            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He <hi>fell on all that heard the Word.</hi> The following verſe exhibits an account of the <hi>aſtoniſhment,</hi> the believing <hi>Jews</hi> were filled with at this event. <hi>And they of the circumciſion, which believed, were aſtoniſhed.</hi> And the more <hi>ſpecial reaſon</hi> of their aſtoniſhment is given in the next words; which was not, as we may be ready to imagine, ſo much the <hi>deſcent</hi> of the HOLY GHOST, as the <hi>perſon on whom he felt.</hi> The <hi>former</hi>

they had often been witneſſes to before, it was an event common in that day; the <hi>latter</hi> was new and ſtrange, what they did not expect, and were much ſurpriſed at. They were <hi>aſtoniſhed,</hi> becauſe, ſays my text, <hi>on the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles alſo was poured out the gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST: In which words the three following things are obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>gift</hi> here ſpoken of; viz. the HOLY GHOST.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>perſon to whom</hi> he was given; and theſe were the <hi>Gentiles alſo,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as <hi>Jews</hi>; both in <hi>common; one</hi> as well as the <hi>other,</hi> without <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>manner</hi> of beſtowing this gift; It was <hi>poured out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly, theſe are the particulars we ſhall briefly conſider, and then apply to the <hi>occaſions</hi> of the day.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt thing obſervable in the text is, the <hi>gift</hi> ſpoken of; viz. the HOLY GHOST.</p>
            <p>The HOLY GHOST, or HOLY SPIRIT, as the word is elſewhere tranſlated; — It's the name of the THIRD of the SACRED THREE. He is otherwiſe ſtil'd ſometimes, by way of emphaſis, THE SPIRIT; ſometimes, the SPIRIT of GOD, the SPIRIT of CHRIST, the SPIRIT of <hi>grace,</hi> the SPIRIT of <hi>truth,</hi> the SPIRIT of <hi>holineſs</hi>; ſometimes, he is ſpoken of as the COMFORTER, the SANCTIFIER, and the like. That glorious perſon is pointed out, under all theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations, in whoſe <hi>name,</hi> as well as in the <hi>name</hi> of the FATHER and the SON, we are <hi>baptiſed,</hi> and by this <hi>inſtituted rite</hi> take upon us the character of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only, let it be remembred, where the HOLY GHOST is ſpoken of as a <hi>gift</hi> from GOD, we are not to underſtand hereby the <hi>perſon,</hi> but the <hi>influences</hi> of this <hi>bleſſed</hi> SPIRIT. Not that the HOLY GHOST is nothing more than an <hi>emanation, operation</hi> or <hi>influence,</hi> from the FATHER. He is often repreſented, in the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004914_0005_100E2B5719855340"/>
               <hi>bible,</hi> as an <hi>agent,</hi> a <hi>perſon,</hi> as truly and properly ſo, as either the FATHER or the SON. But tho' he be a real, living, active, infinitely glorious <hi>perſon,</hi> yet when he is ſpoken of as a <hi>gift,</hi> we are to underſtand hereby his <hi>influences</hi> and <hi>operations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe are either <hi>extraordinary</hi> or <hi>ordinary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of Chriſtianity, the HOLY GHOST was given to men, in an <hi>extraordinary</hi> manner, i. e. in <hi>miraculous</hi> gifts and powers. It does not appear, that the HOLY GHOST, in this ſenſe, was confin'd to the <hi>apoſtles,</hi> or their <hi>fellow labourers</hi> in the work of the Lord. The <hi>apoſtles,</hi> 'tis true, were the firſt, after our SAVIOUR<hi>'s aſcention</hi> up to <hi>heaven,</hi> to whom the HOLY GHOST was thus given. It was upon <hi>them</hi> that he <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, on the day of Pentecoſt, in cloven tongues like as of fire,</hi> to their being enabled to ſpeak in <hi>various lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages</hi>; yea, and to <hi>ſhew ſigns and wonders,</hi> and to <hi>work miracles,</hi> to the <hi>aſtoniſhment</hi> and <hi>converſion</hi> of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes. But it ſhould ſeem, as if the <hi>gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST, in this <hi>extraordinary</hi> manner, was not the <hi>ſole</hi> priviledge of the <hi>apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>firſt miniſters</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion. It rather appears to have been a <hi>gift</hi> beſtowed upon Chriſtians in <hi>common.</hi> Some of the perſons, choſen from among the <hi>people</hi> to be <hi>Deacons,</hi> were thus <hi>miraculouſly</hi> endowed. 'Tis particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of <hi>Stephen</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 6.8.</note>, <hi>that he did great wonders and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles among the people.</hi> And in the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> there was a great diverſity of theſe <hi>extraordinary</hi> gifts; and they ſeem to have been <hi>common</hi> among the <hi>people. To one was given, by the</hi> SPIRIT, <hi>the word of wiſdom; to another, the word of knowledge by the ſame</hi> SPIRIT; <hi>to another, faith; to another, the gift of healing; to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, diſcerning of Spirits; to another, diverſe kinds of tongues; to another, the interpretation of tongues.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:004914_0006_100E2B5B43D87F40"/>
And, perhaps, there were few, in the firſt days of the goſpel, but were endowed with ſome <hi>extraordinary</hi> gift of the SPIRIT or another.</p>
            <p>And it was at <hi>different</hi> ſeaſons that the HOLY GHOST fell upon perſons, in his <hi>miraculous</hi> powers. Sometimes, he came upon them, even before they were <hi>baptiſed.</hi> So it was in my context. Upon <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>preaching</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the HOLY GHOST <hi>fell upon them all.</hi> And that he fell upon them in his <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> gifts, is evident from what follows: for 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <hi>they were heard to ſpeak with tongues.</hi> i. e. with <hi>ſtrange</hi> tongues, in languages they did not before under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, nor could ſpeak. But <hi>more commonly</hi> the HOLY GHOST was given by the <hi>laying on of the hands of the apoſtles after baptiſm.</hi> An inſtance of this we have, in Act. 19.5, 6. where, after a number of diſciples had been <hi>baptiſed,</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>Paul laid his hands upon them, and the</hi> HOLY GHOST <hi>came on them:</hi> And he <hi>ſo</hi> came on them, as that <hi>they ſpake with tongues, and propheſied.</hi> And it was the <hi>falling of the</hi> HOLY GHOST on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in his <hi>miraculous</hi> powers, <hi>by the laying on of the hands of the apoſtles,</hi> that put <hi>Simon Magus</hi> upon making an offer to purchaſe this <hi>wonderful gift with money</hi>*.</p>
            <p>Some, perhaps, may be ready to envy theſe <hi>firſt</hi> Chriſtians their priviledge, in being thus <hi>miraculouſly</hi> endowed; imagining, they were much better of it than <hi>we,</hi> who can pretend to no ſuch <hi>extraordinary</hi> gifts. But what ſays the inſpired <hi>Paul?</hi> Why, ſpeaking to the Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth,</hi> concerning <hi>theſe very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts of the</hi> HOLY GHOST, he directs them to what was far more deſirable. <hi>I ſhew unto you,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a more excellent way</hi>†. And <hi>this way</hi> he <hi>ſhewed</hi> to them, was that of <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>love.</hi> The true <hi>love</hi> of <hi>our neighbour,</hi> ſpringing from <hi>love</hi> to GOD, and a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>faith</hi> in JESUS CHRIST, is a <hi>gift</hi> far <hi>preferable</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:004914_0007_100E2B5E84899348"/>
to any of the <hi>miraculous</hi> gifts, the firſt Chriſtians were endowed with: And upon whomſoever GOD beſtows this gift, he does more for them, than if he enabled them to <hi>ſpeak with the tongues of men or angels,</hi> or gave them <hi>faith</hi> ſo that they could <hi>remove mountains.</hi> This, 'tis true, might make them more eminent in their <hi>own</hi> as well as in the eſteem of <hi>others</hi>; but the <hi>former</hi> would render them <hi>better</hi> in themſelves, and far more <hi>acceptable</hi> in the ſight of GOD.</p>
            <p>'Tis worth our particular remark, the <hi>extraordinary gifts</hi> of the HOLY GHOST made no man the <hi>better Chriſtian.</hi> They did not <hi>ſanctify</hi> his ſoul, or put him in a ſtate of favour with GOD: And if <hi>ſanctified</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were thoſe, on whom they, were <hi>often</hi> conferred, yet this was not <hi>always</hi> the caſe. It was no certain argument of a man's being a good man, a ſincere ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of JESUS CHRIST, that the HOLY GHOST <hi>had come upon him in his extraordinary gifts.</hi> The <hi>Spirit of prophecy</hi> fell on <hi>Balaam,</hi> who made <hi>Iſrael to ſin,</hi> and of whom it is teſtified by an apoſtle, that he <hi>loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs.</hi> And <hi>Judas,</hi> as well as the other <hi>apoſtles,</hi> had the power of <hi>working ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and of <hi>caſting out Devils:</hi> Yea, our SAVIOUR himſelf has declar'd, that <hi>he will,</hi> in the great day of judgment, <hi>ſay unto many who have propheſied in his name, and in his name caſt out Devils, and in his name done many wonderful works, I never knew you: Depart from me, ye that work inequity</hi>*. Theſe <hi>miraculous</hi> gifts were rather beſtowed for the good of <hi>others,</hi> than the <hi>perſons themſelves</hi> who had them. <hi>Tongues,</hi> ſays the apoſtle†, <hi>are for a ſign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not.</hi> They were intended as an <hi>open atteſtation</hi> to the truth of the <hi>Chriſtian religion</hi>; which being now ſettled in the world, there is no further uſe of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004914_0008_100E2B61B168C5F0"/>I therefore go on to obſerve,</p>
            <p>By the <hi>gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, not only theſe <hi>extraordinary powers,</hi> but that <hi>ordinary influence,</hi> common to all ages of the Church, whereby the <hi>work of Divine grace</hi> is <hi>begun</hi> and <hi>carried on</hi> in the ſouls of men, to there being prepared in this world for the bleſſedneſs of the world that is to come.</p>
            <p>Some, I am ſenſible, are for confining the <hi>gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST to the <hi>apoſtolic age:</hi> But there is no reaſon for this. 'Tis plain from the current ſtrain of the whole new-teſtament, that the <hi>gift</hi> of the HOLY GHOST is as neceſſary for perſons in all <hi>after</hi> ages, as it was in the <hi>firſt</hi> days of the Goſpel. 'Tis therefore declared in language extending to all <hi>times</hi> as well as <hi>Perſons</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">John 3.5.</note>, <hi>except a man be born of the</hi> SPIRIT, <hi>he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the kingdom of GOD</hi>; and again, <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 8.9.</note> 
               <hi>If any man have not the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>he is none of his</hi>; and yet again, <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 John 4.13.</note> 
               <hi>Hereby we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his</hi> SPIRIT.</p>
            <p>Nor by the <hi>gift of the</hi> SPIRIT, in this Senſe, are we to underſtand barely the <hi>objective</hi> influence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed truths, or any improvements of nature that are meerly <hi>moral</hi>; but that immediate preſence and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the HOLY GHOST, whereby a real power is communicated to the purpoſes of religion. This is the true meaning of thoſe numerous texts, wherein thoſe who are real Chriſtians, are ſaid <hi>to be born of the</hi> SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT; to have the SPIRIT <hi>dwelling in their Hearts by faith</hi>; to be <hi>ſtrengthened with all might in the inner man by the</hi> SPIRIT; to be <hi>led by the</hi> SPIRIT; <hi>to walk in the</hi> SPIRIT, and the like. By theſe phraſes, is pointed out a ſort of influence beyond what is meerly <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral:</hi> 'Tis evidently their main ſcope to repreſent the holy SPIRIT as <hi>all in all</hi> in the buſineſs
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004914_0009_100E2B65B09005A8"/>
of pure and undefiled religion; the beginner, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier on, and the finiſher of faith, yea, and of every thing elſe that is ſpiritually good, in the hearts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtians: Nor will any thing ſhort of this come up to the juſt and full import of theſe expreſſions.</p>
            <p>Nor is it any objection againſt theſe <hi>operations</hi> of the HOLY GHOST, that we know not <hi>how</hi> he operates upon the humane mind. Men may, if they pleaſe, take occaſion from hence to ſpeak contemptuouſly of this diſpenſation of GOD's Grace; but 'tis, in true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, no argument againſt the <hi>reality</hi> of a thing, that the <hi>manner</hi> of it can't be deſcribed. Who can tell how his own Spirit operates on his own body, or his own body on his own Spirit? And yet, there is nothing we are more ſure of, than that they mutually operate on each other. And if it be no objection againſt the mutual operation of ſoul and body upon one another, that we know not the <hi>modus</hi> of their operation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is our ignorance as to the <hi>manner</hi> of the SPIRIT's operation on the hearts of Men, any objection againſt the thing it ſelf: Nor is it at all incredible, that the GOD who made our ſouls, and is perfectly acquainted with all their ſprings of action, ſhould be able to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon them; and this, in a way ſuited to their nature, and ſo as not to break in, in the leaſt, upon the juſt exerciſe of their <hi>reaſonable</hi> powers. It would argue but a low conception of the infinitely wiſe GOD to ſuppoſe the contrary. He that has an immediate acceſs to our Spirits <hi>can</hi> certainly work upon them, and, in a <hi>reaſonable</hi> way, influence them both <hi>to will and to do of his own good pleaſure:</hi> And that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ever-bleſſed SPIRIT does really thus operate upon them, and in thus doing acts the part eſpecially aſſigned him to the affair of man's ſalvation, muſt be acknowledged to be the obvious ſenſe of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of texts, which can't, without the greateſt violence, bet interpreted to any other meaning. But it will not
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004914_0010_100E2B68291F7358"/>
be amiſs, if we are a little particular in explaining the <hi>gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST, as it means this <hi>internal operation</hi> of his, which is common to all ages of the Church. And it conſiſts in the following things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In <hi>convincing men of Sin.</hi> This is the firſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the SPIRIT upon the Sinner. Accordingly, this is particularly mentioned as one of the ends for which the SPIRIT is ſaid to be given to men, even that he might <hi>reprove,</hi> or convince, <hi>them of ſin</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">John 16.8.</note>. And this he does by awakening their attention, bringing them to conſideration, and giving them ſuch a ſight of <hi>ſin</hi> as they never had before. When the SPIRIT con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of ſin, he opens the ſinners eyes, ſo that he ſees it to be an evil and bitter thing, that he has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the LORD his GOD. He has now an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of ſin as what is hateful to the Divine majeſty, and dreadful in its effects and conſequences; He has now a view of himſelf as an object of wrath, and heir of hell, and in danger every moment of being made miſerable in that future place of torment: And from this apprehenſion of ſin, and of his own immanent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard as under the guilt of it, he is filled with uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; bitterly reflects upon himſelf, and feels all that inward diſtreſs which is the reſult of a conſciouſneſs of guilt, an actual clear view of himſelf as in a ſtate, wherein he deſerves to be ſent away to be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy in the place of blackneſs of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Some, perhaps, may think, there is no need of this perception of ſin, and uneaſineſs from a ſenſe of guilt; but 'tis <hi>ordinarily</hi> neceſſary, as that without which there can be no ſuch thing as a real and thorow <hi>converſion</hi> to GOD: To be ſure, 'tis a matter of neceſſity in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>adult</hi> perſons, thoſe among them particularly, who inſtead of being reſtrained from ſin from their
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004914_0011_100E2B6BA5F10B10"/>
early Childhood, have given the reins to their luſts, and gone on adding iniquity to tranſgreſſion. 'Tis ſeldom, if ever, that a ſaving change is effected in ſuch, but 'tis preceeded with bitter reflections on their paſt ſecurity and folly, and uneaſy ſenſations from an apprehenſion of themſelves as obnoxious to the Divine vengeance.</p>
            <p>Tho' it ought to be particularly remembred here, that the degrees of diſtreſs, from a conſciouſneſs of ſin and fear of wrath, are vaſtly various in different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. In ſome 'tis greater, in others ſmaller; in ſome 'tis of longer, in others of ſhorter continuance; in all, that are ſavingly brought home to GOD in JESUS CHRIST, the concern of ſoul is ſufficient to put them effectually upon the uſe of appointed means in order to their obtaining mercy; but in none, is this diſtreſs excited to ſo great a degree as to put them beſide themſelves, unleſs from their own weakneſs, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or ſome faulty cauſe or other, which ought not to be aſcribed to the SPIRIT of GOD.</p>
            <p>And it may be worth remembring likewiſe, that this <hi>conviction</hi> of ſin is a thing quite different from <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</hi> 'Tis only the <hi>firſt ſtep</hi> towards it, a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of mind making way for it: Nor unleſs it end in this bleſſed change, will it ſignify any thing, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are under ever ſo deep diſtreſs. This ſhould be well conſidered by ſuch as may be under convictions. You may not from hence conclude your ſelves to be in a good ſtate. The ſight you have of ſin as an evil thing, the apprehenſion you have of your ſelves as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of wrath, and the uneaſineſs you may be under herefrom, are nothing more than the <hi>tendencies</hi> towards <hi>converſion.</hi> And let me tell you, there may be the <hi>former</hi> and not the <hi>latter.</hi> You may turn out ſhameful apoſtates from GOD after very ſerious impreſſions, very ſtrong convictions, yea, and great zeal in an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on religious duties. O take heed, you don't
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004914_0012_100E2B6E67B83A68"/>
make a righteouſneſs of your convictions, that you don't place them in the room of CHRIST, in the room of true Goſpel repentance! Don't ſuffer your ſelves to reſt in convictions! If you place your religion here, and attain no higher, they will do you no good; yea, notwithſtanding your convictions, tho' they have ſtruck you to the earth, you will certainly be excluded hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and be ſent away to hell. Realiſe it, the great deſign of conviction is to put you upon the uſe of the inſtituted means of ſalvation. Their uſe is to ſhew you your need of CHRIST, to open to you the value of grace, and quicken you, with a becoming importunity, to ſeek GOD's face and favour: And if they are not improv'd for theſe purpoſes, they will be of no ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſervice to you. O fix it in your minds as a ſure truth, that you may have even the ſtrongeſt convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and no ſaving good follow upon them! And it is often thus; yea, in reſpect of many with whom it is thus, they are the worſe, and not the better for their convictions. Sinners who have been ſurprized with fearfulneſs, under an apprehenſion of ſin and guilt, have often turn'd out the worſt of men, the moſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd and abandon'd to all that is good. The <hi>latter end</hi> with them has been <hi>worſe than the beginning.</hi> You are therefore, at preſent, in a critical ſtate; and ſhould look well to your ſelves, leaſt, after having eſcaped the pollutions that are in the world through luſt, you ſhould turn away from the holy commandment deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to you. But I muſt not enlarge,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another operation, included in this <hi>gift</hi> of the HOLY GHOST, is that whereby he produces in men true <hi>goſpel faith.</hi> This faith is much celebrated in the writings of the new teſtament. 'Tis every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as the grand <hi>characteriſtic</hi> of a <hi>true Chriſtian.</hi> 'Tis indeed that without which 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe GOD; yea, 'tis by this, and this <hi>alone,</hi> that we are
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004914_0013_100E2B71E361C510"/>
               <hi>juſtified through the</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST, <hi>without the deeds of the law.</hi> This faith is variouſly exhibited to us; ſometimes in metaphorical language, but more commonly in plain, eaſy words. And the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by it, is not <hi>meerly</hi> an <hi>aſſent</hi> of the mind to <hi>goſpel truths:</hi> This indeed there will be; the man who has true faith embraces the <hi>Scripture revelation</hi>; yea, the <hi>whole Scheme</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine,</hi> ſo far as he has an underſtanding of it, and he will have an underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it ſo far as it is abſolutely neceſſary; But then, his faith is not a meer ſpeculative thing, but ſuch an inward, ſtrong perſuaſion as will operate in <hi>general</hi> agreably to the truths he profeſſes to believe: In <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi> he is ſo fully perſuaded of the glorious things ſpoken of concerning CHRIST, his <hi>perſon</hi> and <hi>mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial undertaking</hi> for ſinners, that he acknowledges no other SAVIOUR, nor has dependance upon any but him; yea, ſo clearly ſatisfied is he of the <hi>ability</hi> and <hi>readineſs</hi> of the LORD JESUS CHRIST to be a SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR to him, of the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>merit</hi> there is in him, that he ventures his <hi>all</hi> on him, his <hi>ſoul</hi> and his <hi>eternal concerns</hi>; truſting in him, and in him alone for <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>eternal life.</hi> He eſteems himſelf an <hi>unprofitable ſervant,</hi> after he has done his beſt; and as having done no more than it was his duty to do. He counts all things but loſs for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the knowledge of CHRIST JESUS his LORD; yea, he counts them but dung, that he may win CHRIST, and be <hi>found in him,</hi> not having on <hi>his own righteouſneſs,,</hi> which is of the <hi>law,</hi> but that which is through the <hi>faith of</hi> CHRIST, the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> which is of GOD by <hi>faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>true Chriſtian faith:</hi> And 'tis to make us the ſubjects of this <hi>faith,</hi> that the HOLY GHOST is <hi>poured out.</hi> 'Tis not the <hi>meer</hi> reſult of that <hi>teſtimony</hi> of the SPIRIT, the <hi>evidence of miracles,</hi> by which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> has been confirmed, as a <hi>revelation</hi> from GOD;
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004914_0014_100E2B752BDDEF48"/>
but is the produce of that <hi>internal work</hi> of <hi>his</hi> upon the mind of the ſinner, whereby, the eyes of his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being opened, he has ſuch a view of the ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the goſpel method of ſalvation in <hi>general,</hi> and of the lovelineſs of CHRIST in <hi>particular,</hi> his all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to be his SAVIOUR, as that he is perſuaded and enabled to embrace him as ſuch, giving himſelf up to him, to be inſtructed, governed and ſaved by him. The ſcripture is every where full in it, that this <hi>faith</hi> is of the <hi>operation</hi> of the SPIRIT. Hence 'tis particularly mentioned among the <hi>fruits of the</hi> SPIRIT<note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. 5.22.</note>; and is expreſly ſpoken of, as of the <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of</hi> GOD<note n="†" place="bottom">Col. 2.12</note>, and as the <hi>gift of</hi> GOD<note n="‖" place="bottom">Eph. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.8.</note>. And when <hi>Simon Peter</hi> profeſſed his <hi>faith</hi> in CHRIST, in thoſe words, <hi>Thou art</hi> CHRIST <hi>the</hi> SON <hi>of the living</hi> GOD; JESUS ſaid unto him, <hi>Fleſh and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my</hi> FATHER <hi>which is in heaven</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Mat. 16.16, 17.</note>.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another operation, included in the <hi>gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST, is the <hi>change</hi> whereby men are made <hi>new creatures.</hi> We every where read, in the inſpir'd writings, of a <hi>Change,</hi> which 'tis neceſſary Sinners ſhould paſs under, as ever they would hope, according to the tenour of the Goſpel covenant, to be admitted into the coming kingdom of GOD. This <hi>change</hi> is ſpoken of under a variety of names. 'Tis ſometimes called <hi>converſion,</hi> ſometimes <hi>regeneration,</hi> ſometimes 'tis compar'd to a <hi>reſurrection,</hi> and ſometimes to a <hi>new creation.</hi> The ſame thing is intended in all theſe phraſes; even that change which is made in men, when they become true Chriſtians. Not that there is any change effected in them, <hi>phyſically</hi> ſpeaking; their natural powers and faculties are ſtill the ſame: But in the <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>moral</hi> ſenſe, they are ſtrangely altered. There is a change wrought both in their
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004914_0015_100E2B786EB5FE18"/>
hearts and lives, in all their inward principles as well as outward behaviour in the world. They are, as it were, new moulded and faſhioned. They have other thoughts and ſentiments, other ſprings of action, other views and aims; they are ſo altered as to be quite other perſons, they have another temper of mind, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taſte and reliſh, another heart and ſoul, and they lead another kind of life, are pious towards GOD, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous towards men, and ſober in reſpect of themſelves.</p>
            <p>This is the change we muſt paſs under, in order to our being made meet for the inheritance of the ſaints in light. And 'tis to effect this change, that the HOLY GHOST <hi>is given</hi>: Nor can it be effected in any way but by his <hi>operations</hi> in us. It is not the produce of <hi>meer reaſon,</hi> nor of <hi>external revelation.</hi> It is not bro't about by the bare influence of <hi>moral motives,</hi> whether they are fetch'd from the <hi>law</hi> or the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> No, but it is an <hi>effect</hi> of the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>the</hi> SPIRIT, working effectually in them that believe. And 'tis every where in the bible ſpoken of as ſuch. This is the juſt import of the <hi>metaphors,</hi> under which this change is figur'd out to us. That of a <hi>new creation</hi> points our view di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to GOD as the author of converſion. If this were an eaſy buſineſs, a matter within the reach of men's own power, what they could accompliſh by an act of their <hi>own free will,</hi> it would never have been ſet forth under this ſimilitude. To <hi>create</hi> is the known prerogative of GOD: And the firſt thing moſt obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly occurring to our minds from this reſemblance is, that the <hi>new creature</hi> is the <hi>workmanſhip of</hi> GOD. The ſame thought is ſuggeſted from the metaphor of a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> under which this change is ſometimes ſpoken of. <hi>Raiſing the dead</hi> beſpeaks the agency of GOD. 'Tis therefore natural, and almoſt unavoidable, when we read of converſion under this figure, to conclude it to be a work beyond the power of man, and as requiring a <hi>Divine power</hi> to effect it.</p>
            <p>

            <p>But ſome, perhaps, may be ſo curious as to aſk, how does the HOLY GHOST produce this change in men?</p>
            <p>And to ſuch the anſwer is, this is one of thoſe things, concerning which we know but very little: Nor ought our ignorance, as to the <hi>manner</hi> of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, to be eſteemed the leaſt objection againſt the truth of the thing. We know not the <hi>manner</hi> in the <hi>natural</hi>; and why ſhould it be thought ſtrange if we know not the <hi>manner</hi> in the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> creation? The methods of operation, in the <hi>Kingdom of grace,</hi> and in the <hi>Kingdom of nature,</hi> are both alike ſecret and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: And we have no more reaſon therefore to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt the <hi>former</hi> than the <hi>latter.</hi> 'Tis no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the formation of children, that <hi>we know not how the bones grow in the womb of her that is with child</hi>; neither is it of any validity againſt the formation of the <hi>new man,</hi> that we know not preciſely the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> in which the <hi>Divine</hi> SPIRIT exerts himſelf
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004914_0017_100E2B808C9734A0"/>
in the production of this <hi>ſpiritual workmanſhip:</hi> They are both fearful and wonderful.</p>
            <p>Thus much indeed we know in general, that in <hi>new making</hi> men, the <hi>Divine</hi> SPIRIT acts in, and upon them, in a way ſuited to their nature <hi>as Men,</hi> in a way that agrees with their character as <hi>moral agents.</hi> He ſo manages the matter, as that they are changed into <hi>new men,</hi> in a method perfectly harmonizing with their ſeveral powers, ſo as that they oppoſe not one another, but are preſerved in due dependance and ſubordination to each other. <hi>Light</hi> is commanded to ſhine into the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> the enlighten'd <hi>underſtanding</hi> directs and governs the <hi>will,</hi> and the <hi>will</hi> the ſeveral <hi>affections</hi> of the <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>powers</hi> of the <hi>body</hi>: But to ſay <hi>preciſely</hi> how the HOLY GHOST enlightens the <hi>mind,</hi> and then captivates the <hi>will,</hi> and then preſerves the <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>paſſions</hi> in due harmony, and conducts the <hi>life</hi> in the way of holineſs; theſe things, I ſay, are difficulties in this diſpenſation of grace: And as they are ſuch, the leſs we puzzle our ſelves or others about them, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The thing is certain, Men are ſometimes <hi>new made</hi>; and when they are ſo, 'tis as evident from the Scripture, that 'tis GOD by his SPIRIT, that <hi>new makes</hi> them. Let us ſee to it, that we be in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe who are <hi>new creatures,</hi> and as to the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> in which it pleaſes GOD to bring this about, we need not be at all concerned about it. To go on,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another thing, included in this <hi>gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST, is his <hi>exciting ſincere Chriſtians</hi> to, and <hi>aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> them in, the practice of their duty, to their <hi>increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in grace,</hi> and <hi>perſevering therein unto the end.</hi> There is need of the HOLY GHOST not only to turn men from the power of ſin and Satan unto GOD, but, when they are thus changed, to ſtir them up to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in the work of GOD and their Soul's ſalvation, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004914_0018_100E2B855C70CAD0"/>
to aſſiſt them in it. If left to themſelves, the beſt Chriſtians, thoſe that are fulleſt of faith and holineſs, and every other grace, would ſoon loſe their vigour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor without the continual aids of the <hi>Divine</hi> SPIRIT would they be able to honour CHRIST, and adorn their profeſſion by a converſation becoming the Goſpel. The HOLY GHOST therefore is given to them, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite good motions in them, to animate their reſolutions, to quicken their graces and aſſiſt them in the exerciſe of them, to their running the way of GOD's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with ſtrength and vigour, with chearfulneſs and delight. This is certainly the language of Scripture upon this head. Hence that prayer of holy <hi>David,</hi>

               <hi>I will never forget thy precepts; for with them thou haſt quickened me.</hi> And the HOLY GHOST is ſaid to <hi>dwell in the hearts</hi> of good Chriſtians; and they are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as <hi>led by the</hi> SPIRIT, and as <hi>walking in the</hi> SPIRIT. The plain meaning of all which texts is, at leaſt thus much, that the HOLY GHOST is given to good men to be their excitement in duty, their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual help in the practice of it.</p>
            <p>And 'tis owing to the ſame preſence and influence of the HOLY GHOST, that they are enabled to grow in grace, and in a conformity to the image and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Saviour; to be more weaned from this world, and prepared for a better.</p>
            <p>In one word, 'tis owing to the ſame influence ſtill, that they are kept from falling, and preſerved through faith unto ſalvation. And indeed, ſuch are their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions within, and ſuch their temptations without; ſuch is the ſubtilty of Satan, ſuch the ſnares

of the world, and ſuch their own weakneſs, that it could not be expected, but they ſhould draw back to perdition, were they not under the ſpecial and continual guidance of the HOLY GHOST: And to this it is always attributed in Scripture, that they are preſerved unto CHRIST's heavenly kingdom. Hence the <hi>apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of them, <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. 1.5.</note> as thoſe who are <hi>kept by the power of GOD, through faith, unto ſalvation.</hi> Hence alſo that <hi>Doxology</hi> in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Jude,</hi>

Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Another thing contained in the <hi>gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST is ſupport and conſolation under ſufferings and afflictions. Frequent mention is made of this in the writings of the new Teſtament. When the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſought to GOD for grace, in a time of great tryal, that was the anſwer of GOD to him, <note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Cor. 12.9.</note> 
               <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee; for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> And hear how this ſame <hi>apoſtle</hi> triumphs over difficulties, and all manner of ſufferings, in the power of <hi>this grace</hi> of the SPIRIT of GOD. <note n="§" place="bottom">ver. 10.</note> 
               <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I take pleaſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, in perſecutions, for</hi> CHRIST<hi>'s ſake.</hi> And others alſo have been ſtrengthened, with all might, to all long-ſuffering, according to the glorious power of the SPIRIT of JESUS CHRIST, which has been given to them. It was eminently thus, in the firſt days of the Goſpel, with the Confeſſors and Martyrs for the name and cauſe of CHRIST. The ſtrength of GOD was viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perfected in many of theſe, who, being weak, were yet made ſtrong to ſuffer for his ſake. To what elſe can it be aſcribed, that they were enabled to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004914_0020_100E2B8C5EBC1290"/>
ſo many deaths, with ſo much calmneſs and patience, with ſo much chearfulneſs and holy rejoicing? How elſe can it be accounted for, that they ſhould be ready to give themſelves up to be <hi>tortured, not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliverance</hi>; that they ſhould be willing to undergo <hi>the tryal of cruel mockings and ſcourgings, yea, moreover, of bonds and impriſonment</hi>; that they ſhould ſubmit to be <hi>ſtoned, to be ſawn aſunder, to be ſlain with the ſword</hi>; that they ſhould be content to <hi>wander about in ſheep-ſkins and goat-ſkins,</hi> being <hi>deſtitute, afflicted, tormented:</hi> I ſay, to what can it be attributed, that they ſhould be willing to ſubmit to theſe ſufferings, and be able to go through them with courage, and patience, and even joy, but to this, that they were <hi>divinely</hi> aſſiſted? The power of the SPIRIT of JESUS CHRIST was with them, ſupporting, encouraging and ſtrengthning them: And to this it was owing, that they were both willing and able to ſuffer any thing for the honour of him, who had loved them, and died for them. And the ſame power of the ſame SPIRIT is ready to be with us, under all the tryals and ſufferings, we are called to paſs through, in the courſe of providence. The ſame bleſſed SPIRIT, which was given to them is promiſed to us alſo; and 'tis now often ſeen, that he is a ſupport and comfort, in a glorious degree, to ſincere Chriſtians, in proportion to what they are called to endure; yea, and ſuch is the ſenſe they ſometimes have of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of GOD, that they are able to exult, in the midſt of the heavieſt tryals, in the language of the holy apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. 1.3, 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>Bleſſed be</hi> GOD, <hi>even the</hi> FATHER <hi>of our</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST, <hi>the</hi> FATHER <hi>of mercies, and the</hi> GOD <hi>of all comfort, who comforteth us in all our tribulation. For as the ſufferings of</hi> CHRIST <hi>abound in us, ſo our conſolation aboundeth by</hi> CHRIST.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:004914_0021_100E2B8EE3613C58"/>6. Another thing contained in this <hi>gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST, is that <hi>inward joy,</hi> which Chriſtians are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſubjects of. This <hi>Joy</hi> is therefore particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned as one of the <hi>fruits of the</hi> SPIRIT<note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. 5.22.</note>. And Chriſtians are ſometimes ſpoken of as <hi>having Joy in</hi> GOD<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 2.11.</note>, as <hi>rejoicing in hope of the glory of</hi> GOD<note n="‖" place="bottom">v. 22.</note>, yea, as <hi>rejoicing with joy unſpeakable and full of glory</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">1 Pet. 1.8.</note>. And they are repreſented, as praying to GOD <hi>to fill them with all joy and peace in believing</hi>
               <note n="**" place="bottom">Rom. 15.13.</note>, and as <hi>giving thanks to</hi> GOD, <hi>who cauſeth them to triumph in</hi> CHRIST<note n="{inverted †}" place="bottom">2 Cor. 2.14.</note>: And <hi>the peace of</hi> GOD, <hi>which paſſeth all underſtanding,</hi> is promiſed to them, <hi>to keep their hearts and minds thro'</hi> CHRIST JESUS<note n="‖‖" place="bottom">Phil. 4.7.</note>. The obvious import of all which texts is, that there is ſuch a thing as <hi>inward peace and pleaſure,</hi> which ſometimes riſes to ſuch a height in the hearts of ſincere Chriſtians, as to cauſe them to exult and triumph in GOD: Nor is this <hi>Joy</hi> the effect of meer nature; neither does it reſult from the <hi>ſole</hi> exerciſe of the mind, either upon it ſelf, or the truths revealed in the Goſpel, but is the <hi>produce</hi> of the HOLY GHOST, which is <hi>given</hi> to them. That of COMFORTER is therefore the Style, in which this bleſſed SPIRIT is ſometimes ſpoken of in Scripture<note n="§§" place="bottom">Joh. 14.16.</note>. And becauſe it is by the HOLY GHOST, that GOD <hi>comforteth</hi> his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he is therefore called the GOD <hi>of conſolation</hi>
               <note n="*‖" place="bottom">Rom. 15.15.</note>.</p>
            <p>But to prevent our falling into miſtakes about this <hi>Joy,</hi> 'twill be neceſſary to obſerve here, that when ever it is the <hi>genuine fruit</hi> of the SPIRIT, and not a <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,</hi> the foundation of it is laid in a <hi>faith</hi> that <hi>purifies the heart, and purges the conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living</hi> GOD. Hence that of the apoſtle, <note n="*§" place="bottom">2 Cor. 1.12.</note> 
               <hi>For our</hi> REJOICING <hi>is this, the teſtimony of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of</hi> GOD, <hi>we have our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004914_0022_100E2B91C7115380"/>
in the world.</hi> And very obſervable to the ſame purpoſe is that exhortation of this ſame apoſtle,<note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. 6.4.</note> 
               <hi>But let every man prove his own work, and then ſhall he have rejoicing in himſelf.</hi> The way to true <hi>Joy</hi> is a religious and impartial examination into the frame of our hearts, and the courſe of our actions, and if our Joy ſprings from a clear diſcernment of theſe as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd to the tenour of the Goſpel covenant, we may hope it is the produce of a divine influence: Whereas, if it is a ſudden flaſh only, and ariſes we know not how, nor upon what it is bottom'd, 'tis much to be ſuſpected; to be ſure, no great ſtreſs ſhould be laid on it. For 'tis to be remembred, there is the Joy of the hypocrite as well as of the good Chriſtian; there is a Joy that is the effect of <hi>nature</hi> as well as <hi>grace.</hi> Such was the Joy of the <hi>ſtony ground hearers</hi>; ſuch was the gladneſs, with which <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> preach; and ſuch was the <hi>taſte of the word of</hi> GOD, <hi>and of the powers of the world to come,</hi> which the <hi>Jewiſh apoſtates</hi> were partakers of<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. 6.5.</note>. In all theſe perſons, there was the paſſion of <hi>Joy,</hi> and it aroſe, probably, in ſome of them, to a conſiderable height; but yet, was nothing more than a <hi>ſenſitive paſſion,</hi> the reſult of the workings of meer animal nature. And this, it may be feared, is the <hi>only Joy</hi> of many others: It certainly is, of all thoſe, who have <hi>Joy without faith.</hi> Men may pretend what they pleaſe, but if they are not poſſeſt of <hi>faith,</hi> that faith I mean, which is a living principle of grace in the Heart, and will evidence it ſelf to be ſo by its genuine influence on the life, their <hi>Joy</hi> is only a <hi>fire of their own kindling</hi>; and tho' they <hi>walk in the light of their fire, and in the ſparks which they have kindled,</hi> yet may they, notwithſtanding, <hi>receive this at the hand of</hi> GOD, <hi>they may lie down in ſorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:004914_0023_100E2B96106ACDF8"/>And as this <hi>Joy,</hi> if it be produced by the SPIRIT of GOD, will ſpring from <hi>heart-purifying faith,</hi> ſo will it make thoſe who have it <hi>humble.</hi> They'll be for exalting GOD, and abaſing themſelves. An illuſtrious example of this we have in the great <hi>apoſtle</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> No meer man, it may be, ever more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Joy</hi> than he; and yet, who more filled with humility? <hi>By the grace of</hi> GOD, ſays he,<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 15.10.</note> 
               <hi>I am what I am.</hi> And again,<note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
               <hi>I live; yet not I, but</hi> CHRIST <hi>liveth in me.</hi> And comparing himſelf with his <hi>fellow-labourers</hi> in the work of the LORD, that is his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Cor. 15.9.</note>, <hi>I am the leaſt of the apoſtles, and not meet to be called an apoſtle</hi>; yea, he ſpeaks of himſelf<note n="§" place="bottom">Eph. 3.8.</note>, <hi>as leſs than the leaſt of all Saints.</hi> And this humble frame of ſoul is ever a concomitant of true ſpiritual <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation</hi> in the LORD. It diſpoſes perſons to entertain a low thought of themſelves. So far are they from boaſting of their own goodneſs, that they wonder at the grace of GOD, in taking notice of ſuch unworthy creatures as they are. They are not of the Spirit of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in the goſpel, who <hi>truſted in themſelves that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others:</hi> On the contrary, that is a juſt repreſentation of their true tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>in lowlineſs of mind, eſteeming others better than themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, this <hi>Joy,</hi> if it be of the HOLY GHOST, will obſerve, at leaſt ſo far as it is under his guidance, a <hi>juſt decorum</hi> in the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>expreſſing it ſelf.</hi> It won't be oſtentatious, diſcovering a forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſhow it ſelf in ſuch methods as are out of the way, and carry the face of a <hi>deſire to be ſeen of men.</hi> It will chuſe rather in <hi>private</hi> to vent it ſelf in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of praiſe to GOD, than in the <hi>ſtreets,</hi> and <hi>public places of concourſe:</hi> This is too like the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who <hi>lov'd to pray in the corners of the ſtreets, that they
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004914_0024_100E2B98599BBD88"/>
might be ſeen of men:</hi> Nor does it ſeem ſo congruous a thing to behold this <hi>joy</hi> operating in LAUGHTER. 'Tis, in its nature, a ſober, rational ſatisfaction and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and is converſant about the moſt ſerious and awful matters. A diſpoſition to <hi>laughter</hi> ſeems there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſavour too much of levity, to be an appendage of this Joy. 'Tis indeed too ſenſual a mode of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing ſo Divine a paſſion, and approaches too near to the way, in which the men of the world expreſs that joy, which has the things of time and ſenſe for its proper object: Nor does it diſcover that awe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, that holy fear and caution, with which this Joy ought always to be mixt, as it has to do with the infinite majeſty of heaven, and the everlaſting concerns of our ſouls.</p>
            <p>In fine, it deſerves our further conſideration here, that the <hi>paſſionate</hi> part of this Joy, the <hi>ſenſible</hi> working of it, is widely different in different perſons, according to the different turn of their natural tempers. Some are of a ductile make, their paſſions ſoft, and apt to carry them into tranſports. And if perſons of this moveable diſpoſition are more ſenſibly affected, than others of a firm and ſteady frame of mind, 'tis no other than might be expected: But, perhaps, a ſettled, permanent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure and delight of ſoul, ariſing from the teſtimony of a good conſcience, is the moſt deſirable ſenſe, in which we can be poſſeſt of the joys of religion; at leaſt, in ordinary caſes: To be ſure, whoever have this peace of GOD, this joy of the LORD, they are bleſſed perſons, tho' they know not the meaning of thoſe raptures ſome others may experience; and the ſtate of mind they are brought to, they may aſſure themſelves, is an effect of the HOLY GHOST, which has been at work in them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The laſt thing, the time will allow me to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as contained in <hi>this gift,</hi> is the <hi>witneſs of the</hi> SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004914_0025_100E2B9CAF7CF798"/>
That is to ſay, that influence of the HOLY GHOST whereby he ſatisfies good Chriſtians of their <hi>adoption</hi> into GOD's <hi>family,</hi> and intereſt in the promiſes of the Goſpel covenant. The holy apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is very expreſs in taking notice of this inſtance of the SPIRIT's operation. Hence he applies to thoſe, who are <hi>led by the</hi> SPIRIT, and are <hi>the Sons of</hi> GOD, in that language,<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 8.15.</note> 
               <hi>But ye have received the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of adoption, whereby ye cry, Abba, father.</hi> Parallel whereto are thoſe words of his, in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Galatians</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. 4. ver. 6.</note>, <hi>And becauſe ye are Sons,</hi> GOD <hi>hath ſent forth the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of his</hi> SON, <hi>into your hearts, crying, Abba, father.</hi> But the moſt obſervable text to this purpoſe, is that in Rom. 8.16, 17. <hi>The</hi> SPIRIT <hi>it ſelf beareth witneſs with our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that we are the children of GOD: And if children, then Heirs, heirs of GOD, and joint-heirs with</hi> CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Some, perhaps, from this text, may expect an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate whiſper from the SPIRIT, or ſome ſecret ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary impulſe, aſſuring them, they are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of GOD. And I deny not but the HOLY GHOST can, if he pleaſes, in this way, make it evident to a man, that he is an heir to the inheritance of the Saints in light: But this does not appear to be the way of the SPIRIT<hi>'s witneſſing</hi>; and it may be dangerous for perſons to ground their hopes of heaven upon meer impulſes and impreſſions: Eſpecially, will this be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, if they ſet up theſe things in the room of the written word, or depend upon them in oppoſition to it. Multitudes have by degrees come to this, and dreadful have been the deluſions they have been betrayed into. They have even miſtook, not only the workings of their own imaginations, but the ſuggeſtions of Satan, for undoubted dictates of the HOLY GHOST.</p>
            <p>This <hi>witneſs of the</hi> SPIRIT is always agreable to the Scripture, and lies principally in two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:004914_0026_100E2B9FC2E8D7B0"/>
in producing in us the diſpoſition of GOD's children, which is done in the work of regeneration, whereby we are form'd to a Divine likeneſs, and made, as it were, living images of our FATHER in heaven. And then, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> in helping us to ſee in our ſelves this filial frame and temper of Soul, and ſo to ſee it as from hence to be clearly perſuaded of our intereſt in the rights of the Sons of GOD. The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe is the proper Goſpel evidence to the priviledge of <hi>adoption</hi>; the <hi>ſecond,</hi> that by which it is made <hi>evident to us</hi> that this priviledge is <hi>ours</hi>; and by both is compleated the <hi>witneſs of the</hi> SPIRIT, that influence of his, whereby we are aſſured that we are GOD's children.</p>
            <p>Let me add here, and I may do it with the greateſt boldneſs, that where there is not a <hi>work of grace</hi> in the heart, it can never be witneſſed to a man, that he is a child of GOD; for he is not: And by whatever impulſes, impreſſions, or revelations, he is made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is, he is certainly under the influence of a heated imagination, or a ſpirit of deluſion. The Divine SPIRIT, as Mr. HENRY obſerves, "wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to none, the priviledges of children, that have not the nature and diſpoſition of children"; No, but he "teſtifies our adoption, as Mr. BURKITT<hi>'s</hi> words are, by evidencing to us our ſanctification And all this, as he adds<note n="*" place="bottom">BURKITT in loc.</note>, is done, not by ſudden impulſes, and immediate inſpirations, which is the <hi>witneſſing</hi> of the SPIRIT, <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> pretend to, but the SPIRIT <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> in a way of argumentation. Thus, whoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, believes and obeys the Goſpel, ſays the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhall be ſaved; but the SPIRIT helps us to ſee that we do ſo, and accordingly enables us to infer and conclude that we ſhall be ſaved."— But I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I have been too long in explaining to you, what we are to underſtand by the <hi>gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST.

I therefore haſten, to the next obſervable in the text, viz.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Perſons</hi> to whom the HOLY GHOST is ſaid to have been given; and theſe were the <hi>Gentiles alſo.</hi> i. e. both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the one as well as the other, without reſpect of perſons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were formerly the people of GOD, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from all others. The LORD was their GOD ſo as he was not the GOD of other nations. He had ſelected them out of the reſt of the world, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, conducted and bleſſed by him beyond any other people: They are therefore called a <hi>choſen gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> a <hi>peculiar people</hi>; and <hi>to them,</hi> as the apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>pertained the adoption, and the glory, and the giving the law, and the covenant, and the promiſes of GOD.</hi> And they had a high conceit of themſelves, on account of this diſtinction, GOD had made between them, and the other nations of the earth; encouraging a hope, as if it would always continue: Nor could they be reconciled to the thought of an enlargement of GOD's covenant, ſo as to bring <hi>others</hi> upon a level with <hi>them</hi> in regard of the favour of GOD, and the happineſs of heaven. The <hi>apoſtles</hi> themſelves; and this, even after the death and reſurrection of CHRIST, were too much under the influence of this <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And it was, in an extraordinary manner, by a viſion from heaven, that <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>ſhewed not to call any man common or unclean.</hi> And it was upon his preaching, in conſequence of this Divine revelation, in that ſtrain, <hi>I perceive of a truth, that God is no reſpecter of perſons; but in every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteouſneſs is accepted of him</hi>; I ſay, it was upon <hi>Peter</hi>'s preaching in ſuch language as this, that GOD owned the truth of what he delivered, by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous effuſion of the HOLY GHOST, even while he was preaching, upon all his hearers promiſcuouſly, both
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004914_0028_100E2BA952A73520"/>
               <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And it was this <hi>pouring out of the</hi> SPIRIT upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in common with the <hi>Jews,</hi> that was the occaſion of the <hi>aſtoniſhment</hi> we read of, in the former part of the verſe, in which is the text. The <hi>Jews</hi> could not tell what to make of it, to ſee that GOD took as much notice of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as of them: It was a mighty ſurprize to them; yea, there was ſcarce a greater ſtone of ſtumbling to them, than the <hi>calling</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> This was a <hi>myſtery hid in</hi> GOD <hi>from ages and generations,</hi> and not made <hi>manifeſt to the Saints</hi> until now<note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. 3.9. Col. 1.26.</note>. We of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were <hi>aliens from the common-wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the covenant of promiſe, and far off from</hi> GOD, <hi>were now made nigh by the blood of</hi> CHRIST; <hi>for he is our peace, and hath made</hi> both Jews and Gentiles <hi>one,</hi> having <hi>broken down the middle wall of partition between us,</hi> and having <hi>preached peace to us who were afar off, as well as to them that were nigh.</hi> And my text is a ſtanding glorious evidence of an <hi>Equality</hi> between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in regard of the <hi>gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST. For he was given to both theſe ſorts of perſons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction: Nor is there, as to this matter, any reſpect of perſons with GOD. He puts no difference between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi>; but is rich to all that call upon him: And whoever the perſons be that do ſo, whether they be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whether they be <hi>bond</hi> or <hi>free, male</hi> or <hi>female,</hi> they ſhall, without regarding the one any more than the other, have granted to them the <hi>gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST. It is promiſed equally to all the varying kinds of ſinners, and they have all equal encouragement to apply to the father of mercies for it. They are all <hi>one in</hi> CHRIST JESUS: He came equally to be a SAVIOUR to them all, and he is equally ready to import of his SPIRIT to them all, to fulfil in them the good pleaſure of his goodneſs, and the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004914_0029_100E2BADF1E890C8"/>
work of faith with power. But I muſt go on to the laſt thing taken notice of in the text, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>manner</hi> of beſtowing this <hi>gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST. It was <hi>poured out. i. e.</hi> GOD was pleaſed to beſtow it largely and plentifully. He ſo beſtowed it, as that they were filled with the SPIRIT; as that they were <hi>all</hi> made to partake of this <hi>gift.</hi> Like a plentiful ſhower of rain, the HOLY GHOST came down upon the <hi>whole aſſembly,</hi> he fell upon every perſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; they had each one a ſenſible perception of his influences, and were enabled herefrom to <hi>ſpeak with tongues, and magnify</hi> GOD. The <hi>miraculous</hi> gifts of the HOLY GHOST, were thoſe eſpecially, in which he was now <hi>poured out</hi>; but 'tis probable, he fell like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in a plentiful manner, in his more <hi>ordinary</hi> influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and that numbers were enlightned and humbled, and put, at leaſt, under a hopeful proſpect of being converted and ſaved. To be ſure, the HOLY GHOST was thus <hi>poured out,</hi> in the firſt days of the Goſpel. i. e. in his <hi>graces</hi> as well as <hi>gifts</hi>; to the ends of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>ſanctification,</hi> as well as to enable men to <hi>ſhew ſigns</hi> and <hi>wonders.</hi> Hence, when the <hi>apoſtle</hi> is ſpeaking of <hi>regeneration,</hi> as accompanied with <hi>juſtification,</hi> and a <hi>hope of eternal life,</hi> he attributes it to the HOLY GHOST <hi>ſhed,</hi> or poured out, <hi>on us, abundantly, through</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>our</hi> SAVIOUR<note n="*" place="bottom">Tit. 3.6.</note>.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>manner</hi> of giving the HOLY GHOST, the <hi>pouring him out,</hi> the beſtowing him on great numbers of perſons, as well as in large and abundant meaſures, is one of the things particularly propheſied of, as what ſhould be the glory of <hi>Goſpel-times.</hi> The texts to this purpoſe are very obſervable. Says GOD himſelf, Iſa. 44.3. <hi>I will pour out my</hi> SPIRIT <hi>upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing on thy offspring.</hi> And again, Zach. 12.10.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004914_0030_100E2BB10C1D2A70"/>
               <hi>I will pour out upon the houſe of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of grace and of ſupplication; and they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only Son, and ſhall be in bitterneſs for him, as one that is in bitterneſs for a firſt born.</hi> And yet again, Joel 2.28. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs afterward, that I will pour out my</hi> SPIRIT <hi>upon all fleſh.</hi> Theſe texts, to be ſure, the two laſt of them, principally look forward to Goſpel times; and they had a marvellous accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment in the firſt days of Chriſtianity, not only in the miraculous gifts, with which multitudes were then filled, but in the <hi>graces</hi> of the SPIRIT, they were enabled to live in the exemplary exerciſe of, to the aſtoniſhment of all beholders.</p>
            <p>But, perhaps, theſe propheſies may look forward ſtill, and point our view to thoſe times that are yet to come, when the <hi>little ſtone cut out without hands, ſhall become a great mountain, and fill the whole earth</hi>; when the <hi>kingdom, and the dominion, and the greatneſs of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, under the whole heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the ſaints of the moſt high</hi>; when <hi>the blindneſs that has happened to Iſrael ſhall be removed, and the fulneſs of the Gentiles come in</hi>; and <hi>the new heavens, and the new earth be created, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my ſelf, I am not aſhamed to own, I am one of thoſe who look, according to the <hi>promiſe of</hi> GOD, for a far more glorious ſtate of things, both among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> than has ever yet been ſeen; a ſtate of things, wherein <hi>he that has the key of the bottomleſs pit ſhall lay hold on the Dragon, that old ſerpent, which is the devil and ſatan, and bind him a thouſand years, and caſt him into the bottomleſs pit, and ſhut him up, and ſet a ſeal upon him, that he ſhould deceive the nations no more, till the thouſand years ſhould be fulfilled:</hi> The effect whereof will be that <hi>univerſal</hi> prevalence of <hi>faith, love, peace,</hi> and all thoſe chriſtian Graces, which
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004914_0031_100E2BB44A892C90"/>
               <hi>transform</hi> Men into a likeneſs to GOD, and make them happy in the participation of the fruits of his favour.</p>
            <p>And to this happy ſtate of things do theſe <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> which ſpeak of the <hi>pouring out of the</hi> SPIRIT, finally look: Nor will they have their <hi>full completion,</hi> till the <hi>earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the</hi> LORD, <hi>as the waters cover the ſeas.</hi> When the ſet time for this will commence, is a ſecret the FATHER hath kept in his own breaſt: And 'tis known only to him, what <hi>inſtruments</hi> and <hi>means</hi> he will make uſe of in bringing to paſs this great event; but whatever the means or the inſtruments are, the work will be chiefly his: It will not be accompliſh'd by their <hi>might,</hi> but by the <hi>power of the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of the</hi> LORD <hi>of hoſts</hi>; his SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT poured out upon the world, in ſuch abundant meaſures, and upon ſuch vaſt multitudes, as has been hitherto unknown. This <hi>pouring out</hi> of the SPIRIT therefore is what we ſhould pray for, as that <hi>only</hi> which will be effectual to the ſeeting up GOD's KING upon his <hi>holy hill of Zion,</hi> ſo as to have <hi>the heathen for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion.</hi> But I muſt now proceed to the</p>
            <p>APPLICATION. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us take occaſion, from what has been offer'd, to <hi>examine</hi> each one of us, whether the <hi>gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST has been poured out upon us. This is a matter it very nearly concerns us all to enquire into. For <hi>if any man have not the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>he is none of his.</hi> He is no diſciple of CHRIST; he has no intereſt in the favour of GOD, nor in the merits of the SAVIOUR; he is yet in his ſins, a child of wrath, and an heir to Hell. Can you then be too ſollicitous to know, whether you have <hi>this gift,</hi> which is a matter of ſuch everlaſting importance? You may come to a comfortable ſatisfaction as to this from what has been diſcours'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:004914_0032_100E2BB91FB222C0"/>You will eaſily collect thence, wherein this gift does not conſiſt; that it does not lie in <hi>viſions,</hi> and <hi>revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>Trances.</hi> None of theſe things are mentioned any where in the bible, as ſuch evidences of the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT in us, as will argue our belonging to CHRIST JESUS: Nay, even in the days of the Apoſtles, they were no proof of a real good character. Perſons, in thoſe times, might <hi>ſee viſions,</hi> and <hi>ſhew ſigns</hi>; yea, and <hi>caſt out Devils, and do many wonderful works,</hi> and after all be doom'd to a <hi>departure from</hi> CHRIST, <hi>to dwell with devouring fire.</hi> The <hi>gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST, in a ſenſe that will denominate you the <hi>children of</hi> GOD, and <hi>Heirs to heaven</hi> lies not in things of this nature; but in thoſe <hi>internal operations</hi> that are common to all <hi>good Chriſtians,</hi> and have been ſo in <hi>all ages,</hi> and in <hi>all places,</hi> from the days of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Would you know, my brethren, whether the HOLY GHOST has been <hi>poured out</hi> upon you, ſo as that you may conclude your ſelves to be intereſted in CHRIST, and in ſuch a ſtate as that you may expect the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Souls, you may, by the help of grace, come to a good hope of this, by aſking your ſelves ſuch queſtions as theſe.</p>
            <p>What have been my <hi>perceptions of Sin?</hi> Have I ever had any ſorrowful reflections in my breaſt, at the thought that I am a ſinner? Has a ſenſe of ſin been grievous to me? Have I had upon my mind a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of guilt? Have I had a view of my ſelf as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the wrath of almighty GOD, and been in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern hereat, and inquiſitive how I might eſcape? If you can't ſay thus of your ſelves, you have reaſon to be afraid of your condition. You, to be ſure, have reaſon to be ſo, who han't been under reſtraints from ſin, but have <hi>walk'd in the way of your own hearts, and in the ſight of your own eyes, adding iniquity to tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Is it reaſonable to think ſuch ſinners, as you are, ſhould be brought to a right mind, without ſevere and
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004914_0033_100E2BBC002936C8"/>
bitter reflections on your ſelves? 'Tis not poſſible, you ſhould have a juſt conception of your ſelves, and of the real truth of your character, and not be in deep anxiety of Soul: Nor may you imagine, you have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly chang'd from a ſtate of ſin to a ſtate of grace, if you have had no remorſe of conſcience, no uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in your breaſts on account of your ſins, no fear of the Divine majeſty, nor of the vengeance of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal world. Such, whoſe caſe this is, have upon them the ſad marks of being to this day in <hi>the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in the bonds of iniquity.</hi> And oh! of how many, may it be feared, is this the juſt character! Are there not multitudes <hi>at eaſe in Zion,</hi> who have upon their minds no concern about their ſins, no fear of the Divine wrath; but are going on calmly and quietly in the broad way to death and hell? If there are any here preſent, whoſe conſciences tell them, they are the men, let me beſeech you, as you love your ſouls, and would not be the deſtroyers of them, to bethink your ſelves. Whether you will believe it or not, you are, as ſinners againſt the GOD that made you, the proper objects of hell, and nothing keeps you out of that place of weeping and wailing and gnaſhing of teeth, but the patience of a provoked GOD, which may even this day come to an end with you. And is this a condition to be eaſy in? O be convinced of your danger! You are certainly in circumſtances of amazing hazard: O realize it to be ſo! and bow your knee to the GOD and FATHER of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, beſeeching him, with a becoming importunity of ſoul, to have mercy upon you. Your help is only in GOD, through JESUS CHRIST. O cry mightily to him! He may hear from heaven, and convert and ſave you.</p>
            <p>But if upon inquiry you ſhould find, you have been under uneaſy ſenſations from a conſciouſneſs of ſin and guilt, reſt not ſatisfied with this; but go on and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, how theſe <hi>perceptions</hi> have operated, what has
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004914_0034_100E2BBEDD6008E8"/>
been the effect of them. In themſelves, <hi>convictions</hi> are no ſufficient evidence of a good ſtate. You may have roared out by reaſon of the diſquietneſs within you, and yet be at a diſtance from GOD and grace. Don't be content that you have been under awakenings, but examine into their iſſue. Have you herefrom ſeen your need of CHRIST? Have you repaired to him as the SAVIOUR of undone ſinners? Have you been ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to place your truſt in him, and in him alone for righteouſneſs and eternal life? Are you become <hi>new men?</hi> Have you experienced that change, which will denominate you the children of GOD, and born from above? Be critical in your inquiry into this matter. Is the change you have paſſed under, a change only in your affections? Is it nothing more than a little out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reformation? Does it lie only in an attendance on <hi>ſermons</hi> and <hi>lectures?</hi> Or is it indeed a change from the power of ſin and ſatan, a change into the likeneſs of GOD? Have you, in truth, been made partakers of the <hi>Divine nature?</hi> Have you been transformed, by the renewing of your mind, into the image of CHRIST JESUS? Unleſs the Image of the Devil has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced in you, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you have been really chang'd into a reſemblance to the bleſſed GOD, and his SON JESUS CHRIST, notwithſtanding all your other experiences, be they what they will, and as many and as great as they will, you are yet in your ſins; you are yet in ſuch a ſtate, as that if you ſhould go out of the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a further change, you would certainly miſs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and be ſent away to hell.</p>
            <p>And let me tell you, if you have indeed been <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the ſpirit of your minds,</hi> it will ſhew it ſelf in your <hi>lives.</hi> The change that has been wrought in you will have an influence upon your whole outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and behaviour. You will leave off former ſins, and put in practice neglected duties. As the grace of GOD teaches, you will deny ungodlineſs, and wordly
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004914_0035_100E2BC1F084D660"/>
luſts, and live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godlily in the world. You will attend the duties of piety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come men of prayer, the devout worſhippers of GOD, in the cloſet, in the family, and in the place where he records his name. You will keep under reſtraint your paſſions of wrath, and anger, and hatred; you will abſtain from all filthy talking and jeſting: And as for the groſs acts of uncleanneſs and intemperance, they will not be ſo much as named among you. In fine, you will do to others as you would they ſhould do to you. You will put away lying, and ſpeak every man truth with his neighbour. You will be fair and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in your treatment of mankind; honeſt in your dealings; faithful to your promiſes: All clamour and evil-ſpeaking, you will lay aſide; with all ſlandering, back-biting, tatling and tale-bearing: And you will (as the elect of GOD) put on bowels of mercies, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long ſuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, as GOD for CHRIST's ſake forgiveth you. And above all theſe things, you will put on <hi>charity,</hi> which is the bond of perfectneſs. In one word, there will be an amendment of your carriage in all the <hi>relations</hi> you ſuſtain. You will be better huſbands and wives; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parents and children; better maſters and ſervants: You will be better neighbours, better friends, better ſubjects; yea, you will be better in every <hi>ſtation,</hi> and in every <hi>condition</hi> of life: Nor otherwiſe may you think you have been renewed after the image of him that created you. Let no man deceive you; he that doth righteouſneſs, is righteous, even as he is righteous: He that committeth ſin is of the Devil. In this the children of GOD are manifeſt, and the children of the Devil: Whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs is not of GOD, neither he that loveth not his brother.</p>
            <p>Some, perhaps, may think theſe things of no great importance; but deceive not your ſelves, impoſe not
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004914_0036_100E2BC5F42C5A90"/>
on your own Souls; the work of the SPIRIT, where-ever it is ſavingly wrought, will have an influence upon the <hi>whole man,</hi> not only the <hi>heart,</hi> but the <hi>life:</hi> And 'tis a vain thing, in any man, to pretend he has the SPIRIT, in his ſaving influences, if, in his <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward life,</hi> he is habitually unconformed to the Goſpel. Where ever there is true faith, that faith, whereby we are <hi>juſtified freely of GOD's grace, without the deeds of the law, thro' the redemption that is in</hi> JESUS CHRIST, there will be a holy life; And if our faith does not expreſs it ſelf this way, 'tis that <hi>dead</hi> faith, the apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of, which is of no account with GOD: And notwithſtanding ſuch a faith, a man may periſh; yea, if he has no better a faith, he certainly will periſh: The mouth of the LORD hath ſpoken it.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the things, my brethren, by which you are to make tryal of your ſelves, whether the HOLY GHOST has been <hi>poured out upon you.</hi> And a number of you, I truſt, have reaſon, upon the tryal, to ſay, it has been ſo with you: Yea, the SPIRIT himſelf, I would hope, has <hi>witneſſed with your Spirits,</hi> that you are the <hi>children of GOD; and if children, then heirs; heirs of GOD, and joint-heirs with</hi> CHRIST, <hi>to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for you.</hi> And if, from this teſtimony of the SPIRIT, with that of your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, you are filled with peace, and enabled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in hope of the glory to be hereafter revealed, you are happy among men! You have within you the juſt grounds of a holy joy, and 'tis no wonder if you are glad: You, if any perſons on earth, have reaſon to rejoice. Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous! and again I ſay, rejoice: Yet, let your joy be mixt with a becoming caution. Rejoice with trembling! Be not high-minded, but fear. — Take heed, you be not elated with pride.— O let humility, in all the lowly expreſſions of it, be ever the attendant of your joy!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:004914_0037_100E2BC908F7EDD0"/>And let not thoſe be too much diſcouraged, who have not this joy of aſſurance. You may not from hence conclude that the SPIRIT has not been <hi>given</hi> to you. Aſſurance, however deſirable; yet, is not <hi>eſſential.</hi> A man may be a ſincere Chriſtian without it: Yet, let me call upon you, not to reſt ſatisfied while in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty about the ſtate of your ſouls; but to <hi>give all diligence,</hi> as the apoſtle exhorts, <hi>to make your calling and election ſure.</hi> Think no pains too much, if, by any means, you may come to <hi>know</hi> that the SPIRIT dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in you. 'Twill be a ſpring of comfort to you, all along in life, through all the varying conditions of it; and 'twill make even the thought of death pleaſant to us. But 'tis time that I draw towards a cloſe; and this I ſhall do by only adding in the</p>
            <p n="2">2. Second place, That we have reaſon from what has been ſaid, to be ſeeking to GOD for the <hi>out-pouring of his</hi> SPIRIT.</p>
            <p>This is the deſign of this day's ſolemnity; nor will any one object againſt a thing ſo reaſonable as <hi>ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to GOD for the <hi>gift of the</hi> HOLY GHOST.</p>
            <p>This is a <hi>neceſſary</hi> gift; that indeed without which nothing elſe will be effectual to our having that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind formed in us, without which we ſhall never be qualified for an admiſſion into the coming and eternal kingdom of GOD. We may not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently apprehenſive of it, but 'tis a certain truth, 'tis only by the SPIRIT of GOD, ſin can be rooted out of our hearts, and the diſpoſitions of holineſs implanted there. No means, nor inſtruments, will of themſelves be able to effect this. It can be accompliſh'd by no power, but that of the <hi>divine</hi> SPIRIT. And is it then a needleſs thing to make our prayer to GOD for his SPIRIT? There is nothing we can go to him for, that is a matter of greater neceſſity.</p>

                  </gap> 11.13.</note>? We who are parents know the working of our bowels towards our children: We feel within our ſelves, tho' we are evil and ſinful, a ſtrong propenſion to hearken to their cry; and if we are ſometimes unable, we are never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to beſtow upon them thoſe good things, they aſk of us, which we know are needful for them: And ſhall we ſuſpect that goodneſs of our heavenly FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, in compare with which, the tender <hi>mercies of men</hi> are <hi>cruelty?</hi> Shall earthly, ſelfiſh, ſinful parents give good gifts to their children, and ſhall not our FATHER <hi>in heaven</hi> much more give his holy SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT to them that aſk him? 'Tis unreaſonable, 'tis baſe and ungrateful to harbour in our minds the leaſt doubt or heſitation as to this matter. For he is GOD and not <hi>man</hi>; and therefore infinitely more kind and merciful than the moſt tender-hearted parents on earth.</p>

               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:004914_0039_100E2BCEF08FBB70"/>Having therefore ſuch ſtrong encouragement, let us proſtrate before the throne of GOD, and pray to him for the <hi>out-pouring of his</hi> SPIRIT.</p>
            <p>Let us pray, that he may be <hi>poured out</hi> upon the Church of CHRIST in general; that there may be a revival of true primitive Chriſtianity. Religion, it may be, was never at a lower ebb, in the profeſſing world, than at this day. 'Tis indeed, in general, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what GOD may be doing, in here and there a particular place, in a ſad, decay'd, languiſhing, and almoſt dead condition. To be ſure, it is ſo in regard of the <hi>real power of Godlineſs,</hi> in the room of which has been introduced, and taken place, meer form and external appearance, a thouſand ſuperſtitions and fopperies; and what is worſe than all, a ſpirit of tyranny, whereby theſe things have been bound upon the conſciences of men, to the eating out the very bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of true vital Chriſtianity: Yea, by far the greater part of the nations, who call themſelves the people of GOD, as profeſſing ſubjection to him through JESUS CHRIST, have, in a dreadful degree, corrupted his worſhip, and perverted his truths; teaching for Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, the commandments of men, and bowing the knee to <hi>ſaints</hi> and <hi>angels</hi> together with CHRIST, and making uſe of <hi>them</hi> as well as <hi>him,</hi> for <hi>mediators</hi> and <hi>interceſſors:</hi> Nor may it be expected, they ſhould ever be in a better ſtate, till GOD ſhall work powerfully and generally upon the hearts of men, by his holy SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT. We have ſuch a paſſage as that,<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. 32.15.</note> 
               <hi>Until the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>be poured upon us from on high, and the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a foreſt.</hi> You obſerve, the <hi>pouring out of the</hi> SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT, and the <hi>wilderneſs becoming fruitful,</hi> are connected with each other. The <hi>Church</hi> of GOD will never be recovered out of that deſolate, barren condition it is in,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004914_0040_100E2BD25B792460"/>
but by the <hi>plentiful effuſion</hi> of the SPIRIT; and when ever it ſhall pleaſe GOD thus to <hi>pour out his</hi> SPIRIT, it ſhall revive and flouriſh, and be as the field which the LORD hath bleſſed. This is what we ſhould pray for; and it ſhould inſpire our prayers with faith and fervour, to conſider the many promiſes, which ſeem, in their ultimate intention, to look forward to the <hi>laſt days</hi>; ſome of which, I have already mentioned to you.</p>
            <p>Let us pray likewiſe for the <hi>pouring out of the</hi> SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT upon our nation: Nor did they ever ſtand more in need of prayer for this bleſſing, than at preſent. There are, it is to be hoped, a good number ſtill left, of whom it may be ſaid, they are <hi>good men, and full of faith and of the</hi> HOLY GHOST: But for the nation in general, it never was, perhaps, in a more corrupt and degenerate ſtate, than at this day. The truths of GOD were never more diſowned; the revelations of GOD were never more diſbelieved; and the ways of GOD were never more deſerted, for the ways of ſin which lead to death and hell. The language, in which the holy GOD addreſt to his people <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, may pertinently be applied to them, <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. 1.2, 4.</note> 
               <hi>Hear, O heavens! and give ear, O earth! for the</hi> LORD <hi>hath ſpoken: I have nouriſhed, and brought up children, and they have rebelled againſt me. Ah! ſinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a ſeed of evil doers; they have forſaken the</hi> LORD, <hi>they have provoked the holy one of Iſrael to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they are gone backward.</hi> We cannot more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly expreſs our regards to them than by our prayers to GOD, to <hi>pour</hi> out his SPIRIT on them, to their effectual humiliation and repentance: And the more fervent we are in our ſupplications for this mercy, the more ſhall we diſcover a true chriſtian affection for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:004914_0041_100E2BD88329B528"/>Let us pray alſo, for the <hi>out-pouring</hi> of the SPIRIT upon our land. There is room for prayer in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. A concern, I am ſenſible, has been generally awaken'd in the minds of people, in one place and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And it has, I truſt, been of ſpiritual advantage to many; who, it may be hoped, have been either <hi>ſavingly converted</hi> to GOD, or <hi>enliven'd</hi> and <hi>quicken'd</hi> in the work of religion, and their ſoul's everlaſting ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There are, I doubt not, a number in this land, upon whom GOD has graciouſly <hi>ſhed</hi> the influences of his bleſſed SPIRIT; and we ought to be thankful for what of the SPIRIT, we have reaſon to hope there is among us: But there is yet need of prayer; and the more ſo, as ſo many things have ariſen among us, which are a diſhonour to GOD, and may have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency greatly to obſtruct the progreſs of real and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial religion. Alas! what unchriſtian heats and animoſities are there in many places, to the dividing and breaking in pieces of churches and towns? What a ſpirit of raſh, cenſorious, uncharitable judging pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails too generally all over the land? What bitterneſs and wrath and clamour, what evil-ſpeaking, reviling and ſlandering, are become common; and among thoſe too, who would be counted good chriſtians? How alienated are many miniſters from each other, and how inſtrumental of hurting rather than promoting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's uſefulneſs? What prejudices are there in the minds of too many people againſt the <hi>ſtanding miniſtry,</hi> tho' perhaps as faithful a one as any part of the world is favour'd with? And how general is the diſpoſition they diſcover to flock after every <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>illiterate</hi> EXHORTER, to the contempt of their <hi>paſtors,</hi> who have ſpent, it may be, the moſt of their days, in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervices for their ſouls? How heated are the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of a great many, and into what exceſſes do they betray them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:004914_0042_100E2BDB8C0CE660"/>Theſe and ſuch like things, it is too evident to be diſowned, are grown too common, not in a ſingle place only, but in moſt places throughout the country. How they may appear to ſome others I know not; but to me, I confeſs, they afford no comfortable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. I can't but think it is <hi>now</hi> a <hi>ſpecial ſeaſon</hi> for <hi>prayer.</hi> Let us unite in our cries to the GOD, who dwelleth on high. —— Let us pray for a <hi>general effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of the SPIRIT upon the <hi>land</hi>; and that he may come down, not only as a Spirit of <hi>humiliation</hi> and <hi>ſanctification,</hi> but as a Spirit of <hi>wiſdom,</hi> that ſo they who are <hi>zealous</hi> may be <hi>prudently</hi> and <hi>knowingly</hi> ſo; and they who are <hi>pious</hi> exemplarily ſo, adorning the doctrine of GOD their SAVIOUR in all things, and cutting off occaſion from them who might be glad of occaſion to ſpeak evil of them.</p>
            <p>In fine, Let us the people of GOD, who uſually worſhip in this place, <hi>pray</hi> for the <hi>out-pouring</hi> of the SPIRIT upon <hi>our ſelves</hi> more particularly. Bleſſed be GOD, we are not wholly without the influences of his SPIRIT. Some, we truſt, have had experience of his operations on their ſouls. The LORD increaſe their number! The LORD grant, that the SPIRIT may fall from on high on the whole congregation! Let us pray that it may be ſo; that the HOLY GHOST may be <hi>poured out,</hi> both upon <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>people,</hi> upon high and low, rich and poor, male and female, bond and free, old and young, to the revival of the things which remain and are ready to die.</p>
            <p>This is the bleſſing we are come to aſk of GOD. O let us be importunate in our cries to him for it! Let us pray with an importunity that ſhall pierce even heaven.</p>
            <p>And let us not think it enough that we join together in the <hi>public prayers</hi> of this day; but let us go on with our <hi>prayers.</hi> Let us each one pray to GOD by <hi>our ſelves,</hi> and with <hi>our families:</hi> And let us pray, and ceaſe not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:004914_0043_100E2BDF6C05A358"/>And while we pray for the SPIRIT, let us beware of every thing that may have a tendency to prevent his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences being ſhed upon us. Let us be upon our guard againſt all ſin, and thoſe ſins in ſpecial, by which GOD may be provok'd to withhold from us his bleſſed SPIRIT. Let us take heed, that we don't harbour prejudices in our minds againſt the SPIRIT, his <hi>office</hi> and <hi>work</hi> upon the hearts of ſinners: And while we are ready to give to the divine SPIRIT the honour of thoſe <hi>operations</hi> that are truly <hi>his,</hi> let us maintain a care that we don't reflect diſgrace upon him by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him the author of thoſe things, which are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him: The SPIRIT may be diſhonoured both theſe ways; and perhaps he has been as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd by the <hi>latter</hi> as he has been ſlighted by the <hi>former.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhould alſo be diligent in our attendance on <hi>all means,</hi> eſpecially <hi>the word preached. Sabbaths</hi> muſt be obſerved. — GOD muſt be waited on at his <hi>houſe</hi>; his <hi>worſhip</hi> regarded; his <hi>word,</hi> in the <hi>miniſtry</hi> of it, attended to. GOD is often preſent by his SPIRIT, when the <hi>word</hi> is diſpenſed. We read in my text of many up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom the HOLY GHOST <hi>fell,</hi> while they were <hi>hearing the word.</hi> And 'tis obſerved of the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 3.2.</note> that they <hi>received the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>by the heareng of faith.</hi> i. e. the preaching of the <hi>word of faith,</hi> the Goſpel of CHRIST. But then, you muſt not think, that <hi>hearing of Sermons</hi> is all that is neceſſary. You muſt ſo hear as to find time for <hi>meditation, ſelf-examination,</hi> and a ſerious <hi>ſelf-application.</hi> And you muſt come to hear without any previous biaſs upon your minds, without prepoſſeſſions and prejudices againſt either the <hi>word,</hi> or the <hi>diſpenſer</hi> of it. You muſt come with minds open to conviction, willing to receive the truth, as it
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:004914_0044_100E2BE29B7F8148"/>
is in JESUS; otherwiſe the beſt preaching in the world will be of no ſervice to you.</p>
            <p>In a word, you muſt make it the great buſineſs of your lives to obtain the influences of the holy SPIRIT. This, you muſt eſteem, the main thing; and here you muſt lay out your chief ſtrength. This muſt be your continual care. You muſt make it your main buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſubordinating your other affairs to this which is of the greateſt importance.</p>
            <p>And if it ſhall pleaſe GOD to <hi>pour out his</hi> SPIRIT upon us, then ſhall we remember from whence we are fallen, and repent and do our firſt works; then will the work of religion proſper among us, ſinners be awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd, humbled and converted, and ſaints be quicken'd and enliven'd. Then ſhall we flouriſh like the palm-tree, and grow like the cedar in Lebanon, and being planted in the courts of our GOD, ſhall bring forth fruit, even till old age, to ſhew that the LORD is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: Which GOD of his infinite mercy grant for the ſake of CHRIST JESUS, to whom be glory for ever and ever. AMEN.</p>
