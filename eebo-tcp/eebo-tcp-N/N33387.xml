            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Appeal to the People of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts State, againſt Arbitrary Power.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>FRIENDS AND COUNTRYMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A Cauſe is now to be tried before you, which is of infinite and eternal importance to us all; and can I be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably blamed for addreſſing you upon it ſince I am pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly called to act for many thouſands in the affair? The cauſe I refer to turns upon this point, viz. Whether TRUTH and EQUITY, or PARTIALITY and HYPOCRISY ſhall conſtitute the future government of this State? I am far from ſuppoſing that you would adopt the latter under theſe names, or when you viewed them in their true nature and effects. The divine law was violated by our firſt mother, under a view of its being <hi>good</hi> and <hi>pleaſant</hi> ſo to do; and the empire of iniquity ever ſince has been carried on, by calling <hi>evil good, and good evil; by putting darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs, bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter.</hi> And the inſpired apoſtle ſays, <hi>I fear leſt by any means, as the ſerpent beguiled Eve through his ſubtilty, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt.</hi> And he earneſtly calls us to <hi>mark thoſe who cauſe diviſions and offences, contrary to his doctrine,</hi> under <hi>good words and fair ſpeeches.</hi> 2 Cor. 11.3. Rom 16.17, 18. And the caſe to be tried by you is, who this mark belongs to, and whether it ſhall now be put upon the right perſons or not?</p>
            <p>One of the greateſt hiſtorians of New England exerted all his art to fix it upon the firſt baptiſts therein.
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Magnalia, book</hi> 7. <hi>p</hi> 9. <hi>Baptiſt hiſtory, p.</hi> 109.</note> And the ruling party in this State, have now made a like attempt to fix it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and upon the communities I am connected with. And you are all called upon, to approve or diſapprove of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and if you ſuffer a wrong judgment to proceed, when you can prevent it, you cannot be guiltleſs therein. Upon
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:043766_0003_101D643F7524EB60"/>this great cauſe you are to judge according to law and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and my buſineſs is to open the caſe before you, as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I can.</p>
            <p>Now you are to note, that Chriſt himſelf came on purpoſe to make diviſions upon earth; therefore it is not all diviſions, but only ſuch as are contrary to his doctrine, that are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And a firſt and capital article of his doctrine is that HE IS HEAD OVER ALL THINGS TO THE CHURCH; and that ſhe is <hi>complete in him,</hi> Eph 1.21, 22. Col. 2.10. And thoſe are to be marked as deceivers who do not thus hold THE HEAD. Col. 2.19—23. Another article in his doctrine is, that no man <hi>can ſee his kingdom,</hi> nor have right to any <hi>power</hi> therein without <hi>regeneration.</hi> John 1.12, 13 &amp; 3.3 And the firſt man that offered <hi>money</hi> as a means of obtaining <hi>power</hi> therein, is <hi>marked</hi> with an eternal brand of infamy. Acts 8.19.23. A third article is, that the whole of our duty is included in love to GOD, and love to our neighbour. Mat. 7.12, &amp; 22. 37—40. A fourth is, that the civil magiſtrate's power is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the laſt of theſe; and that his ſword is to puniſh none but ſuch as <hi>work ill to their neighbours.</hi> Rom. 13.1—10. 1 Pet. 2.13, 14. A fifth is, that thoſe who receive inſtruction and benefit from Chriſt's miniſters, are required freely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, according to their ability, to their temporal ſupport, as they will anſwer it to him in the great day. Luke 10.7—12. 1 Cor. 9.4—14. Gal. 6.6, 7. A ſixth is, that none ſhould hear, nor give countenance, to any teachers who bring not Chriſt's doctrine, but pervert his goſpel, as they would avoid partaking in their guilt. Prov. 19.27. Mark 4.24. 2 John, 10, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Theſe are plain points of law. The facts and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that you are called to judge upon are as follow.</p>
            <p>The doctrine that New-England was founded upon was, that
<q>the merits of ſaints might as well be mingled with the purity of Chriſt for the ſaving of the church, as the laws of men with her laws, for the ruling and guiding of it.</q> Which doctrine was violated fifteen years after, when the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> at Boſton determined to mix their laws with Chriſt's laws about worſhip, and to compel every man in the colony to ſwear allegiance to <hi>that</hi> power, or to be puniſhed at their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. And for teſtifying againſt <hi>ſuch power</hi> and <hi>ſuch oaths,</hi> they baniſhed the firſt baptiſt miniſter in America out of their juriſdiction
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Baptiſt hiſtory, p</hi> 31, 62—70, 156, 157.</note> And to prevent the like evils for the future, our churches ſent me to Philadelphia, when the firſt congreſs was ſitting, to improve the beſt means we could, to promote <hi>impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial liberty</hi> among ourſelves, ſeeing we were equally concerned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> againſt foreign invaders. This attempt was plainly encouraged by the 17th reſolve of the county of Suffolk, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:043766_0004_101D644102160AD8"/>they promiſed to pay all due reſpect and ſubmiſſion to ſuch meaſures as the Congreſs ſhould recommend, "for the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſtabliſhment of our juſt rights, civil and <hi>religious."</hi> It was not then known here that they would refuſe to be judges of religious controverſies. Theſe reſolves I carried with me to that city, where a promiſe was obtained from our delegates in congreſs, that they would improve their influence toward dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the religious liberty that has long been enjoyed in Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton into the remoteſt parts of this State. But this was ſo far from being fulfilled, that ſome, if not all of thoſe gentlemen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed us in the convention laſt fall, of acting an unfriendly part towards our country, for making the attempt which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured that promiſe. Therefore, in the Independent Chronicle of Dec. 2, I gave a narrative of theſe affairs, and challenged them to a fair hearing thereon. But inſtead of any ſuch thing, that accuſation is repeated in ſaid paper of Feb. 10, to which other horrid ones are added, by one who ſtiles himſelf a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the convention, without intending the public ſhould know his name. And all this, my countrymen, is to perſuade you to ſwallow down the third article, which, after a very hard ſtruggle, they have inſerted in the bill of rights, that they would lay as the foundation of our future government. Which article is pregnant with the following evil.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It aſſerts a right in the people of this State, to make and execute laws about the worſhip of God; directly contrary to the truth, which aſſures us that we have but ONE LAWGIVER in ſuch affairs. Iſai. 33 22. James 4, 12</p>
            <p n="2">2d. They who framed this article are ſo far from holding THE HEAD of the church, and from allowing her to be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in him,</hi> that they do not name either Chriſt or his church in all their account of the worſhip of God, and of the choice and ſupport of religious teachers. So that <hi>good</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> are the fine names under which you are urged to receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, "in piety, religion and morality," without any regard either to our <hi>only Mediator,</hi> or to her who is preſented as a <hi>chaſte virgin to him.</hi> 2 Cor 11, 2.</p>
            <p n="3">3d This article is ſo <hi>partial,</hi> that it would empower the majority in every town and pariſh, to covenant for the reſt with religious miniſters, and to compel every man therein to ſupport the pariſh miniſter, if the money paid was not required for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And no man could require it, nor miniſter receive it, with a good conſcience, who believed this way to be unjuſt and there are thouſands in this State, of various denominations.</p>
            <p n="4">4th If this article ſhould be eſtabliſhed, our caſe would be incomparably worſe than it has ever yet been. For firſt, our former laws about worſhip proceeded entirely from the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes and errors of the legiſlators, and not at all from our char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:043766_0005_101D6442AADFB158"/>but this article would make them an eſſential part of our conſtitution. Secondly, we had formerly a legal way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from the unjuſt acts and ſentences of the ruling ſect here; which was a great reſtraint upon them. But the plan they have now laid, is to have that reſtraint entirely taken off. Thirdly, this plan is to empower legiſlators, who are elected by <hi>money</hi> qualifications, if they do but bear the <hi>chriſtian</hi> name, (which the church of Rome does as well as others) to compel all to attend and ſupport what they ſhall call the worſhip of God; and what a door this would open upon us you ought to conſider. Fourthly, the advocates for this power, have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy threatened revenge upon us for oppoſing it, if they can ever get it eſtabliſhed. And in the mean time they have exhibited a ſpecimen thereof to the world. For a former legiſlator headed a mob the June before laſt, and violently broke up a peaceable meeting for divine worſhip, only becauſe it was in a way different from the judgment of his party. And becauſe I publiſhed an account of it, he ſaid in open town meeting. <q>I know how I will get my recompence of him if ever I come acroſs him!</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Independent Chronicle of Dec.</hi> 3, 1778.</note> Yet he was ſo far from receiving any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all this, that he has been employed in forming the plan of government that is now offered to you. Another mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the convention was ſo much inflamed by the forenamed accuſations againſt us laſt fall, that he went home and procured the impriſonment of two of my brethren, on the very day that I anſwered thoſe accuſations. And two more of my hearers were fined for refuſing to aſſiſt in ſeizing the bodies of their friends, for a tax to a miniſter they had diſſented from and had declared they could not in conſcience ſupport. And they have ſince been taxed to him again, and are daily expoſed to impriſonment therefor. And our oppreſſors in their publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Feb. 10. have accuſed my brethren in the convention of being ſuch monſters as "even to rake open the aſhes of the dead."</p>
            <p>They ſay, <q>No man would betake himſelf to declaiming and reviling, who had any ſolid arguments to ſupport his cauſe.</q> I readily grant that ſuch a practice indicates a bad temper, or a bad cauſe, or both. So far we are agreed But the diſpute is about which party have diſcovered this black mark. In this publication they have <hi>ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Here therefore, my dear countrymen, you have a very plain caſe to judge upon. Our opponents call that <hi>good</hi> which we call <hi>evil.</hi> And the great judge of all ſays. <hi>Every one that doeth evil, hateth the light—but be that doth truth cometh to the light.</hi> John 3.20, 21. And you are called to judge betwixt us upon this great point. Each of us profeſs to plead for the cauſe of truth and equity, as it concerns your welfare as well as ours; and if you ſhould give a wrong judgment upon it, none can ſay how great and pernicious the effects will be to us all, and to all ſucceeding generations, even till time ſhall be no more; yea, to all eternity. Never was there ſo fair an opportunity offered to any people ſince the riſe of antichriſt, as you now have, to aſſert your own rights, and to caſt off tyranny. One charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thoſe who have <hi>a form</hi> but deny <hi>the power of godlineſs.</hi> is that they are <hi>falſe-accuſers.</hi> Another is, that they are <hi>ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> 2 Tim 3.1—7. And ſince it is certain that chriſtianity was founded upon <hi>the truth,</hi> and that the <hi>power of it</hi> conquered the Roman empire; do they not deny the power of it, who hold that it would ſoon be loſt from among us, if <hi>force</hi> was not uſed to ſupport it? I concur with them that religion has been the the life of New England. But I am ſo far from thinking that human laws about religious worſhip have been our life that I know they have been moſt deadly things to us; &amp; that if the power of godlineſs had not been above them &amp; had not prevailed againſt them we ſhould all have been ruined long ago <hi>Plagues from God</hi> ever have followed, and ever will follow, thoſe who <hi>add</hi> to his laws about worſhip Rev. 22 18. This was the practiſe and the portion of the Phariſees, Mahomet, the Jeſuits, and the mad men of Munſter; and can you be ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as to continue that practice among us, becauſe the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for it, caſt thoſe hateful names upon thoſe who oppoſe it! They do not come ſo <hi>near to the light</hi> as the Phariſees did; for when they taught God's fear by the <hi>precepts of men,</hi> they made a man an <hi>offender for a word.</hi> Iſai 29.13, 21. Mat. 15, 9; but our <hi>accuſers</hi> have not done ſo much as this.</p>
            <p>Since I was firſt called to act as agent for the Baptiſts in this State, we have publiſhed four books, beſides a number of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, againſt the uſe of ſecular force in religious affairs, which are now to be had in Boſton; yet, when in behalf of our church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, I challenged our accuſers in the convention, to a fair and open hearing; they have been ſo far from it, as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

And all this without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſo much as a ſingle <hi>word</hi> from all our writings to prove their charges againſt us. And in Mr. Gill's paper of March <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Inſtead of raking open the aſhes of the dead, we earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted our countrymen ſeven years ago, to bury ſome of their <hi>bones</hi> which appeared above ground.

Ezekiel 43, 7—9. Upon which one of my brethren turned the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little off from it; which is what they mean by their bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exclamation. That is, they denied that their fathers ever <hi>perſecuted</hi> any in this country; and he recited a few acts of their courts to prove that they did. The ſentence of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon may give light in this caſe. 1 Kings. 3.27. For our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents are ſo much for <hi>dividing the living child,</hi> that they would have religious teachers ſettled and ſupported <hi>in the name of this State,</hi> who ſhould adminiſter ordinances <hi>in the name of Chriſt.</hi> But thoſe women never thought of diſputing about which was the living child, and which not, as our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries do. For after the head of their form was cut clear off, they contend for power to put another <hi>head</hi> to it, and for the people to <hi>give life</hi> to ſuch a monſter; as being <hi>eſſentially neceſſary</hi> to the good of the State. Rev. 13.15—18.

            <p>All this norſe proceeds from no better cauſe than our inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon impartiality in our future government. We lately proved, that the greateſt miniſter in Boſton, eighty years ago, who was then preſident of Harvard-College, called the practice we oppoſe SIMONY and ROBBERY.
