            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The 25th we made the out End of the Iſland of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and on the 27th we landed on it without the loſs of a Man.—A ſmall Party of Rangers were almoſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by a large Party of <hi>Indians</hi>; but the Rangers ruſh'd through them with the Loſs of only one Man; what Damage the Enemy ſuſtain'd is uncertain.</p>
            <p>On the 29th the <hi>French</hi> ſent five Fire-Ships down among our Fleet; but, thank God, they did no Damage. The ſame Day we marched about 6 Miles, under the Command of Col. <hi>Carlton,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped that ſame Night in Sight of the <hi>French</hi> Army, and likewiſe in Sight of the Town.—Gen. <hi>Monckton</hi>'s Brigade and a Party of Rangers landed on the South Side; we had a ſmall Attack, by which we had 3 kill'd, 2 wounded and 4 taken Priſoners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 1st, the Enemy came againſt our Detachment on the South-ſide of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with floating Batteries; but our Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping ſoon drove them off;—the Damage they ſuffer'd is not known.

            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> the 5th, a Barge came between the Iſland and the main Land, to ſound the Depth of Water: The <hi>French</hi> fir'd four Cannon-Shot at her, and came down on a large Bar of Sand, from whence they fir'd ſmall Arms; alſo five Canoes came down the River, loaded with <hi>Indians,</hi> who took the Barge, made one Man Priſoner, and wounded another belonging to the 22d Regiment. On the ſame Day their floating Batteries attack'd our Shipping; but was ſoon obliged to quit their Firing. —Gen. <hi>Monckton</hi> opened a ſmall Battery upon the South Side: The first Day they cannonaded and bombarded on both Sides; but loſt never a Man.</p>
            <p>The 8th we landed on <hi>Quebeck</hi>-Shore, without any Interception, and marched up the River about two Miles; when the <hi>Louisbourg</hi> Grenadiers being order'd out to get Faſcines, they had ſcarce ſat down to take a ſmall Refreſhment, and detach'd

            <p>The third Day our Shipping was drove off by the Enemy's Shells.—We got only ſome few Priſoners, 'til the 12th Day, when the <hi>French</hi> built a Battery againſt us, but had not Time to mount any Guns on it; for we ſoon demoliſh'd it with our Field-Pieces and Hauitzers. The four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Day their floating Batteries came out after our Boats, but we ſoon drove them back again.—The 16th, we ſet the Town on Fire, about 12 o'Clock, which continued burning all that Day.</p>
            <p>On the 17th we went out a Faſcining, and to make Oars, with a ſmall Party to cover us;—5 were kill'd, of which 4 were ſcalp'd, and we was oblig'd to quit the Wood directly; the <hi>Indians</hi> came up very cloſe, and kill'd and ſcalp'd one Man cloſe by us; the Grenadiers of the 45th Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

fir'd upon them, and I ſaw one drop; but the <hi>Indians</hi> took him off in a Minute: We had 5 kill'd, belonging to the 35th Regiment, and one dangerouſly wounded; the 15th Reg. had one wounded; the 45th Reg. had one wounded very bad; but our People returning upon them, made them fly ſo faſt that they were oblig'd to leave their Blankets and Match-coats, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Things, behind them; but we could not get one of them Priſoners. A Deſerter came to us, from whom we had in imperfect Account of their Forces; which, however, gave us ſome Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 18th, the Deſerter went out with our Light-Infantry, to ſhow them a Place where to croſs the Falls; the <hi>Indians</hi> fir'd on them, but hurt none: Likewise the ſame Night ſome of our Shipping paſs'd the Town, and one run aſhore on the South Side of the River. The 19th Day the floating Batteries came out to attack our Shipping round the Harbour; but our Batteries on the Land-Side drove them off, ſo that the Shipping receiv'd but two Shot. —On the 20th an Accident happen'd in the Light-Infantry's Camp; a Man ſitting

            <p>The 21ſt Day of <hi>July</hi> all the Grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers croſsd over to the Iſland of <hi>Orleans</hi>; the <hi>Indians</hi> attack'd us very ſmartly, as we was marching to the Water-Side.—Same Day the Enemy open'd two Batteries on us, which raked our Camps. Our Troops, with Seamen, ſtormed a Battery on the S. Side, ſpiked the Cannon, broke the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, broke into their Magazine, took all their Powder, and threw all the Shot and Shells into the Water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 22d we ſet the Town on Fire, which burnt all the next Day: Some of our Shipping went to paſs the Town; but they fir'd ſo hot, that they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to turn back.</p>
            <p>The 23d 300 Provincials landed on the Iſland of <hi>Orleans,</hi> which was ſome Rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement.</p>

at our Camp; and we receiv'd News, That our Forces on <hi>Montmorancy</hi> Side had been attack'd the Day before, and likewiſe got the better of the Enemy; we had an Account that we kill'd 300 of them, but the Number of wounded none of us could tell: Our loſs was 5 Officers and 32 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates, 12 of whom were kill'd, and the reſt wounded. The ſame Day we went to get our Plunder, which we diſcovered on our March round the Iſland, conſiſting of Gowns, Shifts, Petticoats, Stockings, Coats and Waiſtcoats, Breeches, Shoes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Articles too tedious to mention,— and ſome Caſh; which, if the Things had been ſold to the Value, would have fetch'd upwards of 500 l. Sterl. The ſame Night the <hi>French</hi> ſent five Fire-Floats down, which made great Confuſion among our Fleet; but the Men of War ſent their Boats and tow'd them aſhore, where they burnt out without further Damage.</p>

               <hi>July</hi> 29, <hi>Otway</hi>'s and <hi>Hopſon</hi>'s Grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers went on board the <hi>Three-Siſters, Witmore</hi>'s and <hi>Warburton</hi>'s on board the <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> the reſt in flat-bottom Boats and other Veſſels, with a full Intent to land on a Part of the <hi>French</hi> Shore; ſo as by that Means we might come at the Town:

The firſt Puſh we made was on the 31ſt of <hi>July,</hi> with 13 Companies of Grenadiers, ſupported by about 5 Thouſand Battalion-Men;—as ſoon as we landed we fixed our Bayonets and beat our Grenadier's-March, and ſo advanced on; during all this Time their Cannon play'd very briſkly on us; but their Small-Arms, in their Trenches, lay cool 'till they were ſure of their Mark; then they pour'd their Small-Shot like Showers of Hail, which caus'd our brave Grenadiers to fall very faſt: Brave Gen. <hi>Wolfe</hi> ſaw that our Attempts were in vain, ſo he retreated to his Boats again: The Number of kill'd and wounded that Day was about 400 Men;—in our Retreat we burnt the two Ships, which we had ran aſhore on that Side to cover our Landing.</p>
            <p>The 3d Day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> a Party of Capt. <hi>Danks</hi>'s Rangers went from the Iſland of <hi>Orleans</hi> to <hi>Quebeck</hi>-Side, a little down the River; they were attack'd by a Party of <hi>French,</hi> and was ſmartly engag'd for the Space of half an Hour; but the Rangers put them to flight, kill'd ſeveral and took one Priſoner: The Rangers loſt one Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, who died of his Wounds ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and 2 or 3 others. They got a great deal of Plunder.</p>

            <p>On the 6th a Victualing-Ship ſail'd from our Fleet, and went below the Falls, the <hi>French</hi> hove Shot and Shells in great Number at them; but did them no Harm.</p>

The 9th Day we ſet the Town on Fire, being the 3d Time.</p>
            <p>On the 10th the <hi>French</hi> floated a Thing down in the Form of a Floating-Battery; one of our Ships ſent out a Boat to ſee what it was, and juſt as the Seamen were going to jump on board, it blew up and kill'd one Midſhipman and wounded four

Sailors.—The ſame Day about 30 Sailors went a Plundering on the South-ſide of the River, and as they were about their Prey, they was ſurpriz'd by a Party of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and drove off; but they all got ſafe to their Boats, tho' not without the Loſs of their Plunder.</p>
            <p>The 11th Inſtant there was an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between our Scouting-Parties and the <hi>Indians</hi>; our People drove them off; we had a great Number wounded, ſeveral very badly, but the moſt ſlightly; there was but few kill'd: There was one of the 35th Reg. told me, he ſaw an <hi>Indian</hi> who fir'd at him, but miſs'd him; that he le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled his Piece and fir'd at the <hi>Indian,</hi> and miſs'd him likewiſe; upon which the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> immediately threw his Tommahawk at him and miſs'd him; whereupon the Soldier, catching up the Tommahawk, threw it at the <hi>Indian</hi> and levell'd him, and then went to ſcalp him; but 2 other <hi>Indians</hi> came behind him, and one of them ſtuck a Tommahawk in his Back; but did not wound him ſo much as to prevent his Eſcape from them.</p>
            <p>The 12th Day we had an Account of General <hi>Murray</hi>'s going to land above the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008381_0012_102F436959F3E3F0"/>
Town—He made an Attempt to land twice and was beat off; he made the third At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and landed on the South-Shore with the Loſs of about 100 kill'd and wounded. The ſame Day we had an Account from the Enemy, That Gen. <hi>Amherſt</hi>'s <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>my was taken very badly, and that they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to turn back again.</p>
            <p>On the 13th we had an Account by one of the <hi>French</hi> Gunners, who deſerted to us that Night, That the Enemy had very little Proviſions; he likewiſe gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what a Body of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> came over the Falls, the ſame Side that our Army was on, and that they had four Days Proviſions with them, and remain'd there ſtill.</p>
            <p>The 14th a Sailor belonging to the <hi>Dublin</hi> Man of War, endeavour'd to ſwim over to the <hi>French,</hi> over the River; but the Current ran ſo ſtrong, that he was driven on Shore on the Iſland-Side, and was taken up by one of <hi>Hopſon</hi>'s Grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and carried to their Quarter-Guard, from whence he was carried on board his own Ship again, ſtark naked.</p>
            <p>The 15th of <hi>Aug.</hi> Captain <hi>Gorham</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from an Incurſion, in which Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008381_0013_102F436AE922CEB8"/>
were employ'd, under his Command, 150 Rangers, a Detachment from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Regiments, Highlanders, Marines, &amp;c. amounting in the whole to about 300, an arm'd Veſſel, three Tranſports, with a Lieutenant and Seamen of the Navy to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him; of which Expedition they gave the following Account:</p>
            <p>"That on the 4th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded down to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Bay, (which is oppoſite to the North Side of this Iſland) where was a Pariſh containing about 200 Men, who had been very active in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing our Boats and Shipping.—At 3 o' Clock in the Morning Capt. <hi>Gorham</hi> land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and forced two of their Guards, of 20 Men each, who fired ſmartly for ſome Time; but that in two Hours they drove them all from their Covering in the Wood, and clear'd the Village which they burnt, conſiſting of about 50 fine Houſes and Barns; deſtroy'd moſt of their Cattle, &amp;c. —That in this one Man was kill'd and 6 wounded; but that the Enemy had two kill'd, and ſeveral wounded, who were carried off.—That from thence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to <hi>Mal Bay,</hi> 10 Leagues to the Eaſtward on the ſame Side, where they
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008381_0014_102F436C76B6E5A0"/>
deſtroyed a very pretty Pariſh, drove off the Inhabitants and Stock without any Loſs; after which, they made a Deſcent on the South Shore, oppoſite the Iſland of <hi>Coudre,</hi> deſtroyed Part of the Pariſh of St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s and St. <hi>Roan,</hi> where were very handſome Houſes with Farms, and loaded the Veſſels with Cattle; after which they returned from their Expedition."</p>
            <p>The ſame Day 1 of our Schooners went from the Fleet below the Fall, and the <hi>French</hi> fir'd 8 or 9 Shot at her; but miſs'd her. This Day a Party of young High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers came to the Iſland of <hi>Orleans</hi> from Gen. <hi>Monckton</hi>'s Encampment, on Purpoſe to deſtroy all the <hi>Canada</hi>-Side.—The ſame Day our People ſet one of the Enemy's Floating-Batteries on Fire;—and in the Night General <hi>Monckton</hi> ſet the Town on Fire, (being the 4th Time) and the Flames raged ſo violently, that 'twas imagin'd the whole City would have been reduc'd to Aſhes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 18th, a Sloop and Schooner went below the Falls; the <hi>French</hi> hove Shot and Shells at them, but did 'em no Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage. The ſame Day the Enemy hove a Bomb from the Town, which kill'd one
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008381_0015_102F436F3A8C3090"/>
Man and wounded 6 more,—one Man had his Arm cut off by a Piece of the ſame Shell.</p>
            <p>On the 20th the <hi>Louisbourg</hi> Grenadiers began their March down the main Land of <hi>Quebeck,</hi> in order to burn and deſtroy all the Houſes on that Side.—On the 24th they were attack'd by a Party of <hi>French,</hi> who had a Prieſt for their Commander; but our Party kill'd and ſcalp'd 31 of them, and likewiſe the Prieſt, their Commander: They did our People no Damage. The three Companies of <hi>Louisbourg</hi> Grenadiers halted about 4 Miles down the River, at a Church called the <hi>Guardian-Angel,</hi> where we were order'd to fortify ourſelves till further Orders; we had ſeveral ſmall Parties in Houſes, and the Remainder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church.—The 25th, began to deſtroy the Country, burning Houſes, cutting down Corn, and the like: At Night the Indians fired ſeveral ſcattering Shot at the Houſes, which kill'd one of the Highlanders and wounded another; but they were ſoon repulſed by the Heat of our Firing:—It was ſaid that the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Enemy conſiſted of 800 <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> and <hi>Indians. Sept.</hi> 1ſt we ſet Fire to our Houſes and Fortifications, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008381_0016_102F4372338D4400"/>
marched to join the Grand Army at <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morancy</hi>; the 3 Companies of Grenadiers were ordered to hold themſelves in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to march at a Minute's Warning.</p>
            <p>The 26th a Serjeant of the 35th Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſerted acroſs the Fall, and our People fir'd ſeveral Grape-Shots after him; notwithſtanding which he got clear off to the Enemy.</p>
            <p>The 27th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> ſome of our Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping went paſt the Town, which fir'd ſo hot at them with Shot and Bombs, that one would have thought it impoſſible for any Veſſel to paſs; but they receiv'd little or no Damage. The 29th, 5 Sail went to paſs the Town, up the River; the Town fir'd very warm all the Time of their paſſing, and I was very well inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That only 15 of their Shot took Place out of all their Firing: Likewiſe the 30th Inſtant four of our Ships paſs'd the Town, where they kept a continual Firing; but did us very little Damage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept.</hi> 1. all the Sick and Women that was on <hi>Montmorancy</hi>-Side, came over to the Iſland of <hi>Orleans</hi>; on the 2d Inſtant a large Body of <hi>Wolfe</hi>'s Troops came over,

with the <hi>Louiſbourg</hi> Grenadiers, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped that Night on the ſame Iſland.</p>
            <p>The 3d Day all the Army left <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morancy</hi>-Side, and we ſet all the Houſes and Fortifications on Fire, and then we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd in flat-bottom Boats and came up above the Fall; the <hi>French</hi> fir'd very brisk all the Time of our paſſing, but did us no Damage, and we went over to Point <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vee</hi> and encamped there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept.</hi> 4th the <hi>Louisbourg</hi> Grenadiers and the Remainder of the Army, croſs'd over to Point-<hi>Levee</hi> from the Iſland of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and encamped there.—The ſame Day 4 Men came from Gen. <hi>Amherſt</hi>'s Army; they was 26 Days on their Journey, and inform'd us, That we had got <hi>Ticonderoga,</hi> and likewiſe <hi>Crown-Point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept.</hi> 5th about 5 or 6000 Men march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the River, on Point-<hi>Levee</hi> Side, to go above the Town, and carried one Month's Proviſion up in Sloops. The ſame Day one of the <hi>Royal-Americans,</hi> who was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoner by the <hi>French-Indians</hi> the 31ſt of <hi>July</hi> laſt, made his Eſcape and came to the <hi>Porcupine</hi> Sloop of War, that lay a little below the Fall; he informs us, That there is no more than about 300 <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:008381_0018_102F437A348868F8"/>
that carries Arms; but that there was a great Number of Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they were very ſcant of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; likewiſe that he himſelf had been 48 Hours without any Thing to eat: He further ſaid, that the Enemy were very numerous in their Intrenchments, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of at leaſt 14,000 Men, of which 11,000 were <hi>Canadians</hi> and the reſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars, the latter of whom were heartily tir'd with the Siege.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept.</hi> 6th the Schooner <hi>Terror of France</hi> went above the Town, in the middle of the Day, as ſhe paſs'd they kept up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Fire at her, and ſhe receiv'd five of their Shot; one in her Jib, two in her Mainſail and 2 in her Foreſail; but loſt none of her Hands, nor did ſhe ſuſtain any further Damage.</p>
            <p>The whole Army being on Point-<hi>Levee</hi> Side, the main Body were order'd to get ready to march above the Town, on the South Side, and to take only one Shirt and one Pair of Stockings, beſides what we had on: We marched up the River about 8 Miles, and then embarked on board the Men of War and Tranſports that were up the River; the Number that embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008381_0019_102F437C3657F108"/>
was 3349 Men, with a Party of the Train of Artillery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sept.</hi> 10. the Weather being very wet, and the Troops very much crowded on board the Men of War and Tranſports, the General thought proper to land us on the South Side again; which was a great Decoy to the <hi>French:</hi> We marched to the Church of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> under the Command of General <hi>Monckton,</hi> where we halted. The next Day we received Intelligence of a ſmall Number of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> who were driving ſome Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;—we diſpatched a Party of 500 Men, who took the Cattle, but the Enemy got off.</p>
            <p>The 12th we received Orders to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark on board our Ships again.</p>
            <p>The 13th we had Orders to land; ſo we fell down the River in the Ships and Boats till we came a little above the Town, where the Enemy leaſt ſuſpected us (for where the Enemy thought we ſhould have landed, they had about 600 Horſe; but what Number of Foot we could not ſay; we could perceive that they was intrench'd and had 5 Floating-Batteries to intercept our Landing)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:008381_0020_102F437F94C81D38"/>On the 14th we landed, at break of Day, and immediately attacked and rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Enemy, taking Poſſeſſion of a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of 424-Pounders, and one thirteen Inch Mortar, with but an inconſiderable Loſs. We then took Poſt on the Plains of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whither M. <hi>Montcalm</hi> (on hearing that we had landed, for he did not expect us) haſted with his whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (conſiſting of Cavalry as well as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry) to give us Battle; about 9 o'Clock we obſerved the Enemy marching down towards us in three Columns, at 10 they formed their Line of Battle, which was at leaſt ſix deep, having their Flanks cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a thick Wood on each Side, into which they threw above 3000 <hi>Canadians</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> who gauled us much; the Regulars then marched briskly up to us, and gave us their firſt Fire, at about Fifty Yards Diſtance, which we did not return, as it was General <hi>Wolfe</hi>'s expreſs Orders not to fire till they came within twenty Yards of us—They continued firing by Platoons, advancing in a very regular Manner till they came cloſe up to us, and then the Action became general: In about a Quarter of an Hour the Enemy gave

The Enemy loſt in the Engagement, Lieut. Gen. <hi>Montcalm,</hi> (who was torn to Pieces by our Grape-Shot) 2 Brigadier-Generals; one Colonel; 2 Lieutenant-Colonels; and at leaſt 1300 Officers and Men kill'd, and 200 taken Priſoners at their very Sally-Ports, of which 58 were Officers:—On our Side was killed the brave and never to be forgotten Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral WOLFE; with 9 Officers, 4 Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants and 44 Privates; wounded, Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier-General <hi>Monckton</hi>; Colonel <hi>Carlton,</hi> Quarter-Maſter-General; Major <hi>Barre,</hi> Adjutant-General; and 50 other Officers, with 26 Serjeants and 557 Privates.—This Action was the more glorious, as the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy were at leaſt 12,000 ſtrong, beſides 500 Horſe; whereas we, at the utmoſt, did not conſiſt of above 3500, ſome of whom did not engage;—for at the Time of the Engagement Colonel <hi>Scott</hi> was out burning the Country with 1600 Men; Col. <hi>Burton</hi> was at Point-<hi>Levee</hi> with 2000

            <p>At Ten o'Clock at Night we ſurpriz'd their Guard and took Poſſeſſion of their Grand Hoſpital, wherein we found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 12 and 1500 Sick and Wounded.</p>
            <p>We lay on our Arms all Night, and in the Morning we ſecured the Bridge of Boats which the Enemy had over <hi>Charles</hi> River, and poſſeſſed ourſelves of all the Poſts and Avenues that was or might be of any Conſequence leading to the Town<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and broke Ground at 100 Yards Diſtance from the Walls; we likewiſe got up 12 heavy 24-Pounders; ſix heavy Twelve-Pounders, ſome large Mortars, and the 4 8-inch Hauitzers, to play upon the Town, and we had been employed three Days, intending to make a Breach, and ſtorm the City Sword in Hand, but we were prevented by their beating a Parley, and ſending out a Flag of Truce with Articles of Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and the next Day, being the 17th of <hi>September,</hi> we took Poſſeſſion of the City, where we found 250 Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, a Number of Mortars, from 9 to
