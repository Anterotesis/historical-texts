            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>d well, That <hi>Runto Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munto Plumpismenoi Raperpandico</hi>— What d'ye stare at? This is good <hi>Greek</hi> for ought you know, and contains a Mystery, which shall continue so, unless you Reveal it; and so no more of that. The following <hi>Elionophysalo Fizlical Farce</hi> having fallen into my Hands by a most sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Accident, it seemeth meet unto me that it should, with all due Reverence Kiss yours. Here it lies at your Feet, take it up. Now read the first Act,—Have ye done? What's the matter Man? Have ye got the Gripes? A Plague on your Sower Faces. Bring him a Dram. What have have you to do, had you to do, or ought you to have to do with the <hi>Senate?</hi> You smell a Rat, you say. Be it so. But compose your self, and now Read the second Act,—How d'ye like it, ha? <hi>O Hooo, T'churrrrrrrrrtch,</hi> I can say that as Loud as you can do; and if you'll but leave out these Damnable <hi>R</hi>'s and <hi>T</hi>'s which make it so hard in Pronounciation, and harder in Digestion, I like it better than you do. You don't believe me! and I don't believe in you; and this is a perilous Article in a Mans Belief too; For one who dy'd a very good <hi>Christian,</hi> was sentenc'd by your

Sanctity to be bury'd a <hi>Pagan,</hi> only because he seem'd to believe that you were some-what Thick of believing; yet you are a Christian, a very good Christian,</p>
            <l>So was your Leader, Major <hi>Weere,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Burnt for Bu—ry, God be here.</l>
            <p>He had a good Gift of the Gob too: You were bred up in the same Accademy, the same Principles, and the same way of Worship: All the Difference between you lies in this nice point, He Worship't the Dev'l in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of God, and you worship God as if he were the Dev'l. Come to't again, first take two Turns cross the Room, Cross-ways, I say, Wipe the Sweat from your Brows, and sit down. Now read the Third Act, I'll sing the while,</p>
            <l>It is an Old Maxim, et c'est Escrit,</l>
            <l>Au trou de mon cul, look there you'll sie't,</l>
            <l>When the Head is Be—ck't the Body's Beshit,</l>
            <l>Which no Body dare Deny, Deny,</l>
            <l>Which no Body dare Deny.</l>
            <p>Read on, and be hang'd, don't mind me, Man, I sing for my own Diversion.</p>
            <l>But 'tis strange how Notions are chang'd of late,</l>
            <l>For 'tis a New Maxim, but odd one, That</l>
            <l>Ce que pend a nos culs doit nous garnir latete,</l>
            <l>That I flatly and boldly Deny, Deny,</l>

            <p>What is the Matter now? Is he Dead? or is't a Qualm? Holo, a Hay! Who waits there? some burn't Feathers, <hi>Sal Armoniack?</hi> No, No, Let him smell to the Skirt of his own Garment. So, he Recovers Poor <hi>Fiz!</hi> who could have thought that you were so quick of Smelling! Come, Man, take Courage; What have You or I to do with it? Let the Gall'd Horse wince,

our Withers are unwrung. But tell me, will you be quiet for the Future? You shall be paid for't, nay, you have been paid for't; and it is hard that Men must be Brib'd for Not doing what they ought Not to do. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member an Odd Fellow upon <hi>Pont Neuf</hi> who got his Livelihood by as Odd a Stratagem; He procur'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a Portable Forge and Bellows, which he carried under his Cloak, and having heated a small Iron red hot, he would lug it out and present it to the Gentlemen who pass'd that way, with this Complement, <hi>Good Sir! Pray Sir! give me leave to run my hot Iron into your Arse.</hi> When the Gentleman started at the Extravagance and Danger of the Motion, he continued, <hi>Nay, Sir, if you don't like it, pay me but a Sol Marquee for the heating of my Iron, and there is no harm d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Now, I know that it is not an easie matter for you to get rid of your Forge and Bellows, but can't you blow your Bellows and heat your Iron at home, and quit that unaccountable Rage of Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into your honest quiet Neighbours Arses, who pay you amply, and meerly for Forbearance?

I found in my reading, That Man was composed of three parts, <hi>Body, Soul</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that the two first were entirely ingross'd by two Societys, so I Resolv'd to Exercize my poor Talent upon the Infirmitys of the last, not with any hopes or intention to Cure them, but as others do, meerly to raise my self a Maintenance out of them, here under your Honors happy Auspeces. But, Lo, here they come, Retire to a Corner. If I am seen in your Company, my Project is spoyl'd.</p>

                     <p>Gentlemen, The ill Measures that have been taken, and the Foundation that hath been laid within this Tenement, to make the Tenants thereof, Tenants therein, is the Cause which causeth me to make this Speech. Our Grievances being innumerable, I shall Enumerate them. The first I shall mention, is this, That tho' the Tenement be large, the Mansions many, and the Inhabitants Numerous, There is but One Kitchin, and one Cellar, by which means we are kept from Eating and drinking What we please, When we please, and as Much as we please, which is our Birth-Right Priviledge by the Laws of God and Nature, settled upon us by Act of Parliament; for which cause I humbly <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Wheter it may not be

                            rendition="simple:additions"/>
more Convenient that each Mansion have its proper Kitchin and Cellar under the special Direction of the respective Tenants?</p>
                     <p>To clear up the Necessity of this Method, I'll tell you what happ'ned to me t'other day; One of the Servants of this House, who brought me a Mess of Water Gruel, being my special Friend, and knowing how eagerly my Stomach stood towards what was forbidden me by the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians, conveys a Hand of Pork into the Porrige, but being discover'd he was punisht, tho' he offer'd to take his Corporal Oath, That the Hand of Pork was a bunch of Radishes. But of all others, we of the East End of the Tenement suffer most, for by reason of our distance from the Kitchin, our Porrige is cold before it comes to our Hands. To Remedy this, we fell upon a private Intercourse with the <hi>Bethlemites</hi> on the other side of <hi>Moor-fields,</hi> who by virtue of their Charter run at large, by which we broke the Laws pretty Comfortably for a season; but these same subtle Fellows of the Kitchin found it out, and put a stop to't, to the Great Prejudice of the Freedom of the Subject, and the direct Discouragement of our indirect Commerce. I Remember we once Address'd our Superiors, That we might have a Servant of our own, independent of this Plaguey <hi>Keeper</hi>; They were Graciously pleas'd to allow us such a one, with this Restriction only, That the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant aforesaid might have the Custody of our Straw and Water, but by no means of our Meat and Drink; notwithstanding this, the Keeper will not permit him to take the care and Custody of our Victuals and Drink. What! does<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he think us <hi>Non Corpus Mentlus,</hi> that we do not know the meaning of plain words! But <hi>I</hi> shall Conclude at this time, with this Exhortation, That since it appears plainly, that we of this Tenement, who are Tenants thereof, are in danger of Being, by the Foundations laid, made Tenants therein, let us not lie Crying thereat, but be Valiant Therefore, and Vindicate our Rights There-from, Our Birth-Right Parliamentary Rights, settled upon us by the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>

                     <p>Mr. Speaker, being Resolv'd to enter my Dissent to these several Resolves, I shall first give my Reasons for so doing. I believe it is needless to put you in mind of our Origine, from whence we sprang, and how we came hither. It is well known that we were of that Number of Publick Spirited Persons, distinguish't from our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by an inward Light or Faculty, call it what you Please. The <hi>Romans</hi> call it <hi>Aestrum,</hi> the <hi>French, Verve,</hi> our Northern Nation has indeed given it a Courser Name, which gave us a strong Disposition toward Reformations, Remonstrations, Resolutions, and other Acts of Zeal; in the eager pursuit of which we were apt to throw our selves, sometimes our Neighbours, into the Fire or Water. The Wisdom of the Times thought fit to Erect this Tenement for our Intertainment, where the Exercize of the Faculty aforesaid might be less Dangerous or hurtful to our selves, or others. Here we are Maintain'd at their Charge with Food and Rayment suitable to our Condition, and the Fabrick kept in Repair at the no small Annual Expences of our Land-Lords. And what Returns do we make? Have not many of us from our private Cells thrown our Filth and Ordure in their Faces? And now in a Collective Body we are about to throw more filthy Resolves at them.</p>

Do you but when he appears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have your selves as if he were Invisible, and take no maner of Notice of what he shall say or do, and I'll answer for the rest. Here he comes, mind him not.</p>
