            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>IN his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth—To day, if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts, as in the Provocation, and in the day of Temptation in the Wilderneſs.</p>

            <p>REASON or Thought is that excellent Power in Man, by which he is nearly ally'd to the Angelick World, and advanc'd above the Level of ſenſitive Beings here below. 'Tis one eſſential Character of the Divine Image in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamp'd on Man at his Creation: and as the regular Exerciſe of this noble Power is one of the brighteſt Ornaments of Humanity, ſo the higheſt and beſt <hi>Object</hi> of our Knowlege and Contemplation is the Bleſſed GOD, whom to know is Life eternal. But then as the Glory of GOD is very conſpicuouſly diſplay'd in the things which his Hand hath formed; ſo his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> with the greateſt Juſtice, challenge a Room in our Thoughts, and demand our deliberate Attention to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:002874_0005_0FE6802DD1BBFE48"/>AS the Works of Nature &amp; Grace, ſo the Works of Providence, are to be ſeriouſly conſider'd by us, if we would ſhew our ſelves Men. <hi>Who is wiſe, and he will obſerve theſe Things: Prudent, and he ſhall know them?</hi> The Works of the Lord are great; ſought out of all Them that have Pleaſure therein. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber then that thou magnify his Works which Men behold. To conſider them indeed in their Eſſence and natural Cauſes &amp; Properties, is not ſo much the Buſineſs of the Chriſtian, as the Philoſopher. But the ſame things which are the Subjects of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> do under different Reſpects, as they are referred to their Efficient, and Final Cauſe, alſo come into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in <hi>Divinity.</hi> — Hence the Scriptures do every where lead us into Contemplations on the Works of Nature, and various <hi>Phaenomena</hi> or Events that come to paſs in the World, <hi>as the Works of GOD;</hi> whoſe <q>Efficiency runs thro' &amp; influences all Second Cauſes, and enters into every Effect; preſerves the Being and Powers of all the Creatures, and directs all their motions thorow all and above all their next inferiour Ends, to GOD himſelf as the laſt End of all.</q>
               <hi>Of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all Things; to Whom be Glory for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Doctrine of a Divine Providence, whereby the vaſt Variety of Creatures and Things in the Univerſe, are powerfully upheld in their Exiſtence, Operation, and beautiful Order, and wiſely directed to the ſeveral Ends and Uſes they were made for; is one of the firſt Dictates of Reaſon, &amp; abundantly confirm'd by Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which teaches us the unlimited Extent of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Providence, unfolds many Myſteries in the Divine Conduct, and ſhews us infinite Perfections &amp; Beauties ſhining in the Works of GOD: — Calls us to Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Praiſe, and teaches us to acknowlege GOD in every Appearance and Event, and to conſider the Operations of his Hand, with a ſutable Application to our ſelves, and Improvement to the Ends of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; ſo as not only to ſee the Name of GOD written upon every Diſpenſation of Providence, but alſo to hear
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002874_0006_0FE6802DEFE978F0"/>
his Voice, comport with his wiſe Deſigns, and engage our Hearts in the Love, Fear, and Service of Him, who is over all GOD bleſſed for evermore.</p>
            <p>THIS Obſervation is but agreable to the Scope of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> before us; where the devout <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſtirs up himſelf and others to praiſe GOD, with a holy Joy and humble Awe, from an affecting Senſe of his infinite Greatneſs and Goodneſs, and of their ſpecial Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Relation to him as a peculiar People: And he calls upon his Nation to live as well as ſpeak the Praiſes of GOD, to lend an obedient Ear to his Voice, without which all their Songs of Praiſe would be but an Abomination to Him, an empty Sound yea lothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Flattery. And he preſſes them to an <hi>inſtant</hi> Compliance: <hi>To day if ye will hear his Voice.</hi> —Some take it as a wiſh, O that you would hear his Voice, and be obedient, without delay! And no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>harden your hearts,</hi> as they of old in the <hi>Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and day of Temptation,</hi> leſt you provoke GOD to deſtroy you by awful Judgments, even as He did them, whoſe Carcaſes fell in the Wilderneſs, &amp; to whom He ſware, they ſhould not enter into his Reſt: So they could not enter in becauſe of Unbelief. They were a rebellious and ſtiffnecked Generation; full of Infidelity, Murmuring, and Diſobedience. They ſaw the Works of GOD, both his Miracles of Mercy and of Judgment; and yet they were not to be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by theſe things. Neither the Goodneſs of GOD in the moſt eminent Deliverances, nor his Severity in tremendous Judgments, whether on their Enemies, or on ſome among themſelves, wou'd prevail to lead them to Repentance. Particularly when <hi>Korah</hi> and his Company were for their Murmurings deſtroy'd ſuddenly by an Earthquake, and devouring Fire, though the Remnant of the People were <hi>affrighted</hi> for the preſent, and <hi>fled</hi> at the Shrieks of their ſinking Friends, ſaying, Leſt the Earth ſwallow us up alſo: Nevertheleſs after Peace was ſpoken to them, we find them the very next day returned unto Folly, and acting over the ſame Perverſeneſs and Unbelief, which
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002874_0007_0FE6802F181F23F0"/>
their Companions had ſo awfully periſh'd for. Numb. 16.41. <hi>But on the Morrow all the Congregation of the Children of Iſrael murmur'd</hi> again. Tho' they had ſeen ſo many fall before them, yet they wou'd not take warning: Tho' GOD had ſignaliſed his Goodneſs and Patience in reprieving them from deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Perdition, yet they repented not to give Him Glory; but turned his Grace into Wantonneſs, and after their Hardneſs and impenitent Hearts treaſured up unto themſelves Wrath; ſo that the Plague brake in upon them, and GOD wou'd have conſum'd them all as in a Moment, had not <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> fallen on their Faces, and quickly made an Atonement for them.</p>
            <p>NOW theſe Things were written for our Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence the Apoſtle writing to the Chriſtian <hi>Hebrews,</hi> makes uſe of the awful Example of <hi>Iſrael's</hi> Fall in the Wilderneſs, as a loud Caution to them. Heb. 3.7, &amp;c. <hi>Wherefore as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, To Day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts, as in the Provocation. — Take Heed, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, leſt there be in any of you an evil Heart of Unbelief,. in departing from the living God.</hi> And in the 15th Verſe, he reſumes the <hi>Quotation</hi> he had made (which you obſerve is from our <hi>Text</hi>) and he brings home the Words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Application, to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> he was writing to; as if that Scripture was of equal Concern to the preſent Generation, as to former Ages. And in the 4th <hi>Chapter</hi> he repeats the Words again, and warns the Chriſtian Hebrews to <hi>labour leſt any Man fall after the ſame Example of Unbelief.</hi> GOD'S Wrath will as ſoon flame out againſt impenitent <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as againſt Unbelieving <hi>Jews;</hi> againſt the <hi>preſent,</hi> as well as againſt any former Generation of his People; againſt his People in <hi>Canaan,</hi> as well as againſt his People in the <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HENCE then the Admonition in the Text belongs to <hi>Us</hi> in theſe Days, as much as to thoſe of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt's or the Apoſtle's Times. And O that the Counſel here given may be acceptable to this People
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002874_0008_0FE6802F3B054890"/>
of GOD! That we may be prevail'd with to give a ſpeedy Attention to the Call of our GOD, whoſe Voice has been crying to the City and Land in a Variety of awful Providences; and particularly in the late ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing <hi>Earthquake,</hi> which ſpread a ſudden and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Terror among us! — In a moſt calm ſerene Night, juſt as we were compoſing our ſelves to Reſt, a dreadful Sound ſtruck our Ears, the Earth trembled and our Houſes ſhook in a fearful manner. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>It was on the <hi>Night</hi> after the Lord's Day (<hi>Octob.</hi> 29.) a little more than half an hour paſt <hi>Ten,</hi> that the firſt and great Shake was felt: — when the Heavens were moſt ſerene, the Atmoſphere in a perfect Calm, and there had been no generally obſerved Preſages of any ſuch Event.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay, Before they were ſenſible of the Shock, they ſaw <hi>Flaſhes</hi> of Light glance by their Windows, and others obſerv'd their Dogs give a ſudden bark, as when affrighted. But before any cou'd look about them, to know the meaning of theſe things, they heard firſt a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Murmur, like a ſmall ruffling Wind, and then a more noiſy Rumbling, as of Thunder at ſome Diſtance: which ſeem'd to approach nigher, and grew louder, till it roared terribly; and then we felt our Houſes totter and reel, with the tremulous Motion and Heaving of the Earth, as if they wou'd tumble down into Ruins.</p>
                  <p>It's tho't the <hi>greatest</hi> Earthquake this Country ever knew. Had the firſt Concuſſion laſted a few Minutes longer, or been repeated often with equal Force, it's probable much Damage had been done: But by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of GOD, the Violence was ſoon over (I believe it ſcarce exceeded a <hi>Minute &amp; half</hi>) and they were but feebler Shakings, that follow'd, the ſame Night; or that have in ſome Places ſince been perceived: For ſeveral Towns to the <hi>Northward</hi> have, for ſome Weeks now, been ſcarce a Day free from the rumbling Noiſe, &amp; fainter Shocks.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Extent</hi> of the Earthquake, it's beyond what has been common. We are already inform'd, it reach'd <hi>Five Hundred</hi> Miles. And the Time of the firſt Shock ſeems to have been in all parts with little or no obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Variation — So that the inflamed Damp, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous Fermentation, which was the Principle of this great Earthquake, muſt needs be emphatically in <hi>the deep Places of the Earth;</hi> and there appears a marvellous Hand of the <hi>ALMIGHTY</hi> in it.</p>
               </note> Verily
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002874_0009_0FE6803605D8D768"/>
               <hi>it is a Night to be much obſerv'd</hi> and remembred, for the uncommon Terror, and the great Deliverance. And ſurely it can't be forgotten, at leaſt while the Repetition of the doleful <hi>Murmurs</hi> &amp; <hi>Shakes</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, as we hear it is yet in divers Places. Laſt <hi>Lord's Day</hi> Evening it is ſaid ſeveral Towns were ſurpriſed with the roaring Noiſe.</p>
            <p>UPON this extraordinary Occaſion you have doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs all of you already heard proper Leſſons and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions from the Pulpit. Yet <hi>I think it meet to ſtir you up, by putting you in Remembrance;</hi> and hope it will be a word in Seaſon, eſpecially ſince it is as it were an Addreſs to the whole Province together, in our honorable <hi>Rulers,</hi> and <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> met at this time in a new Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>AND I beſeech you, Brethren, ſuffer the Word of Exhortation, which ſpeaks to you in the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> Language; The LORD is a great GOD, and a great King above all Gods: <hi>In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth,— To day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts as in the Provocation, and in the Day of Temptation in the Wilderneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the Words we have firſt a Propoſition laid down, <hi>In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth.</hi> And then an Exhortation leading us into a proper Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of that general Truth, <hi>To day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts.</hi> Which is enforced by the awful Conſideration of the Fall and Deſtruction of the unbelieving <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> who tempted and provoked the moſt high GOD, ſo that He was wroth with his Inheritance, and abhorred his People.</p>
            <p>IN diſcourſing on the Text, I ſhall proceed in the Order &amp; Method of the Pſalmiſt: <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall ſay ſomething to illuſtrate the <hi>Truth</hi> he aſſerts here: <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall inculcate the <hi>Duty</hi> he exhorts to. And finally preſs the <hi>Motive</hi> taken from the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that ſinned and fell in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:002874_0010_0FE680362403C9A0"/>I ſhall begin with the Pſalmiſt's Pro poſition, which you may take for the <hi>Doctrine</hi> or Ground of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IN the</hi> LORD'S <hi>Hand are the deep Places of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Meaning is, That the whole Earth is the LORD'S, and even from it's Centre, and in all it's Parts, is ſupported and govern'd by a Divine Power and Influence. GOD has the Propriety, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of all.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) HE has a <hi>Propriety</hi> every where, and even the deep Places of the Earth are his Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>THIS appears the Meaning in part from what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; <hi>The Strength of the Hills is</hi> HIS <hi>alſo; The Sea is</hi> HIS, <hi>and He made it; and his Hands formed the dry Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT was GOD that originally gave Being to the Earth; 'Twas the Product of his mighty Power, the Contrivance of his Wiſdom, and Efflux of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The holy Scriptures every where aſcribe the Creation of the Earth to GOD, and mention it in many elegant &amp; lofty Deſcriptions of the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Sovereign of all Things, as a marvellous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of his adorable Perfections; a glorious Piece of divine Workmanſhip <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102 35 &amp; 104.5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51 15.</note>. Yea we find the Almighty challenging it as his peculiar Glory <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Iſa</hi> 44 24. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48 12, 13. <hi>Job</hi> 38 4,-7.</note>.</p>
            <p>NOW therefore, if GOD created the Earth, He muſt needs have an indiſputable Right of Propriety in it. Hence the Scriptures do frequently aſſert his Title. Thus, Deut. 10.14. <hi>Behold, the Heaven and the Heaven of Heavens is the Lord's thy God, the Earth alſo with all that therein is.</hi> Pſal. 24.1. <hi>The Earth is the Lord's, and the fulneſs thereof; the World, and they that dwell therein.</hi> And ſo our Text, In his hand are the deep Places of the Earth: the ſubterraneous Springs and Mines; the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002874_0011_0FE680384A1CE1E8"/>
abundance of the Sea, and the Treaſures hid in the Sand. Yea He tells us, Job 41.11. <hi>Whatſoever is under the whole Heaven is mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INDEED it is ſaid, GOD <hi>hath given the Earth to the Children of Men:</hi> but it means only, That he has lent or let it out to them: Given it them for a Poſſeſſion to occupy for the preſent. We are but Tenants: He is the Landlord, and has reſerv'd to Himſelf the whole Property. Even our very Houſes, with all their Furniture, and our Lands, with all the Improvements upon them; all the Produce upon the Surface, and all the Riches within the Bowels of the Earth, are the LORD'S. All the Ends of the Earth, and all the ſecret Places of it; even the Regions that are out of all human Sight and Reach, They and their rich Contents are His: Not only under his Eye, but in his Hand, poſſeſſed by him as much as any other parts of the World.</p>
            <p>THIS ſhows the <hi>unſearchable Riches</hi> &amp; <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of GOD. Agreably the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>Great is the Lord:</hi> In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth. Surely none of the great Men of the Earth, that truſt in their Wealth, and boaſt themſelves in the Multitude of their Riches, can vie with GOD. However large their Poſſeſſions, tho' they have added Houſe to Houſe, and Field to Field, and extended their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes or Conqueſts ſo far that they ſeem to be placed almoſt alone in the Earth; yet they cannot compate with GOD: for He is Lord of the <hi>whole</hi> Earth; the utmoſt parts of the Earth, and the deep places of it, are his Poſſeſſion; while the Richeſt of Men poſſeſs only ſome ſmall ſpots of the upper <hi>Strata.</hi> Let this Reflection teach Men Humility.—And let it teach us to admire the <hi>Condeſcenſion</hi> of GOD in accepting the Alms &amp; Devotions of his People. 1 Chron. 29.14. <hi>But who am I, and what is my people, that we ſhould be able to offer ſo willingly after this ſort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</hi> Surely He is not miniſtred to by Men's Hands, as tho' He needed any thing, ſeeing that He is Lord
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002874_0012_0FE6803869C129C8"/>
of Heaven and Earth. Hence He put a ſlight upon the legal Sacrifices, in thoſe Terms, Pſal. 50.12. <hi>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the World is mine, and the fulneſs thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, THIS teaches us the <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> of Them that have an Intereſt in the LORD as their GOD! Behold, Happy is the Man whoſe Hope is in the Lord. They that have Him for their Portion may be ſaid to poſſeſs all Things: Things preſent and Things to come, all are theirs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. Hence Pſal. 89.11, 12, 15. <hi>The Heavens are thine, the Earth alſo is thine: as for the World, and the fulneſs thereof, thou haſt founded them. The North and the South thou haſt created them: Tabor and Hermon ſhall rejoyce in thy name. Bleſſed are the People that know the joyful ſound: they ſhall walk, O Lord in the light of thy Countenance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, THIS Reflection affords a Motive to <hi>Obedience;</hi> becauſe GOD is able out of his rich Stores abundantly to reward us. Exod. 19.5. <hi>Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my Covenant, then ye ſhall be a peculiar Treaſure unto me above all People: for all the Earth is mine.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly it is a ſtrong Incentive to Charity &amp; Bounty, in all thoſe Inſtances which GOD requires of us. For all the Store that we have prepared cometh of his Hand, and is all his own. He juſtly therefore expects that we honour Him with our Subſtance: and in ſpecial by willingly expending upon pious and charitable Uſes, the Proportions which he hath out of our Eſtates and Incomes ſeparated to ſuch Ends. We are ſolemnly charged to give, every Man as he is able, according as GOD hath proſpered him <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2</note>. And if we withhold more than is meet, He charges us with Stealth and Injuſtice. Mal. 3.8. <hi>Will a Man rob God? yet ye have robbed me: but ye ſay, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes &amp; offerings.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we wou'd not incur the Guilt of Injuſtice, as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002874_0013_0FE6803FA38A9648"/>
well as Ingratitude, let us ſee to it that we be ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate. To do Good and to communicate, forget not: for with ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices GOD is well pleaſed. Render to all their dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Honour to whom Honour, Charity to whom Charity. Bring ye <hi>all the Tithes</hi> into GOD'S Store-houſe, and prove me now herewith, ſaith the Lord, if I will not pour you out a Bleſſing, ſo that your Barns ſhall be filled with Plenty, and ye ſhall dwell in a delightſome Land, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the moſt High GOD, Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>I paſs now to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) ANOTHER Thing imply'd may be, That GOD <hi>Upholds</hi> the Earth in it's Being, and continues it's ſeveral Virtues, Riches and Ornaments.</p>
            <p>THE Earth, and all it's deep Places, He holds in his Hand, and keeps from Deſolation. Should He withdraw His ſuſtaining Influence but for a moment, the Earth wou'd immediately return to it's primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chaos, or relapſe into Nothing. By his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty <hi>Fiat</hi> the Earth, with it's immenſe Stores and Treaſures, ſtarted into Being; and He upholds all Things by the ſame Word of his Strength. No Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has a Power of Self-preſervation; nor can one preſerve another: but all depend upon the Firſt Cauſe, and equal is the Efficiency of the Almighty, in the Suſtentation of the Earth, as in it's original Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>THE upholding and preſerving of this viſible World is every where in holy Scripture declar'd the Work of his omnipotent Arm, and celebrated as one of the high Glories of infinite Majeſty. Jer. 51.15. <hi>He hath made the Earth by his Power; He hath eſtabliſhed the World by his Wiſdom.</hi>— When He had created the Earth, He fixed this vaſt Globe on it's Centre, and ſettled the Orders and Uſes of all Things therein. Hence we read, Pſal, 104.5. <hi>Who laid the Foundations of the Earth,</hi> or as it is in the Margin,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002874_0014_0FE6803FC62C3EF8"/>
Hath founded the Earth upon her Baſes. This vaſt Terraqueous Globe has no viſible Foundations to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, no Pillars to reſt upon, nor Axletree on which it hangs; but is ſuſpended in the Air, pois'd with it's own weight, we know not how. A Myſtery this is, celebrated by all Philoſophers as one of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutable <hi>Arcana</hi> of Nature, and the Reſult of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power &amp; Wiſdom. <hi>Job</hi> mentions it with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Chap. 26.7. <hi>He ſtretcheth out the North over the empty Place, and hangeth the Earth upon No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> When GOD ſpake to <hi>Job</hi> out of the Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, among other Challenges, He made that, Chap. 38.5, 6. <hi>Who hath laid the meaſures thereof, if thou knoweſt? or who hath ſtretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the Foundations thereof faſtned? or who hath laid the Corner-ſtone thereof?</hi> "The vaſt Bulk of the Earth is model'd as regularly as if it had been done by Line and Meaſure": And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to this Day the ſame Figure &amp; Dimenſions that it had at firſt; continued by the Power of GOD, who <hi>laid the Corner-ſtone</hi> thereof, which preſerves the Parts of it in a juſt Conſiſtence, and ſaves them from crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling into Confuſion. And He alſo <hi>faſten'd the Foundations,</hi> ſo that this prodigious Weight has kept thro' many Ages it's primitive Situation, which gives it ſtill the Advantage of the Atmoſphere, and the heavenly Orbs round about it. This is the Work of GOD. <hi>His ſtrength ſetteth faſt the Mountains,</hi> and He is the Confidence of all the Ends of the Earth. He comprehendeth the Duſt of the Ground in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and weigheth the Hills in a Balance. He viſits the dark Caverns of the Earth, and preſerves it's Bowels from guſhing out. He guards the Earth from the Violence of the Sea, and continues the ancient Diviſion of the Waters from the dry Land. He ſets Bars to the Ocean, and holds the mighty Abyſs in the Hollow of his Hand. He poiſes this terraqueous Globe ſo equally on every ſide; maintains a juſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Elements, and the convenient Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſolid and fluid Bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002874_0015_0FE68042706FD760"/>HE alſo preſerves the different <hi>Natures</hi> of Things, their eſſential Qualities, and original Inſtincts, or Tendencies to the various Ends &amp; Uſes they were adapted and deſign'd for. The Laws of <hi>Gravitation</hi> and <hi>Magnetiſm,</hi> and the Law of <hi>Inſtinct,</hi> thoſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Contrivances of His infinite Wiſdom, are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in the Word by his Almighty Hand; by which Means the ſeveral Parts of the Earth afford their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Productions for the Support &amp; Service of it's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, in their innumerable Species, and with a moſt ſurpriſing Harmony all Things conſpire to ſerve the particular Purpoſes they were made for, which terminate in the Benefit of the Univerſe and Glory of the Creator. Well may we make thoſe Reflections, with the devout Pſalmiſt <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 104.24.—119.90, 91.—74.16.17.</note>, <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy Works! In Wiſdom haſt Thou made them all: The Earth is full of thy Riches; ſo is the great and wide Sea: wherein are Creatures innumerable. Theſe wait all upon Thee. Thou preſerveſt Man and Beaſt. Thy Faithfulneſs is unto all Generations: Thou haſt eſtabliſhed the Earth, and it abideth. They continue this Day according to thine Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for all are thy Servants.

            </p>
            <p>O let us ſtand up and bleſs the Lord our GOD for ever and ever; whoſe glorious Name is exalted above all Bleſſing and Praiſe. And let all the Earth fear the Lord: let all the Inhabitants of the World ſtand in Awe of Him: for <hi>He ſpake, and it was made: He commanded, and it ſtood faſt</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal 33.8.</note>.</p>
            <p>In a word, LET the People of GOD improve this Conſideration to confirm their Faith, and invigorate their Hope in the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> that it ſhall ſtand faſt for ever, even as the Covenant of Nature. So GOD himſelf has taught his People to reflect and argue, Jer. 31.35, 36, 37. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, which giveth the Sun for a light by day, and the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002874_0016_0FE6804295E60888"/>
ordinances of the Moon and of the Stars for a light by night; which divideth the Sea when the Waves thereof rore; the Lord of hoſts is his name. If thoſe ordinances depart from before me, ſaith the Lord, then the ſeed of Iſrael alſo ſhall depart from being a Nation before me forever. Thus ſaith the Lord, If Heaven above can be meaſured, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Earth ſearched, out beneath, I will alſo caſt off all the ſeed of Iſrael, for all that they have done, ſaith the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.20, 21, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>IT may be added now in the laſt place,</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) GOD not only preſerves, but alſo <hi>governs</hi> the Earth, and all Things that are therein.</p>
            <p>THIS Act is imply'd in the former, and the Right of Dominion is juſtly founded thereon. Neh. 9.6. <hi>Thou, even Thou art Lord alone: Thou haſt made the Heaven, Earth &amp; Seas, and all that is therein; and Thou preſerveſt them all.</hi>— So the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The Lord is a great God, a great King above all gods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Government is in his Hand; His right Hand, and his holy Arm governs the Wheels of univerſal Nature. In his Hand is Power &amp; Might, and He reigneth over all. Heaven is his Throne, and the Earth his Foot-ſtool.</p>
            <p>HE governs the <hi>Rational</hi> World; doth what He pleaſeth among the Armies of Heaven above, and amongſt the Inhabitants of the Earth below. The Kingdom is the Lord's, and He is the Governor among the Nations. In his Hand it is to make great, or bring low; to make rich, or poor. The Lord is the Judge: He putteth down one, and ſetteth up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the Pillars of the Earth are the Lord's, and He hath ſet the World upon them. He governs in all Societies, and rules over all Individuals; reſtraining, guiding, puniſhing, or bleſſing, as He pleaſeth. He ruleth by his Power for ever: His Eyes behold the Nations: let not the Rebellious exalt themſelves. But rejoyce in the Lord ye Righteous. The Lord
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002874_0017_0FE6801DDD7F48E8"/>
reigneth: GOD is my King of old, working Salvation in the midſt of the Earth.</p>
            <p>HE alſo preſides over the <hi>Natural</hi> World. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends his Care and Influence to all his Creatures, both ſmall and great. None are ſo little as to eſcape his Notice: Nor any too big for Him to manage. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Lord pleaſeth,</hi> that doth He in <hi>Heaven</hi> and in <hi>Earth,</hi> in the <hi>Seas</hi> &amp; <hi>all deep Places,</hi> Pſal. 135.6. Nature is not left to govern it ſelf; is not reſign'd to the wild Steerage of blind Chance: But GOD ſitteth upon the Circle of the Earth, as a wiſe &amp; powerful Director, influencing all natural Cauſes, and diſpoſing all Effects &amp; Accidents, Periods, Revolutions, and Succeſſions of Things.</p>
            <p>THE glorious Orbs of <hi>Light,</hi> that roll over our Heads, are preſerv'd by Him in their Beauty &amp; Order, and directed by Him in all their Motions and Effects. The <hi>Earth</hi> alſo under our Feet, and the <hi>Air</hi> we breathe in, are under his abſolute Dominion.</p>
            <p>HE made the Elements, and He governs them: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects their natural Powers, and orders all their Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences &amp; Operations; ſuſpending, or enlarging, as He will. Men are indeed ſometimes apt to imagin, that the Elementary World is under no Direction, that a wild Looſe is given to natural Cauſes, and that they act with an unbounded Liberty. But verily in the midſt of all the Confuſion and Impetuoſity that is ſeen at any time, GOD inſpects, reſtrains, and over-rules, to make every thing ſubſerve his own bleſſed Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Hence that of the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 148.7, 8. <hi>Praiſe the Lord from the Earth, ye Dragons and all Deeps, Fire &amp; Hail, Snow &amp; Vapour, and ſtormy Wind, fulfilling his Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the Depths as well as Heights, GOD ſhews his Power and Dominion. He ſendeth forth his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment upon Earth; His Word runneth very ſwiftly <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:002874_0018_0FE6804993652238"/>THIS earthly Globe is continually paſſing under <hi>Changes</hi> and Revolutions. There are perpetual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves &amp; Alterations, Increaſes &amp; Decays, viſible on the Face of the Earth; and doubtleſs the like in it's interiour Parts. There is a kind of Circulation among natural Principles; a Revolution of the Elements. Thus the terreſtial Matter waſh'd off the Earth by Floods, is a great part of it exhal'd up into the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere with the daily aſcending Vapours, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the Ground by Rain, Snow &amp; Hail.

            <p>THE ſmall Fiſſures &amp; wider Cavities in the low Places of the Earth, as well as the high Hills and rocky Mountains, appear the Work of Counſel, and are of indiſpenſable Uſe to the World.

            <p>IN a word, All the <hi>Seaſons</hi> of the Year, and the ſeveral Circumſtances of them, are very much govern'd by the ſubterraneous Regions. Our Wealth and the valuable Comforts of Life, are moſtly of a ſubterranea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean Extract. <hi>Job</hi> obſerves not only that <hi>Iron</hi> is taken out of the Earth, &amp; there are the Veins of <hi>Silver</hi> &amp; <hi>Gold:</hi> But he adds, As for the Earth, <hi>Out of it cometh</hi> BREAD. The vegetable Productions of Nature, the orderly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of Seed-time &amp; Harveſt, Cold and Heat, in their due Seaſon, and in a juſt Proportion, depend very much upon a regular State of Things in the Mineral

Kingdom, and dark Retreats of the Earth below us.</p>
            <p>WHAT follows then, if in GOD'S Hand be the <hi>deep Places</hi> of the Earth, but that He muſt be the ſupreme Moderator and Diſpoſer of this univerſal Globe! And conſequently we learn from our Text theſe <hi>two</hi> important Leſſons:</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>THAT GOD muſt have the</hi> Praiſe <hi>of all the</hi> beneficial <hi>&amp;</hi> beautiful <hi>Appearances in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND then,</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>THAT in all</hi> terrible <hi>&amp;</hi> evil <hi>Events, we muſt ſee his Hand, and acknowlege his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AGREABLY the Scriptures every where teach us to conſider GOD as the <hi>Author</hi> of all thoſe <hi>Benefits</hi> and Salvations, which the Earth and it's Inhabitants do experience. They tell us that He is the <hi>Father of Lights</hi> and <hi>Fountain of Living Waters.</hi> He giveth unto all Life and Breath and all Things. He feeds the Fowls of Heaven, which neither ſow nor reap, and he giveth the Beaſt his Food. And He provideth Bread for Man. It is He that proſpers a People in their Trade abroad and Buſineſs at home: makes <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulun</hi> to rejoyce in his goings forth, and <hi>Iſſachar</hi> in his Tents: and giveth them Power to get Wealth; to ſuck of the abundance of the Sea, and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the dry Land. He cauſeth his Sun to riſe, and giveth the Rain in it's Seaſon; making the Ground to yield it's Increaſe, and the Trees their Fruits; and He reſerveth to us the appointed Weeks of the Harveſt. When he uttereth his Voice, there is a multitude of Waters in the Heavens, and He <hi>cauſeth the Vapours to aſcend from the Ends of the Earth:</hi> He maketh Lightnings with Rain, and <hi>bringeth forth the Wind out of his Treaſures,</hi> by which he preſerves our Air from ſtagnating, and prevents the innumerable Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that otherwiſe wou'd be done by poiſonous Steams out of the Earth; and by which alſo He carries our Ships to the deſired Haven. By his Skill &amp; Power
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002874_0021_0FE6804C231BE658"/>
the Depths are broken up, and the Dew &amp; Clouds formed, which gently diſtill to refreſh the thirſty Ground. He cauſeth the Bud of the tender Herb to ſpring forth; maketh the Graſs to grow, filleth the Trees with Sap, and prepareth the Corn; ſo that the Mountains rejoyce, and the little Hills on every ſide; the Valleys break forth into Singing, and all the Fields &amp; Orchards clap their hands for joy. He alſo preſerveth the Fruits of the Faith; gives a ſutable Time for Ingathering, and crowns the Year with his Goodneſs. Thus He governs the <hi>Spring,</hi> and <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and <hi>Autumn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE maketh alſo the <hi>Winter,</hi> and governs all the Affairs and Circumſtances of it. He ſaith to the <hi>Snow,</hi> Be thou on the Earth, and bringeth the <hi>Cold</hi> out of the North. By the Breath of GOD, <hi>Froſt</hi> is given, and the Breadth of the Waters is ſtraitned. He caſteth forth his <hi>Ice</hi> like Morſels; ſcattereth the Hoar-froſt like Aſhes, and giveth Snow like Wool: So He co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth the Earth as with a Garment, to cheriſh the Soyl, that it may give Seed to the Sower, and Bread to the Eater. Moreover, He provides our <hi>Fuel;</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes our <hi>Table,</hi> preſerves our <hi>Health,</hi> and maketh our Garments warm upon us, in this difficult Seaſon of the Year: Elſe who cou'd ſtand before his Cold? In a word, He returns the Heats and Thaws of the <hi>Spring.</hi> He ſendeth out his Commandment, and the frozen Surface of the Ground melts and ſoftens. He quieteth the Earth by the South-Wind: and by the gradual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes of the Day and Advances of the Sun, He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives univerſal Nature, and ſtrips it of it's Winter-Complexion. He ſends forth his Spirit (his warm and animating Breath) and renews the Face of the Earth.</p>
            <p>HENCE then let us give <hi>all the Glory</hi> to GOD, and celebrate his Wiſdom and Power, his Goodneſs and Mercy to us from Year to Year, with Thanksgiving and Praiſe. O how unworthy are we of the leaſt of his Mercies! Yet He crowneth the Year with a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and Plenty of Bleſſings. What but infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs cou'd ſo triumph over the Unworthineſs of ſinful

Creatures; and be kind to the Evil and Unthankful! Verily the Earth is ſatisfied with the Fruit of his Works, and is full of his Riches. All our Senſes preſent us with numerous Inſtances of Divine Goodneſs. We taſte and ſee that the Lord is gracious: Our Ears alſo have heard the Fame thereof. O let us awake up our Glory, to ſing and give Praiſe! Let the Heaven and Earth praiſe the Name of GOD; the Seas alſo, and every thing therein. <hi>O come let us ſing unto the Lord</hi> (ſays the Pſalmiſt in the Context) <hi>let us make a joyful Noiſe to the Rock of our Salvation. Let us come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Preſence with Thanksgiving, and make a joyful Noiſe unto Him with Pſalms. For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods: In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth.</hi> He is our God, and we are the People of his Paſture.</p>
            <p>BUT yet the Lord has not left us <hi>altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed.</hi> He has been correcting us with Stripes from Year to Year: and this Year in a particular manner, He hath been alarming us by a Variety of awful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, which call for our ſolemn Obſervation and Remembrance. Our Text teacheth us to look above natural Cauſes, and aſcribe to a Divine Hand all the evil Accidents which happen in the Earth. The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign GOD controuls and commands all Things here below, ſo as to make them even forget their particular Inſtinct, act contrary to their native Tendency, and deſert their proper Place, according to his abſolute Will and Pleaſure. <hi>Who is a ſtrong Lord,</hi> like unto HIM, whom Fire, and Wind, and Seas obey; who looketh upon the Hills and they tremble! All Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors and Elements are obſequious to Him, who gave Nature it's Laws, and directs it's Motions as He plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. His Way is in the Whirlwind, and in the Storm, in the Thunder and Lightning, in the Flame of Fire, in the ſtifling Damp, and tremendous Earthquake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>— All which, and other Judgments, we have this Year been viſited with. O let us ſee the Hand of GOD lifted up, and tremble at his repeated loud Reproofs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:002874_0023_0FE6805271317D98"/>IN this Town particularly, how has GOD been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to contend by <hi>Fire</hi> once and again! Tho' in his great Mercy He has ſet Bounds to this wild Element, and ſoon extinguiſh'd the threatning Flames.</p>
            <p>IN the Beginning of the Year what uncommon <hi>Colds</hi> &amp; <hi>Sickneſſes</hi> (occaſion'd by noxious Vapours out of the Earth) prevail'd every where: And what a <hi>Mortality</hi> ſince in ſeveral Towns! Tho', bleſſed be GOD! It has been in general a healthy Year.</p>
            <p>WHAT repeated awful Inſtances have we ſeen of very <hi>ſudden Death!</hi> And one GREAT Inſtance, which has put the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions into uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Mourning, by the Bereavement of our late glorious KING; of happy Memory!

            <p>IT has been a Year fill'd with a Variety of ſtrange <hi>Accidents,</hi> and ſurpriſing <hi>Mortalities,</hi> whereby we have been alarm'd from time to time. In particular, becauſe of it's obvious Reference to my preſent Subject, I wou'd mention the awful Inſtance of the fatal <hi>Damp,</hi> by which <hi>two Men</hi> periſh'd almoſt in the ſame Moment in one <hi>Well</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">In Boſton, <hi>July</hi> 19. this ſurpriſing Accident happen'd. The Well had not been open'd for many Years before: and in going down to examin it, the <hi>Maſter</hi> &amp; <hi>Servant</hi> ſucceſſively were both ſmother'd; by ſome mineral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation, or other ſuffocating Vapour, they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd in. And a <hi>Third</hi> eſſaying to follow them, with a Rope laſh'd about him, had not deſcended two Yards before he felt his Breath expiring: but being inſtantly drawn up, he ſoon recovered.— <hi>Surely every Man at his beſt Eſtate is Vanity. LORD, make me to know how frail I am!</hi>

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:002874_0024_0FE6805293BC75B0"/>WHAT an uncommon Summer have we had, for <hi>Heat,</hi> the moſt extreme, and of long Continuance! By which GOD appointed over us Terror, and ſeem'd to intimate his firy Indignation. Yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the extraordinary Drought, which threaten'd us, He hath in his great Goodneſs allow'd us a plentiful Harveſt of many Fruits of the Earth.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, How has the LORD of Hoſts been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uttering his Voice from the Skies in very dreadful Accents of amazing <hi>Thunder,</hi> and ſhooting out his incenſed Arrows from above: Whereby ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral received Damage in their <hi>Subſtance</hi>

And ſome <hi>Perſons</hi> were ſtruck, but I think none given over to Death.</note>; tho' thro' the ſparing Mercy of GOD, no human Life has been loſt.— Once in particular how did He ſet the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens over our Heads on a Blaze, in a moſt unuſual and ſurpriſing manner; bright Streams of Fire darting inceſſantly in every part: So that we tho't we ſaw ſome Reſemblance of the Day of GOD, when the Lord <hi>JESUS</hi> ſhall be reveal'd from Heaven in <hi>flaming</hi> Fire; and many were ſore afraid! His Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings illuminated the World; the <hi>Earth ſaw and trembled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, HE prepared the <hi>Stormy Wind,</hi> and blew upon us with an <hi>horrible Tempeſt.</hi> He ſent forth the Blaſt of his Mouth, and cauſed the Rain of his Strength to come down. So that univerſal Nature ſeem'd to be out of Courſe; the Foundations of the World break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and the Pillars of Heaven falling down. It was a very diſtreſſing Seaſon, both on the Sea &amp; Land. And all the People (as they in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Time) ſat <hi>trembling</hi> for the <hi>great Rain.</hi>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:002874_0025_0FE68054D6F912B0"/>AND in a few Weeks after, GOD has been pleas'd to viſit us in another and more unuſual Form, by EARTHQUAKE, and <hi>great Noiſe,</hi> which may be call'd Subterranean Thunder; a Thunder-Storm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, in <hi>the deep Places of the Earth.</hi> This I ſhall take Notice of with a little more of Enlargement.</p>
            <p>PHILOSOPHY teaches us to ſuppoſe that the Earth is not a perfectly ſolid Body, but has mighty <hi>Caverns</hi> within it, and innumerable leſſer <hi>Veins</hi> and hollow Spaces; where are Fountains of Water, or Treaſures of Winds &amp; Vapours. And the whole Globe is filled with vaſt Stores of Fire and combuſtible Materials. Theſe appear to be the Proviſions in Nature for thoſe terrible Convulſions the Earth is ſometimes thrown into.</p>
            <p>BUT the Lord of Hoſts is the grand EFFICIENT. All the Power and Skill of Men can't produce an Earthquake. It muſt be ſaid of it, <hi>This is the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of GOD.</hi> There have been ſome Inſtances, wherein it's thought phyſical Reaſons have been wanting, and the Commotion of the Earth intirely miraculous, the immediate Effect of a ſupernatural and divine Influence, without any Preparations in Nature: as that at the giving of the Law, when the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended upon <hi>Sinai,</hi> and the whole Mount <hi>quaked greatly.</hi> So thoſe at the Death and Reſurrection of CHRIST; and others mention'd in Scripture.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, doubtleſs in ordinary Caſes at leaſt, there are natural Cauſes of this <hi>Phaenomenon.</hi> But yet the moſt critical Inquirers into Nature are at a loſs how to account for the generating of the Earthquake, and the Operations of it, without aſcribing a great
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002874_0026_0FE68054FA9F37A8"/>
deal to the more immediate Influence of ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Power. Naturaliſts agree in this general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, That the Earthquake is not any regular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature, but a Violence to it, and throws the Earth into a praeternatural State. They confeſs it is contrary to the eſtabliſh'd Laws of the Creation, and reſults from ſome mighty Obſtruction to the ſtated Order and Courſe of Things.—But what that Obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, or what the particular Principle &amp; Ground of it, remains yet an Inquiry that the moſt penetrating Philoſophers are to this Day perplex'd &amp; divided about. Some derive it's Origin from this natural Cauſe, and others from that. One aſcribes it chiefly to that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and another to this. They mutually oppoſe one another's Sentiments: And the moſt that is ſaid upon this myſterious Appearance is but Conjectural.</p>
            <p>IT ſeems truly to be a more immediate Act of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, than moſt other Events. It muſt be look'd upon as a more ſpecial Work of GOD; viſibly out of the Courſe of Nature: produc'd and govern'd by the great Creator, who has all the Wheels of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe under his arbitrary Command. <hi>He gathereth the Wind in his Fiſts; bindeth the Abyſs in a Garment;</hi> reſtraineth the ſubterraneous Fires; and <hi>eſtabliſheth all the Ends of the Earth.</hi> His Eye and Hand reach the profoundeſt Caverns; and his <hi>Footſteps are not known.</hi> If the Lord our GOD did not govern the Elements in our Favour, how wou'd they perſecute a guilty World, by Fire, and Tempeſt, Plague, and Famine! How ſoon wou'd the Heavens diſſolve and fall upon us in Cataracts of Vengeance: And the Earth and Sea combine to deſtroy all their Inhabitants! Why does not the Earth ſink into the mighty <hi>Deep,</hi> on the face of which it is <hi>ſtretched out</hi>

What power viſits one City or Country with the deſolating <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and not another? Verily the ſame DIVINE Power, which in the Days of <hi>Korah</hi> created that <hi>new Thing,</hi> when the Earth

open'd, and Multitudes together went down alive into the Pit.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Order of Nature is ſubverted, the Rule of natural Cauſes violated, and praeternatural Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions happen, all muſt be ultimately reſolv'd into an higher Principle, than any ſecond Cauſes, even the Providence of GOD. When Things move and act either <hi>againſt</hi> or <hi>above</hi> their own Nature, a ſuperior Power is to be acknowleg'd: And in ſome Inſtances eſpecially, the <hi>Earthquake</hi> conſider'd in it's extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Circumſtances and Effects, muſt be aſcribed to the more immediate Hand of GOD, as in a ſenſe his alone Work.— Whatever ſubordinate Means &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments GOD may ſee fit to make uſe of in this ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous Event; yet his terrible Majeſty appears im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed upon it in very peculiar Characters. It has a bright Stamp of Divinity on it's Face; Men behold in it thoſe clear Impreſſes of Divine Power, Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty and Greatneſs, as irreſiſtibly carry up their Eyes to the Firſt Cauſe; and they cannot but appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Inviſible GOD therein diſplaying his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the World.

they ſhall know that I am the LORD.</hi>— The Earthquake that <hi>Elijah</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.11.</note> ſaw, was to ſhew him the Glory and Majeſty of GOD.</p>
            <p>WE may further obſerve,</p>
            <p>AS the Earthquake is an eminent Demonſtration of the Divine Power and Preſence: So it is uſually a Token of <hi>Wrath</hi> kindled againſt a Place for the Wickedneſs of them that dwell therein.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES indeed it has been a Teſtimony of the <hi>gracious</hi> Preſence of GOD with his People, and his Approbation of them. An Inſtance you have, Acts 4.31. <hi>And when they had prayed, the Place was ſhaken where they were aſſembled together; and they were all filled with the holy Ghoſt, and they ſpake the word of God with boldneſs.</hi> So the Earthquake that deſtroy'd <hi>Korah</hi> and his rebel Crew, was a Divine Teſtimony to <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> the Servants of GOD. And that at the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of CHRIST was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, not only as a Signal to give Notice of that great Event, but alſo as a Teſtimony from Heaven to the Majeſty &amp; Glory of his Divine Perſon.—Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Earthquakes have been ſent to work Salvation for the Servants of GOD, by deſtroying their Enemies. The Skies have pour'd down Righteouſneſs; the Earth alſo hath open'd, and brought forth Salvation. When <hi>Joſhua</hi> compaſſed <hi>Jericho,</hi> we are told, at the Sound of the Trumpet, and the Shout of the People, <hi>the Walls</hi> ſuddenly <hi>fell down flat</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002874_0029_0FE6805E82CDDD70"/>
I might mention alſo the Earthquake, which was the Means of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Deliverance out of Priſon, and a Teſtimony from GOD to their Innocence and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Miſſion. Acts 16.25, 26. <hi>At Midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and ſang praiſes unto God: and the Priſoners heard them. And ſuddenly there was a great Earthquake, ſo that the foundations of the Priſon were ſhaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were looſed,</hi> &amp;c. Thus ſometimes the Earthquake is in Token of the Divine Favour to GOD'S People.</p>
            <p>BUT uſually it is a Viſitation in <hi>Diſpleaſure:</hi> a Sign of Wrath gone out from the Lord. Hence it is made the Subject of a Divine <hi>Threatning.</hi> As you may ſee, if you conſult the <hi>Texts</hi> in the <hi>Margin</hi>

Iſa. 5.24, 25. <hi>Becauſe they have caſt away the Law of the Lord of Hoſts, therefore the Anger of the Lord is kindled againſt his People; and He hath ſtretched forth his Hand and ſmitten them; and the Hills did tremble, and their Carcaſſes were torn in the midſt of the Streets.</hi> This might be the Earthquake that <hi>Zechary</hi> ſpeaks of, in the days of <hi>Uzziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi>

            <p>I ſhall only add here, That Earthquakes may be Tokens of Divine Anger, when yet no Execution is done, no Injury receiv'd. It is not to be doubted but <hi>that</hi> was ſo, which attended the <hi>Crucifixion</hi> of our bleſſed LORD.

               </q> The Earth trembled, and the Rocks rent, at the accurſed Fact, to proclaim the Indignation of GOD. The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains quaked, becauſe He was wroth, and He threw

down the Rocks in his Anger. He as it were ſmote his Hands at the wicked Deed, and rent his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the deteſtable Blaſphemies that accompanied it.

'Twas a wonder the Earth did not inſtantly open and ſwallow them up. But GOD in his infinite Patience only warn'd and threaten'd them, without any preſent Execution.

            <p>THIS then may ſerve to <hi>interpret</hi> to us the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Providence in the late awful Diſpenſation <hi>among our ſelves,</hi> and may convince us that GOD hath been in his <hi>Anger</hi> marching through our Land, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the City &amp; Country, <hi>Alas for all the Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Houſe of Iſrael!</hi> By which <hi>they are crucifying to themſelves the Son of GOD afreſh, and putting Him to an open Shame!</hi>

The Diſpenſation in it's own Nature has a powerful Tendency to work on the Minds of Men by way of Conviction and Terror, and to beget a trembling frame of Spirit, from the apprehenſion of an inviſible Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Hand ſhaking the Earth. And it is what GOD expects, that we tremble at his Preſence, and fear his Wrath at ſuch a time. He ſays now unto <hi>New-England,</hi> "Surely thou wilt fear Me; Thou wilt receive Inſtruction: So thy Dwellings ſhall not be cut off.</p>
            <p>HENCE we may look upon it as a <hi>Token for Good,</hi> that ſuch extraordinary Impreſſions are made upon the Hearts of many by this awakening Diſpenſation. For by the Terrors of the Lord Men are often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded and prepared to turn unto GOD, and believe on the Name of <hi>JESUS.</hi> The Evangeliſts tell us, That <hi>all the People</hi> which came to ſee the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion of our Lord, when they ſaw the Earthquake, and the awful Things that came to paſs, <hi>ſmote on their Breaſts and returned</hi> — ſorrowful and in a very penſive frame, deploring the wicked Fact, which had been committed, and trembling for fear of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Judgments they cou'd not but apprehend were coming upon them. Thus their Hearts were in a manner ſoften'd, and made ſuſceptible of the Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſanctifying Grace. It's thought the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions they now were under, prov'd happy Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives to the good Work which was afterwards wro't upon them, when <hi>ſeveral Thouſands</hi> together were converted by <hi>Peter</hi>'s Preaching.— So in the Caſe of the <hi>Jaylor,</hi> (Act. 16.26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) the ſudden and terrible <hi>Earthquake</hi> which open'd the Priſon-Doors, and ſet looſe his Priſoners, was the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Awakning and Repentance.</p>
            <p>AMONG ourſelves, it is a hopeful Symptom of the Spirit's co-operating with Divine Providence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we hear ſo many, in great fear &amp; concern for their Souls,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002874_0041_0FE680177702A828"/>
crying out with the Jaylor, <hi>What muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> Hitherto the awful Diſpenſation we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſeems to have been in <hi>Mercy</hi> unto Many, to bring them to <hi>Repentance</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">In many Towns and Congregations conſiderable Numbers have been awakened; ſo that ill Cuſtoms are broken off in a great meaſure: Family-Worſhip ſet up in prayerleſs Houſes: the Table of the Lord more deſired, and throng'd.

               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:002874_0044_0FE6801756BFF598"/>MUST it not be ſaid to thee, O <hi>Boſton!</hi> to thee O <hi>New-England!</hi> as the Prophet ſaid to <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Ezek. 16.49. <hi>Behold, this was the Iniquity of thy Siſter</hi> Sodom: <hi>Pride, Fulneſs of Bread, and Abundance of Idleneſs was in her and in her Daughters.</hi> And can there be nothing done to correct the Extravagance of the Times, to reform the Idle and Diſſolute! Surely the Judgments of GOD call this People to lay aſide their <hi>vain</hi> Ornaments, to retrench the Superfluities of their voluptuous Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and to awake out of that criminal Sloth &amp; indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent trifling way of ſpending their precious Time, which Multitudes are guilty of.</p>
            <p>IS it not ſaid, Wo to the City that is <hi>filthy and polluted!</hi>— Now are there not abominable Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Adulteries committed in this Land? And might not more be done for the Reſtraint of this grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wickedneſs!</p>
            <p>IS it not ſaid, Wo to the <hi>oppreſſing</hi> City! And is there not much of Oppreſſion, Extortion, and unrighteous Dealing practiſed among us? May it not be complain'd, <hi>All the foundations of the Earth are out of Courſe!</hi> And is it not the Language of Providence, <hi>How ye down Trees, and caſt a Mount againſt</hi> Jeruſalem: <hi>This is a City to be viſited; She is wholly Oppreſſion in the midſt of her!</hi> GOD ſeems to be ſmiting his Hands at our diſhoneſt Gain.

            <p>AND when we have felt the Earth tremble, and our Houſes <hi>reel to &amp; fro</hi> like a <hi>drunken Man</hi> (as the Prophet gives us the elegant, but reprochful Compariſon) ſhou'd it not mind us of the wicked <hi>Intemperance,</hi> which threatens (among other fooliſh and hurtful Luſts) to drown us in Perdition, unleſs there be ſome ſpeedy and very powerful Stand made!</p>

               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:002874_0045_0FE645FC2BA14408"/>Furthermore, Is not <hi>Truth</hi> fallen in our Streets; and the Spirit of <hi>Falſehood</hi> reigning, to a ſcandalous degree among us? What Promiſe-breaking, Back-biting, Lying and Slandering, do Multitudes live in the practice of; who give their Mouths to Evil, and their Tongues frame Deceit!— Is there not alſo much of profane <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Curſing;</hi> by reaſon of which the Land mourneth! How do Multitudes among us in the moſt impious and barefac'd manner rend and tear the ſacred Name of GOD!

            <p>Again, IF we reflect on the particular <hi>Seaſon,</hi> when GOD viſited us with the Earthquake, may we not ſee his Finger pointed at the great and growing Iniquity of <hi>Sabbath-breaking!</hi> O how is the Lord's Day polluted by Multitudes! Are there not many, who very frequently, if not habitually, do neglect the public Worſhip? Are there not many who proſtitute the Day (or part of it) to worldly Buſineſs or vain Recreations! How general a Cuſtom is it, for Men to continue exerciſing their Trades, or purſuing their Diverſions, till late in the Evening <hi>before</hi> the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and to ſpend the Evening after in Idleneſs and Vanity: by which means our bleſſed LORD, the Lord of the Sabbath, is defrauded of a valuable Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holy Time, and the good Ends of ſacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Duties very much defeated! Well then may the Earth tremble, and the Heavens at this be aſtoniſh'd.— There are good and wholeſome Laws providing ſutable Remedies in theſe Caſes: But how little are they regarded, and what a Coldneſs in many to have them put in Execution!</p>
            <p>Moreover Is there all due Care taken to encourage and ſupport the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the Goſpel in this Land, in ſome Towns eſpecially?— If GOD'S Altar be ſtarv'd, and there be a Robbing of GOD in Tithes

            <p>IN a word, Is there not a deplorable Neglect of <hi>Family-Order</hi> among us? How little is there of Religion and Government in many Houſes? And does not the late terrible Shaking of our Houſes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh us of our Family-Diſorders and Neglects?— Shou'd not our Rulers then exert themſelves for the Reformation of theſe things! Might not ſome further publick Laws be enacted for that End; to oblige Parents and Maſters to keep better Hours and better Orders in their Houſes; and to reſtrain Children and Servants from many vile Practices!— Are there not ſome Houſes among us, that are mere Nurſeries of Lewdneſs and Debauchery, or Receptacles of Thefts and Robberies, or full of ſcandalous Strifes and Brawlings? And might not more Pains be taken to ſubdue and reform ſuch diſorderly vicious Families!</p>
            <p>THUS I have mention'd ſome of thoſe Sins, which make the Times perillous, and expoſe the Land to ſhaking Diſpenſations.

theſe Abominations, but alſo as publick Miniſters of Juſtice, to be open and ſwift Witneſſes againſt them, both by Word and Deed!

            <p>AND O that the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> may be quickened, directed, and aſſiſted of GOD, to improve <hi>their</hi> Opportunity! It ſeems to be a happy Seaſon for the Miniſtry of the Word. After Men have been ſo terrify'd by <hi>Earthquake</hi> and <hi>great Noiſe,</hi> what more likely to melt and charm their Souls, than the <hi>ſtill ſmall Voice</hi> of the preached Goſpel? The Lord make us wiſe to win Souls; give us the tongue of the Learned, that we may know how to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary: and make us faithful, that we may cry aloud in the ears of Sinners, and ſpare not; warning every Man, and reproving with all long-ſuffering! The Lord pour out his Spirit upon us, that we may give ourſelves wholly to theſe things, and unto Prayer!</p>
            <p>AND O that the People of GOD in our ſeveral <hi>Churches</hi> may be rouzed and quicken'd to the Duties of Self-Examination, Humiliation and Prayer, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Diſcipline, Brotherly Watch and Admonition, Peace and Union!</p>
            <p>LET the Churches inquire into their State and Circumſtances; examine how they obſerve the Feaſts and Sabbaths of the Lord; whether they keep the Ordinances, as they have been delivered to them, and the Faith as it was once delivered to the Saints?— May not the Earthquake admoniſh us of the Spirit of <hi>Giddineſs</hi> and <hi>Wavering,</hi> that is to be found in Multitudes of Profeſſors! May we not ſpeak of them in the Language of the Prophet, <hi>They are drunken, but not with Wine; They ſtagger, but not with ſtrong Drink!</hi> — O look to your ſelves, that ye loſe not thoſe things which ye have gained. Be watchful, and ſtrengthen the Things which remain, that are ready to die. So ſtand faſt in the LORD, my

Let us fall down upon our Faces in penitent Humiliations before GOD for all our Errors and Miſcarriages, for all our Impenitency, Unbelief, Ingratitude and unfruitfulneſs under the Goſpel; and let us beſiege the Throne of Grace with our ardent Cries, that GOD wou'd pardon all our Iniquities, and turn away from us the fierce Anger, which we have ſeen ſuch awful Tokens and Prognoſticks of.— And let the Churches ſtudy a <hi>Reformation</hi> of all that is amiſs among them. <hi>Purge out the old Leaven,</hi> that you may be a new Lump. Keep the Feaſt, not with the Leven of Hypocriſy, or the Leven of Malice, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and Variance: for which things the Wrath of GOD cometh down upon a Land.

            <p>IN fine, May <hi>all the People</hi> of the Land lay to heart the terrible Viſitation we are under! The ſurpriſing Earthquake and ſubterraneal Thunder was GOD'S <hi>Voice</hi> crying to the Town and Country.

            <p>WE ſhou'd learn how <hi>great</hi> &amp; <hi>terrible</hi> a GOD we have to do with; and therefore make Him our Fear and our Dread.— We ſhou'd learn our abſolute Need of an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in CHRIST; out of whom GOD is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Fire: To Him therefore we ſhou'd fly for Refuge, and plead his Sacrifice as the Atonement for the Congregation.— We ſhou'd learn our intire <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence</hi> upon Divine Providence for Preſervation and all outward Comforts; and adore Him as the GOD of our Life.— We ſhou'd learn the <hi>Inſtability</hi> &amp; Vanity of the <hi>World;</hi> how fooliſh it is to ſet our Affections on Things here below, and what an uncertain Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation they ſtand upon, who build their Confidence on the Earth, and place their Happineſs in it's Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments.—We ſhould learn what a <hi>mutable</hi> World we live in, and how happy they that are got beyond the Reach of the Accidents of Time, and ſettled in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which cannot be mov'd. — Moreover, We are admoniſh'd of a <hi>Day of Judgment</hi> coming, when our glorious Lord will ariſe to ſhake terribly the Earth; will riſe up ſuddenly, and by his immediate Hand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the whole Frame of Nature. And ſeeing we look for ſuch things, we ſhould give Diligence to make our Calling and Election ſure, that if that Day of the Lord ſhou'd haſten and come upon us ſuddenly, we may nevertheleſs have Boldneſs and not be affrighted at the Noiſe of a diſſolving World.</p>
            <p>IN a word, We ſhou'd learn the <hi>Evil</hi> of SIN, which brings down Divine Judgments on the Earth, and throws Nature into the terrible Convulſions and Diſorders we behold. — We ſhou'd inquire, <hi>What meaneth the Heat of this Anger?</hi> We ſhou'd ſtudy the Grounds of GOD'S Contention with us: and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor that all provoking Evils may be put away from the midſt of us.

as the moral procuring Cauſes of the Earthquake, and be found repenting in Duſt &amp; Aſhes.—We ſhou'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how unworthy we are of the Earth for our Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, and admire the Riches of Divine Patience and Clemency in yet reprieving us from Death and Hell. Are we not <hi>as Brands pluck'd out of the Fire!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O let us realiſe the ſparing Mercy and preventing Goodneſs, mix'd with the awful Diſpenſation we are paſſing under. If GOD had pleas'd, He could have by his Earthquake ſhook down our Houſes, and bury'd Multitudes in the Ruins. He cou'd have cauſed the Earth to burſt open, in many Chaſms, and ſwallow Men up alive. He cou'd have kindled a Flame in his Anger, and pour'd out fatal Streams of liquid Fire to conſume us: or have made the Earth ſink under our feet, and drown'd us all in one moment under a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating Flood of mighty Waters: as He overthrew <hi>Sodom,</hi> and as He deſtroy'd the Cities &amp; Villages of <hi>Sicily, Jamaica,</hi> and other parts of the World. —But He has only appointed over us <hi>Terror,</hi> without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: Bleſſed be his Name! — As great as the Miſeries we were expos'd to ſo great is our Deliverance. Sing, O ye Heavens, for the Lord hath ſpared his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: Shout, ye lower parts of the Earth: Break forth into Singing, ye Mountains, O Forreſt, and every Tree therein: for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himſelf in Iſrael.</p>
            <p>IN former days this Land has felt the gentle Shocks of Earthquakes, one after another. GOD has viſited us once and again; but in Tenderneſs, remembring Mercy in the midſt of Wrath. The Language of his Providence is that, <hi>How ſhall I give thee up!</hi> How ſhall I make thee as <hi>Admah?</hi> How ſhall I ſet thee as <hi>Zeboim;</hi> which the Lord overthrew in his Anger and in his Wrath?— O let us conſider the great Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance we have receiv'd, and never forget the Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards we have paſſed thorow. GOD hath ſhewn us the Riches of his Patience &amp; Compaſſion, together with his Power and Majeſty. He hath ſhown us what He <hi>cou'd</hi> do, and hinted to us what <hi>we</hi> deſerve. O that by the Terrors of the Lord we may be perſuaded:
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:002874_0051_0FE645FC2023BCC8"/>
and by his Goodneſs led to Repentance! Let us attend to the Voice of his monitory Rod: that his Long-ſuffering may be Salvation to us. As our Pſalmiſt exhorts, <hi>O come let us worſhip and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord our Maker. For He is our God, and we are the People of his Paſture &amp; the Sheep of his Hand: To Day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts.</hi>

            <p>O that Such as are ſecure may be awaken'd; and that ſuch as are under Convictions may be brought to a true Repentance! GOD has come, not to ſlay us, but only to affright us, and call our Sins to Remembrance. Let us reflect on the Motions and Thoughts of heart within us, when we were alarm'd by the Noiſe and Terror of the late melancholy Night. Did not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience rouze up, and begin to do it's Office, in accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and condemning! O let us cheriſh the Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, retain the Thoughts of thoſe diſtreſſing Hours, and improve the ſame to a thorow Repentance and Reformation. Beware that you don't relapſe into Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity: <hi>Quench not the Spirit.</hi> Satan and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will be buſy to cancel any good Impreſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun upon you: but reſiſt the Devil, forſake all vain Company, and fly the Inticements of an evil World. Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate. Diligently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Means of Grace. Watch &amp; pray, that ye enter not into Temptation. And exhort one another daily, leſt any Man be hardned thro' the Deceitfulneſs of Sin. Often recollect the Vows, which your Lips uttered, in that tremendous Seaſon, when your Soul was in Diſtreſs: and fail not to perform your Vows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AMEND now your Doings,</hi> ſaith the Lord: and truſt not in lying Words. Be not deceived: GOD is not mocked. Beware of Hypocriſy. It is a melancholy Account we have, Pſal. 78.34, 36. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him: and they returned, and enquired early after God. Nevertheleſs, they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</hi> And tho' <hi>we</hi> do the like, GOD may (as in their Caſe) yet have Compaſſion, and not ſtir up all his Wrath, ſpeedily to make an utter End
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:002874_0052_0FE68081696D3980"/>
of us. But verily his Patience will not laſt always. Abuſed Patience will ſooner or later turn into impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Fury.— <hi>Know therefore this day, and conſider it in thine heart,</hi> that the Lord, He is GOD in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven above, and upon the Earth beneath: with whom is <hi>terrible Majeſty.</hi> The Earth ſhook &amp; trembled; the Hills alſo moved &amp; were ſhaken, becauſe He was wroth. He hath lifted up his Voice, and ſpoken to us from the inviſible Caverns below, in the moſt awful Accents of holy Diſpleaſure. Hear this, ye old Men, and give Ear, all ye Inhabitants of the Land: Hath this been in your days or even in the days of your Fathers? Tell ye your Children of it, and let your Children tell their Children, and their Children another Generation: that they may fear GOD, and not forget the Works of the Lord, but keep his Commandments, that it may be well with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THEREFORE alſo now,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Turn ye even to ME with all your Heart,</hi> and with Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and with Weeping, and with Mourning; and <hi>rent your Heart,</hi> and not your Garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious &amp; merciful. <hi>Who knoweth if He will return, and repent Him of the</hi> Evil! Only acknowlege thine Iniquity, that thou haſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, O backſliding <hi>Iſrael!</hi> So I will not cauſe mine Anger to fall upon you, ſaith the Lord. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe therefore your Heart to the Lord, and be no more ſtiffnecked. O let us hear his Voice <hi>to Day,</hi> while it is called to day, and turn at his Reproof. — That's the Call of GOD; Repent and turn, leſt I come quickly, and ſmite the Earth with a Curſe, that ſhall devour the Inhabitants. O let us make Haſte to put far away all Iniquity from our Tabernacles, that our Houſes may be ſafe from Fear. Let us immediately labour to get Sin purged out of our Hearts and Lives, and let us cry mightily to GOD, that Salvation may be nigh to us, and Glory dwell in our Land. <hi>It is Time to ſeek the</hi> LORD, till He come and rain Righteouſneſs upon us. It is <hi>high time</hi> to awake out of Sleep. Awake unto Righteouſneſs, and ſin not.— So ſhall we in the moſt effectual way <hi>flee from the Earthquake,</hi> and obtain

Lengthning out of our Tranquillity. But if by theſe things we will not be reformed; if we will not hear, and if we will not lay it to Heart, to give Glory to GOD, we have Reaſon to fear He will puniſh us <hi>yet ſeven times more,</hi> as He did his People <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old</p>
            <p>THEREFORE our Text warns us in thoſe terms; <hi>To day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts, as in the Provocation, and the day of Temptation in the Wilderneſs: when your Fathers tempted me; unto whom I ſware in my Wrath, that they ſhould not enter into my Reſt.</hi>—Agreably the Apoſtle obſerves, 1 Cor. 10.5, 6. <hi>But with many of them God was not well pleaſed: for they were overthrown in the wilderneſs. Now theſe things were our examples, to the intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they alſo luſted.</hi> So the Prophet, Jer. 7.12. <hi>But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I ſet my name at the firſt, and ſee what I did to it, for the wickedneſs of my people Iſrael.</hi> In like manner it may be ſaid, Go to <hi>Antioch;</hi> Go to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and to <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis;</hi> and ſee what an incenſed GOD has done to them for all their Wickedneſs. And let us fear the like Doom. Places they were once famous for the Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but growing degenerate were finally deſtroy'd by terrible <hi>Earthquakes.</hi> O let not <hi>New-England</hi> be highminded, but fear: be zealous, and repent. To come nearer home, I might ſay, Go to <hi>Lima,</hi> in the Southern Part of <hi>America</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">The Spaniards have met with terrible Blows in this City once and again by Earthquakes. Particularly in the Year 1687, it was totally overthrown; the Houſes were thrown down, and above a <hi>Thouſand</hi> of the Inhabitants periſh'd in the Ruins, or were drown'd in the Sea, which breaking over it's Banks overflow'd the Sea-port Towns round about; carry'd Ships three Leagues up within Land, and made great Havock every where.

and other Iſlands in the <hi>Northern</hi> Part <note n="*" place="bottom">About the Year 1690, happen'd an Earthquake, which affected almoſt all the <hi>Leeward</hi> Iſlands, and was very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible at <hi>Antego, Nevis, St. Chriſtophers</hi> and <hi>Montſerrat.</hi> At <hi>Antego,</hi> it threw down many of their Houſes, Sugar-works, and Wind-mills. One then wrote to his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent here. That the Earth was ſeen to heave &amp; roll like the Waves of the Sea, that Rocks were thrown from the Mountains, Houſes ſhattered, and ſome Points of Land ſwallow'd up. [Dr. <hi>I. Mather,</hi> of Earthq. p. 27.] — At <hi>Nevis,</hi> it made great Deſolations. It ruin'd moſt of <hi>Charleſtown.</hi> The Ground open'd in the Streets, and a hot ſtinking Water ſpouted out of the Earth to a great height. The Earth in many places broke open and ſwallow'd ſome Thouſands of great Trees, that were never more ſeen. At <hi>St. Chriſtophers,</hi> the Earth open'd <hi>nine</hi> foot wide in many places, bury'd ſolid Timber, Sugar-Mills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And threw down the Jeſuits College, and all the other Stone-Buildings — This Earthquake broke off part of another Iſland, and threw it into the Sea, with a Noiſe like a Cannon, and ſent up a mighty Cloud of Duſt into the Air — <hi>Atl Geo.</hi> p. 514, 516, 517, 524.] It was alſo at <hi>Barbadoes;</hi> but did no Hurt there.— And we are now inform'd, That the late Earthquake which ſhook <hi>New-England,</hi> was at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> on the Day before, about Noon; which is nigh <hi>two Thouſand</hi> Miles from <hi>Boſton.</hi> The Shake much as it was here in ſome Places: Their <hi>Houſes</hi> were in a great Convulſion; and the <hi>Streets</hi> roſe and fell like the Waves of the Ocean; ſo that they were afraid of the Earth's ſinking, and all ran down to the Wharves, to get into Boats &amp; Ships for Security.</note>: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Works of the Lord, how terrible He has ſometimes been in his Dealings with impenitent Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. And what Plea now has <hi>Boſton;</hi> what Plea has <hi>New-England</hi> to make for an Exemption, if we go on ſtill in our Treſpaſſes! GOD has once and again put into our Hands <hi>a Cup of Trembling:</hi> and we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect He will make us to drink deep of his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, if we continue impenitent; even <hi>deeper</hi> than other places, in proportion to the Guilt &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of our moſt aggravated Sins. GOD may cauſe the Calamity to riſe up a <hi>ſecond time,</hi> and then give it a Commiſſion to deſtroy; except we repent. Verily there is no Contending with GOD, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks,

               <hi>Job</hi> 9.4, 5, 6. To day then if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts; leſt there come upon us ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Deſtruction without Remedy.</p>
            <p>BUT if utter Deſolation haſten not upon the Land, by literal Earthquakes, and other the like Judgments; yet have we not Reaſon to fear ſad Revolutions, <hi>Church</hi>-quakes &amp; <hi>State</hi>-quakes, that ſhall ſwallow up all our deareſt Privileges! Have we not felt repeated <hi>Shocks</hi> already, that have made the very Foundations tremble under us, and threatned a terrible Diſſolution! Are there not many that <hi>hate our Zion,</hi> who ceaſe not cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Raſe it, Raſe it to the very foundations! And is not the Number of <hi>New-England</hi>'s beſt <hi>Friends</hi> leſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning every day! How is the ancient Stock of pious praying Chriſtians, and faithful, active, zealous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Publick dying off apace? [Among others I wou'd here mention two <hi>late</hi> Inſtances, one in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, and the other in the Miniſtry; the Honourable Col. <hi>John Otis,</hi> of his Majeſty's Council, and the Rev. Mr. <hi>Samuel Danforth,</hi> Paſtor of the Church in <hi>Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who having in their various Stations faithfully ſerv'd their Generation, are now fallen aſleep in JESUS.] And of thoſe riſing up, how few are there poſſeſſed with with the <hi>firſt</hi> Spirit of <hi>New-England!</hi> Are we not daily degenerating from the Principles and Zeal of our primitive Times! Is not Apoſtaſy growing upon our Churches in regard of Faith, Worſhip, Diſcipline and Converſation! Are there not thoſe Sins abounding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, which might juſtly provoke GOD to take away his Kingdom from us, to tear in pieces our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py CHARTER, and viſit us with Perſecution &amp; Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! And does not a Spirit of Contention &amp; Perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Love of the World, and licentious Cuſtoms, threaten to ruin us, in our beſt Intereſts, by a natural and powerful Efficacy!</p>
            <p>O let theſe Reflections awaken all that love <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to tremble for the Ark of GOD, and to plead for the City of our Solemnities. Hear the Exhortation, with which I now conclude, Iſa. 62.6, 7. —<hi>Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not ſilence; And give him no reſt, till he eſtabliſh, and till he make Jeruſalem a praiſe in the Earth.</hi>
