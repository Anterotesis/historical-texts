            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Am very sensible of the great Difficulties that do attend this honourable Imployment in which her Majesty hath been pleased to place me, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Province; but I hope you will never fail to assist me to serve the Queen and her People here.</p>
            <p>Her Majesty hath shewn in the whole course of her Reign, a Reign glorious beyond Example, how much she aims at the good and prosperity of her People. She hath, with indefatigable pains, united her two Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and she continues the same application to unite the Minds of all her Subjects. This is her great Care, and ought to be that of those whom she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes to govern those distant Provinces, which are not so happy by their S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Her Majestys Reign will make a bright Leaf in History; and as 'tis the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the present, so 't will be the admiration of future Ages, not more for her Success abroad than her Prudence at home; and tho' our distance has, and may sometimes be disadvantagious to us, yet we experience the Effect of her Princely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We have no Annimosities with one another, but firmly agree to do our Selves and Country Justice; and perswade our selves, none that deserve pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Censure, will have share in your Excellency's esteem, but that we shall meet with a hearty Concurrence from you in all those measures that conduce to our Peace and Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>We shall contribute to the Support of her Majestys Government to the utmost of our Abilities, and most willingly so at a time when are free'd from Bondage and Arbitrary Incroachments; and are very much satisfied that Vice and Immorality will meet with a different Treatment from what it did, and not receive the publick Countenance and Approbation.</p>
            <p>We do assure your Excellency, all your reasonable Desires shall be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to us, and that we will study to make your Excellency's Administration as easie and happy as we can to your Excellency and our selves.</p>

            <p>This last Libil, call'd, <hi>The Reply, &amp;c.</hi> came out so suddenly, that as yet we have not had time to answer it in all its Particulars, but do assure your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, That it is for the most part false in Fact; and that part of it which carries any face of Truth, they have been malitious and unjust in not mentioning the whole Truth, which would have fully justified my Lord <hi>Cornbury's</hi>

            <p>THUS having discharged this part of our Duty, which we thought at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent incumbent upon us, we beg leave to assure your Majesty, That when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we shall see the People of this Province labour under any thing like a Grievance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we shall, according to our Duty, immediately apply to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour with our best Advice, for the Redress of it; and we have no reason yet to doubt of a ready Complyance in him. We shall not be particular in, but crave leave to refer to his Excellency's Representation of them to the Right honourable the Lords Commissioners for Trade and Plantations.</p>
            <p>The strenuous asserting of your Majesty's Prerogative Royal, and Vindicating the Honour of your Governor, the Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> will, in our humble Opinion, be so absolutely necessary at this juncture, that without your so doing, your Majesty will find your self deceived either in expectation of a Revenue for Support of the Government, or Militia for its Defence.</p>
            <p>In hopes your Majesty will take these important things into your Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and his Excellency the Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> with all the Members of your Majestys Council, into your Royal Favour and Protection, We shall conclude with our most fervent Prayers to the most High to lengthen Your Days and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease your Glories; and that our Selves in particular, and all others in general who reap the benefit of your Majesties most gentle and happy Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be, and ever continue the most Loyal and Dutiful of Subjects to the most Glorious and best of Queens.</p>

            <p>W<hi>E</hi> have now a considerable time waited in expectation that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Council would have laid before your Excellency something in Justification of the Address they sent to the Queen; it is what (if they have any value for their Reputations) they are obliged to doe; but their Neglect of it, after the time set them, looks as if they Studied to avoid coming to the Test.</p>
            <p>We cannot suppose them unprovided, having (as they say) seriously and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately taken into Consideration what they thought themselves bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and duty, to testifie their dislike of, to her Majesty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and having now had so long time to collect what Proofs they are able, which if they decline to do, we hope your Excellency will take it for granted, that what they have writ is not true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that the Consciousness of their own Guilt, makes them shun that tryal, which is so necessary to enable your Excellency to set the Differences between us, in a true light, before her Majesty.</p>
            <p>We have drawn out the several Articles in that Address, which amount to about sixteen; and whatever pretences they may make to Temper and good Manners, we presume they won't offer this Address as an Instance of either; if they do, we must confess our selves so unfortunate as to entertain different sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of it; but of that enough; the Articles are,</p>

            <head>To his Excellency John Lord Lovelace, Capt. General &amp; Governor in Chief of the Province of New-Jersey, &amp;c. The humble Address of the Representatives of her Majestys Province of N. Jersey.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it please your Excellency;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE the Representatives of this her Majestys Province of <hi>New-Jersey</hi> having examined into the truth of several Complaints made against <hi>Peter Sonmans,</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> one of her Majestys Council for this Province, do find, that the said <hi>Sonmans</hi> has illegally used the Power he is cloathed with, to the great hurt of several of her Majestys Subjects, and, if tolerated, will be of evil example, and render their Liberties and Properties precarious, and at the disposal of every Magistrate, who will make his will, and not the Law, the Rule of his Actions.</p>
            <p>We are heartily sorry that that Gentleman, who has the honour be of her Majesty's Council, and does not want sufficient Abilities for her Service, should by his imprudent Conduct lay us under a necessity of so publick a Complaint against him; but we cannot be so much wanting to the Country we represent, as to be silent in a case that so justly requires our Consideration, and perswade our selves, your Excellency will not protect him in the breach of the Laws, and abuse of her Majesties Subjects; but on the contrary, think it for the honor of the Queen to punish a Person who uses her Authority so contrary to the end for which it was confer'd on him. Tho' we have but too much reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve those Arbitrary measures with which the late Administration under the Ld. <hi>Cornbury,</hi> so much abounded, were very much owing to his Councils, he being one of the Persons on whose advice his Lordship very much rely'd, yet we shall not insist on any thing that may look like Conjecture, but take care to inform your Excellency,</p>
            <p>That in the <hi>first</hi> place, he advised and procured the arresting of Mr. <hi>John Barclary</hi> on <hi>Whitsunday</hi> last, coming out of the Church from the Sacrament, which is a manifest breach of the Peace, and contrary to the Laws in that case made and provided, and must tend to the discouragement of Religion, and the publick Worship of God, if Persons can't be secure at the Altar in the most Solemn Acts of Worship.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> He took from one <hi>John Brown</hi> his Horse, without assigning him any Reason for it, and detains him to this Day. And some time after the poor Man had commenced an Action against him, to recover, if possible, his Beast unjustly detain'd from him, one <hi>Reeves</hi> complained against one <hi>Mellin,</hi> a Taylor (who had some time before us'd some expressions against some of Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> Friends) for detaining a Coat of the said <hi>Reeves'</hi>s, which Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> was pleased to call Fellony, and was going to commit the said <hi>Mellin</hi> for Fellony, tho' <hi>Mellin</hi> proved, and <hi>Reeves</hi> afterward con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>est, that <hi>Mellin</hi> only detain'd
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001394_0010_0FB2EBC1E7668088"/>
the Coat he had made, till <hi>Reeves</hi> should pay him for making of it. <hi>Mellin</hi> finding there was no contending against absolute Power, found a way to escape from <hi>Sonmans,</hi> and was set over to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>-Island</hi> by the aforesaid <hi>Brown,</hi> who was altogether ignorant of what had happen'd; upon which <hi>Sonmans</hi> (to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his Resentment) contrary to Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> committed the said <hi>Brown</hi> to Goal; and when the Sheriff had admitted him to Bail, <hi>Sonmans</hi> used many threats to him for his so doing, ordering him to take him back again, telling him, he would throw up his Commission, and go to <hi>York,</hi> and desire my Lord to send Soldiers to Rule them; which Threat, and the fear of being govern'd by Martial Law, induc'd the Sheriff to take him into Custody again, and keep him in Prison till my Lord <hi>Cornbury</hi> was pleased to allow he might be admitted to Bail. This Procedure, as it was most unlawful and unjust, so it tended not only to render her Majesties Subjects intirely depending on my Lord <hi>Cornbury,</hi> or those he thought fit to honour with Magistracy, but to create in the Minds of the People an avresion to her Majesty's just and mild Government, when by a humor a Gentleman of the Council could Dragoon them at pleasure.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> In a Case depending between the Queen and Mr. <hi>Harrison,</hi> upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation exhibited by the Attorney General, he the said <hi>Sonmans</hi> endeavour'd to perswade the Sheriff to pack a Jury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and accordingly gave him a Lift of eleven Men, all <hi>Dutch-men,</hi> and promis'd to bring them in his way, that he might be at little trouble; had this been after the Threat of Dragooning, and with a Man of less Vertue than the present Sheriff, in all probability it had taken effect, and the Gentleman had been Ruin'd.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> In a Suit depending before him in the Court of Pleas, between Mr. <hi>Michael van Veighty</hi> and Mr. <hi>Alexander Walker,</hi> a Friend of Mr. <hi>Sonmans,</hi> the said <hi>Veighty</hi> had ordered Mr. <hi>Tho. Gordon</hi> to take out a Writ and sign it with his the said <hi>Veighty'</hi>s Name, which <hi>Veighty</hi> acknowledged in open Court, and offered to sign it himself; notwithstanding, he the said <hi>Sonmans</hi> did not only not admit the Action to be Try'd, but taxed a Bill of Cost against the said <hi>Veighty</hi> for three Pounds seven Shillings and ten Pence, in abatement, in which Case no Cost ought to be paid. And that the Partiality and Injustice of Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> may appear more plainly to your Lordship, in the same Court another Writ sign'd in the same manner as that was, met with no objection from him, but was allowed of.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> The afore-mentioned <hi>Alexander Walker,</hi> after beating and cutting his Wife in a miserable manner, threatned to wash his hands in the Blood of his Son-in-Law, and on <hi>Sunday</hi> in the Morning attempted it with an Ax, and had, in probability, murdered him, had not the suddain coming of help pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him; upon which application being made to Mr. <hi>Sonmans,</hi> to bind the said <hi>Walker</hi> to the Peace, he absolutely refused it, pretending he was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly going out of Town on your Lordships Business, tho' he staid in Town part of the next Day.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> In Contempt of the Laws in that Case made and provided, he openly Cohabits with a scandalous Woman, has had one Bastard by her; This is to the evil Example of her Majesties Subjects, in so publick a Violation of the Laws, by a Person who ought to give a good <hi>E</hi>xample, and punish that Crime in others.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that Notice which should be taken of such Crimes.</p>
            <p n="8">8<hi>thly</hi> and <hi>lastly,</hi> Whereas her Majesty has been graciously pleased to admit the People call'd <hi>Quakers</hi> to bear and share in the several Offices in this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Mr. <hi>Sonmans</hi> has turned them out of Juries, and not admitted them to serve in those Stations in Courts of which he has been Judge; This is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to Defeat her Majesties good Intentions to her Subjects of that Perswasion, and render her Government uneasie, which is what, we are satisfied, She in no means designs.</p>
            <p>Were there no more to be said against him than his being indicted for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and Adultery, we humbly conceive, would justifie what we are to desire of your Lordship; A Person of that Character being a Scandal to her Majesties Council; and we believe your Excellency will think it a Reflection on the Publick Administration to continue him in that Station. We therefore pray, That your Excellency would remove him from your Presence, Her Majesties Council, and all Places of Trust and Profit in this Province.</p>
