            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>EZEKIEL</hi> 22.12. —And thou haſt greedily gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of thy Neighbours by EXTORTION.</head>
            <p>VERY ſtriking and remarkable is the Charge and Exhortation of the great God to the Prophet Iſaiah. <hi>Cry aloud, ſpare not, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, and ſhew my people their tranſgreſſion, and the houſe of Jacob their ſins.</hi> From this and many other paſſages of ſacred writ, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the indiſpenſible duty of God's miniſters to bear a faithful teſtimony againſt all the ſins, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the crying abominations that prevail amongſt the people to whom they are ſent. The great Judge of all
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015859_0003_0F9A2F85D3403900"/>
the earth, who determines the fate of all its inhabitants, enjoyns this important and irkſome duty upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in the beginning of the chapter, of which our text is a part: he commands him to reprove Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem for all her attrocious crimes and tranſgreſſions, and to denounce his judgments againſt them. Theſe are the words of the incenſed Jehovah to the Prophet. <hi>Now thou ſon of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody City: Yea, thou ſhalt ſhew her all her abominations.</hi> What were theſe abominations? The ſubſequent verſes declare— They were murder, idolatry, diſobedience to Parents, oppreſſion of the ſtranger, the widow, and the orphan— contempt of things ſacred, prophanation of the Sabbath, ſlander to promote the ſhedding of blood, lewdneſs, and that of the worſt kind; inceſt and adultery. Theſe were the enormous crimes, for which God vehemently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the Jews, by the mouth of his Prophet—crimes at which an unfear'd conſcience ſhudders and recoils— Crimes, for which the flaming wrath of heaven cometh down on the children of diſobedience. Yet theſe crimes all black as they were, and ſufficient to plunge a nation into ruin, were but a part of <hi>Jeruſalem's</hi> guilt; for ſin is prolific, and one vice breeds another. Therefore God ſubjoins to the dark liſt of the abovementioned ſins, thoſe of bribery, uſury, and corruption. In thee ſays he have they taken gifts to ſhed blood—thou haſt taken uſury and increaſe: And then he upbraids them with EXTORTION
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015859_0004_0F9A2F8610462728"/>
in the words of my text, ſaying, <hi>And thou haſt greedily gained of thy neighbours by</hi> Extortion.</p>
            <p>THIS grievous, crying ſin, which God formerly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on his ancient people, by the mouth of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> he now charges on the inhabitants of theſe American States, ſaying unto them, <hi>Ye have greedily gained of your neighbors,</hi> your poor diſtreſſed neighbours, <hi>by</hi> EXTORTION. As this SIN prevails amongſt us with ſuch an high hand, I ſhould be utterly inexcuſable before God, and unfaithful to my country, and to the ſouls of men, if I did not bear my teſtimony againſt an evil ſo deſtructive and ſo enormous.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore, by divine aſſiſtance, endeavor to ſhow you,
<list>
                  <item>I. THE nature of this ſin.</item>
                  <item>II. ITS great baſeneſs, and malignity.</item>
                  <item>III. ITS fatal and pernicious tendency.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. THEN I am to ſhew you the nature of this ſin.</p>
            <p>THE word EXTORTION, is derived from the latin verb <hi>Extorqueo,</hi> which ſignifies to force, twiſt, or wring any thing from another; and it is that ſin, whereby a perſon who has any thing to ſell, taking the advantage of his neighbour's neceſſity, requires more for it than a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble price. If you ſhould aſk me, what is a reaſonable price? I anſwer, it is ſuch a one as is limited by thoſe
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015859_0005_0F9A2F86D15DD0E8"/>
important commandments of loving our neighbor as our ſelves, and doing to others as we would they ſhould do unto us—ſuch as is conſiſtent with the law of univerſal benevolence, charity to the poor, compaſſion to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed, and regard to the public intereſt of our country— Such a price as doth not exceed the former cuſtomary profits of honeſt men, nor the bounds and regulations fixed by our own delegated authority: in one word, ſuch a price as is conſiſtent with the various duties incumbent upon us as chriſtians, as members of ſociety, and as friends to LIBERTY. Every man's conſcience, if he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially conſults it, and has due reſpect to theſe points, will readily dictate to him what is a reaſonable price for his goods; now what exceeds this is EXTORTION, and the greater the exceſs is, the greater is the EXTORTION.</p>
            <p>THIS vice is ſometimes in ſcripture ſtyled oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as it is one ſubject's oppreſſing another. Thus the Iſraelites when they bought and ſold, were commanded <hi>not to oppreſs one another, Lev.</hi> 25.14. But oppreſſion is often diſtinguiſhed from EXTORTION, as the one is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a ſin of the governors, and the other a ſin of the people. Thus the ſin of oppreſſion in its appropriated ſenſe, conſiſts in a magiſtrate's laying heavy and unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary taxes, fines, and other impoſitions upon the people, unjuſtly ſeizing their property, and impriſoning their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons—witholding juſtice from them, rejecting their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015859_0006_0F9A2F87904BC4A8"/>
petitions, abridging or taking away their lawful privileges, or making unjuſt war upon them. EXTORTION ſeems rather limited to the actions of thoſe under autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and is exerciſed in thoſe private advantages which men take in their common dealings with one another, and eſpecially in caſes of buying and ſelling. It would be eaſy to prove and illuſtrate theſe definitions of oppreſſion and EXTORTION, &amp; evince their ſpecific difference, from ſacred &amp; prophane hiſtory, but I preſume this would be a needleſs attempt. The crime of EXTORTION is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt us, that however ignorant people of other countries may be of it, the inhabitants of America are ſo well acquainted by experience, with all its myſteries of iniquity, that what has been already ſaid of its nature, may be deemed amply ſufficient.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the ſecond propoſition of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, namely. To ſhow its great baſeneſs and malignity.</p>
            <p>IT flows originally from the grand ſource of all ſin, the univerſal depravity and corruption of our nature contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fall. It proceeds from that unrighteous, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, covetous, malicious, envious, deceitful, unnatural, ſelfiſh, unmerciful diſpoſition, which was the conſequence of the original apoſtacy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. It proceeds from that ſordid avarice, that infamous love of money, which the apoſtle avers, <hi>is the root of all evil</hi>—from that love of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015859_0007_0F9A2F884FB4DBD8"/>
the world which is enmity againſt God—from that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs which is idolatry—from that mean love of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſt, which would ſacrifice the welfare of a whole community for the ſake of one's own filthy lucre. Thus we ſee it is directly oppoſite to thoſe two great command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the love of God and the love of our neighbour, on which hang the whole law and the prophets—It proceeds from littleneſs of ſoul, contractedneſs of mind, baſeneſs and narrowneſs of heart, low, unmanly, ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ignoble, and grovling principles. It is an act of the moſt flagrant injuſtice and malevolence againſt the peace, comfort, and happineſs of ſociety, and highly inimical to our country. I obſerved that covetouſneſs, from which <hi>extortion</hi> ſprings, is idolatry. What is idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? It is beſtowing that ſupreme love on the creature, which is due to the Creator alone. And doth not the <hi>extortioner</hi> love the world and mammon more than God? Doth he not ſacrifice his time, talents and affections to thoſe baſe idols, and for their ſakes, live in the continual violation of his Maker's laws?</p>
            <p>IT is a direct tranſgreſſion of a poſſitive, divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. <hi>Ye ſhall not oppreſs one another, neither ſhall ye vex nor oppreſs a ſtranger,</hi> is the expreſs mandate of the ſupreme Legiſlator. Compare <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.27. with <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.14. &amp; 17. With this correſponds alſo, the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolic exhortation to all chriſtians, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.2. &amp; 6. <hi>Ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jeſus,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015859_0008_0F9A2F8911656E20"/>
that no man go beyond, and defraud</hi> (or as the word might be rendered OPPRESS) <hi>his brother in any matter, for the Lord in the avenger of all ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is directly contrary both to the law and the goſpel. It breaks the firſt and ſecond commandment of the firſt table, which reſpects our duty to God, as it idolizes mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, riches, and the world, and prefers them before the infinitely greateſt and beſt of beings; it tranſgreſſes the ſecond, as it pays its adoration, its principal care, love &amp; attention, to a little molten gold &amp; ſilver, to a few bundles of figured paper, and to the painted trifles of the preſent ſcene. It conſiders and regards them as the ſupreme good, and as it were, bows down to worſhip them. It violates the eighth and tenth commandment of the ſecond table, which reſpects our duty to our neighbour. <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet any thing that is thy neighbour's</hi> (ſays the law) but the <hi>extortioner,</hi> under the influence of that ſordid luſt, avarice, baſely covets other mens property; moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he who doth not give his neighbour an equivalent for his money, and exacts from him a greater price for his merchandize than it is worth, not only covets, but vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, and in the ſight of God, ſteals his neighbour's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. What is ſtealing? It is the unlawful taking away what it another's—and although there ſhould be no human law to regular the price of things, and forbid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant profits <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, they are contrary to the natural laws of juſtice and equity, written on every man's conſcience;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015859_0009_0F9A2F89D1A5CAB0"/>
they are contrary to Jehovah's expreſs prohibition, of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion</hi> and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>BUT this ſordid vice, is not only a manifeſt tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the law; but it is diametrically oppoſite to the genius, ſpirit, deſign, and tendency of the goſpel, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of its amiable and divine author, and his holy apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles—it is directly contrary to the love of mankind, and all thoſe generous virtues enjoined upon chriſtians. It is a flagrant contravention of that excellent and univerſally approved golden rule of equity, <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo unto them.</hi> It is a notorious violation of thoſe capital and important com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of our Savior, on which he laid ſo great a ſtreſs, and an obedience to which he mentions as a peculiar and diſtinguiſhing mark of our diſcipleſhip and relation to him, I mean the commandments of loving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and loving our neighbour as ourſelves. It is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect infringement of the goſpel injunction, to do good to all as we have opportunity—to pity the afflicted, ſympathize with the ſuffering, relieve the diſtreſſed, aſſiſt the widow and fatherleſs; the ſtranger and the needy, to promote the honor of religion, the welfare of the church, and our own meetneſs for the enjoyment of God.</p>
            <p>IT is contrary to the example of Chriſt, who being God manifeſt in the fleſh, gave himſelf for us, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though rich, became poor for our ſakes, that we through
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015859_0010_0F9A2F8A915174D8"/>
his poverty might be made rich. It is contrary to the example of the holy apoſtles, who ſpended and were ſpent for the welfare of mankind, and did not account their lives, their eſtates, their comforts dear, if ſo be they might finiſh their courſe with joy; and the miniſtry they had received from the Lord Jeſus, to teſtify for the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and eternal benefit of others, the goſpel of the grace of God. They ſuffered ſtripes, baniſhment, cruel mockings, confiſcation of goods, impriſonment—they wandered about from place to place, being deſtitute, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, tormented—they expoſed themſelves to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perils, they underwent the greateſt difficulties and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, they undertook the moſt tedious journeys, and dangerous voyages—and they endured pain, watchings, hunger, thirſt, faſting, cold, nakedneſs—They faced miſery and death in a thouſand frightful ſhapes, for the benefit of mankind.</p>
            <p>IT is a ſhameful reverſe of the example of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive chriſtians at Jeruſalem, who ſold their eſtates, and diſtributed the money ariſing from the ſales, to ſupply the wants of their diſtreſſed brethren. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

inſtances of their magnanimity, diſintereſtedneſs, ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and heroic exploits in their country's cauſe, to the infinite diſgrace of chriſtian <hi>extortioners;</hi> but if I ſhould, this diſcourſe would ſwell beyond its proper bounds— It is directly contrary to the noble example of many of our brethren, who have abandoned and ſacrificed, ſome their all, ſome a great part of their worldly goods, for the ſake of civil and religious liberty. How many are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting their private affairs, and expoſing themſelves, their lives and fortunes, to the rage of an implacable foe, in the councils of this continent—and how many thouſands more have left their houſes, occupations, intereſt, wives, children, parents and deareſt connexions, and have volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily expoſed themſelves to the inexpreſſible hardſhips of Summer's and Winter's campaigns, and all the horrors of impriſonment, famine, deſolation, wounds, ſlaughter, and death, for the ſafety and deliverance of their bleeding country. Now what a ſhameful contraſt to all theſe glorious examples, is the <hi>extortioner,</hi> who endeavors to fatten by the fall, thrive by the ruin, and enrich himſelf by the impoveriſhment of his brethren—who ſacrifices religion, liberty, his country—the blood of the faithful ſoldier the councils of the worthy patriot, the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of millions now alive, and the happineſs of millions yet unborn, to his ſordid paſſion for private gain. What a peſt of ſociety! What a ſordid wretch! What an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, what a deſpicable character is ſuch a man! Altho' he is a being deſtined for eternity, he is entirely occupied
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015859_0012_0F9A2F8CC43D2CB0"/>
with the moſt contemptible trifles of time. His immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoul, capable of angelic and celeſtial delights, and of aſpiring to a likeneſs and enjoyment of the DEITY, flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the dirt, wallows in the mire, contracts itſelf up into the baſeſt and meaneſt ſelfiſhneſs as the ſnail draws itſelf up into its ſhell, and is only active to obtain enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments common with the brutes—he envies the happineſs of his neighbors, he labors hard for their deſtruction—he in fact regards not the tears of the widow and fatherleſs, the groans of the poor and diſtreſſed, and the miſeries of the friends of mankind. If good offices and charity to ſuch objects are the fruits of benevolence; then ſurely grinding the faces of the poor, extorting from unhappy ſufferers their ſmall pittance, by exorbitant prices for the neceſſaries of life, muſt be the effects of a hard, cruel, malevolent, unfeeling heart, deſtitute of humanity and compaſſion. <hi>Extortion</hi> is a crime ſo ſordid and odious, that even the Phariſee thanked God, and congratulated himſelf, that he was not guilty of it; and the apoſtle Paul ranks it with the moſt attrocious ſins, ſuch as drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, theft, and ſodomy. Nay, he warns chriſtians not even to eat with, or to hold the leaſt communication with them; but to avoid them as a plague, as a nuiſance, as an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, as odious criminals, whoſe perſons are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and whoſe company is a diſgrace.

            <p>I now proceed to the laſt point propoſed, namely, to ſhew the fatal and pernicious tendency of <hi>extortion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It tends to debaſe the ſoul, and render it averſe to religion, devotion, and communion with God. The holy apoſtle declares, that the friendſhip of this world is enmity againſt God. If any man (ſays he) will be the friend of the world, the ſame is the enemy of God. If any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him. Thus <hi>extortion,</hi> which is both an effect and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of this ignoble paſſion, leads us away from the only fountain of bliſs, to thoſe ſordid purſuits, occupations, and enjoyments in which it cannot be found. It frequently impels the avaricious mind to the commiſſion of the moſt attrocious crimes of which human nature can poſſibly be guilty. The love of money (according to the unerring voice of inſpiration) is the root of all evil, which ſome having coveted after, have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows. Balaam was induced to adviſe the ruin of Iſrael, Judas to betray his innocent Lord and Maſter, and many others to betray their friends and ſell their country for money. Some have wiſhed their relations dead, and others have actually embrued their hands in their blood, for the love
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015859_0014_0F9A2F8D9040F320"/>
of filthy lucre. Numbers have been inveigled by this infamous paſſion, to commit theft, forgery, perjury, and other criminal actions, which have brought them to the gallows.</p>
            <p>It throws inſurmountable obſtacles in the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; renders us averſe to, and unfit for its enjoyments, and damps every generous purpoſe for the welfare of others. Our bleſſed Lord declares, <hi>that it is eaſier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven:</hi> We accordingly read that the young man in the goſpel, went away ſorrowful from Chriſt, becauſe he had <hi>great poſſeſſions.</hi> What keeps ſo many rich, ſo many mighty, ſo many noble, from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the goſpel? Is it not their attachment to the unrighteous mammon? What is the reaſon of all that meanneſs diſcovered by many pretended friends of liberty, in equivocating, lying, ſwearing falſly, refuſing to aſſiſt their country in the cabinet or the field? What is the reaſon of their lukewarmneſs, inactivity, changing of ſides, and finally abandoning the glorious cauſe of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican liberty? Is it not the baſeſt ſelf-intereſt, and the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did love of money? He who is reſolved to be rich, at all adventures, and on no account to ſacrifice private intereſt or part with his purſe, muſt needs be guilty of many baſe and mean actions, and will infallibly fall into a ſnare, and many hurtful luſts which drown men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to perdition. It has been partly obſerved before, that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015859_0015_0F9A2F8E513307C8"/>
               <hi>extortion</hi> proceeds from injuſtice, cruelty, hardneſs of heart—it alſo keeps alive, encourages, and nouriſhes thoſe odious diſpoſitions—it inſenſibly diveſts the ſoul of pity, humanity, integrity, benevolence, and every generous feeling and ſentiment—It degrades human nature, and brutalizes every divine faculty; eſtranges the mind from God and religion, unfits it for holy prayers and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, deſtroys faith, quenches the love of God and man, damps the nobleſt purpoſes for the public good, and leads to the moſt ſhameful and inglorious conduct. What is the cauſe of this unnatural, bloody civil war, and all the diſaſters of our ſuffering country? Is it not the accurſed love of money, and a deſire of enriching the needleſs and peſtilent members of ſociety with the ſpoils of others? This has produced all the unjuſt decrees and meaſures againſt America, and ſtain'd its once delightful fields with brothers blood. This has caſt a dark cloud over our proſperity, and filled the land with mourning, lamentation, and woe.</p>

It is ranked by the inſpired writers with the worſt of crimes, threatened with exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from heaven, and everlaſting damnation. <hi>Know ye not</hi> (ſays the apoſtle) <hi>that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God.

Ezek.</hi> 18.10, &amp;c. Heaven is inhabited by thoſe who lov'd God above the world, preferred the teſtimony of a good conſcience, before thouſands of gold and ſilver —who ſought firſt the kingdom of God and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs—who preferred ſpiritual and eternal joys, before the richeſt poſſeſſions of this world—who lov'd their neighbor as themſelves, exerciſed kindneſs to all as they had opportunity, and did to others as they would that others ſhould do unto them—who lov'd their country and the church, more than their own lives and eſtates—whoſe bowels were moved with compaſſion for the poor, who

pitied the ſuffering, ſympathized with the afflicted, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to promote the welfare of mankind, relieved the widow, aſſiſted the fatherleſs, fed the hungry, gave drink to the thirſty, took the ſtranger into their houſes, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed the naked, viſited and aſſiſted the ſick and the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Theſe are the happy ſouls who dwell with God in Zion. But an <hi>extortioner</hi> and an oppreſſor is a character the very reverſe of all theſe. He cannot therefore without repentance and reformation, inherit the kingdom of God. If ſuch an one was admitted into heaven, he would find no ſuitable company, occupation or entertainment there; he would find no one there with whom he could converſe concerning ſchemes to amaſs wealth—he would find none from whom he could greedily gain by <hi>extortion;</hi> there is no trade nor merchandize, no buying nor ſelling in that bleſſed world; there he could not engroſs, foreſtall, and purſue that lucrative buſineſs which was his chief delight and concern upon earth: Heaven would be a diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble place to him, and therefore he would be excluded from it as utterly unworthy of, and unfit for its ſpiritual, holy, and glorious enjoyments—there would be great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſhould he be permitted to reſide in the celeſtial city, that he would rob it of its pure gold and precious ſtones.</p>
            <p>THUS <hi>extortion</hi> debaſes the ſoul, renders it averſe to God and religion, pulls down the vengeance of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty upon it in this life, and expoſes it to eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the life to come. Theſe are the melancholly

Many reſpectable families who preferred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, liberty, and the welfare of their country, to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſt, forſook their eſtates, their houſes, lands, and means of ſubſiſtence, with a ſmall pittance, to ſeek an aſylum, a place of refuge among their brethren in the uninvaded States; and thoſe brethren from whom they have a right to expect all the compaſſion, charity, and kind offices of chriſtian benevolence; inſtead of helping, pitying, and ſupporting them under their misfortunes, are picking their pockets, obliging them to ſell the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of their broken fortunes to keep themſelves from ſtarving, and taking from them their ſcanty pittance, by exorbitant prices for the neceſſaries of life. Thoſe refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gees, who are thus ſqueeſed and oppreſſed by their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, will naturally be filled with indignation againſt them, and muſt think that thoſe perſons have no right to complain of the oppreſſion of Great-Britain, nay cannot ſeriouſly oppoſe it, who oppreſs one another. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity and oppreſſion, has driven many friends of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty to throw themſelves upon the mercy of the enemy, who, not long before, had bravely fought againſt them. Many left their poſſeſſions in New-York and Long-Iſland, but meeting with little kindneſs and hoſpitality, and being likely to want both food and cloathing in New-England, they, in the midſt of their diſtreſs, and in the bitterneſs of their ſoul, returned to their habitations, thinking that the oppreſſion of the enemy was leſs diſtreſſing, than that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015859_0023_0F9A2F94500BFC88"/>
of their unnatural brethren. The New-England States have the only ports that are free for the trade and naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the friends of liberty—New-York, New-Jerſey, and Pennſylvania, are by the enemy excluded from them. If they would fetch from hence the foreign merchandize they ſo greatly need, they cannot come, but at an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous expence, and when they are here, they can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe but little, the price of things being exorbitant and unparalleled. No one can tell, except thoſe who have been eye witneſſes of it, how great are the ſufferings of our brethren in the middle colonies, and how grievous and diſtreſſing our <hi>extortion</hi> is to them: It naturally tends to enkindle hatred, and the moſt implacable animoſity— It tends to divide our councils, weaken our efforts in the field, and ſet us together by the ears—This <hi>extortion</hi> is the more odious and unnatural, as the ſouthern States had ſo much companion with New-England in her diſtreſs, and ſent ſo many valuable preſents for the relief of her poor; and now the ſeat of war being removed to ſuch a diſtance from us, numbers of this country ſeem to be ſo far from ſympathizing with their ſuffering brethren, that they endeavor to profit by their misfortunes. Inſtead of keeping our men at home, that we may compleat our quotas of the continental army—ſtrengthen the hands of our brave, prudent, and worthy General, and enable him to make one great effort for the relief and deliverance of our diſtreſſed brethren, we are employing our ſoldiers on the watry element for our perſonal advantage; although

            <p>THERE never was, I think, a better opportunity than now preſents itſelf, to put an end to the preſent ruinous war; and perhaps this let ſlip and neglected, another may never come. But inſtead of ſeizing the opportunity, many ſeem to conſider this war as a commercial one, where their primary deſign is to manage it ſo as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their own filthy lucre. O ſordid love of gain to what a mean and pernicious conduct doſt thou not impel ignoble and grovling minds.

We are obliged to pay as much for one campaign now, as ought to have ſerved for four or five. As money is the ſinews of war, in proportion as that is depreciated, the means and power of defence are weakened; and our country is expoſed to ruin, ſlaughter, and devaſtation. The ſucceſs of our cauſe depends upon the credit of the Congreſs, and the bills they have emitted: but if the credit of thoſe bills is loſt, how can the cauſe be ſupported.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THIS oppreſſion and <hi>extortion</hi> has a tendency to ruin diminiſh and diſcourage the army, upon whom, under God, the ſafety and defence of our country depends. Is it not extremely unreaſonable, cruel, and unjuſt, that a number of brave men who love their country more than their own lives, families, and private intereſts, ſhould, by infernal <hi>extortion,</hi> have their wages reduced to nothing, and be deprived of the neceſſaries of life. Theſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py men expoſe themſelves to Summer's heat and Winter's
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015859_0026_0F9A2F9690F3C478"/>
cold—to froſt, rain, and ſnow; to dews, damps, and piercing winds—they are expoſed to continual watchings, dangers, and alarms—to fluxes, fevers, dropſies, agues, pleuriſies, conſumptions, and other diſtempers—their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions are broken by continual hardſhips—they leave their peaceful habitations, their dear parents, their wives and children, and march through the moſt tedious roads, ſleep in miſerable tents or huts, and are often expoſed to the chilling, piercing, freezing, wintry air without any covering—they are cloathed with rags, and often infeſted with filthy vermin. Farmers ſhut their doors upon them, will afford them no entertainment, and will give them nothing, or but a trifle for their money—Without ſhoes they march on the ſnow and ice barefooted, and mark their way with blood. Sometimes they are taken priſoners by the enemy, are cruelly kicked, beaten, and inſulted—ſometimes are ſtabbed with bayonets, or hack'd in pieces with broad-ſwords and cutlaſſes— Sometimes they are put in nauſeous ſuffocating dungeons, priſons, guardſhips, full of ſtench and diſeaſe, where they contract mortal diſtempers, linger away a miſerable exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and are ſtarved to death; ſometimes they are broken under arms; have a hand or a leg lopped off, are fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully maimed, or receive a mortal, excruciating wound, which makes them rend the heaven with their cries. No tongue can paint; no imagination can conceive, what agonies, what tortures, what anguiſh they ſuffer—their families are ſtarving at home, whilſt they are dying by
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015859_0027_0F9A2F9750718C88"/>
inches in camps and fields of battle. All this they do and ſuffer for their country; and yet, O barbarous and unfeeling ingratitude! their country is inſenſible of their ſervices and ſufferings—and all their recompence is a little ragged paper money, which their brethren are ſtriving to render of no value. The hard hearted <hi>extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner</hi> has no compaſſion or ſympathy with theſe poor devoted bleeding victims, but is ſtriving to grow rich by their blood, wounds, miſeries, and ſlaughter—by the ruin of theſe brave men and their families—How hard, how cruel is this! Who would wonder if they ſhould exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the authors of their unparalleled ſufferings, quit the army, and never more fight for their ungrateful country. Who can wonder if any more troops ſhould refuſe to enliſt, when they conſider what diſcouragements, <hi>extortion</hi> has thrown in their way. What generous ſoldier's breaſt would not be fir'd with indignation, to think that whilſt he is ruining health, life, and family, and undergoing all the hardſhips of a military life for his country—the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner</hi> ſhould be only intent upon his gain and his eaſe, and do nothing for his comfort, or the welfare of his family, but every thing to ruin them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. OPPRESSION and <hi>extortion</hi> naturally tend moſt to the ruin of thoſe who ſeem leaſt to deſerve it; and whoſe ſufferings are a great ſin and reproach to their country: I mean the widows and fatherleſs, miniſters of the goſpel —Schoolmaſters, the poor, the aged, the infirm—thoſe
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015859_0028_0F9A2F980F87D098"/>
who are retired from worldly buſineſs on account of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, contemplative life, or for the public good. It has been obſerved that the miniſters of the goſpel have been true and faſt friends to the freedom of America; have exerted their influence and abilities, to rouſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eir coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen to a ſenſe of their danger—have watched over their liberties, and endeavored to animate them bravely to oppoſe tyranny and oppreſſion. Now by the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Extortion, their ſalaries, as well as thoſe of the inſtructors of youth are reduced to but a fourth or fifth part of their value. The widows and fatherleſs, of whoſe intereſts every community, and every chriſtian ſhould be peculiarly tender, are exceedingly injured by the depreciation of the Continental currency—their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes being leſſened as much as the abovementioned ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries—Many men of worth and probity who living on their means, devote their time and talents to the ſervice of their country, are ſpending their fortunes, whilſt the moſt worthleſs members of ſociety, and perſons of the leaſt merit, conſcience, honor, integrity, and love to their country are increaſing theirs. But I hope that times ſo pernicious to the beſt, and ſo profitable to the worſt of men, will not long continue. Extortion in a ſpecial manner (ſays one) "is very unmerciful and diſtreſſing to the poor, their circumſtances call for our pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. But what doth the extortioner? Inſtead of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording relief, he adds to their miſeries and wants. Yea further, is not Extortion in a great meaſure the cauſe of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015859_0029_0F9A2F98D03A6758"/>
their miſery? Doth it not bring the diſtreſſing calamity of pinching want upon thouſands, who otherwiſe might have been ſtrangers to ſuch deep affliction forever! What a ſhocking reflection doth this afford! What complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy can the Extortioner take in his unjuſt gain, while ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from whom he has extorted it and who are intitled to his mercy and compaſſion, may be now groaning and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for want? at leaſt it is not owing to his benevolence if they are not."</p>
            <p n="5">5. Oppreſſion and Extortion naturally tend to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in of thoſe very perſons that practice them. I have ſhewn their obvious tendency to ruin the army and the country, and in their ruin Extortioners will be involved as much, if not more than others. I have alſo ſhewn that ill-got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wealth is a curſe to its poſſeſſors and their poſterity. If the enemy ſhould prevail, what will all their bundles of Continental Bills avail? they will be probably of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more worth than ſo much waſte paper. By his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and exorbitant profits, the Extortioner is making a ſword to pierce his own bowels, and he is pulling down the pillars that ſupport the goodly fabric of liberty and property, which will fall upon his head and cruſh him with its ruins. Extortioners may think they are ſafe, becauſe the ſeat of war is at a diſtance; but if the Southern States are ſubdued, it is to be feared theſe Northern Colonies will ſhare the ſame fate, and if they are conquered, their ſufferings probably will be greater
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015859_0030_0F9A2F9A08AD4870"/>
than others, as they have moſt vigorouſly oppoſed the common oppreſſors—therefore it is much better for them to fight the enemy where they are, than to have to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with them at home—the moſt prudent ſtep is to make one great effort now, before the enemy make any farther conqueſts; for I imagine the more places they have in their poſſeſſion, humanly ſpeaking, there is the greater probability of our deſtruction and their ſucceſs. If, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of trying to gain by Extortion, General Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton had been properly ſupported, it is probable the enemy would not have been now in Philadelphia. How painful is the conſideration, that a brave people, ſo zealous for Liberty, ſo prodigal of their blood in it's cauſe, ſhould now endanger it by that mean, ſcandalous, mercenary, ſordid vice; the vile nature, baſeneſs, and tendency of which I have been endeavouring to ſet before you. How diſtreſſing the idea, that a people, who were the foremoſt for the public good, ſhould now be ready to ſacrifice it for the baſeſt ſelf-intereſt, and to a ſordid deſire of filthy lucre! What will Europe think of it? What will the reſt of the States ſay of it? Will they not be ready to ſuppoſe that all the boaſts of patriotiſm and public virtue in this country were falſe, and that the moſt deteſtable views of private advantage lay concealed under all thoſe fair and ſpecious appearances? What will poſterity think of you? Your renowned anceſtors left Great-Britain and all their intereſt in it, brav'd the fury of the Atlantic, came to this once barren and howling wilderneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015859_0031_0F9A2F9A4FF8F188"/>
themſelves to Savage cruelty for the ſake of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and yet their poſterity ſacrifice that invaluable Jewel, for a little pelf, for a little white or yellow dirt, for a few bundles of paper money.</p>
            <p>ARE not ſuch degenerate men like the mercenary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Balaam, curſing their country for the wages of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs? For by what better name can I call the profits of <hi>extortioners</hi> than the wages of unrighteouſneſs? Are they not obtained in direct oppoſition to the advice of Congreſs, whom we all pretend (and beſure ought above all men) to reverence and reſpect; to the laws of our own repreſentatives, whom (if we deſire the public good) we never were under ſtronger obligations to obey? Thus we teach the enemy to deſpiſe thoſe honorable and reſpectable aſſemblies, to whom we owe uncommon love, eſteem, and gratitude—who for our ſakes have ſtood in the gap and expoſed themſelves to the hotteſt rage of a cruel, bloody, and vindictive miniſtry—who have expoſed their perſons, lives, families, and eſtates, to the utmoſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of tyranny and oppreſſion. If the States of New-England had complied with the Regulations of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, this <hi>extortion</hi> and oppreſſion had never been. What an infamous blot, never to be effaced will it leave upon their characters—if after having already performed the moſt difficult part in defence of the liberty and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of this vaſt continent, they ſhould now ſuffer it to be ſubdued, through a ſordid attachment to private gain
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:015859_0032_0F9A2F9B0F7FC218"/>
and ſelf-intereſt? Would not poſterity, and generations yet unborn, riſe up and curſe the authors of their ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and miſery. Alaſs! Alaſs! that the liberties of America ſhould be trifled with and loſt, for the profits of <hi>extortion.</hi> I hope no one will be offended at what I ſay —my heart is averſe to diſpleaſe and publiſh diſagreeable things to my brethren, and eſpecially to thoſe whoſe kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I have largely experienced. But I would prefer fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to Chriſt, and the good of my country, before my own private advantage. And I think I have a right to ſpeak freely, as I have left by far the principal part of my fortune, and a ſtate of affluence, for the love of religion, liberty, and my country, and thereby reduced myſelf and a numerous family to want and indigence. But if refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gees leave all for liberty and their country, is it not ſhameful that thoſe who poſſeſs all unhurt, ſhould not be content with a moderate profit, eſpecially after a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful harveſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſiderable ſucceſs at ſea; ſo that they have in a manner, the moſt of the trade and merchandiſe of half America in their hands?—Is not avarice in ſuch circumſtances, unſpeakably baſe and deteſtable? What would an ancient Roman ſay to thoſe <hi>extortioners,</hi> who pretend to be patriots? would he not bluſh at their groſs effrontery? would he not think that the chriſtian religion had debaſed, inſtead of ennobling the human mind? However this vice is not countenanced, but greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Chriſtian religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:015859_0033_0F9A2F9BCFE9BEE8"/>It was a maxim with the Romans <hi>Condonare inimicitias reipublicae</hi>—to ſacrifice their private reſentment and private intereſt to the welfare of the common wealth. Hiſtory affords illuſtrious inſtances of their zeal and magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, their noble diſintereſtedneſs and great ſelf-denial in their country's cauſe—Shall Pagan zeal and patriotſm ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel Chriſtian?—O my brethren, ſuffer it not to be ſaid, to the diſgrace of our moſt holy religion. Deteſt, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a vice ſo contrary to its dictates, and which ſinks you ſo much beneath the Heathen. You have noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of diſintereſted love in your Bibles to animate you to a generous conduct with reſpect to your country. The bleſſed Jeſus, to whom you are indebted for life, and breath, and all things, for all the enjoyments of this life, and the bleſſed hope of a more glorious inheritance in the life to come—this glorious, this divine Saviour, deny'd himſelf, and laid down his life for you, and therefore you ſhould be willing to lay down your lives, and part with your ſubſtance for the brethren, <hi>Although he was rich, rich in all the glories of the divine nature, and rich in all the happineſs of the heavenly world, yet he made himſelf poor for your ſakes, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</hi> All the holy Apoſtles did ſpend and were ſpent for the church and people of God, and did not count their lives dear, if they could thereby promote the happineſs of Men. If they were offered up a ſacrifice for the dear chriſtian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they joy'd and rejoiced with them. All your pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Behold many noble, magnificent, and ſtately churches in New-York, Philadelphia, New-Jerſey, and other places, where once the great Father of the univerſe was worſhiped in ſpirit and truth—where the adoring multitude ſerved God in the beauty of holineſs—where a crucify'd Saviour was preached, and the whole counſel of God faithfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared—See theſe holy temples either ſhut up, or ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prophaned, turned into hoſpitals, ſtables, riding ſchools and theatres, defiled with filth and obſcenity.

of theſe States; weaken and diſſolve the army; deſtroy the Continental Bills of credit; ruin the worthieſt and moſt helpleſs inhabitants of the land; miniſters and poor; widows and fatherleſs; and finally ruin the religion and liberty of America, in which you muſt be involved; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that this <hi>Extortion</hi> is a ſtupid vice, which, while it ruins many worthy members of ſociety, can be of little actual benefit to the <hi>Extortioner</hi> himſelf.
