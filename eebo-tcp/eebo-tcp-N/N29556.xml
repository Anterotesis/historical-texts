      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have now had a Year and an half's Experience of me, which I hope will Confirm you in the Truth of what I have publickly aſſured you of, my beſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for your Service, which I promiſe I will allways juſtly perform.</p>
            <p>I cannot but acknowledge that all your Actions in our laſt meeting gave me great ſatisfaction, for it was managed with that Accord and good agreement, that there was not the leaſt ſhadow or Colour for any ill diſpoſed People to make any malitious remarks upon: And that good Underſtanding which we were ſo happy at firſt to Create, will I hope be mutually preſerved on both ſides; as it is my fixed Reſolution it ſhall be inviolably on mine. After which I will give you all the convincing Proofs of what I have ſolemnly averred, in my Regards for the Province in General, and every one of you in Particular. Wherefore if you labour under any difficulties, I am ready to redreſs them and aſſure you I will ſuppreſs all unneceſſary charges and expences to make you eaſy, And have the Vanity to believe your Examination of the publick Accounts will convince you of what I have already done in that, not having ſince the laſt ASSEMBLY, which is Ten Months ago, Entailed Ten Pounds Charge upon you, or any individual Perſon in the Province: But on the contrary, Averted what lay in my Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GENTLEMEN,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SINCE it is and ought to be the Great End of all GENERAL ASSEMBLY'S, to conſult the Honour of GOD and the Service of their King and Countrey, the Ignominious Report which is handed about by ſome, leads me to acquaint you of an Order of his Moſt Sacred MAJESTY in Council, for the diſanulling the Law which is Entituled the <hi>Act for Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Proteſtant Religion.</hi> The Repealing the ſaid Law, gives no Room to any Perſon to ſuggeſt it's being diſaſſented to, upon any other grounds then it mentions; you having clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and loaded it with things of different Natures, which I hope you will wiſely Correct with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Heſitation. For we are happy under the Wings and Protection of a Prince whoſe Delight is to run the greateſt Hazards for the Conſervation of our Property's, and never yet obſtructed his People in purſuing that Bleſſed Name of Liberty.</p>
            <p>YOU are ſenſible how uſeful Religion is in the good Government of a Nation or Province. It's the uniting the People, the keeping Men good, and deterring them from committing of Rapines of all degrees, upon each other. Much may be ſaid upon this Subject, which is not ſo proper here, and not being my Tallent, neither is it neceſſary, where I am morally aſſured thoſe Perſons to whom I apply, are ſo well inclined, and are ſo good Judges of the Fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences would attend us in the Loſs of that good Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GENTLEMEN,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not here enumerate what other affairs we are to concert this Seſſions of Aſſembly, but will leave you to proceed in the uſual way of Conference and Meſſage, being ready to joyn with you wherein we may promote his Majeſty's Service, on which depends the Good of this Province.</p>
