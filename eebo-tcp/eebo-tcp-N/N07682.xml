            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>REMARKS,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THERE hath lately appear'd a Pamphlet, called the <hi>Quaker Unmask'd,</hi> or <hi>Plain Truth,</hi> a very well wrote Piece indeed, and would be ſtill better, had not the Author made the Hyperbole, his darling Trope.</p>
            <p>A Piece of this nature muſt certainly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the diſcerning, or them who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the late alarming and intereſting Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and who had an Opportunity of ſeeing the Rioter's Friends ſloth and inactivity in endeavouring to ſuppreſs, and their Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and Zeal in forwarding and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unprecedented and lawleſs proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of an ignorant and enthuſiaſtick <hi>Mob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There hath ſeveral Pieces appeared in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, on the Occaſion; but a Piece from that ſide of the Queſtion appearing, was thought impoſſible, without it was one that would be compoſed of Apoligies for, and Palliations of the late intriguing Conduct of a rigid ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Society in this City; but inſtead of that, after favouring the Cauſe in private, to eſpouſe it in public, is ſurprizing to every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and plainly indicates the moſt depravid
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:009813_0003_0F7A5455E7F92398"/>
Ignorance, or that uncommon Audacity, that the Lenity of a Government to ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Monſters is too often productive of.</p>
            <p>It hath been obſerved by the Proprietors of <hi>Negroes,</hi> that there is ſomething ſo peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar in their Diſpoſition, that they cannot bear Indulgence; theſe People I look upon to be under the ſame unhappy Circumſtances, not that I would ſuppoſe it ſo in their original Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, but owing to the Effect their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples have, for they are, and have always been (tho' under the mildeſt of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) a Sett of uneaſy, diſcontented, and innovating People.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Philadelphia</hi> boaſts of better Men than they; Men, who when Occaſion calls, are ready to take up Arms in Oppoſition to the Enemies of her Welfare. Yet ſome of theſe
<q>are called Incendiaries, who are not only enraged themſelves, at their dear Friends the Indians, being ſlain, but would have all the World of their Temper.</q>
Now, what Intereſt can the ſaving the Lives of the Indians be to the <hi>Q—rs,</hi> or what Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage can accrue to them from their Death, I can't conceive, neither hath our Author (after ſeveral low and impertinent Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) be able to determine.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that did take up Arms, I am fully convinced, had no other View in it, than the Welfare of the City, and Perſons acting by
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009813_0004_0F7A5456CA177730"/>
the Principle of Partriotiſm, make this their incumbent Duty, not only to be poſſeſſed of this Principle themſelves, but make (as much as in them lies) Proſelytes to it, or in our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Author's Words,
<q>would have all the World of their Temper.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Narrative</hi> of the Maſſacre, &amp;c. it is a Pamphlet that will bear a recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the Peruſal of every candid Perſon, as there is in it that <hi>Pathos,</hi> that will rouſe the Chriſtian in the Reader, and excite in him an endeavour to prevent the effuſion of human Blood. And the Author is, as the Work ſhews him to be, a Gentleman of Integrity, of impartial Judgement, and of Sentiments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted by infectious P—y.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Theſe compaſſionate and merciful Chriſtians, ſo eaſily affected with Pity for <hi>Indians,</hi> would not grant a ſingle Farthing for the Relief of their Fellow Subjects.</q>
This aſſertion is certainly falſe, and againſt known Truths (but it is needleſs to pick out Paragraphs that are falſe, when there is not a Truth in the whole) for tho' there were no Charity Sermons preached, and no oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Collection made in Public, yet it is well known that there were conſiderable Sums collected and diſtributed among the truly neceſſitous; but perhaps this Aſſertion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from their being none diſtributed at <pb n="5" facs="unknown:009813_0005_0F7A545788EDCFF8"/>
               <hi>Germantown,</hi> a place where ſome People made all their Charity center.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Let us impartially next conſider <hi>Quakers</hi> with Reſpect to Government. Can it be conſiſtent that a Perſon who declares that his Conſcience by divine Inſpiration forbids him to have any Hand in ſhedding Blood, ſhould be intruſted as a Repreſentative for People, who look upon themſelves to be obliged by the Laws of God, the Laws of Nature, and the Laws of their King and Country to take up Arms to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and puniſh thoſe who would deprive them of Life and Property.</q>
If <hi>Q—rs</hi> are under thoſe Circumſtances, ſo improper to repreſent a People, (between whoſe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there is ſo great a Contraſt) why are they choſen as ſuch? They have never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their Seats in the Houſe of Aſſembly by either any ſecret or underſtanding Means, or any open violent Meaſure, but ſo far from that, what few are in the Houſe, have been annually, by public Advertiſments, declaring their deſire of reſigning, and requeſting the Election of others in their Room: If there are ſo many Diſadvantages flow from their being Members of a legiſlative Body, why is not their requeſt complied with? I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it can't be alledged, that the Numbers
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009813_0006_0F7A54587A3DE598"/>
of <hi>Q—rs</hi> in this Province make a Majority of its inhabitants, nor can it be owing to the Paucity of their avowed Enemies the <hi>Pr—ns</hi> (for unhappy for it, it ſwarms with them) but their Conſtituents, upon probation, ſeeing the happy Effects of their upright Conduct in every public Truſt, executive as well as legiſlative, have always endeavoured (tho' contrary to their Inclinations) ſtill to keep them poſſeſſed of it. And I doubt not but this very railer, when the Anniverſary Day of Election comes about, (after an impartial Conſideration of their unexceptionable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and a ſerious Reflection on the Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their Enemies) will be the foremoſt in oppoſing their removal; for his preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, is only owing to a little Heat of Blood, occaſioned by the Miſcarriage of a late Project.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But it hath been proved, by a very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial Oath of a young Man, who hath ſince very unaccountably diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</q>
&amp;c. What a bitter Innuendo is that! But People's knowledge of every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance relative to it, makes the Invective contained in it, recoil with the greater Force upon them. O unhappy Predeſtination! whom I ſuppoſe it was intended to ſcreen and defend.—And believe me my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, thoſe who would be privy to an Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009813_0007_0F7A545A05503EA8"/>
of Murder, and would aſſiſt, when they thought Opportunity favoured the putting the Intention in Execution, would perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate a Murder, and rather than their diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Schemes ſhould prove abortive in any Point, would work upon the Inexperience of a Youth to commit an Act, that will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably redound to the Infamy of his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators. Our Author I believe ſtudies <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> a good deal, as he ſeems to be well ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Art of compoſing Proverbs.—It is a Pity he had not ſome of his Wiſdom too. Here follows an excellent one;
<q>To govern is abſolutely repugnant to the avowed Principles of <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </q>
To be govern'd is abſolutely repugnant to the avowed princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Pr—ns.</hi> Now, to ſum up the Character of the aforemention'd Pamphlet, I think it is really an elegant and perfect Work, and ſo many found Truths interſperſed throughout the whole Piece, makes it ſtill more amiable; and upon the whole makes up what <hi>Longinus</hi> calls the <hi>Sublime.</hi> Altho' I think the Poet hath drawn the Author's Character in the following Lines.</p>
