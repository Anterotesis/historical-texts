            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> WHY are men obliged every year to pay their taxes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To ſupport government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is government?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The government here intended, is the mutual compact of a certain body of people, for the general ſafety of their lives, liberty, and property.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Are all ſyſtems of civil government founded in compact?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No: ſucceſsful robbers and tyrants have founded their ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems in <hi>conqueſt</hi>—enthuſiaſts and prieſt-ridden people have founded theirs in <hi>grace</hi>—while men without merit have founded their ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem in <hi>birth</hi>; but the true principle, that all Gentile nations ſhould found their government upon, is, <hi>compact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Was civil government appointed by the Almighty from the beginning?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It was not; nor was it neceſſary until ſin had intoxicated man with the principle of ſelf-love. The law was not made for a righteous man, but for the diſobedient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What form of government prevailed firſt among mankind?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Patriarchal. The father of a family uſed to exerciſe ſome ſovereignty over his ſucceſſors, until they moved from the city of their father, and became patriarchs themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How long did the world ſtand without any government in it but patriarchal?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:027215_0003_0FD3DF8E1D47D598"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> There was no other kind before the flood (which was more than one thouſand ſix hundred and fifty-five years) nor afterwards till <hi>Nimrod,</hi> two generations after the flood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What was Nimrod?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He was the firſt that began to be a <hi>mighty one</hi> in the earth— He was a <hi>mighty hunter</hi> before the Lord; who hunted beaſts to ſupport his army with; and hunted men to reduce them to his will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What form of government did he adopt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> A kingly form; for the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh. He was the firſt of thoſe pretty creatures, called kings, who reduced others to ſubjection by hunting them like beaſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Did the Almighty ever give a code of political laws to any nation; or are nations left to act at diſcretion in eſtabliſhing forms of government and codes of laws?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Almighty did certainly give the nation of Iſrael a complete code of laws on Sinai and in the wilderneſs, for their rule of conduct in religious, civil, and military life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Were thoſe laws obligatory on other nations?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Laws, that are in themſelves juſt, are binding on all men, but the particular form of many of thoſe laws was peculiar to that nation. The tranſgreſſion of many of thoſe precepts was criminal in that nation, which the Gentiles were never accuſed of by their great apoſtle, PAUL.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What did other nations do, in point of government, while Iſrael was in the wilderneſs and under the regulation of judges?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> When <hi>Nimrod</hi> uſurped the monarch's crown, the ſpirit of domination ran through the world like a raging plague. <hi>Aſhur</hi> went out of the land of Shinar, where Nimrod's ſeat was, and built Nineveh and founded the Aſſyrian monarchy; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of <hi>having kings</hi> and <hi>being kings</hi> prevailed ſo greatly, that every little village had a king. <hi>Abraham,</hi> with three hundred and eighteen ſervants, conquered four of them and their hoſts—<hi>Joſhua</hi> deſtroyed thirty-one—and <hi>Adonibezek</hi> cut off the thumbs and great toes of ſeventy—Alſo eight kings and eleven dukes reigned over Edom, before any in Iſrael.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> In what condition was the nation of Iſrael, after they left Egypt, before <hi>Saul</hi> reigned over them, in regard to their police?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They were in a ſtate of theocracy, the beſt of all ſtates when people have virtue enough to bear it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Were there no men among them who exerciſed dominion over the reſt?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:027215_0004_0FD3DF9255103A28"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> Moſes and Aaron exerciſed divine orders among them; the princes of the tribes and the officers bore authority, and the judges, of whom there were thirteen, had ſome preeminence, but neither of them had the power of making laws; when God appointed them, they were to execute his laws, and no other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Was the code of laws, ordained for the government of Iſrael, ſufficient to govern other nations by, in their very different circumſtances?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It was not: Canaan was an inland country—the people were forbidden to trade with other nations; ſo that no laws were made for navigation, commerce, or union; all of which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in Gentile nations. And, beſide, their civil and religious laws were all blended together. The ſabbath of the ſeventh day —ſeventh year and fiftieth year—the three grand feaſts, and a multitude of ſacrifices, ceremonies, and oblations were enjoined on that people, which things Gentile nations have nothing to do with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Has the <hi>political</hi> part of that conſtitution ever been abuſed by Gentile legiſlatures?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Abundantly ſo, among Gentile nations that have become Chriſtian; for by bringing Chriſtian ſtates upon the ſame footing of the commonwealth of Iſrael, they have ſuppoſed that Chriſtian nations have a juſt right to diſpoſſeſs the Heathen of their lands and make ſlaves of their perſons, as Iſrael ſerved the Canaanites and Jebuſites: for no better claim than this had the European nation to make a ſeizure of America. Nor is this all: but civil rulers, in Chriſtian countries, have taken the liberty of adopting ſuch precepts of the Moſaic conſtitution as ſuited them; and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed thoſe who would not ſubmit, when, at the ſame time, they have left unnoticed a great number of the precepts of Moſes, which were equally obligatory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Has the <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> part of the Moſaic conſtitution ever been abuſed as well as the <hi>political</hi> part?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, and that to a great degree. The church of Iſrael took the whole nation, and none but that nation; whereas Chriſt's church takes no whole nation, but thoſe who fear God and work righteouſneſs in every nation. But almoſt all Chriſtian nations and ſtates (ſince the reign of Conſtantine) have ſought to eſtabliſh national churches: in order to effect which, they have brought in all the <hi>natural ſeed</hi> of the profeſſors into the pales of the church, making no difference between the precious and the vile; and from this foundation they have appealed to the laws of ſtate, inſtead of the laws of Chriſt, to direct their mode of diſcipline. What a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027215_0005_0FD3DF94D9E64F60"/>
ſcandal it is to the Chriſtian name, to ſee church diſcipline exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in a court-houſe, before the judges of the police; to ſee cenſures given at the whipping-poſt and excommunications at the gallows;<note n="*" place="bottom">The Baptiſts and Newlights have been impriſoned, fined, and whipped, and witches and Quakers have been hung in Maſſachuſetts.</note> and for ſmaller breaches, to be admoniſhed by a ſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iff's ſeizing and ſelling cows, &amp;c. or wiping off the admonition by a <hi>pecuniary mulct!</hi> Yet ſuch has been, and ſtill is the caſe, even in New-England, that has made her boaſt of religion and liberty.<note n="†" place="bottom">Seizing and ſelling, for miniſterial tax, is ſtill practiſed in many towns to this day.</note> Circumciſion, as to its firſt inſtitution, was not of Moſes, but of the fathers that lived before Moſes, yet it was enjoined by Moſes to be performed on all the males of Iſrael. From this a great number of eccleſiaſtics have changed blood for water, and ſprinkle their children inſtead of bleeding of them in order to make the goſpel church as extenſive as the church of Iſrael was. Yet many of them will not admit a perſon to go back as far as <hi>John</hi> for the origin of baptiſm, becauſe (ſay they) John's adminiſtration was under the law; yet they will run back two thouſand four hundred years before John for a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of baptiſm.<note n="‡" place="bottom">A Rev. Gentleman in the county of Worceſter, who, like many of his brethren, views John's baptiſm under the law, contends for infant baptiſm from Geneſis <hi>ix. 27.</hi> That the law of Moſes was in force while John lived, and open to the death of Jeſus, I do not deny; but that John baptized in Jordan and Enon, ſuch, and ſuch only, as brought forth fruits of repentance, by any order of the law, will be denied until it can be proved. If no inſtitution ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed before the death of Chriſt is imitable for Chriſtians, the holy Supper ſhould be neglected.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Was not circumciſion to the church of Iſrael, the ſame that water-baptiſm is to the church of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If ſo, the following abſurdities ariſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. None but the males were circumciſed; whereas both males and females are ſprinkled with water. To ſay that the females were <hi>virtually</hi> circumciſed in the males, is juſt as good ſenſe as to ſay the females are <hi>virtually</hi> ſprinkled in the males.</p>
            <p n="2">2. None were ever circumciſed under eight days old, which was the general time appointed; but children are ſprinkled ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:027215_0006_0FD3DF94DD019920"/>
before they are eight hours old. Midwives have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to do it in caſe death was nearer than a prieſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Circumciſion was never a prieſtly rite; but fathers, maſters, mothers, and friends did the work; but ſprinkling is ſuppoſed to be a miniſterial rite.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whatever circumciſion figured out, it was ſomething that was wrought in the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and done <hi>without hands;</hi> and as there is nothing done by men, that is called <hi>baptiſm by water,</hi> either ſprinkling, pouring, or dipping, that can poſſibly change the ſpirit; ſo neither of them are effected without the hands of men. The concluſion therefore is, that the firſt did not figure out the laſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. None but thoſe who were circumciſed were to inherit Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan; of courſe then, none but thoſe who are baptized with water can inherit heaven; which is a conſequence inadmiſſible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What do you think of the Britiſh conſtitution of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There is no conſtitution in Britain—It is ſaid, in England that there are three things unknown, viz. The prerogatives of the crown—The privileges of parliament—and the liberty of the people. Theſe things are facts, for although they conſider the ſeventy-two articles of the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> as the baſis of their government, yet from that baſis they have never formed a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to deſcribe the limits of each department of government. So that precedents and parliamentary acts are all the conſtitution they have.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How does government operate in England?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> A hereditary king, of the Proteſtant faith, muſt always fill the throne, whether he be a wiſe man or a dunce. A houſe of lords, of the hereditary mould, muſt always check the houſe of commons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the houſe of commons?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is a repreſentative body of a ſmall part of the nation, choſen once in ſeven years. It is called the houſe of <hi>commons,</hi> becauſe the houſe of lords is a houſe of <hi>uncommons,</hi> ſuppoſed to be a ſpecies of beings, like the <hi>Genii</hi> of the Mahometans, between angels and men, born only to rule, without having a fellow feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thoſe whom they rule over.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What condition has that form of government reduced the people to?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It has ſunk them in a debt of more than two hundred and eighty millions; ſo that the intereſt of their debt, together with the ſupport of the civil and military liſts, impoſes an annual tax
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:027215_0007_0FD3DF964D8E42B8"/>
on the people equal to thirty ſhillings ſterling per ſoul, and at the expiration of the year the nation is a million pounds more in debt than at the beginning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How ſtand religious concerns in England?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The thirty-nine articles and book of common prayer are eſtabliſhed by law. No man can fill any office in the civil or military departments without taking an oath to ſupport them, and upon receiving a commiſſion he muſt ſeal his oath with the eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt: this is true of all, ſaving the members of parliament, who are obliged only to take the oath of abjuration, <hi>curſe Pope and Papiſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But are there none in England that diſſent from the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed religion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Many of them, of various denominations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How do they fare?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They are deprived of ſuch advantages as the Conformiſts enjoy: In addition to all their proſcriptions, the tenth part of all their income is taken from them to ſupport prieſts that they never hear, and in whom they place no confidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is it ſuppoſed that the articles and forms of the church of England are ſo perfect that they cannot be mended?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They are always perfect when Diſſenters are handled. <hi>Edward Wrightman</hi> was burnt to death at Litchfield, by a warrant from prince <hi>James,</hi> for ſaying that the worſhip of God was not fully deſcribed in the thirty-nine articles and book of common prayers; and nearly eight thouſand loſt their property, liberties and lives in the reign of the merciful king <hi>Charles,</hi> becauſe they could not, would not ſay, that they believed what they could not believe, and ſo conform to the eſtabliſhed worſhip.</p>
            <p>They are alſo always perfect when a candidate enters into holy orders; for all of them do ſolemnly declare that they give their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned aſſent and conſent to all and every thing contained in that book; and yet, from the firſt formation of that book, it has paſt above ſix hundred alterations; and to this day, many parts of it are complained of by many of the Epiſcopal clergymen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What have you to ſay about the Federal Conſtitution of America?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is a novelty in the world: Partly confederate and partly conſolidate. Partly directly elective, and partly elective one or two removes from the people; but one of the great excellencies of the Conſtitution is, that no religious teſt is ever to be required to qualify any officer in any part of the government. To ſay that the Conſtitution is perfect, would be too high an encomium upon
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027215_0008_0FD3DF97EAF9ADB0"/>
the fallibility of the framers of it; yet this may be ſaid, that it is the beſt national machine that is now in exiſtence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What think you of the Conſtitution of Maſſachuſetts?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is as good a performance as could be expected in a ſtate where religious bigotry and enthuſiaſm have been ſo predominant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is your opinion of having a <hi>bill of rights</hi> to a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of government?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Whenever it is underſtood, that all power is in the monarch —that ſubjects poſſeſs nothing of their own, but receive all from the potentate; then the liberty of the people is commenſurate with the <hi>bill of rights</hi> that is ſqueezed out of the monarch.</p>
            <p>After the conqueſt of <hi>William,</hi> the government of England was completely monarchical, until the reign of <hi>king John,</hi> when the <hi>Magna Charta</hi> was given to the people: this has often been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in America as a ſufficient reaſon for a <hi>bill of rights,</hi> to pref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace each conſtitution: but in republican, repreſentative govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, like thoſe of America, where it is underſtood that all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is originally in the <hi>people,</hi> and that all is ſtill retained in their hands, except ſo much as for a limited time is given to the rulers, where is the propriety of having a bill of rights? In this view, no ſuch bill is found in the Federal Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>But it is not my intention, at this time, to diſpute the point of propriety or impropriety of a bill of rights; but ſhall only add that the liberty of the people depends more upon the organization of government, the reſponſibility of rulers, and the faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the officers, than it does upon any bill of rights that can be named.</p>
            <p>The illuſtrious patriots of Maſſachuſetts, in framing their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of government in 1780, prepared a bill of rights, which is adopted in the ſtate, on which I ſhall make ſome remarks. The bill contains thirty articles, upon a few of which I ſhall animadvert.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond article it is ſaid, "It is the right and duty of all men publickly and at ſtated ſeaſons to worſhip the Supreme Being." This article would read much better in a catechiſm than in a ſtate conſtitution; and ſound more concordant in a pulpit than in a ſtate-houſe.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe there are in Maſſachuſetts a number of Pagans and Deiſts: the Pagans, upon hearing that it is their <hi>duty</hi> to worſhip <hi>one</hi> Supreme Being only, muſt conſequently renounce all other deities whom they have been taught to adore; here their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences muſt be diſpenſed with, or the conſtitution broken. The Deiſt (who believes all religion to be a cheat) muſt either act the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027215_0009_0FD3DF997AEEDA60"/>
hypocrite, or diſregard the ſupreme law of the State. This duty is called a <hi>right:</hi> if every man has this <hi>right,</hi> then he has a <hi>right</hi> to judge for himſelf, and will hardly thank any body for turning his right into what they may call a duty. That it is the duty of men, and women too, to worſhip God publickly, I heartily believe; but that it is the duty or wiſdom of a convention or legiſlature to enjoin it on others, is called in queſtion; and will be, until an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance can be given in the New Teſtament, that Jeſus or his apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles gave orders therefor to the rulers of this world.</p>
            <p>It is the duty of men to repent and believe: to worſhip God in their cloſets and families as well as in public: and the reaſon why public worſhip is enjoined by authority, and private worſhip is omitted, is only to pave the way for ſome religious eſtabliſhment by human law, and force taxes from the people to ſupport ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricious prieſts.</p>
            <p>What leads legiſlators into this error, is confounding <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>crimes</hi> together; making no difference between <hi>moral evil</hi> and <hi>ſtate rebellion:</hi> not conſidering that a man may be infected with moral evil, and yet be guilty of no crime, puniſhable by law. If a man worſhips one God, three Gods, twenty Gods or no God; if he pays adoration one day in a week, ſeven days or no day; wherein does he injure the life, liberty or property of another? Let any or all theſe actions be ſuppoſed to be religious evils of an enormous ſize; yet they are not crimes to be puniſhed by the laws of ſtate; which extend no further (in juſtice) than to puniſh the man who works ill to his neighbour.</p>
            <p>When civil rulers undertake to make laws againſt moral evil, and puniſh men for heterodoxy in religion, they often run to grand extremes. The eating of a potatoe for food, and uſing emeticks for phyſic, were once conſidered in France as religious evils. <hi>Galileo</hi> was once excommunicated and baniſhed by the Pope's bull, as a man of dangerous hereſy, becauſe he believed in the Copernican ſyſtem. The ancients were treated as hereticks, who believed they had antipodes. The court of Zurich made a law to drown Felix Mentz with water, becauſe he was baptized in water. In ſhort, volumes might be written and have been written to ſhow what havock among men, the principle of mixing <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>crimes</hi> together has effected; while men in power have taken their own opinions as infallible teſts of right and wrong.</p>
            <p>The third article of the <hi>bill of rights</hi> is ſimilar to the ſecond in its ſtructure. It is ſaid, "The people of this commonwealth have a right to inveſt their legiſlature with power to authoriſe and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:027215_0010_0FD3DF9D0E49DA28"/>
require, and the legiſlature ſhall from time to time authoriſe and require the ſeveral towns, pariſhes, &amp;c. to make ſuitable proviſion, at their own expenſe, for the inſtitution of the public worſhip of God, and for the ſupport and maintenance of public <hi>Proteſtant</hi> teachers, in all caſes where ſuch proviſion ſhall not be made vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untarily."</p>
            <p>If the legiſlature of this commonwealth have that power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and eſtabliſh that religion, which they believe is the beſt in the world, by the ſame rule all the legiſlatures of all the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, ſtates, kingdoms and empires that are in the world, and that have been in the world, may claim the ſame.</p>
            <p>If dumb idols are called devils, and idolatry is the religion of the devil, this claim of power brings all the Gentile nations under the government of the devil. Idolatry was eſtabliſhed by this pretended power in the Gentile nations, when the Chriſtian religion firſt was ſent among them: now if that eſtabliſhment was right, then the Apoſtles were wrong in ſeparating ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands from the eſtabliſhed religion. They were guilty of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting a ſchiſm, and government was innocent in inflicting ſuch puniſhment upon them and their adherents. In proceſs of time the religion of Chriſt prevailed ſo far that it was eſtabliſhed in the empire of Rome; at which epocha it received a deadly wound, which gradually reduced it to ſuperſtition, fraud and ignorance: ſo that in the ſixteenth century a number of kingdoms and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities proteſted againſt the church of Rome: But this was a grand piece of obſtinacy, if rulers have the power that the article under conſideration ſays belongs to the legiſlature of Maſſachuſetts. Theſe Proteſtants, eſpecially in England, retained ſo many of the Papal relicks, that great numbers became Nonconformiſts: Here they repeated their crime, rejecting the Engliſh eſtabliſhment, as well as that of Rome. Some of thoſe Nonconformiſts came into New England, and ſoon began to exerciſe that power which the bill of rights ſays they have a right to.</p>
            <p>Now, how ſhall all theſe evils be remedied? Anſwer—All who have diſſented from the eſtabliſhed religion of New England muſt return to that fold, and confeſs their errors—Then all muſt return to the church of England and ſubmit to that eſtabliſhment—Then, joining with the Epiſcopalians, all muſt apply to the Pope for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and ſubmit to his uncontrolable authority—Then, with the Papiſts, all muſt return to the Pagans, and ſubmit to Polytheiſm. If the <hi>power</hi> ſpoken of is right, then this mode of procedure is right: and therefore, if it is not the natural conſequence of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027215_0011_0FD3DF9FACDE57E8"/>
eſtabliſhments by human law, to bring all men under the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment and religion of the devil, it is becauſe there is neither devil nor deviliſh religion in the world.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved, that "The people of this commonwealth have a right to inveſt their legiſlature with this power." But where do they get this right? The univerſe is compoſed of a multitude of units; ſo this commonwealth is formed by a number of individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals. The confederacy is the ſovereign, and rulers are agents; and how can the creature have more power than the Creator? <hi>Propter quod unum quodque eſt tale, illud ipſum eſt magis tale.</hi> Whatever is found in the commonwealth, in aggregate, is found in ſmall, eſſential particles among all the individuals: if therefore <hi>this power</hi> is in the commonwealth, each individual has a little of it in his own breaſt; and has a right to exerciſe it towards his neighbour, and force him to worſhip God, when, where and in ſuch a manner as he himſelf ſhall chuſe; and if this be the caſe, what means the firſt article in the <hi>bill of rights;</hi> where it is ſaid, "all men are born free and equal." To be conſiſtent, either that clauſe ſhould be eraſed, or the power contended for given up.</p>
            <p>This power is to be uſed to oblige people "to make ſuitable proviſion, at their own expenſe, for the inſtitution of the public worſhip of God." I have long been of the belief that Jeſus Chriſt inſtituted his worſhip; and if my faith is well founded, then it is not left for rulers to do in theſe days: But ſurely nothing more can be meant by it, than, that the legiſlature ſhall incorporate religious ſocieties, and oblige them to build houſes for public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Pariſhes, precincts, and religious ſocieties politically embod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied, are phraſes not known in the New Teſtament—convey ideas contrary to the ſpirit of the goſpel, and pave the way for force and cruelty, inadmiſſible in Chriſt's kingdom, which is not of this world. If a number of real ſaints are incorporated by human law, they cannot be a church of Chriſt, (by virtue of that forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) but a creature of ſtate.</p>
            <p>This power is further to be exerciſed to require the people to be at expenſe "for the ſupport and maintenance of public <hi>Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi> teachers."</p>
            <p>Preaching by the day—by the month—by the year—annual taxes for preaching—what ſtrange ſounds theſe are! not ſtrange in theſe days; but ſuch ſtrangers in the New Teſtament, that they are not to be found there. How inſignificant would the federal government be, if it was dependent on the laws of the ſtates to ſupport its officers! That government that has not force enough
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027215_0012_0FD3DFA4A5D0ADE8"/>
in it to ſupport its officers will ſoon fall: Juſt ſo with the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Jeſus. The author of our religion has appointed a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for his teachers; but has never told the rulers of this world to interfere in the matter.</p>
            <p>How much did John the Baptiſt, Jeſus, Peter, James or John aſk per year? Anſwer.—I know not. If a man preaches Jeſus, he cannot aſk enough for it; the gold of Ophir cannot equal it: If he preaches <hi>himſelf,</hi> it is good for nothing.</p>
            <p>Strange it is, that men ſhould pretend to be ſent by God to preach to ſinners; and yet will not do the work of the Lord, unleſs they can get men to be legal bondſmen for Jehovah.</p>
            <p>To read in the New Teſtament that the LORD has ordained that thoſe that preach the goſpel ſhall live by its inſtitutions and precepts, ſounds very harmonical; but to read in a ſtate conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the legiſlature ſhall require men to maintain teachers of piety, religion and morality, ſounds very diſcordant.</p>
            <p>We may next obſerve, that the legiſlature of Maſſachuſetts have not got power to provide for any public teachers, except they are <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> Pagans, Turks and Jews muſt not only preach for nothing; but Papiſts, thoſe marvellous Chriſtians, cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a maintenance for their preachers by the laws of this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Such preachers muſt either be ſupported voluntarily, ſupport themſelves, or ſtarve. Is this good policy? Should one ſect be pampered above others? Should not government protect all kinds of people, of every ſpecies of religion, without ſhowing the leaſt partiality? Has not the world had enough proofs of the impolicy and cruelty of favouring a Jew more than a Pagan, Turk or Chriſtian; or a Chriſtian more than either of them? Why ſhould a man be proſcribed or any wiſe diſgraced for being a Jew, Turk, Pagan, or a Chriſtian of any denomination, when his talents and veracity (as a civilian) entitle him to the confidence of the public?</p>
            <p>The next thing to be noticed is, that the legiſlature of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts is inveſted with power and "authority to enjoin upon all the ſubjects an attendance upon the inſtructions of the public teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers—at ſtated times and ſeaſons." By which ſtated times, no doubt, is meant the days called Sabbaths, Sundays, (Sondays) Firſt-days or Lord's-days. I ſhall not diſpute the point about the holy day, whether it was enjoined on men from the beginning, or never before the manna was given in the wilderneſs—whether the fourth commandment in the decalogue was of a moral or ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial nature—whether it was binding on all nations, or only on Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael—whether
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027215_0013_0FD3CB92D664C5D8"/>
the ſame day of the week is to be kept to the end of the world—whether the ſeventh part of time anſwers the end of the law, or whether the ſeventh day is changed for the firſt; but ſhall uſe the liberty of ſaying, that the appointment of ſuch ſtated, holy days, is no part of human legiſlation. I cannot ſee upon what principle of natural right, the people of Maſſachuſetts could inveſt their legiſlature with that power; and as I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it from the ſource of natural right, ſo neither can I find a hint of it in the New Teſtament, that Jeſus or his Apoſtles ever reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any for the neglect of that day; or that ever they called upon civil rulers to make any penal laws about it. And it is curious to ſee what havock rulers make of good ſenſe whenever they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to legaliſe ſaid day. No longer ago than 1791 the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this commonwealth made a ſabbatical law; wherein, for the ground work, they ſay, that the ſeventh part of time is to be kept holy: But how do they calculate time? A man on a journey may travel until Saturday night, midnight, and begin again on Sunday at ſundown: if eighteen hours is the ſeventh part of a week, then their calculation is good; but being conſcious that it is not, they make it up (i. e. pay what they have borrowed) out of recreation; for ſuch exerciſe muſt ceaſe on Saturday at the going down of the ſun, and continue to ceaſe till Sunday midnight. It may further be obſerved, that the law of God and the laws of men differ widely in phraſe: the law that enjoined the obſervance of the ſeventh day on the nation of Iſrael, which came from JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH, did not except the works of neceſſity and mercy; neither man, maid nor beaſt were to work—but a little ways were they to travel—a bundle of ſticks was not to be gathered and laid on the fire—nor had they any orders to aſſemble on that day, in a ſtated manner, to read the law of Moſes. It was to be a day of reſt, which gave it the name <hi>Sabbath:</hi> but the laws of men have ſo many exceptions, that nothing and any thing are done on ſaid day.</p>
            <p>But however theſe things are, the legiſlature of this ſtate is to oblige the people to aſſemble on theſe ſtated times, to hear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of theſe teachers of piety, religion and morality, if there be any on whoſe inſtructions they can conſcientiouſly and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently attend. Here is a gap wide enough for any man to creep out. If neglecting to go to meeting is not juſtified by pleading inconveniency, his conſcience will ſoon do it; but whether he goes to church or not, his pennies muſt go to the treaſurer's purſe.</p>
            <p>It is true that on ſect of Proteſtant Chriſtians has as fair an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to be incorporated as another; but there are many who
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027215_0014_0FD3DFA6E39FD3C8"/>
juſtly deſpiſe the idea of religious incorporation by human law; and therefore thoſe who do not, have an undue advantage of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Suppoſing, in France, the National Convention ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree that all ſects of Chriſtians, that believed that kings, in certain caſes, might wear their heads and crowns upon them, ſhould have equal privileges in France; I aſk, whether the Jacobin party would ſhare equal favours with the royaliſts? So in this caſe, all ſects of Proteſtant Chriſtians that chuſe to be incorporated, may elect their own teachers and contract with them for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and aſſeſs it upon all within their reſpective precincts; but thoſe who cannot, in conſcience, accord with this legal religion, muſt pay their tax with the reſt, and be at the trouble of drawing it out of the treaſury again, which ſometimes occaſions vexatious lawſuits.</p>
            <p>Now, if it ſhould be argued that a great many in this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth believe, in their conſciences, that it is the beſt way to ſerve God, to have ſocieties incorporated by law, and levy a tax upon all to ſupport their worſhip and maintain their teachers, how eaſily the above evils might be prevented, and all enjoy liberty of conſcience. If thoſe only, who are conſcientious in legal religion, are incorporated, and tax none but themſelves, there will be no cruel diſtraining from thoſe whoſe conſciences dictate another mode of worſhip. A man can cheerfully work when he verily believes he is doing God ſervice; a man therefore who believes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious incorporation, can joyfully give in his name to be taxed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he who believes that the law has nothing to do about religious worſhip, can as joyfully ſtay at home. The laſt of theſe have as good grounds to judge that the firſt plead conſcience for cruelty, as the firſt have to judge that the laſt plead conſcience for covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
            <p>But there is no need for a conſtitutional clauſe about things of this nature; for if a number of men contract with a preacher for a year, or for life, the bond which they give him, is as recoverable by law as any bond whatever; but the poiſon of ſuch contracts is, including thoſe who do not act voluntarily, and perpetuating them upon their ſucceſſors or natural offspring.</p>
            <p>The laſt clauſe of the third article reads thus:</p>
            <p>"And every denomination of Chriſtians, demeaning themſelves peaceably, and as good ſubjects of the commonwealth, ſhall be equally under the protection of the law; and no ſubordination of any one ſect or denomination to another, ſhall ever be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by law."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:027215_0015_0FD3DFA85F3CD768"/>On this ſection I have ſeveral remarks to make:</p>
            <p>Firſt. The firſt part of it is very liberal, to a certain degree; but if it read <hi>all men</hi> inſtead of <hi>every denomination of Chriſtians,</hi> it would be unexceptionable.</p>
            <p>When the Pagans were favoured, by law, more than Chriſtians, what devaſtation it made in the empire of Rome, in the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of the Chriſtian religion, until the reign of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> In the three firſt centuries almoſt two millions of lives were loſt for conſcience ſake. Theſe were men, women, and children, who were as good ſubjects of ſtate as any in the empire. After the change in the empire, when the Chriſtian religion became eſtabliſhed by law, the Pagans ſuffered in the ſame manner that the Chriſtians had done in the ten preceding perſecutions. Who can read the hiſtory of their ſufferings without ſeeing the bad policy of eſtabliſhing either of the religions in the empire!</p>
            <p>Second. Although the clauſe now under conſideration is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what liberal, indeed entirely ſo among Chriſtians, yet it no ways accords with a former clauſe in the ſame article, where the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature is forbidden to incorporate any Chriſtians but <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> at leaſt, are not veſted with power to do it. <hi>Proteſtants</hi> only can be formed into religious ſocieties and diſtrain for a maintenance for their teachers.</p>
            <p>One of two things muſt be granted; either that Papiſts are no Chriſtians, or that there is a partiality eſtabliſhed. Among little-ſouled bigots, who believe nobody right but themſelves, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Chriſtian religion to their own ſect, and conclude that they have the excluſive right to monopolize ſalvation, it would not be ſtrange to hear that Papiſts, and all others who differed with them in ſentiment, were no Chriſtians: but this cannot be the caſe here. The framers of the conſtitution were men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and acquaintance with the world; the reſult is, then, that there is a contradiction in the two clauſes of the ſame article.</p>
            <p>Such is the ſtate of things in Maſſachuſetts, that the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, according to the power veſted in them by the firſt part of the third article, have made ſuch laws as have effected a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of one ſect to another, contrary to the laſt clauſe in the ſame article.</p>
            <p>On March 23, and June 28, 1786. two acts paſſed; the firſt reſpecting towns, the other precincts, which effect the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation juſt mentioned. Theſe two laws were ſomewhat uniform in ſtructure, and therefore a quotation from one of them may
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027215_0016_0FD3DFA9E681ECE8"/>
ſuffice in this place. Each inhabitant has the power of voting in town or precinct affairs, who pays two thirds more in one tax than a poll tax; and then follows, "That the freeholders and other inhabitants in each reſpective town, qualified as aforeſaid, at the annual meeting for the choice of town officers, or at any other town-meeting regularly warned, may grant and vote ſuch ſums of money as they ſhall judge neceſſary for the ſettlement, maintenance, and ſupport of the miniſtry, to be aſſeſſed upon the polls and property <hi>within the ſame</hi> as by law provided."</p>
            <p>Now if any Chriſtians but Proteſtants are thus incorporated, the conſtitution is violated; and if none but Proteſtants, what may the Catholics ſay? But this is not all; by this act, property entitles a man to church privileges. A degree of ſimony is contained in the act. The wiſeſt man that was ever born of a woman could not eſtimate <hi>wiſdom,</hi> by all the gold and pearls on earth; but here a little property procures it; at leaſt an annual tax entitles a man to the rights of it. Whether theſe voters are ſpiritual, moral, or profane, they have an equal ſuffrage in the choice of ſpiritual teachers, who have (or ſhould have) the cure of ſouls at heart.</p>
            <p>It is well known that there are a number of Baptiſts in this ſtate; in ſome towns they and their adherents form a majority; but in the greateſt part of the towns, thoſe called the <hi>ſtanding order</hi> are ſuperior in number to all the reſt. As the Baptiſts are Proteſtants, where they form a majority, they might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated as well as others, and tax all in the town or precinct to part with their money for religious uſes. But it is well known that they are principled againſt it. They do not believe that the legiſlature have any proper authority (upon the ſcale of good policy) to make any laws to incorporate religious ſocieties and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a maintenance for the miniſtry. Now the queſtion is, Do their ſentiments prevent their demeaning themſelves as peaceable ſubjects of ſtate? Let thoſe who differ with them in judgment an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Yet from their known and conſcientious principles, how are they reduced to ſubordination in various places?</p>
            <p>In a town or precinct where the Baptiſts are a minority, the major part chuſe and ſettle a miniſter; the expenſe is levied upon all according to poll and property; the Baptiſts in this caſe muſt either part with their money to ſupport a religion that they do not fully believe in; or be ſubordinate enough to get a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate to draw it out of the treaſurer's hand. Some have conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the laſt mode, as being the beſt alternative they had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while others have had ſuch a diſguſt to ſubmit to a power, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027215_0017_0FD3DFAD2DCF4B80"/>
neither to the kingdom of the Meſſiah, nor the civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on earth, that they would not bow let the conſequences be what they would. The diſtraining law ſuits and oppreſſions that have riſen from this ſource, even ſince the ratification of the preſent conſtitution, need not be mentioned at this time.</p>
            <p>One obſervation more ſhall cloſe my ſtrictures on this article. It is well noticed, that none ſhall be protected by law, but thoſe who properly demean themſelves as peaceable ſubjects of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. This, however, ſhould be extended to all men, as well as to Chriſtian denominations.</p>
            <p>For any man, or ſet of men, to expect protection from the law, when they do not ſubject themſelves to government, is a vain expectation. Let a man's motive be what it may; let him have what object ſoever in view; if his practice is oppoſed to good law, he is to be puniſhed. Magiſtrates are not to conſult his motive or object, but his actions.</p>
            <p>Without adverting to Bohemia, Munſter, any part of Europe or Aſia, for inſtances, we ſhall pay attention to a few recent tranſactions of our own. A Shaking-Quaker in a violent manner caſt his wife into a mill-pond, in cold weather; his plea was, that God ordered him ſo to do. Now the queſtion is, Ought he not to be puniſhed as much as if he had done the deed in anger? Was not the abuſe to the woman as great? Could the magiſtrate perfectly know whether it was God, Satan, or ill-will, that prompted him to do the deed? The anſwers to theſe queſtions are eaſy.</p>
            <p>In the year 1784, <hi>Matthew Womble,</hi> of Virginia, killed his wife and four ſons, in obedience to a Shining One, (whom, he ſaid, was the Son of God) to merit heaven by the action; but if the court had been fearful of offending that Shining One, and pitied <hi>Womble</hi>'s ſoul, they would never have indicted that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him which they did the October following. Neither his motive, (which was obedience), nor his object, (which was the ſalvation of his ſoul) had any weight on the jury.</p>
            <p>Should magiſtrates or jurors be biaſſed by ſuch proteſtations, the moſt atrocious villains would always paſs with impunity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here add, that in Scotland, two women were brought before the ſeſſions for fornication, one of them was a church member and the other was not. She who was a daughter of Zion was pitied, and the man who had defiled her was judged a vile ſeducer and ſeverely fined; but ſhe who was not a member of the church, was judged a lewd flatterer and was driven out of the pariſh, that ſhe might not deceive honeſt men any more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:027215_0018_0FD3DFADC56CA818"/>Should a man refuſe to pay his tribute for the ſupport of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, or anywiſe diſturb the peace and good order of the civil police, he ſhould be puniſhed according to his crime let <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>It is often the caſe, that laws are made which prevent the liberty of conſcience; and becauſe men cannot ſtretch their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, like a noſe of wax, theſe nonconformiſts are puniſhed as vagrants that diſturb the peace. The complaint is, "Theſe men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble the city." Let any man read the laws that were made about <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three children, and ſee who were the aggreſſors, the law makers or the law breakers. The rights of conſcience ſhould always be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered inalienable—religious opinions as not the objects of civil government, nor any ways under its juriſdiction; laws ſhould only reſpect civil ſociety; then if men are diſturbers they ought to be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>Among the many beautiful traits of the conſtitution of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts, the proviſion made for its reviſion ſhines with great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgence.</p>
            <p>Permanency and improvement ſhould be mixed together in government. But few nations have ever had patriotiſm ſufficient to remove the radical deficiencies of government without falling into convulſion and anarchy. There are certain ebbs and tides in men, and bodies of men, which often break over all proper bounds, without a proper check. To leave government therefore ſo mutable, that a bare majority can alter it, when under ſome prevailing paſſion, expoſes that permanency that the good of the whole, and the confidence of allies, call for. In this laſt view of things, ſome real, confeſſed evils had better be borne with than to make government too fluctuating. In the federal government it requires two thirds of the ſtates, or two thirds of the members of congreſs, to change the conſtitution. In Maſſachuſetts the ſame, but not till after the experiment of fifteen years. However this may appear to others, to me it appears one of the faireſt lines in the conſtitution; a ſignal of a patriotic people, conſcious of their liability of miſtake, wiſhing to improve in policy, attached to energy and freedom. And there is no doubt, but in the year 1795, the citizens of this ſtate may meet by their delegates and coolly improve upon the conſtitution, and remove its defects that time and experience have diſcovered, without the leaſt danger of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027215_0019_0FD3DFAF8C709DB8"/>
tumult or noiſe. Should that be the caſe, it is hoped that ſome things, reſpecting religion, will be altered, which is the chief end of the publiſhing of this ſmall tract.</p>
            <p>If the conſtitution ſhould be reviſed, and any thing about religion ſhould be ſaid in it, the following paragraph is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>"To prevent the evils that have heretofore been occaſioned in the world by religious eſtabliſhments, and to keep up the proper diſtinction between religion and politics, no religious teſt ſhall ever be requeſted as a qualification of any officer in any department of this government; neither ſhall the legiſlature, under this conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ever eſtabliſh any religion by law, give any one ſect a prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to another, or force any man in the commonwealth to part with his property for the ſupport of religious worſhip, or the maintenance of miniſters of the goſpel."</p>

            <head>A CIRCULAR LETTER OF VALEDICTION, ON LEAVING VIRGINIA, IN 1791.</head>
            <byline>BY JOHN LELAND.</byline>
            <opener>
               <salute>Men, Brethren, and Fathers,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN leaving the ſtate, where I have contracted a large acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance—where I have ſpent <hi>fourteen years</hi> of the prime of my life, in which time I have baptized <hi>ſeven hundred</hi> perſons (the chiefeſt of whom, God has graciouſly given me as ſeals of my miniſtry) it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed that I feel an unuſual perturbation of mind; eſpecially when I conſider the kind acceptance I have found among the people, as well as the confidence which the Baptiſt ſociety have repoſed in me. When all theſe endearing bonds preſent themſelves before me, they ſtrangely agitate my throbbing breaſt. A total diveſtiture of theſe ſenſations would render me an odious ſtoic, among men formed for friendſhip; but an exceſs of theſe tender emotions, would appear too effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for a man of buſineſs, and inadmiſſible for the hazardous voyage before me.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſay that I had any particular call to come to Virginia, like <hi>Paul</hi> to go to Macedonia; but came voluntarily, of my own accord; and hope kind Providence has overruled it for the beſt. Now I meditate a return to my native land, upon a principle as voluntary as I came. May Heaven ſend me good ſpeed, and proſper me in every lawful undertaking. The thoughts of death, in general, are not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> painful as the thoughts of living for nothing.</p>
            <p>My friends in general, and thoſe in particular who acknowledge my weak efforts as the means of their ſalvation, will receive this final valediction as a proof of my love; and as I cannot viſit them all to take a formal parting, I hope this letter will be as pleaſing and more profitable. When I came firſt into Virginia, I ſhared the common lot of ſtrangers; many were afraid of me, that I was not ſincere; and ſome better characters than myſelf, ſeemed to defame; but I always was prevented from retorting, by the words of David, "Who can ſtretch forth his hands againſt the Lord's anointed and be innocent:" and amidſt all my troubles, theſe words were my ſupport, "The Lord ſaid, verily it ſhall be well with thy remnant (of days,) verily I will cauſe the enemy to entreat thee well in time of affliction and in time of evil." No man can conceive the difficulty that a ſtranger in a ſtrange land has to endure, but thoſe who have tried it. Thus I was; in the day the drought conſumed me, and the froſt by
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:027215_0021_0FD3DFB269E11990"/>
night; my head has often been filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night. The love of my God, and the worth of immortal ſouls, has ſtimulated my heart and borne me up under all the preſſures of mobs, tumults, reproaches, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; and having obtained help of God, I remain until this very day.</p>
            <p>The union that has taken place among the Baptiſts has been very pleaſing to me, and a continuation of the ſame, is an object that engroſſes my deſire. For this deſireable end, I have been willing to ſacrifice a number of little peculiarities, and think myſelf a gainer in the bargain.</p>
            <p>Ye are not ſtrangers, my dear brethren and children, of the difference of opinions now ſubſiſting among the Baptiſts in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia; ſome pleading for predeſtination and others for univerſal proviſion, It is true, that the ſchemes of both parties cannot be right; and yet both parties may be right in their aims, each wiſhing to juſtify wiſdom, and make God righteous when he judgeth. He cannot be wrong, whoſe heart and life are right— He cannot walk amiſs who walks in love. I have generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that when religion is lively among the people no alienation of affection ariſes from a difference of judgment; and whoever conſiders that the devil is orthodox in judgment, and that the Bible is not written in form of a ſyſtem, will ſurely be moderate in dealing out hard ſpeeches towards his heterodox brother. I conclude that the <hi>eternal purpoſes</hi> of God, and the <hi>freedom of the human will,</hi> are both truths; and it is a matter of fact, that the preaching that has been moſt bleſt of God, and moſt profitable to men, is <hi>the doctrine of ſovereign grace in the ſalvation of ſouls, mixt with a little of what is called Arminianiſm.</hi> Theſe two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions can be tolerably well reconciled together, but the modern misfortune is, that men often ſpend too much time in explaining away one or the other, or in fixing the lock-link to join the others together; and by ſuch means, have but little time in a ſermon to inſiſt on thoſe two great things which God bleſſes. I do not plead for implicit faith; let each man believe, ſpeak, and act for himſelf; but when it is confeſſed that nine tenths of the ſcripture is beſt explained without deſcending to thoſe cutting points, a man muſt appear contracted who ſpends all his time in diſputing about them; and more malevolent when he finds it tends, not to promote love and union, but rather a rancorous ſpirit. Let us then follow after the things that make for peace, and the things whereby one may edify another, and ſtrive who ſhall be the moſt humble and love over the greateſt affronts.</p>
            <p>My children, I am afraid that after my departure, you will forget the weak advice that I have given you; and (what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more) the inſtruction of that gracious Redeemer who bought you with his blood. Wherefore watch, and remember that for the ſpace of fourteen years I ceaſed not to warn you night and day, and taught you publickly, and from houſe to houſe. And now behold I go (with ſubmiſſion to Providence)
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:027215_0022_0FD3DFB3D17DF760"/>
to New England, not knowing what things will befal me there. Perhaps the faithleſs ſeas may be my tomb, or I may live to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience more ſevere trials than ever I have ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>I know myſelf to be a feeble, ſinful worm. A retroſpective view of my paſt conduct is not altogether pleaſing, and perhaps it is owing to your partiality that I have not been publickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: for my own part, I have nothing to fly to for defence, but the blood and righteouſneſs of the dear Redeemer: but if my conduct has been ſuch as to eſcape the cenſure of thoſe men, who know what it is to ſtruggle with a body of death; any calumny that may be caſt on me after my departure, will be unnoticed.</p>
            <p>I have preached about <hi>three thouſand</hi> ſermons ſince I came to Virginia; all of which have been too flat, and many of them ſo cold, that the ſentences would almoſt freeze between my lips; and yet, many times when I have attempted to inſtruct and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort others, I have found the ſame bleſſings for myſelf. And now, brethren, I commend you to God and the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all thoſe who are ſanctified; hoping and praying that if we meet no more on earth; that we may meet in heaven among all the redeemed of the Lord: though the company is large, yet there is room—Many manſions—Places for you, my brethren, a place, I truſt, for worthleſs me.</p>
            <p>Before I cloſe, I wiſh to add a word in behalf of the poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy negroes, and ſpeak a little for thoſe who are not ſuffered to ſpeak for themſelves. I have generally been quiet on this head, for the following reaſons. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I have been a ſtranger among you, and therefore judged it indecent to meddle with the cuſtoms of the country. <hi>Second,</hi> I have had no ſlaves of my own, and ſo concluded that if I ſaid any thing on that head, it would be conſtrued to my diſadvantage, without doing any good. <hi>Third,</hi> It has ever appeared to me difficult to form any plan (even in idea) for their manumiſſion, and to expoſe the evil without pointing out the way of eſcape, would be doing as the witch did to <hi>Saul. Fourth,</hi> To ſay any thing about it would raiſe the paſſions of a certain claſs of citizens, and from that they would abuſe them worſe than before, and ſo eventually make thoſe in miſery more miſerable. But as I am now about leaving the ſtate, I can ſpeak with more freedom.</p>
            <p>I am heartily glad, that I can ſay that the ſpirit of maſters has greatly abated ſince I have been in Virginia; it is now confeſſed by many, that negroes can feel injuries, hunger, pain, and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and I hope this ſpark of good fire will be raiſed to a flame, in due time.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, that I am not as much ſhocked to ſee them naked, gant, and trembling, as I was when I firſt came into the ſtate; the diſtance that they are kept in, the abject ſubordination and things relative thereto do not affect me as they once did (ſo fatal are bad cuſtoms) but I can never be reconciled to the keeping of them; nor can I endure to ſee one man ſtrip and whip another, (as free
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:027215_0023_0FD3DFB515A79C10"/>
by nature as himſelf) without the interference of a magiſtrate or any being or thing to check his turbulent will. And as I am well convinced that many of my dear brethren have the ſame feelings of myſelf, I can unboſom myſelf with confidence. It is not my intention to drop the miniſterial veſt, and aſſume the politician's garb to-day; but after adding, that ſlavery in its beſt appearance, is a violent deprivation of the rights of nature, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with republican government, deſtructive of every humane benevolent paſſion of the ſoul, and ſubverſive to that liberty (abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to ennoble the human mind) let me aſk whether Heaven has nothing in ſtore for poor negroes better than theſe galling chains? If ſo, ye miniſters of Jeſus, and ſaints of the moſt High—ye wreſtling Jacobs, who have power with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and can prevail over the angel; let your prayers, your ardent prayers, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the throne of God inceſſantly, that he may pour the bleſſing of <hi>freedom</hi> upon the poor blacks. If public prayers of this kind would raiſe the anger of tyrants, or embolden the ſlaves in inſolence, let the ſable watches of the night, in lonely ſolitude, be witneſſes to your ſincere longings after the liberty of your fellow creatures.</p>
            <p>How would every benevolent heart rejoice to ſee the halcyon day appear—the great jubilee uſher in, when the poor ſlaves, with a Moſes at their head, ſhould hoiſt up the ſtandard, and march out of bondage! Or, what would be ſtill more elating, to ſee the power of the goſpel ſo effectual that the lion and the lamb ſhould lie together—all former inſults and revenges forgotten —the names of maſter and ſlave be buried—every yoke broken, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed go free—go free but not empty away.</p>
            <p>And you, my black brethren, hear a word from your parting friend. It is not only a general complaint, but a general truth, that but very few of you will do your duty without a degree of ſeverity. That your maſters have right to chaſtiſe you (while you are their ſervants) is undoubted. You cannot conceive what pain, what diſtreſſes of ſoul your maſters endure for your ſake. How glad many of them would be if you would bear good uſage. Their reſt forſakes them at night, and their comforts by day, on account of your indolence and roguery. There is no way you can honour your profeſſion, do a good part for yourſelves, or move God to ſend you deliverance ſo effectually, as to obey thoſe who have the rule over you in the fear of God. Though our ſkins are ſomewhat different in colour, yet I hope to meet many of you in heaven; where your melodious voices, that have often enchanted my ears and warmed my heart, will be inceſſantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the praiſe of our common Lord. In hope of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal joy, you may well be patient in your hardſhips, and wait till your change comes.</p>
            <p>And now may the peace of God, that paſſeth all underſtanding, dwell richly in all your hearts.—Amen.</p>
