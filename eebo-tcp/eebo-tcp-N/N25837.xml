            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

SPECIAL MEETING.</opener>
               <p>IN conſequence of the prevalence of a fever of a very alarming nature in ſome parts of this city, the College were called together, in order to conſider what ſteps ſhould be taken by them on the occaſion, conſiſtent with their duty, to their fellow citizens.</p>
               <p>After a free communication of ſentiment, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee was appointed to conſider and report on the means beſt adapted to prevent the ſpreading of this diſeaſe, and to guard againſt the contagion of it.</p>

ADJOURNED MEETING.</opener>
               <p>THE committee reported a copy of directions for preventing the further progreſs of the malignant fever, which, being amended, was agreed upon. It was agreed to have it ſigned by the Vice-Preſident and Secretary, and to ſend a copy of it to the Mayor. The directions were as follow, viz.</p>

                           <head>Directions for preventing the further progreſs of the Malignant, contagious Fever.</head>
                           <p>The College of Phyſicians having taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the malignant and contagious fever which now prevails in this city, have agreed to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to their fellow citizens the following means of preventing its progreſs.</p>
                           <p>FIRST.—That all unneceſſary intercourſe ſhould be avoided with ſuch perſons as are infected by it.</p>
                           <p>SECOND.—To place a mark upon the door or window of ſuch houſes as have any infected perſons in them.</p>
                           <p>THIRD.—To place the perſons infected in the center of large and airy rooms, in beds without curtains, and to pay the ſtricteſt regard to cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by frequently changing their body and bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linen; alſo by removing, as ſpeedily as poſſible, all offenſive matters from their rooms.</p>
                           <p>FOURTH.—To provide a large and airy hoſpital in the neighbourhood of the city, for the reception of ſuch poor perſons as cannot be accommodated with the above advantages in private houſes.</p>
                           <p>FIFTH.—To put a ſtop to the tolling of the bells.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="3" facs="unknown:034356_0005_0FFC2ABC767905C8"/>
SIXTH.—To bury ſuch perſons as die of the fever, in carriages, and in as private a manner as poſſible.</p>
                           <p>SEVENTH.—To keep the ſtreets and wharves of the city as clean as poſſible. As the contagion of the diſeaſe may be taken into the body and paſs out of it without producing the fever, unleſs it be rendered active by ſome occaſional cauſe, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing means ſhould be attended to, to prevent the contagion from being excited into action in the body.</p>
                           <p>EIGHTH.—To avoid all fatigue of body and mind.</p>
                           <p>NINTH.—To avoid ſtanding or ſitting in the ſun, alſo in a current of air, or in the evening air.</p>
                           <p>TENTH.—To accommodate the dreſs to the weather, and to exceed rather in warm than in cold cloathing.</p>
                           <p>ELEVENTH.—To avoid intemperance, but to uſe fermented liquors, ſuch as wine, beer and cyder with moderation.</p>
                           <p>The college conceive fires to be very ineffectual, if not dangerous means, of checking the progreſs of the fever. They have reaſon to place more depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the burning of gun-powder. The benefits of vinegar and camphire are confined chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to infected rooms, and they cannot be uſed too frequently upon handkerchiefs or in ſmelling-bottles, by perſons whoſe duty calls them to viſit or attend the ſick.</p>

                     <p>No inſtance has ever occurred, of the diſeaſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Yellow Fever, being generated in this city, or in any other part of this ſtate, as far as we know; but there have been frequent inſtances of its having been imported, not only into this, but into other parts of North-America, and prevailing there for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain period of time—and from the riſe, progreſs and nature of the malignant Fever, which began to prevail here about the beginning of laſt Auguſt, and extended itſelf gradually over a great part of the city, we are of opinion, that this diſeaſe was import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Philadelphia by ſome of the veſſels which arrived in the port after the middle of July. This opinion we are further confirmed in by the various accounts we have received from the beſt authorities we could procure on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>To purify the city from latent infection, we would recommend, that every houſe, particularly thoſe in which there have been any ſick, ſhould be thoroughly cleanſed and kept open, ſo as to admit freſh air through every aperture—the walls ſhould be white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſhed and gunpowder burned in all the apartments—the beds and woollen apparel of the ſick ſhould either be deſtroyed or ſmoaked with gunpowder in a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034356_0008_0FFC2AACD33D3778"/>
cloſe room, and expoſed to the air and rain—un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaked Lime, ſhould be thrown down the Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the ſtreets ſhould be kept clean, eſpecially in the confined parts of the city.</p>
                     <p>In anſwer to your laſt queſtion, permit us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that we truſt the early attention of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature will be directed to the ſafety of the port, with reſpect to the officers and other arrangements which may be found neceſſary; and on ſuch an occaſion the College will ever cheerfully co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with them in their endeavours to prevent, avert, or, remove theſe dangerous calamities.</p>

               <p>The Committee on the Health Laws, appointed at the laſt ſtated Meeting, made the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, viz.</p>
               <p>The Committee, appointed by the College of Phyſicians, to conſider the Health Laws, having attended to the ſubject, report, that the ſaid law appears to them to be inadequate to the purpoſes intended to be embraced by the Legiſlature, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly as it reſpects the extenſion of Malignant, Contagious Diſeaſes, when they appear in the city.</p>
               <p>The diſeaſe which appears to require moſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in this reſpect is the Yellow Fever; for it is probable, that whenever this complaint is very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in the Weſt-Indies (which is generally the caſe in time of war) it will find its way to this city, notwithſtanding the care of the Health Officers.—Being highly contagious in cities, when it is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, the lives of our fellow-citizens will be expoſed to extreme danger.—But notwithſtanding its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious nature, the hiſtory of the plague and of other Contagious diſeaſes, authorizes the Committee to ſay,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034356_0010_0FFC2AA4209775C8"/>
that by proper exertions, it may be prevented from ſpreading when introduced.</p>
               <p>Exertions of this kind can only be made or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by perſons who have ſome knowledge of the nature and effects of contagion and can judge right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſuſpicious caſes when they occur.—The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee therefore conſider the law as defective in this point, becauſe it neither lays down a preciſe rule of conduct for the conſulting phyſician employed in this buſineſs, nor commits the object to his ſole diſcretion; but it aſſociates with him any two members of the Committee of Health, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding that theſe Gentlemen ſhould have ſufficient information on the general ſubject; and therefore, the whole object of the law may be loſt, by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes which will ariſe from their want of Medical knowledge.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary, if a diſcretionary power be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any body of men, that a majority of them ſhould underſtand the nature of the buſineſs entruſted to them; and from this view of the ſubject, the Committee are induced to propoſe to the College, to recommend to the Legiſlature, to commit the powers neceſſary to prevent the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of Malignant Contagious Diſorders, to the conſulting Phyſician, and a ſmall number of aſſociates of the Medical Profeſſion, a majority of whom ſhall determine what meaſures are to be purſued, when occaſions of alarm may occur. Of the many advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which will be derived from this aſſociation of profeſſional gentlemen, the Committee will content themſelves with enumerating two:</p>
               <p>1ſt. The conſulting Phyſician will derive firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and reſolution in the performance of his duty, from the ſupport of his profeſſional Brethren, and,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034356_0011_0FFC2A9FF060B848"/>
2dly. The great object, (the ſafety of the City,) will be more completely obtained. The moſt ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Phyſicians have been deceived reſpecting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion; but when ſeveral are concerned they will moſt probably judge rightly.</p>

                           <p>That the act for eſtabliſhing a Health Office &amp;c. appears to them inadequate to ſome of the purpoſes for which it was formed, particularly as it reſpects
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034356_0012_0FFC2A9C50307C48"/>
the communication of malignant contagious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, when they appear in the city.</p>
                           <p>Amongſt thoſe which require moſt of your Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative attention, is that fatal diſeaſe commonly called the Yellow Fever.—For as that complaint is frequently prevalent in the Weſt-Indies, it may ſometimes be brought to this city, notwithſtanding the care of the Health Officers.</p>
                           <p>To prevent its being communicated, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, is therefore an important object; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, it has been found to be highly contagious in Cities, yet, from the Hiſtory of the Plague and other Contagious Diſorders, there is reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that, by proper exertions, it may be prevented from ſpreading when amongſt us.</p>
                           <p>Exertions of this kind can only be directed, or made by perſons, who, having ſome knowledge of the nature and effects of Contagion, are the beſt judges in doubtful caſes; and therefore, in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, the law appears to the College to be defective, as it has committed the buſineſs of deciding upon the removal of perſons, ſuppoſed to be infected, to the conſulting Phyſician and two aſſociates, who are not of the Medical Profeſſion—whereas, in the opinion of the College, it would be moſt properly entruſted to that Phyſician and a council of Medical Gentlemen, a majority of whom ought to determine what meaſures ſhould be purſued, when any cauſe of alarm may occur.</p>
                           <p>They believe that the great object, the ſafety of the city, would be more completely obtained, if the conſulting Phyſician, and this Council, were au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to direct the removal, not only of ſuch perſons as are already diſeaſed, but of ſuch, as from their expoſure to the operation of Contagion,

are likely to become ſo; and alſo if they were conſulted reſpecting the quarantine and purification of veſſels, and the conſtruction and regulation of the City Hoſpital, which is about to be erected.</p>
                           <p>The College truſt that the importance of the ſubject will be ſufficient apology for their addreſs to the Legiſlature; as from the abſtruſe nature of Contagion, its effects can only be underſtood by thoſe who have ſtudied them with attention, and the difficult buſineſs of preventing its propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be moſt properly committed to perſons of this deſcription.</p>

                     <p>The College of phyſicians having attentively conſidered your requeſt, of giving an opinion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the beſt mode of averting the calamity which threatens us, have directed me to communicate to you the following methods; 1ſt for preventing the ſpreading of contagious diſeaſes, when introduced among us; and 2dly, for preventing the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch diſeaſes:</p>
                     <p>1ſt. To prevent the ſpreading of contagious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes when introduced; we recommend the moſt ſcrupulous attention to cleaning and watering the ſtreets, particularly waſhing out the Gutters—Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of temperance, caution as to cloathing, fatigue of body and expoſure to the ſun and night air.—When it is aſcertained that ſuch diſeaſes exiſt, let the phyſicians of the city be enjoined to give infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof to the Board of Health; to whom they ſhould daily report ſuch caſes as may occur—Let all unneceſſary intercourſe be ſuſpended with that part of the city where the diſeaſe firſt appears—Let ſuch of the ſick and their families who reſide in any part of the city, where their reſidence may prove hurtful or dangerous, be immediately remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved—When the Diſeaſe is aſcertained to exiſt in ſeveral Houſes, near to each other, in any part of the city, let all the neighbouring families who have eſcaped infection, be removed, and all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation between the infected families and the city be ſuſpended, by preventing any perſon, except thoſe whoſe viſits are eſſentially neceſſary to the ſick, previous to this removal, from entering into that part of the town—for this purpoſe Mercantile buſineſs muſt, of courſe, be ſuſpended there, and the veſſels removed from the adjoining wharves.</p>

                        <pb n="18" facs="unknown:034356_0020_0FFC2A8014805638"/>
All ſuſpected Wharves and Houſes, particularly ſuch as have been occupied by the ſick, ſhould be purified by order of the Board of Health, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner formerly recommended by the College.</p>
                     <p>2d. To prevent the introduction of Contagious Diſeaſes; we recommend that a new Law on the ſubject be made, conſtituting a Board of Health, conſiſting of five perſons, including two Phyſicians; of whom three ſhall be Citizens of Philadelphia, one an inhabitant of the Northern Liberties, and one an inhabitant of Southwark; who ſhall meet daily during the months of June, July, Auguſt, and September: they ſhall have full power to do every thing neceſſary reſpecting the quarantine to be performed by veſſels arriving in this port, as well as to direct the removal of any veſſels, after their arrival at the city, which may be found or ſuſpected to be unhealthy—a conſulting, and a reſiding Phyſician ſhould be appointed—the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to dwell in the city, and the latter to be generally at the Health Office, on State Iſland; from which he is never to be abſent during the abovementioned months.—Every veſſel which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives, from the Weſt-Indies, from the American Main to the Southward of Florida, or from the Mediterranean, during theſe months, ſhould perform a quarantine of not leſs than thirty days—and all ſuſpected veſſels, ſhould have every article wrought or unwrought, which is uſed for cloathing, or bedding, or which may be ſuppoſed to contain infection, particularly thoſe which may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

               <p>The College of Phyſicians having taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the requeſt of the inſpectors of the Health Office, to propoſe the methods neceſſary to be adopted for preventing the extenſion of contagion, recommend the following plan.</p>

                        <div type="report">
                           <p>FIRST.—Let a perſon, appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, call every morning upon each of the phyſicians in the city and ſuburbs, and procure information of all the caſes of malignant contagious fever that have come to their knowledge.</p>
                           <p>SECOND.—Let thoſe who are affected with the aforeſaid diſeaſe, be removed from town, in all caſes where they are willing, and alſo all thoſe who by living in the ſame family or viſiting the ſick are liable to an attack of the ſame diſeaſe.</p>
                           <p>THIRD.—Where it is not practicable to remove the ſick, the families who inhabit the adjoining houſes ſhould be directed to remove.</p>

FOURTH.—After the ſick have recovered, ſo that they may be removed, or have died, all the family ſhould be removed from town. The bedding, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other articles that have been uſed about the ſick, and the furniture of the rooms occupied by the ſick, ſhould be collected in the rooms which are to be cloſed, and during two days kept filled with a ſmoke to be made in the following manner, viz. Fill a ſmall pan with alternate layers of charcoal and brimſtone, kindle a ſlow fire on the top of theſe combuſtibles, with a few ſmall pieces of bark, and they will burn a long time—When they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed renew them during the aforeſaid ſpace of two days—After this, the walls are to be whitewaſhed and the floors ſcrubbed—Theſe ſervices ſhould be performed by Africans, under the inſpection of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons appointed for the purpoſe.</p>
                           <p>FIFTH.—The bodies of thoſe who are ſuppoſed to have died of the aforeſaid fever, ſhould be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as ſoon as poſſible after death—They ſhould be carried in hearſes, and the whole buſineſs relating to interments ſhould be performed by native Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, if poſſible; if this cannot be done the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of Africans who have lately arrived from the Weſt Indies, ſhould be preferred. No perſon, who by living in the family, or viſiting the deceaſed may be ſuppoſed capable of communicating infection ought to attend the funeral.</p>
                           <p>SIXTH.—It cannot be repeated too often, that the ſick ſhould be placed in large airy apartments, which ſhould be conſtantly ventilated: Their cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bed linen changed daily and waſhed in cold water. Half an ounce of ſtrong oil of vitriol poured upon an equal quantity of powdered ſalt-petre, in China or glaſs veſſels, produces a vapour that has

                     <p>The meaſures to be purſued for purifying the city from any latent infection, are ſuch as we have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore recommended, viz.—A ſtrict attention to cleanlineſs, waſhing, white-waſhing, and ventila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the infected houſes, bedding and cloathing; and fumigating them with charcoal and ſulphur, or

a mixture of oil of vitriol and ſalt-petre. Theſe, with the froſt, we believe, will be found ſufficient entirely to deſtroy any latent contagion.</p>
                     <p>But the latter part of your enquiry, viz. What precautions are beſt calculated to guard againſt the future occurrence of a ſimilar calamity, is an object of ſuch magnitude, as to demand a more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> reply.</p>
                     <p>We have, on former occaſions, communicated our ſentiments on this head; but as you now inform us, that it is intended to eſtabliſh a foundation for future regulations, we willingly enter into the detail; and though this will principally conſiſt of repetition, yet it may be uſeful to have our ideas preſented in one view for your conſideration. And as theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents have been more fully confirmed by recent events, we are again induced earneſtly to recommend a ſtrict adoption of the meaſures we adviſed in our communication of Auguſt 18th, 1797, as being the beſt calculated to guard againſt the future introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of contagious diſeaſes. We now recapitulate thoſe advices with ſome additions.</p>
                     <p>Let an entire new health-law, be made, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting a Board of Health, to conſiſt of five perſons, two of whom to be practitioners of phyſic. The ſmallneſs of the number will enſure reſponſibility, and a conſtant reſidence in the city; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional knowledge of the medical characters will be neceſſary to aſſiſt in directing the meaſures of the Board. Let no perſon whoſe private interest may be affected by quarantine laws, be a member of this Board.</p>
                     <p>Let a ſufficient ſum of money, per annum, be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the draughts of the Board, who ſhall render to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034356_0028_0FFC2A5EE5E14FB8"/>
the Aſſembly a yearly account of their expenditures. Let this Board ſit daily during the months of July, Auguſt, September and October; and, during theſe months let every veſſel from the Mediterranean, Coaſt of Africa, Weſt-Indies, and Continent of America, to the ſouthward of Florida, perform an effectual quarantine. Let the cargoes of ſuſpicious veſſels be unloaded, and, with the veſſels, be purified at the Iſland.</p>
                     <p>Let a reſident phyſician, or health-officer be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, who ſhall never be abſent from the Iſland during the above mentioned months, and a conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing phyſician, who ſhall reſide at Philadelphia.</p>
                     <p>Let the puniſhment of a maſter of a veſſel, who evades the law, by landing cargo, crew or paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, contrary to the intent and meaning of it, be the ſame as for murder of the ſecond degree. Let no veſſel of war ever to be allowed to come above the Fort.</p>
                     <p>Let co-operative laws be procured from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring legiſlatures or from Congreſs.</p>
                     <p>Let the Board of Health have power, with the concurrence of the Governor, to cut off the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with infected perſons and places. Let the long projected Hoſpital be erected.</p>
                     <p>Let the moſt diligent and ſcrupulous attention be given to cleaning and watering the ſtreets, gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and wharves, throughout the City and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                     <p>Such are the precautions which we believe beſt calculated to guard againſt the future occurrence of calamities ſimilar to thoſe we have experienced. If further diſcoveries ſhall happily add to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge on this important ſubject, we ſhall not fail to

                           <p>That your Memorialiſts, deeply affected with the calamities produced by the diſeaſe which has recently occurred amongſt us, are impelled by a ſenſe of duty to their fellow-citizens and themſelves, to inform you, that they conſider the laws which were enacted for the purpoſe of preſerving this city
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:034356_0030_0FFC2A59AE6A1C50"/>
from Malignant, Contagious, Diſorders, as very imperfect.</p>
                           <p>The ſubject being of immenſe importance, they hope to be excuſed for ſtating their ſentiments with reſpect to it, at large.</p>
                           <p>They are of opinion, that the diſeaſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſo much mortality and diſtreſs in the year 1793, was imported into this city from the Weſt-Indies; and they are confirmed in this ſentiment, by the circumſtances attending the diſeaſe of this year, which they conſider as of the ſame nature, and derived from the ſame ſource.</p>
                           <p>Some of their moſt important reaſons for this opinion, are as follow:—The diſeaſe in queſtion is eſſentially different from the fevers that occur in this climate, and which originate from domeſtic cauſes. This difference particularly regards the general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the ſymptoms, and the mortality, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon a compariſon of its hiſtory with that of the ordinary diſeaſes of this city.</p>
                           <p>A diſeaſe which reſembles the fever of 1793 and of this year, in many important points, has long been known in the Weſt-Indies, and thoſe parts of America ſituated between the tropics; and in ſeven or eight different inſtances in which a ſimilar diſeaſe has occurred in the United States, in the courſe of this century, there is good reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it was derived from thoſe countries. In moſt of the inſtances, the original hiſtory of the diſeaſe contains the information that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. In ſome caſes, the infection can be traced to the imported clothing of perſons who died in the Weſt-Indies. In moſt of the caſes where the importation cannot be aſcertained, the firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the diſeaſe has been, as in the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:034356_0031_0FFC2A54B2D45440"/>
in the neighbourhood of the ſhipping, or among perſons connected with veſſels.</p>
                           <p>The circumſtances attending the fever of this year are extremely in point; and the narrative which accompanies this, will, we truſt, ſatisfy you that it was imported.</p>
                           <p>The diſeaſe in queſtion, commences invariably in our ſea-ports, while inland towns, equally expoſed to the ordinary cauſes of fever, eſcape; and in the two laſt inſtances of its occurrence in Philadelphia, the ſuburbs and the country adjacent, were more healthy than uſual at the ſame ſeaſon; and at the commencement of the diſeaſe, all the parts of the city, excepting the ſmall ſpaces to which it was confined, were remarkably healthy.</p>
                           <p>It exiſts in the Weſt-Indies, particularly in time of war, when great numbers of ſtrangers are to be found there; and reference to dates will ſhew, that in moſt of the inſtances of the occurrence of the diſeaſe in the United States, there has been war in the Weſt-Indies.</p>
                           <p>Your Memorialiſts are aware, that caſes may be adduced where the diſeaſe has occurred in perſons, who were not known to have been expoſed to imported contagion: but ſuch is the ſubtile nature of this power, that it often exiſts unſuſpected and ſimilar difficulties occur reſpecting the ſmall-pox, and other contagion, allowed by all to be of foreign origin. There alſo occur, although very rarely, ſolitary caſes of malignant remitting fevers, the ſymptoms of which reſemble ſo much the diſeaſe in queſtion, that they are often ſuppoſed to be the ſame; but there is this eſſential difference, that a malignant remittent fever has never been to our knowledge contagious in this climate.</p>
                           <p>The difference of ſentiments among phyſicians, now ſo much regretted, reſembles that which almoſt
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034356_0032_0FFC2A49EBE77C98"/>
always takes place, when the plague is introduced into any of the civilized parts of Europe, where it is not well known. The identity of the diſeaſe, its origin and its contagious nature have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the ſubject of controverſy.

                           <head>Narrative of Facts relative to the probable Origin, and Progreſs, of the Malignant Contagious Fever which lately appeared at the junction of Penn and Pine Streets.</head>
                           <p>THE ſhip Arethuſa, Captain Keith, ſailed about June 1, 1797, from Port Royal in Jamaica for the Havannah, with ſlaves; during the paſſage two men died with a fever, which Mr. Stephen Kingſton, a gentleman of this city, who was a paſſenger on board, and has frequently ſeen the diſeaſe, believes to have been the Yellow Fever, one having the black vomit. After remaining ſome days at the Havannah, the veſſel proceeded for Philadelphia, and arrived in the ſtream oppoſite to Pine Street, July 23, 1797. At the capes of Delaware ſhe took on board a Pilot, and performed a quarantine of five days at State Iſland. The Pilot was attacked with a fever the day of their arrival at the city, and went on ſhore the ſame day, when he was viſited by Dr. Currie, who has been much converſant with the Yellow Fever, and was ſo ſenſible of the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of his ſymptoms to thoſe of that diſeaſe, that he mentioned the caſe as ſuſpicious to one of his friends.</p>
                           <p>The Arethuſa was moored at Mr. Joſeph Ruſſell's wharf, outſide of two veſſels which lay there when ſhe arrived, her crew left her immediately after ſhe was moored, and the next day, returned for their cloathing, &amp;c. when they croſſed and recroſſed the above mentioned ſhips. Two boys only and the captain (who was on board occaſionally) compoſed the crew of the outermoſt ſhip, or that immediately

contiguous to the Arethuſa; but the innermoſt veſſel, the Brig Iris from Oporto, had a crew of the uſual number. On the twenty ninth day of July, five men of this crew were taken ill with fever, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Dr. J. Stuart, who ſtates, in his report to the College of Phyſicians, that the ſymptoms were ſimilar in all, tho' varying in the degree of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; four of theſe recovered, but one died with unequivocal marks of the malignant yellow fever. A ſervant of George Latimer, Eſq. who lived about 100 yards to the north of this veſſel, and was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently on the wharves, was attacked, July 30, with a fever which was highly contagious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, of which he died in five days.</p>
                           <p>Mr. N. Lewis, who kept a compting room about the ſame diſtance from the Arethuſa, was attacked about the ſame time, and died alſo in five days, of a fever which was ſuppoſed to be of the ſame nature.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Dominick Joyce, who was much engaged on board a ſhip near the Arethuſa, was attacked, Auguſt 3d, with a fever of the ſame kind, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. A man who lived in a ſtore on the South ſide of Pine Street, about 150 yards from the river, was attacked with a malignant fever about this time, and died in a few days.</p>
                           <p>About the ſixth of Auguſt, Mr. Ferguſon, whoſe yard adjoined the wharf where the Arethuſa and Iris lay, was attacked with a malignant fever, and the ſame day Mr. John Plankinhorn's girl, who lived nearly oppoſite to Mr. Ferguſon's acroſs Penn Street, and worked in a yard which was ſituated very near to the above mentioned ſtore in Pine ſtreet, was alſo attacked with fever, they both died on the fifth or ſixth day after the attack, Mrs. Ferguſon with very ſuſpicious, and Mr. Plankinhorn's girl, with

compleat and unequivocal ſymptoms of the yellow fever. In this manner the diſeaſe continued to ſpread, ſo that by the middle of Auguſt, or within three weeks from the arrival of the Arethuſa, above ten perſons had died, who either lived or were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in buſineſs within 300 yards of the Arethuſa, and this at a time when the other parts of the city were ſo healthy, that it is probable all the other deaths which occurred in it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <head>Facts relative to the ſickly ſtate of the Ship Hind.</head>
               <p>IT appears from the depoſitions of Francis Tow, Nicholas Benſon, and William Cooper, ſeamen on board the armed Ship Hind, taken before Chief Juſtice M'Kean, that about the beginning of July 1797, the Hind ſailed from Port an Prince, bound to Philadelphia, with a cargo of ſugar and coffee, and with 43 paſſengers; of which number 23 were whites and twenty coloured perſons, that they touched at Cape Nichola Mole, where they remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eight days and diſcharged a part of their cargo, in lieu thereof taking in a quantity of ſtone ballaſt: during the time they lay at the Mole, the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were occaſionally on ſhore. It would appear that they le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t the Mole between the 12th, and 15th, of July, and arrived at this port, after a paſſage of twenty or twenty one days. About three or four
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:034356_0036_0FFC2A3E75BD5AD0"/>
days after their departure from the Mole, five or ſix white perſons and one negro of the paſſengers were attacked with fever, the white perſons ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked were obſerved to become very yellow. During the paſſage four other coloured perſons and five of the crew fell ill of fever: one or two of the latter number, after the veſſel entered the capes of Delaware, but only a coloured boy and child died during the paſſage, and were thrown overboard after the veſſel entered the river. Upon the arrival of the veſſel oppoſite the Marine Hoſpital, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of orders from the captain, four ſick perſons were ſecreted and did not come under the inſpection of the Phyſician of the Port; excluſive of theſe, two women were ſick in the cabin. After paſſing the Fort one of the ſeamen was taken ill, went on ſhore, and was afterwards carried to the marine Hoſpital; and two other perſons were taken on ſhore ſick. So far go the depoſitions.</p>
               <p>From information obtained from the Health Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it appears, that the Hind was examined at the Fort on the ſecond, and arrived at Philadelphia on the fourth of Auguſt; and that Mr. Doughty, one of the Inſpectors of the Health Office, ſent to the marine Hoſpital on the 13th of Auguſt, Peter Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſio, one of the crew of the Hind then reſiding in Love Lane, and on the 14th, a Portugueſe from near the junction of Penn and South Streets, who had been landed there; and that another perſon was ſick of a ſuſpicious fever at Mrs. O'Connors in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond near Front Street. Both theſe were from on board the Hind, and the Portugueſe abovemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had been viſited by Dr. Currie, who declares his diſeaſe to have been Yellow Fever.</p>

                     <head>Letter from Dr. James Stuart, to the College of Phyſicians of Philadelphia.</head>
                     <p>When you conſider the welfare of the citizens of this city, and the danger attendant on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment of the appearance of contagious diſeaſes, I truſt any apology for the following communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be conſidered ſuperfluous and unneceſſary.</p>
                     <p>On the 29th of July laſt, I was called upon to viſit James Hood mariner, belonging to the Brig Iris, Captain Rhodes, lately from Oporto, then lying at Nixon's Wharf (occupied by Meſſrs. Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Palmer.) He was taken in the forenoon of the ſame day, on board with drowſineſs, ſome ſtupor, ſighing, light but frequent chills, and pain in his loins and head. The pain in his loins he repreſented as though he felt ſomething tearing from his back; to theſe ſymptoms ſucceeded a violent attack of Fever, in which ſtate I found him about four o'clock in the afternoon of the ſame day; ſtill complaining of the moſt excruciating pain in the head and back, with a burning ſenſation in the ſtomach; inflamed eyes, fluſhed face, his tongue white on the fore part, but more dark towards the pharynx, and very dry, a little incoherent at times in converſation, his pulſe very ſtrong and tenſe—he loſt by my direction ſixteen ounces of blood from the arm with evident relief. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a ſcruple of jalap with ten grains of calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel. On the 30th I found the powder had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſeveral ſtools exhibiting a very dark colour, but in no way particularly foetid—his pains had
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:034356_0038_0FFC2A39D07E6598"/>
much abated, but the fever continued, with ſtrength and tenſion of the arteries; he loſt twelve ounces of blood, and the purge was repeated. 31ſt, He had a very reſtleſs night, had not taken the powder; ſymptoms much the ſame as the day before; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the ſame purge to be given in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Auguſt 1ſt, the powder, as I was informed, was ejected by vomiting—the pupils were conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably dilated; he had a ſlight delirium with great reſtleſſneſs, oppreſſion, and pain in the breaſt, with ſtill a tenſe pulſe. A bliſter was applied to his breaſt and ſtomach—I ordered an injection to be thrown up, and after a ſtool ſhould have been procured, to give five grains of calomel every third hour; he took two doſes without effect, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to repeat them. On the morning of the 2d, I found the difficulty of breathing much relieved, and the other violent ſymptoms in ſome meaſure abated; but a ſmall diarrhoea attended, with dark ſtools, inſomuch that he and the attendants ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it to be blood, but upon examination it was diſcovered to be of a very dark green colour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the appearance of viſcid bile—I directed a continuation of the powders—about ſix o'clock in the evening he had not taken any of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, had been attacked with a chill, was very yellow, (which was taken notice of by his attendants) his fever had become more violent, accompanied with an increaſe of delirium, his pulſe ſtill tenſe. Whilſt ſitting by his bed he vomited up a ſmall quantity of black bile—took ten ounces more of blood from the arm, which appeared different from what had been taken at the firſt bleedings, in being bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>y, whereas that taken before had appeared dark with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a diſpoſition to ſeparate, ſtreaked with red—
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:034356_0039_0FFC2A3518191910"/>
preſcribed a repetition of the injections—Auguſt 3d, about nine o'clock the vomiting had in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ceaſed and appeared only when he was moved, comatous, increaſe of delirium, (when rouſed ſaid he was well); Symptoms of effuſſion in the breaſt, his ſkin and eyes very yellow with livid ſpots on the former, eſpecially on ſeveral parts of his arms. I ordered bliſters to his wriſts, legs, and breaſt, and to take five grains of volatile alkali every hour—Cold clammy ſweats now came on with ſingul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, and he expired at twelve o'clock this day, being the fifth from that on which he was taken.</p>
                     <p>It is a circumſtance worthy of remark, that four of the ſame crew were taken on the ſame day with ſimilar ſymptoms, (except in degree and one nearly in the ſame degree at the firſt aggreſs) all of whom, being more conformable in taking medicines as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, recovered on the third and fourth day; and another who was taken on the firſt of Auguſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered on the ſeventh—a particular detail of each caſe, with the particular remedies employed, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, will be given, when time and opportunity will permit, by Gentlemen,</p>
