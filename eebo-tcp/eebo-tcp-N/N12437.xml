            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Sum of the law of nature, as well as of the written law, is love. Love to God and man properly exerciſed in tender feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the heart, and beneficent actions of life, conſtitutes perfect holineſs. The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel breathes the ſame ſpirit, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges none as the diſciples of Chriſt, but thoſe who love (not their friends only) but even their enemies. Bleſs and curſe not, is one of the laws of his kingdom. Yet the averſion of men to this good and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent law, prompts them to frequent violations of it, which is the ſource of all the evils we feel or fear: And ſo loſt are many to all the tender feelings require in this law, as to diſcover their enmity to their Creator, by oppoſing the happineſs of his creatures, and ſpreading miſery and ruin among them.</p>
            <p>When ſuch characters as theſe preſent themſelves to our view, if we are poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of love, required in the law and goſpel, we muſt feel a holy abhorrence of them. Love it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015709_0005_0F99DEBFC4D0BA20"/>
implies hatred to malevolence, and the man who feels no abhorrence of it, may be aſſured he is deſtitute of a benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temper, and ranks with the enemies of God and man. For as God himſelf hates ſin with a perfect hatred from the eſſential holineſs of his nature, and ſinners cannot ſtand in his ſight; ſo the greater our conformity to him is, the greater will be our abhorrence of thoſe perſons and actions which are oppoſite to the divine law. <hi>David</hi> mentions this as an evidence of his love to God: <hi>Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with them that riſe up againſt thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But the weakneſs and corruption of nature, in the beſt, is ſuch, that God hath not entruſted to men at large, the exerciſe of the reſentment due to ſuch characters, nor allowed them to inflict thoſe puniſhments which their crimes call for, even in this world, except in ſome ſpecial caſes. On the contrary he hath ſtrictly prohibited all his ſubjects taking vengeance for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or perſonal injuries, in a private and perſonal manner, and required that if <hi>one ſmite us on the one cheek, we turn to him the other alſo;</hi> 
               <note n="¶" place="bottom">Matthew 5.39.</note> and in the language of love exhorts us, <hi>Dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, avenge not yourſelves.</hi> Yet there are caſes in which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us, as his ſervants, to take vengeance on his enemies. And it deſerves our particular notice, that all theſe caſes reſpect crimes which tend to deſtroy human happineſs: Even his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to puniſh blaſphemy and other ſins which ſtrike more directly againſt himſelf, are not given becauſe his own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is thereby diminiſhed, but becauſe they tend to eraſe from our minds, that ſenſe of his glorious majeſty, authority, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, without the belief of which, all order and peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men would come to an end. So God requires us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute vengeance on the murderer, the thief, the adulterer, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and the like; all which ſins ſtrike at the peace and happineſs of human ſociety. God's heart is ſo much ſet upon diffuſing
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015709_0006_0F99DEC1162E40D0"/>
happineſs among his creatures, by which he moſt eminently diſplays his glory, that he perfectly abhors whatever tends to fruſtrate this end; and has threatened the leaſt oppoſition to it with everlaſting death in the world to come. But as few (thro' the corruption of nature by ſin) have ſaith in a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, ſufficient to influence them to their duty, or deter them from oppoſing God's gracious purpoſes, therefore to ſtrike our ſenſes with full conviction of his anger againſt ſuch as counteract his benevolent deſigns, he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded every ſociety of men, to inflict puniſhment on them in this world, and has ſpecified the crimes, the puniſhments, and the officers who are to inflict them.</p>
            <p>Every puniſhment involves in it a curſe, and pre-ſuppoſes ſome crime; and the curſe or puniſhment is by God, exactly proportioned to the nature, heinouſneſs, and circumſtances of the crime. Therefore, when a grievous puniſhment is inflicted, we juſtly infer the aggravation of the offence. To inflict pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, is actively to curſe, and when we pronounce a curſe, we do, as far as we can, conſign over the object to ſome puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But when God commands us to curſe any perſon or people, we are bound by his authority actually to puniſh them.</p>
            <p>THESE obſervations may lead us to ſome apprehenſions of the aggravated nature of the ſin of <hi>Meroz,</hi> whom <hi>Iſrael</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to curſe bitterly for their conduct in an affair of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic nature.</p>
            <p>THE text I have choſen as the theme of my diſcourſe, is part of a ſong uttered by <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> in holy triumph and praiſe for a ſignal victory obtained over <hi>Jabin,</hi> king of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and <hi>Siſera</hi> the captain of his hoſt. This powerful prince, who had nine hundred chariots of iron, and a mighty army, had brought Iſrael into ſubjection, and grievouſly oppreſſed them for twenty years. This cruel and galling yoke at length awakened them to a ſenſe of their ſin againſt God, and to cry to him for deliverance. No ſooner are they made ſenſible of their ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and dependance on him, and to repent and ſeek his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor and protection, than he appears for their help, raiſes up &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak</hi> with courage and faith in his power and grace, to oppoſe the tyrant, and ſhake off his yoke.

            <p>
               <hi>Jabin,</hi> it ſeems, had no knowledge, or thought that Iſrael was arming againſt him. The firſt intelligence brought him, was, that <hi>Barak</hi> was gone up to mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> that he had already marched, and was on his way to invade his country. Some trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who pretended friendſhip to Iſrael, carried him the news; hoping, doubtleſs, to ingratiate themſelves with <hi>Jabin,</hi> by giving him the earlieſt notice poſſible of this revolt.</p>
            <p>No doubt, both <hi>Jabin</hi> and <hi>Siſera</hi> deſpiſed this ſmall body of undiſciplined, unarmed troops; and were confident they ſhould carry all before them, and quickly reduce thoſe rebels (as he doubtleſs termed them) to their former obedience. But God, who diſpoſes of all events, not only gave the victory to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but utterly deſtroyed the whole hoſt of <hi>Jabin,</hi> that not one eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, except <hi>Siſera</hi> the Captain General, and him God delivered to be ſlain by the hand of a woman. Women have ſometimes been the deliverers of their country; and can, when God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires them with courage, face the proudeſt foe. O how eaſy is it with God to ſave from the greateſt danger, and by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt inſtruments, conquer the moſt powerful enemies?</p>

               <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> deeply impreſſed with a ſenſe of God's mercy in this deliverance, ſang this ſong as an expreſſion of their joy and gratitude: From which, would time allow, many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive leſſons might be deduced. But the words of my text lead us more directly to conſider ſome things moſt worthy our attention at this day; and therefore I have choſen them as the theme of the following diſcourſe. And in them we may obſerve:</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE crime for which this bitter curſe is denounced on the inhabitants of <hi>Meroz.</hi> Probably this was ſome town or State in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who being called to furniſh their quota of men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

So much is certain; they did not go with <hi>Barak</hi> to the war. The crime they are charged with, is not their aiding, aſſiſting, or furniſhing the enemy, or holding a ſecret correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with, or taking up arms to help them: They are not charged as laying plots to circumvent the reſt, or ſtriving to diſcourage their neighbours from going to the war; or as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying others with deſcriptions of the irreſiſtable power of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin's</hi> nine hundred chariots of iron, and the like: No, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Meroz</hi> were innocent people, compared to theſe; they were only negatively wicked; they only failed in their duty; they did not arm to recover their liberties when wreſted from them by the hand of tyranny. This is all the fault charged on them; yet for this they incurred the fearful curſe in my text. Now, if for mere negligence they deſerved this curſe, what muſt they have deſerved who aided and aſſiſted the enemy? ſurely a ſeven fold bitterer curſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. OBSERVE the curſe pronounced; <hi>Curſe ye Meroz, curſe ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof.</hi> Their conduct, on that occaſion, was ſuch as deſerved a ſevere puniſhment from the other States, who are commanded to ſeperate them unto evil, as a juſt reward of their neglect.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE obſerve by whom this curſe was to be pronounced and inflicted. Not by <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak</hi> alone, in a fit of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; as prophane perſons in a rage curſe their neighbours, and

They were not to deal gingerly with them, nor palliate their offence. They are allowed to make no excuſes for them, nor to plead "that they were of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent opinion, that they thought it their duty not to take up arms againſt their king that ruled over them, but to ſubmit to the higher powers: That liberty of conſcience ought to be allowed to every one, and that it would be hard to puniſh them for act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own judgments. <note n="†" place="bottom">Liberty of conſcience is often pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> whoſe command they were required to curſe <hi>Meroz.</hi> It was not by the command of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> but of God himſelf; yea by the command of Jeſus Chriſt, the meek and compaſſionate Saviour of men. <hi>Curſe ye Meroz, ſaid the Angel of the Lord.</hi> This was the Angel of God's preſence, who then fought for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and who was ſo offended with the people of <hi>Meroz</hi> for their ſelfiſhneſs and indifference in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant cauſe, that he not only curſed them himſelf, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all the people to curſe them, and inflict his wrath on them in this world.</p>

Had the foe been weak and contemptible, there had been leſs need of their help. But when a powerful tyrant oppreſſed them, and they were called upon to unite with their ſuffering brethren in ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off his yoke, and all their ſtrength little enough, to oppoſe him, then to excuſe themſelves, was highly criminal, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to join with the tyrant to rivet ſlavery and miſery on the whole nation. This was highly provoking to God, whoſe great end is to diffuſe happineſs, and not miſery, among his creatures, and never puniſhes, but when his ſubjects oppoſe this deſign.</p>
            <p>THIS was the criſis when their all lay at ſtake. They well knew that their brethren (however they themſelves might be diſtinguiſhed with court favours by the tyrant) were groaning under cruel bondage: But as ſelfiſhneſs renders people callous and unfeeling to the diſtreſſes of others, ſo they were eaſy and ſatisfied to ſee their brethren tortured by the unrelenting hand of oppreſſion, if ſo be they might ſleep in a whole ſkin. They were contented others ſhould go forth and endure the hardſhips of war, but refuſed to engage in the work, or bear any part of the burden with them, though all was hazarded through their neglect. How baſe was this conduct, while they knew the ſtrength of the enemy? This conſideration was enough to have engaged every one, not loſt to all the feelings of humanity, to the firmeſt union, and the moſt vigorous exertions. But theſe ſervile wretches would rather bear the yoke, and ſee the whole land involved in ſlavery, than enter the field, and ſhare the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of regaining their freedom from a powerful foe. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their preſent eaſe, or ſome court favors, with chains and ſlavery, to the glorious freedom they were born to enjoy.</p>

This Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> defines to be "That ſtate or condition in which all men naturally are to order all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and diſpoſe of themſelves and poſſeſſions as they think fit, within the bounds of the law of nature, without aſking leave, or depending on the will of any man." In this ſtate all men are equal, and no one hath a right to govern or controul ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And the law of nature, or the eternal reaſon and fitneſs of things, is to be the only rule of his conduct; of the meaning of which, every one is to be his own judge.</p>
            <p>BUT ſince the corruption of nature by ſin, the luſts and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of men ſo blind their minds, and harden their hearts, that this perfect law of love is little conſidered, and leſs practiſed; ſo th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a ſtate of nature, which would have been a ſtate of perfect freedom and happineſs had man continued in his firſt recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, is a ſtate of war, rapine and murder. Hence ariſes an abſolute neceſſity that ſocieties ſhould form themſelves into po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic bodies, in order to enact laws for the public ſafety, and appoint ſome to put them in execution, that the good may be encouraged, and the vicious deterred from evil practices: And theſe laws ſhould always be founded on the law of nature.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Civil Liberty is the freedom of bodies politic, or States. This is well defined by Dr. Price p. 2. to be "The power of a civil ſociety or ſtate to govern itſelf by its own diſcretion; or by laws of its own making, without being ſubject to any foreign diſcretion, or the impoſitions of any extraneous power."</note>HENCE it appears, that perfect civil Liberty differs from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, only in this, that in a natural ſtate our actions, perſons and poſſeſſions, are under the direction, judgment and controul of none but ourſelves; but in a civil ſtate, under the direction of others, according to the laws of that ſtate in which we live; which, by the ſuppoſition, are perfectly agreeable to the law of nature. In the firſt caſe, private judgment; in the ſecond, the public judgment of the ſenſe of the law of nature is to be the rule of conduct. When this is the caſe, civil Liberty is perfect, and every one enjoys all that freedom which God deſigned for his rational creatures in a ſocial ſtate. All Liberty beyond this is mere licentiouſneſs, a liberty to ſin, which is the worſt of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. But when any laws are enacted, which croſs the law of nature, there civil Liberty is invaded, and God and man juſtly offended. Therefore when thoſe appointed to enact and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015709_0013_0F99DEC7EDE31200"/>
laws, invade this Liberty <note n="†" place="bottom">By enacting and inforcing laws contrary to the law of nature.</note> they violate their truſt, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their ſubjects, and their conſtituents may lawfully depoſe them by force of arms, if they refuſe to reform.</p>
            <p>NOW if it be unlawful for magiſtrates in a State, to bind their ſubjects by laws contrary to the law of nature, and if in this caſe it is lawful for their ſubjects to depoſe them; it follows, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> that ſhould the rulers of one State aſſume a power to bind the people of another State, who never intruſted them with a legiſlative power, by ſuch unrighteous laws, thoſe oppreſſed people would be under no kind of obligation to ſubmit to them; but ought, if in their power, to oppoſe them and recover their Liberty. Therefore the freedom of a ſociety or State conſiſts in acting according to their own choice, within the bounds of the law of nature, in governing themſelves, independent of all other States. This is the Liberty wherewith God hath made every State free, and which no power on earth may lawfully abridge, but by their own conſent: Nor can they lawfully conſent to have it abridged, but where it appears for the greater good of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in general: And when this end cannot be attained, they have a right to reſume their former freedom, if in their power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p n="2">II. To prove that the cauſe of civil Liberty is the cauſe of God.</p>
            <p>THIS follows from what hath been now ſaid. For if the law of nature is the law of God; and if God hath given every ſociety or State, liberty, independent of all other States, to act according to their own choice in governing themſelves, within the bounds of the law of nature; then it follows, that this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is of God; and he that is an advocate for it, eſpouſes the cauſe of God; and he that oppoſes it, oppoſes God himſelf. This Liberty hath God not only given, but entailed on all men, ſo that they cannot reſign it to any creature without ſin. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould any State, through fear, reſign this freedom to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other power, it would be offenſive to God Thus, had <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> ſubmitted to, and acquieſced in the declaration of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, <q>That they have a right to bind us in all caſes whatſoever,</q> we ſhould have greatly provoked God, by
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015709_0014_0F99DECBF92E90A8"/>
granting that prerogative to men, which belongs to God only. Nor could we have had reaſon to hope for pardon and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour on our land, without unfeigned repentance: But as repentance implies a change of conduct, as well as of mind, ſo we muſt have exerted ourſelves to undo what we had done, and by every method in our power, to caſt off the chains, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume our Liberty.</p>
            <p>BUT to leave the dim light of reaſon, let us hear what Divine revelation ſays in my text and context.</p>
            <p>ISRAEL were a free, independent common wealth, planted by God in <hi>Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an,</hi> in much the ſame manner that he planted us in <hi>America.</hi> The nations around always viewed them with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and jealous eye: As well they might, ſince they drove out ſeven nations more powerful than themſelves, and poſſeſſed their land. But when by their grievous ſins they provoked God, he often permitted thoſe neighbouring nations to invade their rights, that they might be brought to a ſenſe of their ſin and duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jabin</hi> the king of <hi>Canaan,</hi> one of thoſe States, was God's rod to humble them. He invaded <hi>Iſrael,</hi> robbed them of their rights, and held them in ſlavery twenty years: In all which he acted the part of a cruel tyrant, and provoked God, to his own deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Jabin</hi> had long ruled over <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but this gave him no right: His dominion was ſtill mere uſurpation, as he robbed them of the Liberty God had given them: And with a ſingle view to recover this and puniſh the invader, God commanded them to wage war on the tyrant, and ſhake off his yoke. They obey the Divine mandate, aſſemble their forces, call on the various States to join them in the glorious conflict: And God himſelf curſes thoſe who would not aſſiſt to puniſh this oppreſſor.</p>
            <p>No doubt <hi>Jabin</hi> called this Rebellion, and made proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that all who were found in arms, or any way aiding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, ſhould be deemed and treated as rebels, and their eſtate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> confiſcated; but that all who would make their ſubmiſſions, ſhould enjoy all their priviledges, as before, at his ſovereign diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal A glorious offer! How worthy the joyful and thankful acceptance of men born to freedom! Rather, where's the wretch ſo ſordid as not to feel this as an inſult to human nature? or where's the chriſtian that does not view it as a reproach of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015709_0015_0F99DECCEDF0E128"/>
his God? and who will not, with good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> ſpread before the Lord, in humble prayer, the words of this <hi>Rabſhekah,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to reproach our God, as unable to defend us, though en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in his cauſe? Or where is the man, ſo loſt to all noble and generous feelings, that would not chuſe to die in the field of martial glory, rather than accept ſuch inſulting terms of peace, or rather of miſery; to live and ſee himſelf, his friends, his wife, children and country, ſubjugated to the arbitrary will and diſpoſal of a mercileſs tyrant?</p>
            <p>But doubtleſs theſe inviting, gracious terms of peace, had great influence on ſome. The inhabitants of <hi>Meroz</hi> ſeem to have been ſuch daſtardly, low-ſpirited, court ſycophants; and alſo many in the tribe of <hi>Reuben,</hi> for whoſe diviſions there were great ſearchings of heart. Theſe probably trembled at the power of <hi>Jabin,</hi> and thought him invincible, though oppoſing God himſelf, whoſe cauſe they were called to eſpouſe. Some might call the war rebellion, and others, by open or ſecret practiſes, diſcourage and weaken the cauſe.</p>
            <p>THIS is very applicable to our preſent caſe. We are declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rebels by the king of <hi>England:</hi> His ſervants offer pardon to all who will lay themſelves at his feet to diſpoſe of as he ſhall ſee fit, and "to bind them, their children and eſtates, at his pleaſure, in all caſes whatſoever." What gracious terms of peace! Muſt not this yoke ſit with peculiar eaſe and pleaſure on the necks of free-born <hi>Americans!</hi>—Yet, with horror be it ſpoken, there are free-born ſons of <hi>America,</hi> ſo loſt to all ſenſe of honor, Liberty, and every noble feeling, as to join the cry, and preſs for ſubmiſſion. O tell it not in <hi>Gath,</hi> publiſh it not in the ſtreets of <hi>Aſhkelon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have ſome, but bleſſed be God, that we have no more, of the inhabitants of <hi>Meroz</hi> ſcattered among us; ſome whoſe endeavours to divide us, cauſe great ſearchings of heart. But be it known to them, and to all men, that they, as <hi>Meroz,</hi> are fighting againſt God. This aſſertion is confirmed by the curſe denounced on <hi>Meroz</hi> by Gods command; for had they not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him, he would not have curſed them. They then were the rebels, in the judgment of God, and not thoſe who took up arms to recover their liberties: Rebels againſt the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and therefore fell under his, and his people's curſe; as all thoſe ſhall, who oppoſe, or neglect to promote the like glorious cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:015709_0016_0F99DECD2916C0C8"/>FROM what hath been ſaid, the truth of the ſecond obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. THAT to take arms, and repel force by force, when our Liberties are invaded, is well pleaſing to God.</p>
            <p>THIS is a natural conſequence from what is ſaid above, and from the text itſelf. <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> in taking arms againſt <hi>Jabin,</hi> acted agreeable to the law of nature, which is the law of love; were alſo particularly excited, directed and commanded thereto by God himſelf. <note n="†" place="bottom">Judges, 4.6, 7.</note> They did not by this war, aim at dominion over others, nor ſeek to deprive any of their natural rights; but only to recover and ſecure the Liberties and rights which had been wreſted from them; that they might thereby ſpread peace and happineſs through all the tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> while the real happineſs of others would not thereby be diminiſhed. This, by the law of nature, was ſufficient to juſtify them. If then they conformed to the law of love in taking up arms; and if God required them to make war on <hi>Jabin;</hi> then it was unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably pleaſing to him. But if God approved their conduct in this caſe, he certainly will approve the like conduct in all ſimilar caſes Therefore when one country or State invades the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of another; it is lawful and well pleaſing to God for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to defend their rights by force of arms: Yea, to neglect this, when there is a rational proſpect of ſucceſs, is a ſin, a ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and diſcovers a want of that benevolence, and deſire of the happineſs of our fellow creatures, which is the higheſt glory of the ſaints.</p>
            <p>I need not ſpend time to prove that our ſtruggle with <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is very ſimilar to that of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with <hi>Jabin.</hi> As they had, ſo have we been long oppreſſed by a power that never had any equitable right to our land, or to rule over us, but by our own conſent, and agreeable to a ſolemn compact. When they vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated this, all their right ceaſed; and they could have no better claim to dominion, than <hi>Jabin</hi> had over <hi>Iſrael.</hi> A power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed has been uſurped by the court of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> "to bind us in all caſes whatſoever: Which claim hath already produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced many moſt unrighteous and oppreſſive laws, which they have attempted to inforce by their fleets and armies: In all which they can be no more juſtified, than <hi>Jabin</hi> in his tyranny over <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Therefore if it was their duty to fight for the recovery
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:015709_0017_0F99DECE30ACE830"/>
of their freedom, it muſt likewiſe be ours. And to neglect this, when called to it by the public voice, will expoſe us to the curſe of <hi>Meroz.</hi> Yea,</p>
            <p>III. It is lawful, yea duty, to levy war againſt thoſe who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs us, even when they are not in arms againſt us, if there be a rational probability of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>I ſay, if there be a rational probability of ſucceſs. For the law of love or nature will not juſtify oppoſition to the greateſt oppreſſion, when ſuch oppoſition muſt be attended with greater evils than ſubmiſſion. Therefore the primitive chriſtians, and many of later ages, did not oppoſe their cruel perſecutors; as it would, without a miracle, have brought on them inevitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. But where there is a rational probability of ſucceſs, any people may lawfully, and it is their duty, to levy war on thoſe who rob them of their rights, whether they be rulers in the State they live in, or any more diſtant powers, even before war is waged againſt them.</p>
            <p>THE truth of this appears from the inſtance before us. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin,</hi> at this time was not at war with <hi>Iſrael;</hi> no, they had been conquered and under his government twenty years; and nothing was heard, but the groans and cries of the oppreſſed. How then, it may be aſked, can they be juſtified in commencing a war?—Doubtleſs they had often petitioned for redreſs of griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, as we have done, and to as little purpoſe. What more could they do in a peaceable way?—They were reduced to the dreadful alternative, either tamely to ſubmit themſelves and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after them, to the galling yoke of mercileſs tyranny; or wage war on the tyrant. The laſt was the meaſure God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and therefore, by a ſpecial command, enjoined it on them. This we are ſure be would not have done, had it been offenſive to him. He did not require <hi>Iſrael</hi> to wait till <hi>Jabin</hi> had invaded their country and ſtruck the firſt blow, (as we did in reſpect to our <hi>Britiſh</hi> oppreſſors.) but while all was peace in his kingdom, for ought we find, God commands <hi>Iſrael</hi> to raiſe an army, and invade the tyrant's dominions.</p>
            <p>THE moral reaſon of this is obvious: For uſurpation or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> offenſive war, already levied. Any State which uſurps a power over another State, or rulers who, by a wanton uſe of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015709_0018_0F99DED2485E22B8"/>
their power, oppreſs their ſubjects, do thereby break the peace, and commence an offenſive war. In ſuch a caſe oppoſition is mere ſelf-defence, and is no more criminal, yea as really our duty, as to defend ourſelves againſt a murderer, or high-way-robber. Self-preſervation is an inſtinct, by God, implanted in our nature: Therefore we ſin againſt God and nature, when we tamely reſign our rights to tyrants, or quietly ſubmit to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic oppreſſors, if it be in our power to defend ourſelves.</p>
            <p>A rebel indeed is a monſter in nature; an enemy, not only to his country, but to all mankind: He is deſtitute of that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence which is the higheſt honor and glory of the rational na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.—But what is a rebel? What thoſe actions for which a man or people deſerve this opprobrious charge?—Thoſe only are rebels who are enemies to good government, and oppoſe ſuch as duly execute it. A ſtate of nature is a ſtate of war. Civil government, which is founded in the conſent of ſociety to be governed by certain laws framed for the general good, and duly executed by ſome appointed thereto, puts an end to this State, and ſecures peace and ſafety. He therefore who tranſgreſſes this compact, even he oppoſes good government, and is a rebel, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellat,</hi> he raiſes war again.</p>
            <p>IN this, it matters not whether the perſon be a king or a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; he is the rebel that breaks the compact, he renews the war, and is the aggreſſor: And every member of the body-politic, is bound, by the eternal law of benevolence, to ſet himſelf againſt him, and if he perſiſts, the whole muſt unite to root him from the earth, whether he be high or low, rich or poor, a king or a ſubject. The latter indeed leſs deſerves it, by how much leſs miſchief he is capable of doing. But when a king or ruler turns rebel, (which is vaſtly more frequent in proportion to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) being armed with power, he ever ſpreads deſolation and miſery around his dominions, before he can be regularly and properly puniſhed; and therefore is proportionably higher in guilt: Witneſs <hi>Pharaoh, Saul, Manaſſeh, Antiochus, Julian, Charles the firſt,</hi> of bleſſed memory, and <hi>George the third,</hi> who vies with the chief in this black catalogue, in ſpreading miſery and ruin round the world.</p>
            <p>THE ruler who invades the civil or religious rights of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſubjects, levies war on them, puts them out of his protection,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015709_0019_0F99DED382CAC090"/>
and diſſolves all their allegiance to him: For allegiance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection are reciprocal, and where one is denied the other muſt ceaſe.</p>
            <p>IF theſe obſervations are true (and they cannot be denied with modeſty) then it is as lawful, and as ſtrongly our duty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute a war againſt the king of <hi>England</hi> for invading our rights and liberties, as to bring an obſtinate rebel to juſtice, or take arms againſt ſome foreign power that might invade us. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion alone, if perſiſted in, juſtifies the oppreſſed in making war on the oppreſſors; whether they be rulers or private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in our own or a foreign State. The reaſon is, becauſe oppreſſors are enemies to the great law of nature, and to the happineſs of mankind. For this, God commanded <hi>Iſrael</hi> to commence a war againſt <hi>Jabin,</hi> that, being free from his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, happineſs and peace might be reſtored.</p>
            <p>IN our conteſt with the tyrant of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> we did not indeed commence the war: No: But tho' under a load of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſupportable inſult, abuſe and reproach, we raiſed our humble and earneſt petitions, and prayed only for Peace, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Safety, the natural rights of all men. But be aſtoniſhed, O Heavens! And tremble O <hi>England!</hi> While our dutiful ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications aſcended before the throne, the monſter was meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blow; and e're we roſe from our knees, he fixed his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in our heart! If this is to be a father, where can be the monſter? If this be the exerciſe of lenity and mercy, as he vainly boaſts, <note n="†" place="bottom">See Gen. Howe's proclamation of November 30th, 1776.</note> what muſt be his acts of juſtice? O merciful God, look down and behold our diſtreſs, and avenge us of our cruel foe.—Can we reflect on thoſe ſcenes of ſlaug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r and deſolation which he hath ſpread before our eyes, and doubt of our duty? Is it any longer a ſcruple whether God calls us to war? If ſuch inſults and abuſe will not juſtify us, no abuſes ever can. Yea, had <hi>George</hi> withheld his hand from ſhedding our blood, the grievous oppreſſions we groaned under before, and the contempt and inſult with which he treated our petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were fully ſufficient to juſtify us in the ſight of God and all wiſe men, had we began the war, and expelled his troops from our country by fire and ſword. Is it poſſible that <hi>Jabin</hi> could treat <hi>Iſrael</hi> with greater inſult, or more unjuſtly invade
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015709_0020_0F99DED46E678440"/>
their rights? But for this God commanded <hi>Iſrael</hi> to make war on him, and pronounces a heavy curſe on thoſe who refuſed to join in carrying it on. This leads me to ſhew,</p>
            <p>IV. THAT thoſe who are indolent, and backward to take up arms and exert themſelves in the ſervice of their country, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to recover and ſecure their freedom, when called thereto by the public voice, are highly criminal in the ſight of God and man.</p>
            <p>THIS doctrine is wrapt up in the very bowels of my text. <hi>Curſe ye Meroz, ſaid the Angel of the Lord, curſe ye bitterly the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereof, becauſe they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord againſt the mighty.</hi> The curſe of God falls on none but for ſin; for he delights in bleſſing, and not in curſing. And he never permits any of his ſubjects to execute his curſes on their fellow ſubjects, but where the crime is highly aggravat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; much leſs does he allow them to curſe them bitterly, unleſs their guilt is exceeding great. Now ſince God commands <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> to curſe <hi>Meroz</hi> bitterly, we fairly infer, that their ſin was of a crimſon dye, and moſt provoking to him and his people. And whoever is guilty of the like conduct in our conteſt with <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> incurs the like g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t.</p>
            <p>THIS needs no further proof. For if it be allowed, that the ſtate of the caſe between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> is, in its main parts, parallel with that between <hi>Jabin</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as hath been ſhewn, then the crime of negligence is as heinous in this ſtruggle as in that. And as <hi>Iſrael</hi> were required to curſe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly thoſe cowardly, ſelfiſh, half-way people, ſo are we to curſe the like characters at this day. And as thoſe people, for their neglect, expoſed themſelves to the loſs of all the privileges and bleſſings of a free State in this world, and to the eternal ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God in the next; ſo it highly concerns all to take heed that they do not fall under the ſame condemnation.

Private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and ſelfiſh conſiderations, ingroſs the thoughts and cares of many, who wiſh well to the cauſe of Liberty, and divert their attention and exertions from the main thing which calls for our firſt and chief regard, <hi>viz.</hi> the defence of our country from ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and ſecuring our civil and religious freedom. It is mournful to ſee moſt men eagerly purſuing worldly gain, and heaping up unrighteous mammon by cruel oppreſſion and grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the faces of the poor; while our country lies bleeding of her wounds, and ſo few engaged to bind them up. Let ſuch conſider, that they are guilty of the ſin of <hi>Meroz,</hi> and tho' they may not feel the curſe of men in this world, they ſhall not, without ſincere repentance, eſcape the wrath and curſe of God in the world to come. Every one is called, at this day, to come to the help of the Lord againſt the mighty; either to go out to war, or in ſome way vigorouſly exert himſelf for the public good. There are various things neceſſary for the defence of our country beſides bearing arms, tho' this is the chief; and all may, one way or other, put to a helping hand. There are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious arts and manufactures eſſential to the ſupport of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants and army, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>out which we muſt ſoon be overcome: In one or other of theſe, men and women, youth, and even chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, may be employed, and as eſſentially help in the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their country, as thoſe who go out to war. All are now called to more than ordinary frugality and diligence in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective callings; <note n="¶" place="bottom">Suppoſe every fifth man to be employed in the army, and the number of depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants to be as great as befor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have been informed that <hi>Newbury,</hi> by a town vote, encouraged erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing works and carrying on the making Salt-pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this winter they have ſubſcribed above 500<abbr>l.</abbr> to enable me to erect large Salt works: A manufacture moſt neceſſary for the good of the State.</note> But alaſs, that ſo few make the intereſt and wellfare of the public the main object of their purſuit. Yet there are ſome, and I hope many, who with truth can ſay, they have done their beſt, according to their circumſtances, for the defence and ſafety of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015709_0022_0F99DED56ABA6A60"/>
their country. Such, however the conteſt may iſſue, will enjoy the approbation of God, their own conſciences, and of all the friends of mankind.</p>
            <p>BUT not to make our caſe appear better than it really is; I fear there are many among us, in one diſguiſe or other, who, when ſtript of their vizards, will appear to be of the inhabitants of <hi>Meroz;</hi> and who, if their characters were juſtly drawn, would ſecretly, if not openly ſay, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in another caſe, <hi>In ſaying this, thou reproacheſt us alſo.</hi> But as birds which are hit, ſhow it by their fluttering, and it may ſerve to bring ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible characters to view, and expoſe them to the curſe they deſerve, and on the other hand, may convince ſome real friends to freedom, of their ſinful negligence in the common cauſe, I will venture to point out a few.</p>
            <p>AMONG theſe characters, I do not include ſuch as aid, or in words or actions defend, or openly declare for the enemy, and plead the right of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> "to bind us in all caſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever." Of ſuch there are not many among us; owing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably to their fear of a vaſt majority, which is on the ſide of freedom; and therefore they put on the guiſe of friendſhip, while they endeavor ſecretly to work deſtruction to the cauſe. Theſe may be known by the following marks.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Obſerve the man who will neither go himſelf, nor contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of his ſubſtance (if able) to encourage others to go into the war. Such do what in them lays to break up the army: Theſe incur the curſe of <hi>Meroz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Others will expreſs wiſhes for our ſucceſs, but will be ſure to back them with doubts of the event, and fears of a heavier yoke. You may hear them frequently magnifying the power of the enemy, and telling of the <hi>nine hundred chariots of iron;</hi> the dreadful train of artillery, and the good diſcipline of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> troops—Of the intolerable hardſhips the ſoldiers undergo, and the ſtarving condition of their families at home: And by a thouſand ſuch arts endeavouring to diſcourage the people from the war,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THERE are other pretended friends whoſe countenance bewrays them. When things go ill with our army, they appear
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015709_0023_0F99DED62301AB80"/>
with a cheerful countenance, and aſſume airs of importance, and you'll ſee the Core holding conferences i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> one corner or another. The joy of their hearts, on ſuch occaſions, will break thro' all diſguiſes, and diſcover their real ſentiments; while their grief and long faces, in a reverſe of fortune, is a plain index pointing to the end at which they really aim.</p>
            <p n="4">4. OTHERS, who talk much for liberty, you will find ever oppoſing the meaſures of defence propoſed; making objections to them, and ſhewing their inconſiſtency; while they offer none in their ſtead, or only ſuch as tend to embarraſs the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: They are ſo prudent, that they will waſte away days, yea months to conſider; and are ever full of their wiſe cautions; but never zealous to execute any important project. When ſuch men get into public ſtations; eſpecially if they fill a ſeat in our public councils, they greatly endanger the State; they protract buſineſs, and often defeat the beſt councils. Prudence and moderation are amiable virtues, and the modeſt mind feels pain on being ſuſpected as ſanguine, raſh and imprudent. This gives the over prudent great advantage to obſtruct every vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous meaſure, which they brand with the name of raſhneſs: And every friend to vigorous action feels the reflection, who, without great fortitude, ſits down abaſhed, and with grief ſees his counſels defeated. But if the meaſure be adopted, the next motion of the prudent man is, to delay the execution, that the happy moment, on which all depends, may be loſt. <note n="¶" place="bottom">
                  <p>We have a remarkable inſtance of this nature in 2. Samuel 17.1—14. <hi>David</hi> had juſt retreated from Jeruſalem with only 600 men, when <hi>Abſalom</hi> entered the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and night came on. <hi>Ahithophel</hi> counſelled for an immediate purſuit.

                     <hi>David</hi> in a moment. But mark his deſign—was it to gain advantage of <hi>David?</hi> no; but to give him an opportunity to retreat, collect a larger force, and diſpoſe his army for battle.</p>

               </note> Theſe

               <hi>over</hi> and <hi>over</hi> prudent men ought to be ſuſpected, and viewed with a watchful eye: And the diſcerning mind will ſoon be able to diſcover, whether ſuch counſels ſpring from true wiſdom, or from a deſign to enſnare us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Some are diſcovered by the company they keep. You may find them often with thoſe who have given too much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect their enmity to our cauſe, and rarely with the zealous friends of liberty, except by accident; and then they ſpeak and act like creatures out of their element, and ſoon leave the company, or grow mute, when <hi>liberty</hi> is the ſubject of diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THERE are others who in heart wiſh well to our cauſe, but through fear of the power of our enemies, they are back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to join vigorouſly to ſupport it; they really wiſh we might ſucceed, but they dread the hardſhips of a campaign, and chooſe ſo to conduct, that, on whatever ſide victory may declare, they may be ſafe.</p>
            <p n="7">7. OTHERS wiſh well to the public cauſe, but have a much greater value for their own private and perſonal intereſt. They are high ſons of liberty, 'till her cauſe croſſes their private views, and even then, they boaſt in her name, while, like <hi>George</hi> 3d. they ſtab her to the heart, by refuſing ſubmiſſion to thoſe regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which are eſſential to her preſervation.</p>
            <p>ALL theſe, and many others of the like kind, might doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have been found in <hi>Meroz,</hi> and yet the beſt of them all fell under this bitter curſe: For whatever were their private ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they all led to the iſſue, viz. to keep them back from thoſe vigorous efforts that the cauſe of liberty then required, and for want of which, it was greatly hazarded. And whatever motives influence men at this day, whether a deſire of eaſe, hope of power, honor, or wealth; if they do any thing againſt, or neglect to aſſiſt all in their power, the glorious cauſe of freedom, now in our hands, they, in a greater or leſs degree, incur the curſe of <hi>Meroz.</hi> Now, if ever, is that text to be applied to ſuch, <hi>Curſed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully; and curſed be he that holdeth back his ſword from blood.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. THIS conduct is a violation of the law of nature, which requires all to exert themſelves to promote happineſs among mankind.

When therefore we ſee our fellow creatures, eſpecially our friends and brethren, whoſe happineſs is more immediately our care, reduced to a ſtate of miſery, robbed of their moſt dear and unalienable rights, and borne down with a heavy load of oppreſſion and abuſe by the hands of tyrants; this law requires us to ſtand forth in their defence, even though we are not involved with them in the ſame evils, and how much more, when our own happineſs is equally concerned? <note n="‡" place="bottom">Moſes, thou h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If we nobly reſiſt the oppreſſor, we ſhall, under God, deliver them from his galling yoke; at leaſt ſhall avoid the guilt of riveting it on them: But if we bow tamely to have it faſtened on our necks, unborn ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, thro' unknown centuries, may never be able to ſhake it off; but muſt waſte away a wretched exiſtence, in this world,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015709_0026_0F99DEDBAFCBE2B8"/>
without any other claim to the fruit of their labors, or even to the dear pledges of conjugal love, the fruit of their own bodies, than ſuch as depends on the uncontrouled will of an haughty tyrant.</p>
            <p>Let us, for a moment, glance an eye on the next and ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generations. What a ſcene opens to view! Behold theſe delightful and ſtately manſions for which we labored, poſſeſſed by the minions of power: See yonder ſpacious fields, ſubdued to fruitfulneſs by the ſweat and toil of our fathers or ourſelves, yielding their encreaſe to clothe, pamper and enrich the tyrants favorites, who are baſe enough to aſſiſt him in his curſed plots to enſlave us.—Does this rouſe your reſentment?—Stop a moment, and I'll ſhew you a ſpectacle more ſhocking than this. What meager viſages do I ſee in yonder field, toiling and covered with ſweat, to cultivate the ſoil?—Who are thoſe in rags, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burdens and drawing water for theſe haughty lords, and then cringing to them for a morſel of bread? —They are—O graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, ſupport my ſpirits—They are my ſons, and my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the fruit of my body, the pledges of conjugal love, for whoſe comfort I tho't myſelf happy to ſpend my days in labor, my nights in care!—Thus are my hopes blaſted! — O that they had never been born, rather than to ſee them loaded with irons and dragging after them, where ever they go, the heavy, gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ignominious chains of ſlavery—But may we not hope for an end of theſe miſeries? —Alafs, what hope? Slavery debaſes the human faculties, and ſpreads a torpor and ſtupidity over the whole frame! They ſink in deſpair under their load; they ſee no way, they feel no power to recover themſelves from this pit of miſery; but pine away and die in it, and leave to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the ſame wretched inheritance.—What then does he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve? or rather, what curſe is too heavy for the wretch that can tamely ſee our country enſlaved?</p>
            <p n="4">4. THIS is a ſin againſt our forefathers. They left us a fair inheritance. They forſook their native land; the land of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and the furn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

we reſign this patrimony, ſo dearly bought by them, and entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by their will, living and dying? Shall we, I ſay, reſign it all to that tyrant power, which drove them from their native land to this, then howling wilderneſs? Shall we bow our necks to the yoke which they, tho' few in number, nobly caſt off?— Should our fathers riſe from their graves, they would diſown ſuch children, and repent their care and toil for ſuch degenerate ſons.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THIS is a ſin againſt contemporaries. How provoking in the ſight of God and man is it to ſee ſome quite unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the good of the public, rolling in eaſe, amaſſing wealth to themſelves, and ſlyly plotting to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the fatigues of war, and hazard all that's dear to ſecure the peace, liberty and ſafety of the whole? Surely every benevolent heart muſt riſe with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and curſe theſe enemies to God and nature.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THIS is a ſin againſt the expreſs command of God. He commands us to <hi>ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith he hath made us free</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Galatians 5.1.</note> and not to bow to any tyrant on earth when it is in our power to oppoſe him. I proceed,</p>
            <p>V. TO ſhew, that God requires a people, ſtruggling for their liberties, to treat ſuch of the community who will not join them, as open enemies, and to reject them as unworthy the privileges of civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>THE ſingle crime of <hi>Meroz</hi> is ſaid to be this. When they were called to arm in order to ſhake off the yoke of tyranny, they did not join in the glorious cauſe. For this, and only this, they fell under the curſe of God and man. Not only eternal wrath in the world to come, was the juſt reward of this ſin; but ſo highly was God provoked thereby, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his people to inflict his vengeance on them in this world, that being held up as the monuments of his wrath, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might hear and fear, and do no more ſo wickedly.</p>
            <p>A curſe is ſomething more than wiſhing ill to a perſon: It implies a ſeparating him to ſome evil or puniſhment. The command in my text therefore required <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſeparate the

They had implicitly joined with the enemy, by which they put to hazard every dear and valuable enjoyment of the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            <p>THE application of this to our times is eaſy. The preſent war, 'tis probable, had never been commenced, had none of the inhabitants of Meroz <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If it is lawful to deprive the inhabitants of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> of their property, when in our power, and convert it to our uſe; if this be a juſt retaliation for the injury they have done us, and all too little to countervail the damage; much more the intereſt of thoſe who live among us, and yet aſſiſt the enemy in their cruel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, ought to be confiſcated for the ſervice of the public, by how much more miſchief they have done and are capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe States, and by how much greater their ſin.</p>
            <p>I can't but think it would have been happy for theſe States, had our rulers, long e're now, declared that all who ſhould be found any way aiding and aſſiſting the enemy, or holding a correſpondence with them, ſhould be deemed enemies to theſe States, and forfeit all their eſtates at leaſt.

The real criminals are out of our reach.— What then can be done?—Nothing but to inflict a like puniſhment on a like number of their priſoners in our hands. Accordingly the Hon.

Every ſoldier ſhould enter the field with benevolent, tender, compaſſionate ſentiments, which is the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Jeſus Chriſt. A moroſe, cruel, revengeful, unmerciful temper, is no more conſiſtent with the character of a chriſtian ſoldier, than with that of a miniſter of the Goſpel of peace; nor can it be juſtified even in the height of the fierceſt battle. He ſhould ever be poſſeſſed with a diſpoſition to pray for thoſe he endeavors to deſtroy, and to wiſh their beſt, their eternal good. Theſe are no more inconſiſtent in a ſoldier engaging in battle, and doing his beſt to kill his enemies, than they are in a judge and executioner, who take away a murderer from the earth. For as the judge and executioner are God's miniſters to execute vengeance on the wicked who endeavor to deſtroy
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015709_0032_0F99DEDFE5D23488"/>
the happineſs of ſociety; ſo the ſoldier, engaged in a juſt defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive war, is the miniſter of God to render vengeance to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders of others right: And as the executioner may, and ought to pray for the ſuffering criminal, ſo ſhould the ſoldier for his foe. As benevolence is the ſource of vindictive laws in the ſtate, ſo it ſhould ever be of defenſive war; and they both tend to the ſame end, the happineſs of mankind. How abſurd then is the pretence that the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt forbids us to take up arms to defend ourſelves? and that defenſive war is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the patient, meek, long-ſuffering temper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires?

            <p>FROM what has been ſaid we may clearly infer, that to levy offenſive war is murder, and all who engage in it are murderers in God's ſight. They are guilty, not only of the murder of thoſe they kill in battle, or who otherwiſe periſh in the war; but they are ſelf murderers: They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>THE characters therefore of two States or armies at war, are as oppoſite as their actions. The aggreſſor is a murderer and robber, and all who aſſiſt him are involved in his guilt; every ſoldier who fights for him is a murderer too: But we know that no murderer hath eternal life. How ſhould this make thoſe ſhudder who engage on the ſide of the aggreſſor? If they fall in battle, what hope can they have of God's approbation; ſince they die murdering others and themſelves too? But ſuch who oppoſe them in defence of their own and country's peace, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſafety, are God's miniſters, commiſſioned and ordered by him to puniſh his, and his peoples enemies: They therefore may draw their ſwords with a quiet, approving conſcience, and with pity view the wretches ſlain by their hands as ſelf murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: Or if they fall, they can die, in regard to the war, free of the blood of all men, and in peace reſign their ſpirits into the hand of their redeemer.</p>

Would you, my friends, count it an honor to be employed by God to reſtore peace and happineſs to the oppreſſed and miſerable? do you wiſh to perform acts of love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to mankind, and therein be like your creator and redeemer? do yo you fear the wrath and curſe of God pronounced on all who ſpread miſery among his creatures, and on all that aid or aſſiſt them, or ſo much as connive at, or neglect to oppoſe them? Do you deſire to be workers together with God in reſtoring peace and felicity to your groaning country, and to be owned of him as his ſervants when you die? are theſe the object of your deſire and purſuit?
