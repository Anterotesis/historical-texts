            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Religion of Jeſus Chriſt is friendly to civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, advantageous to every age, prohibits nothing but Immorality; it enjoins Obedience to the King as Supreme, and publiſhes on Earth Peace and Good-Will among Men; while the Leaven of the Phariſee aims to fruſtrate every office of Love, and diſunite the World: for which reaſon, our High-Prieſt and common Redeemer warned his diſciples to take heed and beware of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011551_0003_0F87253B9DFBBC48"/>
of thoſe men, which ſupplanted the Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, by crying up with zeal Forms and Trifles to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate Wickedneſs by Force of Superſtition. Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided thoſe people not barely for their exactneſs in tything Mint, Annis, and Cummin, but for neglecting the weightier matters of the Law, Juſtice, Mercy, and Faith; and becauſe they had rendered void the Commandments of God, by their Traditions, in legitimizing Hypocriſy, inward Impurities, feigned Prayers, and Deſtruction of Widows Houſes.</p>
            <p>If we ſurvey the Character of the Phariſees and Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees, we ſhall find them meeting in the two extremes; one judging itſelf bound to perſecute all who differ in opinion from a ſuppoſed ſtandard; the other, as if born in ſome frigid zone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeemed unaffected with the power and charm of Religion, and wholly indifferent about its doctrines, provided they once in ſeven days wore a Jewiſh ſabbatic devotion.—The radical error of the firſt claſs lies in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident preſumption of their own infallible judgment; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, zealouſly blind, they give the diſſenters from them liberty to conform or burn. The error of the ſecond claſs originates from a diſtruſt of the Divinity of Chriſt; hence they live without Faith, and the former without Charity. —To avoid thoſe two dangerous extremes, which have long divided this world, let us copy the behaviour of Chriſt towards the various ſects among the Jews.</p>
            <p>The Eſſenes were numerous, and held many fantaſtical opinions, yet we find no reflections made on them; while the Phariſees and Sadducees were ſeverely and juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on all occaſions.—Behold the reaſon:</p>
            <p>The Eſſenes, though miſtaken in many things, were
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011551_0004_0F87253C52C73870"/>
ſincere and harmleſs, quiet and peaceable, contented and eaſy to enjoy their own conſciences, and to let other men alone: they pretended not to be infallible and tumultuous, ſought not after the Dictator's Chair, nor the ſole govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World: they neither planned nor executed miſchief againſt the conſtitution; but were humble, modeſt, and obedient to the laws. This good diſpoſition rendered them capable of being led from their miſtaken opinions; while the Phariſees and Sadducees were arrogant and ſelf-ſufficient, inſlaved captives to their own imagined perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, too wiſe to learn, too ſanctimonious to receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; ſubtle, ſly, crafty, inſidious projectors; men who would reign and tyrannize, or by their golden cry of Liberty ſet the world on fire:—therefore, of their Hypocriſy take heed and beware.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the chapter is pointed out the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this important and neceſſary caution. Thoſe two ſects had hitherto been at enmity one with the other, like their maſters Herod and Pilate, yet they became friends in a conſpiracy againſt the "Iſraelite in whom was no Guile." Having put on a ſolemn Demureneſs, (the common livery of Hypocrites,) and pretending themſelves ſtrangers to all the miracles wrought by Chriſt, they addreſſed him with "Maſter, we wiſh to ſee a ſign from thee;" and very likely their petition was delivered with a tone, not to find conviction, but as a varniſh to their infidelity, as they aſked a ſign from heaven which they thought would not be given. Chriſt, knowing their deſign, expoſed their falſe pretenſions by pronouncing a truth, which for once ſilenced a gainſaying people, viz. "An adulterous and wicked generation ſeeketh after a ſign from Heaven, and there ſhall no ſign be given to it, but the ſign of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011551_0005_0F87253D103E62E0"/>
Jonas:" then, turning to his Diſciples, ſaid, "Take heed and beware of the Arts and Hypocriſy of thoſe men." Hence we learn, that Men's Principles guide their Actions; that, if the Tree is good, the Fruit will be alſo good; and that evil Opinions are productive of evil Practices. As to the Sadducees, they denied the Exiſtence of Angels and Spirits, and taught, that Matter was the only Compoſition of the Univerſe; they denied alſo the Immortality of the Soul, the Reſurrection of the Body, and a future Life; they idolized the Letter, and miſtook the Spirit, of the Law of Moſes: but the Phariſees held Opinions oppoſite to them, and extolled oral Doctrines equal to the Law and Prophets, whereby their Creed varied every day, and their Devotion was muffled with new Rights and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, totally different from their Neighbours. The event was truly melancholy: one Sect had too much Faith, the other had none: one had no Religion, no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; the other deſpiſed Morality, and depended on Faith. The Leaven or Art of thoſe Men was calculated only for this mortal Life, where Temptation is in all its Pomp; it had no Cure for a Sigh, no Balm for a wounded Heart, except what the Law of Moſes, in the Senſe of a provincial Code, afforded. This Leaven induced men to comply with ſuch Cuſtoms and Sentiments as were moſt prevalent, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſecure to themſelves temporal Intereſt and Dignity: and by it we find they did ſucceed; for the High Prieſt, and all the Council of the Jews, were of the Leaven. Acts v.1.</p>
            <p>Thoſe men, by their Conduct, appear to be Deſcendants of Cain and Nimrod: for the meek Preacher of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtyles them a Generation of Vipers; and St. Jude calls them filthy Dreamers, empty Clouds, wandering Stars, raging Waves, foaming out their own Shame, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011551_0006_0F87253DD6CB1928"/>
Dominion <hi>in others,</hi> and ſpeaking evil of <hi>Dignities.</hi> A People thus diſpoſed ought not to be truſted, ſeeing that they contemn the Law of Liberty wherewith Chriſt has made us free: yet, to the Aſtoniſhment of Hiſtorians, they have too often ſecured to themſelves the Admiration, if not the Government, of the World, by their inſincere and ſanctimonious Pretenſions; while the peaceful, meek, and truly pious men have been neglected and ſet at nought.</p>
            <p>Having thus far pointed out the Character of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees and Sadducees, and the great Propriety of the Caution given in the Text, it appears to be the Duty of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of Chriſt, in all Ages and in all Countries, to warn the Multitude againſt the Leaven of ſuch deſigning men: for Leaven is no leſs infectious now than it was two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ago; nor is it leſs baneful in America, than it has been in Africa, Europe, and Aſia. Of old it owned no Superior, nor Equal; therefore would not ſuffer Chriſt to reign. Thoſe Sects were ever jealous, and fearful leſt they ſhould loſe <hi>their Liberty of governing:</hi> they were conſtant Fautors of Perſecution; for, when they perceived the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of the Humility, the Kindneſs, and the peaceable Doctrines of Chriſt, they artfully alarmed the Multitude with what they themſelves had no fear of, viz. "If this Man is let alone, all men will believe on him, and the Romans will come in and take away our Place and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." This patriotic Pretence then ſucceeded with the Multitude, who ſoon preferred Barabbas to their Saviour and Defender <note n="*" place="bottom">Here is a remarkable Proof that the Vox Populi is not always the Voice of Juſtice.</note>. The Leaven, having killed the Lord of Life, ſoon ſpread and pervaded all States and Kingdoms, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011551_0007_0F87253E8ED59798"/>
mighty Kings, and deluged the Earth with human Blood.—As ſoon as Chriſtianity found its way to theſe weſtern Climes, the Leaven, infuſing the Luſt of Dominion and Liberty, appeared alſo; where, in verity, as in the Eaſtern World, it has warred againſt the Doctrines of Chriſt, and his Law of Liberty, with great Succeſs; and Chriſtianity, after ſtruggling many years, ſeems to have loſt its Reputation, and is giving Way to human Policy, and is likely to be baniſhed from America, now half-ready to act a Part which will diſgrace the dead, intail War on ourſelves, and Miſery on our Children.</p>
            <p>Alas, my native Country! thy beſt Days are expiring —thy glorious Sun of Liberty is ſetting—thy Virtue is dying!—Yet how can I give thee up? Thou haſt been unto me very pleaſant; I will therefore ſeek to do thee good—I will weep Day and Night for the Tranſgreſſions of the People, and pray for the Peace of Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>I am no Politician, though I have long heard the Cry of Law, Conſtitution, and Liberty; but if the <hi>Liberi</hi> mean Liberty to worſhip God in the Beauty of Holineſs, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of Liberty wherewith Chriſt has made us free, then may Heaven maintain their Cauſe! But, if they mean by their Cry to hold the King's Protection, without yielding Obedience to his Authority and the Britiſh Parliament, I would remind them of the Charters by which we claim a legal Title to our Lands, and the Rights of Engliſh Subjects—Gifts and Privileges made to our Fathers, and us their Heirs, on Condition "of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Laws of England, which now are or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall be made"—(Vide Connecticut Charter, dated 1662) — Words tantamount to the late obnoxious Clauſe,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011551_0008_0F87253FD6742B40"/>
which aſſerts the Supremacy of the Britiſh Parliament over the Colonies, in all Caſes whatever; a Doctrine owned by our Fathers, and by all even in the preſent Day, except in the inſtance of Taxation; which Exception ſeems trifling, after granting that our Lives [not our Money] may be taken away by a Britiſh Act of Parliament.—Our Fathers, though led by the great Charm of Liberty, never claimed Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on the Crown of England; nor did the Iſraelites, in the Wilderneſs, make themſelves a Calf, until Moſes had delivered them out of Egypt, and left them under the Guidance of Aaron <note n="*" place="bottom">Canada was taken 1759.</note>. It is wonderful that Princes, in theſe laſt Ages of the World, have not learned the Science of preventing Evils, from the Hiſtory of former Times, eſpecially from the Story of the Calf. However, Aaron exculpated himſelf by telling Moſes, "Thou knoweſt the People, that they are ſet on Miſchief; for they ſaid unto me, Make us Gods which ſhall go before us; for as for this Moſes, the man who brought us up out of the Land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him." Exod. xxxii.</p>
            <p>We who are ſtigmatized with being Sons of Iſſachar, and Eſſenes in Perfection, have a plentiful Crop of Miſery to gather in, if we credit the Sermons and Declarations of the multiformed Sects of Proteſtant-proteſting Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciators, who have aſſumed a ſelf-conſtituted Power of nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying Acts of Parliament and the Statutes of this Colony. How far they have ſucceeded in the latter Caſe, we already know; but the former is yet pending on the Concorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Civil Magiſtrate and the Eccleſiaſtic Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations.—However, as Charity hopes all things, and the

General Aſſembly has adjudged as treaſonable the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutional Principles of the Wallingsford Aſſociators and the Bill-of-Rights-men, who took the Liberty, by help of their ſtrolling Fancies, to abrogate the County Courts, and to pay their honeſt Debts, with the Cry of legal Reſiſtance, we may logically conclude they will not legalize Reſiſtance againſt the Supreme Power of the Nation, after declaring Reſiſtance againſt colonial Laws illegal and treaſonable.

            <p>Were we leſs friendly to America, or the King's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, which is the Bulwark of Proteſtantiſm, than our Diſſenting Brethren are, we ſhould not have more Reaſon to complain of Grievances peculiar to the Church of England in America, than they and all other Sects of Chriſtians in the whole World <note n="*" place="bottom">Papiſts ſecure Government by ſwearing that the Pope has no civil Juriſdiction in the Engliſh Dominions; American Diſſenters are inſtalled Teachers without ſwearing Obedience to the Engliſh King; yet theſe Sects have their Biſhops and Synods, and other Rights neceſſary for their reſpective Syſtems: while the Proteſtant Epiſcopalians, who are one-third Part of Britiſh America, ſwear Obedience to the King, and abjure the civil and eccleſiaſtical Power of the Pope; and, after all, are denied a reſident Biſhop by their Proteſtant King, and the Liberty of obeying God and the Conſtitution by their own Countrymen.— Let common Senſe determine who has moſt Reaſon to complain of Grievances, among Proteſtants, Papiſts, or Diſſenters, in America.</note>; or, had we croſſed a briny Ocean to import epiſcopal Tyranny <note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Bellamy, in his Sermon before the General Aſſembly of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, ſaid, "Epiſcopacy was like a Cancer deep rooted already, and was daily increaſing, by the golden Influence of an Engliſh propagating Society, over our ambitious Sons, who are frequently croſſing a briny Deep to import prelatic Tyranny, which our Fathers could not bear, and which threatens ſpeedy Ruin to our American Vine.
