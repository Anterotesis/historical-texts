            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> up under a Calling that may ſeem to be a bar from coming home to God: You ſhall ſometimes hear a Man ſay, my Calling hinders me from God and Goodneſs; but I would ſay to ſuch a one, if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeſt to Chriſt, though thy Calling be never ſo baſe and unſuitable to God, and the Ways of God, yet thou ſhalt be fetcht home, and brought home to Jeſus Chriſt at one Time or other; Witneſs the Jaylo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> here the Text ſpeaks of, that had a Calling bad enough, for inſtead of profeſſing Chriſt and his Goſpel, he was a Perſecutor of Chriſt and his People, a rough he wen Fellow, that dealt hardly with theſe precious Servants of Chriſt, beating them, and putting them in the inward Priſon, and made faſt their Feet in the Stocks, as you may read in the 24 Verſe; but Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas <hi>ſang in the Priſon,</hi> Verſ. 25. And take notice by the Way, that God can ſometimes make a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon a Palace to thoſe that fear him. And as they were praying, and ſinging Praiſes to God, the Lord ſhook the Priſon where they were, and with his ſhaking the Priſon, he did ſhake the Jaylor's Heart, he had an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake within him, as well as without him; whereupon being greatly perplexed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd, the Text tells your here, <hi>He calls for a Light, and ſprang in, and came tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004757_0003_100DE7DE8386F828"/>
brought them out, and ſaid, Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> So that this Text tells and deſcribes to you, the Jaylor's Carriage when God firſt ſtruck his Heart, and gave him a Sight of himſelf, and of his Sins; and in this Carriage of the Jaylor, there are theſe three Things very obſervable;</p>
            <p>His Perplexity, his Courteſy, his Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; his Perplexity, in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 29. His Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy and Queſtion, in <hi>Verſ.</hi> 30.</p>
            <p>Firſt, His Perplexity, <hi>He called for a Light and ſprang in, and came trembling, and fel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> down before Paul and Silas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, His Courteſy, the Text ſays, <hi>he brought them out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, His Queſtion; <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the firſt of theſe I principally aim at, namely, the Jaylor's Perplexity, <hi>Than he called for a Light;</hi> Darkneſs now was a Terror to him, becauſe he was a Terror to himſelf, <hi>He was a Magor-Miſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ib, a Terror round about,</hi> Jer. 20 3. <hi>And he ſprang in,</hi> that is, he ruſht haſtily into the Priſon, and like a Man diſtracted, knew not what to do, nor which way to turn himſelf; <hi>he came trembling,</hi> being ſtrucken with inward Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Terror of Conſcience; and pray obſerve it well; there is not the ſtouteſt Man breathing upon Earth, but if God ſet his Conſcience againſt him, like a Dog to fly in his Face, it will pull him down, and lay him flat, and fill him with that inward
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004757_0004_100DE7E1B8236DF0"/>
Horror and Terror, and Perplexity, that he will be more afraid of himſelf, than of all the World beſides. Thus it was with the Jaylor here, when God came nigh him, and awakened his Conſcience, <hi>he fell down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paul and Silas.</hi> God had given him a Sight of his Sins, and of the inviſible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Chriſt, that was in thoſe his precious Servants, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> whom before he lookt upon as a couple of Rogues, and that the Whip and the Stocks, were good enough for them, but now he reverenceth them, and reſpects them, and falls down at their Feet. Thus you ſee what his Perplexity was.</p>
            <p>My Purpoſe is not to inſiſt upon every Particular, but to pitch upon that which is principally held forth in the Words; Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve therefore, when God was about to Work the great Work of ſaving Faith, and ſound Converſion in the Heart of this Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, to bring him to Salvation, what is the firſt Thing that he does? Firſt he humbles him, and ſtrikes him down, and lays him flat, he doth awaken and ſhake his Conſcience; this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken Sinner is now amazed, and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and aſtoniſhed, and he knows not which way to turn himſelf. So then the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation I would commend to you from the Words, is this:</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sound Humiliation is a neceſſary Antecedent or fore-runner to Faith and Salvation.</hi>

                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004757_0004_100DE7E1B8236DF0"/>Would you have it plainer? then take it thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe whom God intends to make true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and Heirs of his everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they are firſt ſoundly humbled, and made ſenſible of their own dangerous and damnable Condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Look as a Timber-Tree, that a Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for Building, firſt he hews it down, and then he fits it, and ſquares it for the Building; ſo that Sinner whom God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to frame for himſelf, and build up by Faith to Salvation, God firſt caſts down to the Ground, and lays him flat, and makes him ſenſible of his own loſt and dangerous, and damnable Eſtate: Look into the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and you ſhall find that is God's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and Jeſus Chriſt's Method, and the Holy Ghoſt's.</p>
               <p>Firſt, This is God's Method, and this Courſe he took with our firſt Parents, he arraigned them, and paſt a Sentence upon them, and pronounced a Curſe againſt them, before ever he brings them to the Knowledge of a Saviour, before ever he made that Promiſe, that <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents Head.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable is that Scripture, <hi>Job.</hi> 33.21, 22. it deſcribes the Manner of God's converting a Sinner, <hi>Ver</hi> 14 <hi>God ſpeaketh once, ye twice, yet Man perceiveth it not.</hi> God calls, and cries, and knocks, and tries this Way, and

               </p>
               <p>So this was the Method of Jeſus Chriſt, this Courſe he took with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> before he was Converted, he unhorſt him, and humbled him, and ſtruck him blind, and all this while St. <hi>Paul</hi> muſt ſteep in Sorrow, before <hi>Ananias</hi> comes to him, and ſpeak Words of Comfort, <hi>Acts</hi> 9 Chriſt would have us <hi>weary and heavy Laden.</hi> Matth. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Iſa. 55.1. <hi>Ho, every one that Thirſteth, came ye to the Waters;</hi> that is, to be ſenſible of the want of Chriſt, and the worth of Chriſt, before he gives the Soul to taſte of the Waters of Life; and he will have the Soul ſick of Sin, before the Phyſician comes to it, <hi>The whole have no need of a Phyſician, but they that

               <p>And this is the Holy Ghoſt's Method too; for you ſhall read the Spirit of God, Firſt <hi>convinceth of Sin, before he convinceth of Righteouſneſs,</hi> John 16 8. Firſt, The Spirit of God convinceth of Sin for Humiliation, before he convinceth of Righteouſneſs for Juſtification.</p>
               <p>And this hath been the Method of all Maſter-Builders. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> he comes levelling of Mountains, and caſting down proud Sinners before they come to Chriſt; and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he prickt his Hearers to the Heart, before he gave them any Hope or Comfort by a Saviour, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. He let them Blood at the Heart before he directed them how to be ſaved. But now, becauſe this is a weighty Truth, and it may pleaſe God to do good to ſome of you all the Days of your Lives, to know the Method and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of bringing Jeſus Chriſt and the Soul together, (for this is all the Work we Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have to do,) let me ſpeak to it by way of Explication, and ſhew you three Things.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is <hi>an active Humiliation;</hi> and this is that whereby a Sinner humbles himſelf before God; of this you read 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 12.7 <hi>They have humbled themſelves, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not deſtroy them.</hi> Now it is not this latter I am to ſpeak of; this, to ſpeak properly, is nothing but the Act of renewed Repentance; but I am to ſpeak of the firſt, namely, that whereby God in the firſt Work of Converſion lets a Man ſee the need that he hath of Jeſus Chriſt, and it may be thus deſcrib'd, <hi>Paſſive Humiliation is a Work of the Spirit of God, whereby a poor Sinner being ſtricken with a Senſe of his Sin, and fear of Wrath, doth fly out of himſelf and cloſeth with Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> I ſay, <hi>It is a Work of the Spirit of God,</hi> becauſe it is the Spirit that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth of Sin, and by convincing of Sin, he humbles the Soul; and hence it is the Spirit of God in the firſt Work of Converſion, is called the Spirit of Bondage, Rom. 8.15. <hi>For ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004757_0006_100DE7E50E6ADF48"/>
again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father.</hi> Why is it called the Spirit of Bondage? Not becauſe the Spirit of God brings the Soul into Bondage, for the Spirit of God is a free Spirit, Pſal. 51 12. <hi>Uphold me with thy free Spirit; and where the Spirit of God is, there is Liberty.</hi> But he is called a Spirit of Bondage, becauſe he diſcovers to us our Bondage, and lets the Sinner ſee the Bondage and Slavery wherein he is miſerably captivated under Sin and Satan. A Man, before the Work of Converſion is wrought, thinks himſelf a Free-Man; <hi>We are Abraham's Seed, and were never in Bondage to any, how ſayeſt thou we ſhall be made free?</hi> John 8 33. But now the Spirit of God comes, and lets a Man ſee himſelf in the Glaſs of God's Law, whereby he diſcovers Sin to be out of Meaſure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and it lets him ſee himſelf in the Glaſs of Conſcience, and ſo comes to the Sinner, and ſays to him, juſt as <hi>Nathan</hi> did to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Thou art the Man,</hi> thou art he that lyeth under the Guilt of Sin, and under the Wrath of God, and under the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſecond Death; therefore look to it. When the Spirit of God lets a Man ſee himſelf, and his Bondage, and that State of Woe and Miſery in which he is, now he confeſſeth he is in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and in the Bond of Iniquity. Again, I ſay in the Deſcription of it, that <hi>the poor Sinner
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004757_0007_100DE7E76D08B790"/>
is ſtricken with the ſenſe of his Sin, and with the fear of Wrath.</hi> Before a Man is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, he is juſt like a Man in a dead Sleep, in a drunken Sleep, he hears not, he fears not, he feels not; like the Drunkard that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, Prov. 23.34, 35 <hi>Yea, thou ſhalt be as he that lyeth down in the midſt of the Sea, or as he that lyeth upon the top of a Maſt; they have ſtricken me, ſhalt thou ſay, and I was not ſick, they have beaten me, and I felt it not; when I ſhall awake, I will ſeek it yet again.</hi> But when once the Spirit of God comes to ſtrike the Sinner to the Purpoſe, now Sin is revived, and Conſcience awakened and convicted, as the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I was alive once without the Law,</hi> alive in my own Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, alive without the ſpiritual Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law; <hi>but Sin revived, and I died,</hi> Rom. 7.9. Then the Law ſhewed me I was but a dead Man; O, Conſcience now began to be awaked, and convicted. Senſe of Sin brings with it a fear of Wrath, and hence it is, that the Spirit of Bondage is called a Spirit of Fear. 2 Tim. 1.7. <hi>For, God hath not given us the Spirit of Fear, but of Power, of Love, and of a ſound Mind</hi> And this Fear doth awaken a Man, and leave ſome kind of Impreſſion upon the Spirit of a Man, ſo that he is awakened, and looks out for Help out of himſelf Again. I ſay <hi>A Sinner thus ſtricken with the Senſe of his Sin, flies out of himſelf, and flies to Jeſus
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004757_0007_100DE7E76D08B790"/>
Chriſt;</hi> That is, he deſpairs of all Hope, and Help in himſelf: I dare ſay, he was never a true believing Sinner, that was not a deſpairing Sinner; underſtand me thus, there is a religious-deſperation, as well as a damning-deſperation; I ſay, a Sinner that is ſtricken with the Senſe of his Sins, deſpairs of Help in himſelf; this is an holy Deſpair, whereby a Man renounceth all Hope of Help in himſelf, and flies to Jeſus Chriſt. This is a certain Rule, the leſs a Man truſts in himſelf, the more he truſts in a Saviour. That's the firſt Thing, What this Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is?</p>
               <p>A ſecond Queſtion to be ſatisfied is this, <hi>Whether the like Meaſure of Humiliation be wrought in all thoſe that are brought home to Jeſus Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, No, ſome have more, and ſome have leſs, according to the different Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Men's Spirits: ſome Men are more froward, and ſome are more ingenious; thoſe that are openly prophane, ſtout, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Sinners, they uſually have a great Meaſure of Humiliation, but now thoſe that are more flexible, have a leſs Meaſure of Humiliation; to the firſt, God comes like a mighty ruſhing Wind, to the ſecond Sort, he comes like a ſtill Wind, in a more mild and melting Way; ſometimes God breaks in upon the Sinner's Heart with open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as he did upon St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was ſmitten down to the Ground, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004757_0008_100DE7E96DE0DF80"/>
Sometimes again God opens the Heart without any Noiſe, as he did the Heart of <hi>Lydia, Acts</hi> 16 Sometimes God ſuffers a Sinner to lie long under the Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, thoſe eſpecially that he hath appointed for ſome ſpecial Uſe and Service to himſelf; as the Timber that is appointed for ſome ſpecial Service, lies long a ſoaking, before it be made Uſe of. Sometimes again Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are ſet free from legal Terrors ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly; now this is the leaſt Meaſure of Humiliation, wrought in thoſe that are brought home to Jeſus Chriſt, to make Sin odious, and loathſome to a Man, and to make a Man fly out of himſelf to Jeſus Chriſt There is a twofold paſſive Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>A Legal Humiliation.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>An Evangelical Humiliation.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The legal Humiliation is that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in legal Terror, and fear of Wrath, and the Senſe of God's Wrath, and Horror of Conſcience, and Fear of Hell-Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is an evangelical Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and that conſiſts in the Operation of God's bleſſed Spirit, convincing a Man of Sin; thus the Spirit of God convinceth the Sinner, and by convincing him, empties him of himſelf, and by emptying him fits him for a Saviour. Legal Humiliation, <hi>(pray mark)</hi> though it makes a greater Noiſe, yet it is not always abſolutely need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for all Perſons, which I prove thus
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004757_0008_100DE7E96DE0DF80"/>
It is not a Grace, becauſe a Man can never have too much Grace, and a Man may have too much legal Humiliation. Again, ſome Reprobates have had a great Meaſure of legal Humiliation, and yet have periſhed; and ſome that have been converted have had but a little Meaſure of legal Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet have been ſaved. I ſay, legal Humiliation, though it makes a great Noiſe, is not abſolutely needful: But evangelical Humiliation, though it makes a leſs Noiſe, this is abſolutely needful to every Perſon, becauſe this drives a Sinner out of himſelf, and cauſeth him to fly to Jeſus Chriſt, in a mild and melting Way, making him, <hi>to look on him whom he hath pierced, and to mourn for his Sin, as he that mourns for the loſs of his only Son that ſerves him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Thing to be opened, is this, <hi>But why doth God take this Courſe, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men to Faith and Salvation?</hi> The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are theſe three.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is equal, becauſe it is God's Way; and there is all the Reaſon in the World, that God ſhould bring us to Heaven in his own Way; that it is God's Way, appears, Iſa. 61.1, 2. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me,</hi> (ſaith Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good Tidings to the Meek; he hath ſent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim Liberty

to the Captives, and the opening of the Priſon to them that are Bound, to proclaim the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Year of the Lord, and the Day of Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our God, to comfort all that mourn.</hi> So you ſee they are to be comforted that mourn, and they are to be bound up that are broken-hearted; ſo that, till a Man be Meek and Humble, and have a broken Heart, he is out of Chriſt's Commiſſion to Comfort, Chriſt will ſay to ſuch, <hi>I have nothing to do with thee, I am ſent to thoſe that are Meek and Humble, and Broken-hearted,</hi> Luke 19 10.

               <p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In reference to <hi>God,</hi> becauſe by this Humiliation, the Juſtice of God is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and the Mercy of God is magnified;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004757_0009_100DE7ECA6461C68"/>
theſe are the two great Attributes that God will have magnified in the Converſion of a Sinner. The Juſtice of God is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, when the Sinner falls down at the Feet of God, and ſaith, <hi>Lord, againſt thee, againſt thee have I ſinned, and done this Evil in thy Sight, that thou mighteſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt, and clear when that judgeſt</hi> Pſal. 51.4 And the Mercy of God is wonderfully magnified, when he hangs out a white Flag of Pardon, after all the Sinner's Rebellions and Provocations, O now, Mercy is Mercy indeed! As a King, when he is about to Pardon a Traitor, he ſuffers him to be brought to the Place of Execution, and to have the Rope about his Neck, and the Hankerchief drawn over his Face; O how welcome is a Pardon then to that Traitor! So a humbled Sinner will ſay, Mercy is Mercy indeed, when he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his deſperate, and undone Eſtate and Condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is fitting in reſpect of <hi>our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> that we know ourſelves. <hi>Know the Plague of our Heart,</hi> 1 Kings 8.38. God will have us to ſee and to feel, that <hi>it is an evil, and bitter Thing, that we have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt him.</hi> Jer. 2 19. <hi>Thine own Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall correct thee, and thy Backſlidings ſhall reprove thee; know therefore, and ſee that it is an evil Thing, and bitter, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, ſaith the Lord God of

                  </gap> under the Law, <hi>I am unclean, I am unclean,</hi> Levit. 13.45 As <hi>Miriam</hi> for her Miſcarriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Moſes,</hi> was ſmitten with a Leproſy, <hi>Moſes,</hi> cryed to the Lord to heal her; no, ſtay, ſaith God, <hi>If her Father had but ſpit in her Face, ſhould ſhe not be aſhamed ſeven Days?</hi> She muſt know herſelf before ſhe be healed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.10, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is fitting in reſpecT of <hi>others,</hi> that they may not ſpeak reproachfully of God, and the Ways of God. If ſo be a Sinner could inſtantly ſtep out of an Ale-Houſe to Chriſt, or out of a Whore-Houſe to Chriſt; if there were no more required to get to Chriſt, than the putting of Meat out of one Diſh into another, carnal Men would be ready to have very low Thoughts of God, that he is ſuch a one as themſelves, that he doth patronize and approve their wicked Courſes; but God will have the Mouth of Iniquity ſtopt, and carnal Men themſelves acknowledge, that the Ways of God are equal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is neceſſary that the Soul be humbled. I ſhall give you theſe five Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the neceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> Becauſe without this Humiliation, the Sinner can never highly prize God. To an unhumbled Sinner, Chriſt is no more eſteemed (with reverence be is ſpoken) than the Dirt under his Feet, Acts 4 11.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004757_0010_100DE7EEF8EC6EF8"/>
                  <hi>This is the Stone which was ſet at nought by you Builders;</hi> they made no reckoning of Chriſt at all. Tell an unhumbled Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Juſtification, of Sanctification, of Adoption, of the Hope of Glory, and the like, he makes no more reckoning of them, than the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did of the <hi>Manna,</hi> who loathed it; but now when a Sinner is ſmitten with a ſenſe of Sin, and fear of Wrath, and feels the Burden of Guilt upon his Conſcience, now Chriſt is Chriſt indeed, and he looks upon him with an admiring Eye, and cries out, O the Dignity of his Perſon! The Preciouſneſs of his Blood! The Value of his Merits! The Efficacy of his Interceſſion! The Comfort of his Spirit! O the Comforts and Excellencies that are in this ſweet and precious Saviour! <hi>My Beloved</hi> (ſaith ſuch a Soul) <hi>is the choiceſt of ten thouſand. The Poor</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>receive the Goſpel;</hi> that is, thoſe that are poor in Spirit, they like the wiſe Merchant will be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſell all to buy him who is the Pearl of invaluable Price; an humbled Sinner will ſay, <hi>Give me Chriſt though I have a Croſs with him, though I have a Priſon with him, nay, though I die with him, though I die for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Without Humiliation the Sinner can never duly and diligently ſeek Chriſt You know <hi>The Law is a School-Maſter to bring us unto Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:004757_0011_100DE7F08B4F2058"/>
Gal, 3.24 The Truth is, the Soul will never run to Chriſt to the Purpoſe, until it be whipt by this School-Maſter. You know the Story of the City of Refuge, the Man ſlayer never fled thither, until the Avenger of Blood purſued him. The City of Refuge is Jeſus Chriſt, and the Sinner never flies to Jeſus Chriſt to Purpoſe, until the Vengeance of a Sin-revenging God, and the Curſe of a condemning Law, and the Horror of a ſelf-accuſing Conſcience, purſue the Soul like a chaſed Deer; now it flies to Jeſus Chriſt to Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Without Humiliation the Sinner will never obey Chriſt; an unbroken Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is like an unbroken Colt, that is not tamed, or like an unbroken Heiſer that will not ſubmit to the Yoke; Jeſus Chriſt may command what he will, but he will do what he liſts. But when a Sinner comes to be humbled and unho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Before the Sinner is humbled, he is ever complaining of the unkindneſs of God's dealing with him, but after he is humbled, he is ever complaining how unkindly he deals with God. <hi>As all Diſobedience ſprings from Pride, ſo all Obedience ſprings from Humility</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Without Humiliation the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will never conſtantly cleave to Jeſus

There are many that ſeemingly cloſe with Chriſt for a while, juſt like thoſe that rejoyced in <hi>John Baptiſt's</hi> Doctrine for a while, John 5 35. <hi>He was a burning and a ſhinging Light, and ye were willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in his Light for a ſeaſon.</hi> And you read of ſome that followed Chriſt for a while, <hi>but they were offended, and went back, and walked no more with him,</hi> Joh. 6 66.

Becauſe they were never through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled, they are weary of Chriſt's Yoke, becauſe they never felt the Burden of the Devil's Yoke, and of Sins Yoke; that Soul that hath felt the Burden of Satan's Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This Humilation is neceſſary, becauſe without it we can never be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Chriſt; for Chriſt was firſt humbled, before he was exalted, <hi>He drank of the

               <p>The firſt <hi>Inſtruction</hi> or <hi>Leſſon</hi> by way of Inference, is this, <hi>If ſound Humiliation be ſuch a neceſſary Antecedent to Faith and Salvation,</hi> then it juſtifies the Practice of thoſe Miniſters, that take this Courſe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, and humbling, and wounding, and awakening ſleepy Sinners; you ſee what we Miniſters may do; nay, you ſee what we muſt do if with Care and Conſcience we would diſcharge our Duty, we muſt ſometimes Thunder and Lighten, as St.<hi>Paul</hi> did when he made <hi>Faelix</hi> to tremble, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. We muſt ſtrike the Sinner's Heart with an Arrow of Conviction, as the Arrow that was ſhot at <hi>Ahab</hi> entred in at the Joints of his Armour, and pierc'd his Heart, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.34 We muſt hedge in the Sinner with inevitable Conviction, and meet him with a drawn Sword, as the Angel did <hi>Balaam,</hi> Numb. 21.23. We muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times knock at the Door of their Hearts, and ſay to them, O thou unregenerate Man, I have ſad News to tell thee! Thou canſt never, ſo long as thou art in this Condition, ſee the Face of God with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or enter into this Kingdom; thou

may'ſt ſee the Face of God indeed, but it will be with Frowns in his Fore-head, and Indignation in his Countenance to thee, when he ſhall Sentence thee to that <gap reason="foreign">

Thou muſt drink of the Cup of God's Wrath and Indignation, which will cauſe the to ſpew and fall, and never riſe again. O Swearer, I have ſad News to tell thee! That the Wrath of God is like a flying Roll, hangs over the Houſe of every Swearer, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. O ignorant and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Sinner, I have ſad News to tell thee, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt will come in flames of Fire to take Vengeance on them that know him not, and obey not the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.7, 8. In a Word, we muſt take any Courſe to awaken Sinners out of their Sloth &amp; Security.</p>
               <p>Two Sorts of Perſons there are that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this kind of Preaching, but moſt do not love it, but diſlike it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The openly prophane and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Sinner, that would fain Sleep in Sin, and go to Hell in a Slumber, and therefore he looks upon ſuch awakning Sermons, as tormenting Sermons, Rev. 11.10. <hi>The two Prophets tormented them that dwelt upon the Earth.</hi> O this convincing, quckning, and awakening Doctrine, this is but a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to many carnal Men, who cry our, <hi>What ado is there with theſe Miniſters?

my Time.</hi> Ah poor Wretch! Art thou afraid to be tormented before thy Time? And art thou not afraid to be tormented Time without End? There are ſome Beaſts ſo furious, that there is nothing but the Fire will came them; ſo there are ſome Men ſo brutiſh, that they are mad upon their evil Ways; as it is ſaid of the <hi>Chaldeans, They are mad upon their Idols,</hi> Jer. 50.38. So ſome are ſo mad upon ſinful Ways and Courſes, that a Miniſter muſt ſpit Fire in their Faces to rouſe them out of their Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſpiritual Lethargy: Art thou angry with a Miniſter, who in tender Compaſſion to thy Soul, would pluck thy Soul as a Fire-Brand out of the Fire, and ſave it from eternal Miſery, and Burnings? If one of you have a Leg broken, you will ſend for a Surgeon to ſet it, and you will be contented that he ſhall put you to great Pain for the recovering of your Limb, and reſtoring you to your former State again; and will you not allow your Miniſters to put you to ſome Pain, and Grief, and Trouble for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of your Souls from that Wound and Breach that Sin hath made upon you?</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:004757_0013_100DE7F7F64B3738"/>To this I reply, What, would you have us apply a Plaiſter where there is no Sore? Would you have us apply a Cordial where they are not ſick? would you have us pour in the Oyl, where there is no Wound? God himſelf pours not in the Oyl of Mercy, but into a broken Veſſel, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1 The Lord knows we delight not in preaching any terrible Doctrines to you, if you were but fitted for Mercy; but if you are not fitted for Mercy, then, as the pricking Needle makes way for the ſewing of the Cloath together, ſo this kind of Preaching, convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and humbling the Sinner, makes way for the bringing of Chriſt and the Soul together, and therefore you may well bear with it.</p>
               <p>A ſecond <hi>Inſtruction</hi> that we may learn from hence, is this, It ſerves to let us ſee what the reaſon is, that there are ſo few Believers, ſo few convinced, and converted; O Miniſters cannot ſpeak of this ſcarce without watery Eyes. Truly heretofore three thouſand were converted at one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but now there is ſcarce one that is converted with three thouſand Sermons. O whence is it that the Work of Converſion is almoſt at an End in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>London?</hi> It is rare to hear of a Soul converted; we hear of many that are prev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004757_0014_100DE7F99DF58A58"/>
that prize him, that believe in him, that obey him, that conſtantly cleave to him, but moſt Men are very well contented to be in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Condition, they are ſecure and quiet without Chriſt; but what is the Reaſon? Becauſe they do not ſee the need they have of Chriſt, for if they did but ſee the need they have of him, they would ſay, they may better want Light, than want Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Light, and by whom they may have the <hi>Light of Life,</hi> John 8.12. They may better want Bread for their Bodies, than the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Bread and ſpiritual Food of the Soul; <hi>I am the Bread of Life,</hi> John 6. If they did but ſee the need they have of him, doubtleſs they would cloſe with him: But why do not they ſee the need that they have of him? The Reaſon is, Becauſe they are not humbled, they were never yet ſtriken with the Senſe of Sin, they never yet ſaw the inſide of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they never, with the Jaylor in the Text, were affrighted, amazed, ſtricken down in the Senſe of Sin.

O that this Doctrine thus opened, might be as a Thunder-Bolt to let ſome of you ſee the inſide of yourſelves. O poor Sinner, thou haſt an inſupportable Burden of Sin and Guilt lying on thy Soul, ready to preſs thee down to Hell, and yet thou feeleſt it not; thou haſt the Wrath of God hanging over thy Head by the twined Thread of a ſhort Life, which it may be thou mayeſt not be free from one Year, nay perhaps not one Month, but thou ſeeſt it not; if thou didſt but ſee it, then thou wouldeſt cry out as he did in <hi>Boſworth</hi> Field, <hi>A Horſe, a Horſe, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for a Horſe;</hi> ſo thou wouldeſt cry out, None but Chriſt, nothing but Chriſt, ten thouſand Worlds for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Uſe</hi> is of <hi>Exhortation;</hi> And I have but two <hi>Exhortations</hi> to tender to you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I Beſeech you, and Exhort you in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt (whoſe poor Meſſenger I am,) that you would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be convinced of the Neceſſity of Humiliation; believe it, be perſwaded of it, be convinced of it, that thou muſt be broken, if ever thou would have Jeſuſ Chriſt to bind thee up; thou muſt be ſick of Sin, if ever thou wouldſt have Jeſus Chriſt to heal thee; thou muſt be dejected and caſt down, if ever thou wouldſt have Jeſus Chriſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thee; if God therefore do not open thine Eyes, and awaken thy Conſcience, and touch thy Heart, I do Pronounce againſt thee, that there is no Chriſt, no Heaven, no
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004757_0015_100DE056765C59F0"/>
Pardon, no Peace, no Comfort, no Salvation for thee. O the miſerable, deplorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all you that were never yet hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, you that were never yet convinced of Sin, you that never taſted the bitterneſs of Sin, you that never felt the burden of Sin, that never yet complained with the Apoſtle, Rom 7 24. <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</hi> Some derive the Word from a Man that is troubled with the Stone in the Bladder, <hi>O wretched Man that I am!</hi> O miſerable is the Condition that you are in, you that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet felt Sin to be Sin, that have not felt the Burden of it, nor taſted the Bitterneſs of it, you are not fit to come to Jeſus Chriſt, you are out of his Commiſſion, for he if ſent to the humble, and broken hearted Sinner, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 61.1. It may be thou knoweſt what Sin is, and Chriſt is, and Grace it, notionally; but there is a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween knowing &amp; inward feeling; wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was thy Condition if thou didſt but feel it, but a thouſand times more wretched is it becauſe thou feeleſt it not.</p>
               <p>My ſecond Exhortation to you, is this, If ſo be <hi>ſound Humiliation be a neceſſary Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to Faith and Salvation,</hi> then uſe the utmoſt of your Endeavours that you may be humbled, broken and bruiſed Sinners, that you may be put into a Capacity to cloſe with a Saviour. Now becauſe I know this is but a harſt <hi>Exhortation,</hi> give me leave to ſweeten it with theſe three Conſiderations,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:004757_0015_100DE056765C59F0"/>Firſt, Remember that the Promiſes of Grace and Mercy are made to all humbled Sinners, Lev. 26.41 <hi>If then their uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Hearts ſhall be humbled, and they accept of the puniſhment of their Sins, then will I remember my Covenant with Jacob, and alſo my Covenant with Iſaac, and alſo my Covenant with Abraham, will I remember, and I will remember the Land</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider, God never looks with ſo much Mercy and Compaſſion on any, as thoſe that are moſt humbled, Jer. 31.18 20. When <hi>Ephraim</hi> be moaned himſelf thus, <hi>Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the Yoke;</hi> I have been proud, and ſtout, and ſtubborn under all thy Rods, <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned. Surely after I was turned I repented, after I was inſtructed I ſmote upon my Thigh. I was a ſhamed yea even confounded.</hi> Now in the 20. <hi>Verſ.</hi> you have God bemoaning <hi>Ephraim, Is Ephraim my dear Son? Is he a pleaſant Child? For ſince I ſpoke againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Bowels are troubled for him, I will ſurely have Mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Do but conſider, That this is the ordinary way that God leads Men to Mercy by; God uſually condemns before he juſtifies, he breaks before he binds up, he pulls down before he builds. <hi>There is a Time to pull down, and a Time to build up,</hi> Eccl. 3.3. That may be applied Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004757_0016_100DE80118D22428"/>
this is, I ſay, God's ordinary Way; and would you have him to go out of his uſual Courſe and Way? If one of you ſhould ſay to your Neighbour, Let me come in at your Window, or break down your Wall, and then I will come in and viſit you; what Anſwer (think you) would he make? If you do not come in at the Door, the ordinary Way, do not come in to me.</p>
               <p>But ſome may ſay. <hi>What will you have us to do? Are we able to humble ourſelves? True indeed, when God hath firſt humbled us, then we are able to humble ourſelves; but you told us even now, in the firſt Work of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we are meerly paſſive, we can do nothing towards our Humiliation, it is the Work of the Spirit of God; you have now preach'd free-will to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, True indeed, in a State of Nature, we can do nothing that may pleaſe God, we cannot ſet one Foot forwards in the way to Heaven; but yet let me tell you, There is never an unconverted Sinner but may do a great deal more than he doth, therefore I put you upon doing no more than you yourſelves can do, and that in theſe five Particulars, which I ſhall ſpeak a little to, and then have done.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Though you cannot humble your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a State of Unregeneracy, yet you may ſuffer another to do it for you, you may ſuffer it to be done. A Man for Example, that is to be cut of the Stone, though he
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004757_0016_100DE80118D22428"/>
cannot cut himſelf, he may ſuffer another to cut him; ſo a Man that is ſick of this deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſtony Diſeaſe, of the Stone in the Heart, though he cannot take it away him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he may ſuffer it to be done; when the Word of God ploughs up the fallow-Ground of your Hearts, you may hold up the Plough, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.22. You may ſuffer the Word of <hi>Exhortation</hi> which is tendred to you; when God wounds you by the Word, you may keep the Wound open: Carnal Men, when the Word hath wounded them, they lick themſelves whole by carnal Counſels, and carnal Company, and carnal Reaſonings; O what a ſtir do Men make to ſhake out the Arrow of Conviction, reſiſting the Spirit of God that is ſtirring in the Miniſtry of the Word upon their Hearts! How many are there that come in Armour to Church, they come in their Coat of Male! How many harden their Necks, that the Word cannot pierce them! Now this you muſt not do, you muſt ſuffer the Word to riffle and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack your Hearts, let the Word ſmite you, as he ſaid, Pſal. 141 5 <hi>Let the Righteous ſmite me.</hi> Let the Word break my Head, or Heart, ſo it may but work upon my Soul. When God rouzeth you, ſuppoſe in any Sickneſs or cutting Croſs, you may join with God in rouzing yourſelves; when God ſmiteth you, may not you ſmite upon your Thighs, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, and ſay, <hi>I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, yea, even confounded, because I di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is a Story of a Man that read in a Book every Day that had three Leaves, a white Leaf, a red Leaf, a black Leaf; the white Leaf of the Book, that was the Joys of Heaven, the red Leaf, that was the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the black Leaf, that was the Torments of Hell; you may look into Hell by Contemplation, and Meditation, that you may prevent Hell to all Eternity; you may medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon the Blood of Chriſt, and ſleep as it were

If any of you have loſt a good Bargain, or miſt a good Market, you can grieve for this; O methinks you ſhould mourn for this, how many Market-Days have I loſt for my Soul; I have burnt out many a precious Light, &amp; ſpent out my precious Time; and can you not Mourn for the loſs of such a Bargain as this is? Suppoſe one of you ſhould be ſent for before a mighty Monarch, and ſhould be impeacht of high Treaſon before him; how would you trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to appear before ſo mighty a King, that hath Power in his Hands to cut you off Inſtantly!
