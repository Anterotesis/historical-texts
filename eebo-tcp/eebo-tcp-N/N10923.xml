            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>THE poiſons which have lately been too laviſhly ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered among you, call aloud for an antidote; and by their operations they appear to be of ſo deadly a kind, as to require the immediate counteration of ſome powerfully efficient recipe; till ſuch an one is produced, a leſs forcible preſcription may, by ſtopping their progreſs, be found ſalutary.</p>
                  <p>Of late two pamphlets have appeared, the authors of which, the contending parties of this country, ſeem to conſider as the invulnerable champions of their different principles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts; and each has therefore naturally attracted the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its friends and oppoſers; but the zeal of the whigs, in diſperſing abroad their boaſted and favourite production, has far out-ſtripped that of the tories, who, perhaps, not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an appeal to the head, as ſo adapted to the purpoſes of party, as one to the heart, have not inſerted the Friendly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs in a News-Paper;—have not conſiderably reduced its price; or ſent it abroad gratis, as a ſtimilus to their friends<note n="Daggar" place="bottom">It is obſervable in theſe impreſſions, deſigned for general uſe, it has been thought adviſeable to omit one of the beſt turned, and beſt deſerved compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to an officer of high rank, that, in the compaſs of a ſmall reading, I as yet remember to have ſeen:—Such inſidious arts, and ſuch want of candot are inexcuſeable, and would diſgrace the nobleſt of cauſes.</note>:</p>

Theſe being the honours which party has conferred on the ſtrictures on that performance, it may not be unamuſing or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to examine on what foundation this boaſted bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of faction is erected. This writer, like a true diſciple of the noble author of the Characteriſtics, tries every thing by the touchſtone of ridicule; but does he know that it can place all ſubjects, even the ſacred precepts and myſteries of our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religion, in the ſame point of view; and like the jaundiced eye, ſeeing through a tainted medium, reduce all objects, however varied in colours, to its own loathſome hue? He commences with a notable diſcovery from unerring ſigns, of his antagoniſt's profeſſion; but I much query if any one, from his ſubſequent obſervations, would be induced to conſider him a ſoldier</p>
                  <p>The friends of Britiſh government in America are, I truſt, not ſo contemptible as the picture of this ſtricturer would lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicrouſly diſplay them; many have already declared their attachment to its cauſe, and fifty times their numbers, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent overwhelmed by popular fury, would in the day of trial avow it: I wiſh not to ſee <hi>royal ſtandards erected, or ſwords flaming in the front, and in the rear,</hi> but alas! the melancholy face of affairs on this continent too ſtrongly indicates it; and then, I am convinced, the regular troops would not, on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, be found ſo contemptible as he endeavours to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them; or that colony forces could be ſo eaſily raiſed and diſciplined, as he aſſerts: A <hi>ſimplification</hi> of manoeuvres that can be learnt in <hi>three months,</hi> will not bring you, Americans, to that ſteadineſs, that you ſhall, with regularity and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, like the Engliſh troops at Fontenoy, evolute in the face of a victorious and ſuperior army: For my part, I will go further than even this rapid inſtructor, and engage to teach ſchool-boys, with wooden guns on their ſhoulders, <hi>to form and reduce from a line of fire to a line of impreſſion,</hi> in half an hour; but to train men for war, requires labour, experience, and time; and to reduce them to perfect ſubmiſſion to every ſuperior, is with difficulty effected in legal eſtabliſhments, never in popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and tumultuous aſſociations; deprived of that coerſive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which, in the former produces obedience, their leaders in vain ſeek by attentions and courteſies that compliance with their commands, which the others derive from eſtabliſhed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputed authority.</p>
                  <p>A yeomanrry, like the American, the moſt happy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable of any in the world, are but ill prepared to ſupport

the fatigues, dangers and wants of long campaigns; they would ſoon miſs thoſe ſolaces which domeſtic tranquility afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and would revert to their priſtine avocations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; their acquaintance with the uſe of implements of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry would ſtand them in but little ſtead, for to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhould they employ them? It has long been acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a principle in war, that irregulars are not calculated for defence, but attack; their vigour and intrepidity may bear down all obſtacles to the latter, but too ſurely they will fail in that patience and perſeverance which is indiſpenſably requiſite for the former, When the New-England provincials, under General Pepperrell, in the year forty five, attacked Louis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, they laughed at the regular methods of approach pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them, and by a concurrence of fortunate circumſtances, united to valour, carried that important fortreſs; this is a fact which many of them can vouch, and moſt, if not all the reſt of them have heard repeatedly from their fathers, when recounting the atchievements of their youthful days; and they muſt then have alſo told them, that the petulance of their brave countrymen was more than once on the point of giving up that glorious enterprize.—Conſider therefore, I adjure you, by thoſe ties and relations which endear life, and ſtrow flowers along the rugged path of its pilgrimage; conſider, before you engage in an attempt of ſo ſerious, ſo hazardous a nature, as the oppoſing a royal and long conſtituted army, what may reaſonably be expected from forces ſo liable to defections as the unreſtrained and haſtily levied troops of theſe colonies muſt ever be: Your numbers are alſo held forth to you as powerful and unconquerable, and I do not deny that on ſo extended a continent as this, many armies of forty-thouſand each might, in the various operations of a war, to advantage be employed; but ſuppoſing it poſſible for this even to be the caſe, what muſt be its unavoidable conſequences? All your peaſantry being engaged in martial expeditions, the land would want its culture, and a dearth in a very few months muſt infallibly enſue, which would deprive your ſoldiers of even neceſſary ſuſtenance<note n="*" place="bottom">To ſtrengthen this obſervation, Germany laſt war afforded melancholy proofs to what diſtreſs a country is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, when occupied by contending armies.</note>, for they muſt forego at the commencement every idea and wiſh for their accuſtomed luxuries: Are you yet to be told that there are diſeaſes which are endemic to a camp, and that when famine with "baneful ſmile" ſtalks through
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013824_0006_0F91B59059BECA30"/>
its avenues, ſhe will add freſh poignancy and malignity to its inſeparable diſorders? From moſt of theſe evils your opponents will be free; from long practice their conſtitutions are habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated to the fatigues of the moſt rigid diſcipline, they may feel diſtemper, but they are better enabled to repel it than you, unuſed to hardſhips, can poſſibly be; nor will they be haunted by the ſmalleſt dread of want; your ports blocked up by the navy of England, though denying you relief, will afford them plentiful ſupplies, and in caſe of defeat, a moſt ſure retreat, till augmented by numerous and powerful reinforcements; for remember, that Great-Britain, during laſt war, did at one time carry conqueſt through every quarter of the globe, and that you aſſiſted her only in this.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto, Americans, I have only pointed out to you the inſtability of your own force; it behoves you as you have examined how far you can rely with ſafety on it, to change the ſcene, and ſee how it ſtands oppoſed to that of your anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts, and here the proſpect is different; taught to conquer by diſcipline, they firmly confide in what they know is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable; and not diſtracted by jarring principles and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: with them every part of the machine acts in harmony and concord, and every ſpring, and every wheel conſpires to produce its neceſſary efficient force.</p>
                  <p>It matters not of what perſons armies are compoſed, ſince the profeſſion has a natural tendency to create in them new principles and ideas of fortitude, ſubmiſſion and reliance on the wiſdom and experience of their ſuperiors: Your informant has told you the Britiſh troops are made up of "<hi>the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched weavers' prentices, the ſcum of the Iriſh Roman Catholics, who deſert upon every occaſion, and a few, very few, Scotch, who are not ſtrong enough to carry packs.</hi>" I have cultivated an acquaintance with the moſt ſenſible of the military gentlemen, and have found them men of candour and worth; from their information, and my own obſervation, I will now in theſe particulars lay before you a true and impartial ſtate of the Britiſh army<note n="*" place="bottom">The writer of the Strictures in ſtating the number of the Britiſh infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, has, either through negligence or purpoſely committed an error, by not including the marines: Their eſtabliſhment is, I think, upwards of four thouſand. This corps, though exiſting under a different act of Parliament, may properly be denominated an addition to the marching regiments, as in the expeditions of laſt war it frequently co-operated with them, and by its vigour and intrepidity contributed to their memorable ſucceſſes. This is only produced as an inſtance of what occurs in every page, unfair reaſoning from miſrepreſented facts; for a trifling peace eſtabliſhment is not to be computed the force of Britain,—it is founded on a plan, recommended by Marſhal Saxe for the French army, of having many battalions with more officers to each that requiſite for the number of private men, that in caſe of neceſſity, new levies might be ingrafted on them, and by that means a conſiderable body of troops, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

And by what arts have ſo many appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, without detection, deſerted their maſters, and broke their indentures? But all recruiting officers, and I ſuſpect the Stricturer can affirm it, know that it is the country and not the towns which completes their battalions, that they beat up only on market-days when peaſants, not mechanics reſort to them; and you can all of you judge from the appearance of thoſe recruits which have been brought hither, if they were the produce of villages or cities. <hi>The ſcum of the Iriſh Roman Catholics,</hi> he tells you, forms the proportion from that country, but unfortunately two ſtrong circumſtances militate againſt this aſſertion, for the legiſlature of Ireland, from fatal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, jealous of the Roman Catholics, has, under the ſevereſt penalties, prohibited them the uſe of arms, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified them from forming a part of the defence of their country: Yet I am told that ſome few, notwithſtanding, are ſmuggled into the ſervice, but this can only be in thoſe regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments lately on that eſtabliſhment, and in them very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; the other circumſtance is a law, which, from the fear of depopulation, proſcribes the enliſting any man for other than the eſtabliſhment within that kingdom: His annexment that they <hi>deſert upon every occaſion,</hi> is not better grounded upon fact;—here the mention of deſertion, makes me wiſh to advert to this great ſource of triumph in your popular leaders; they proclaim to the world how numerous have the inſtances of it been from the army quartered in Boſton, and yet, I am well informed, it is no more than has always been from a ſimilar body of troops, even to the natural enemies of their country; and I heartily wiſh they could as eaſily reconcile to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences the ſeducing men from their allegiance and duty to the worſt of crimes, perjury, and the greateſt of earthly evils, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared, and almoſt certain, death if retaken: Our author makes up the ſmall reſidue with <hi>a few, very few, Scoth, who are not ſtrong enough to carry packs:</hi> I am told, had he been at

the trouble to examine muſter rolls he would have found them not ſo inconſiderable; that this is propable we may reaſonably conclude from the number of emigrants who have quitted that country to come here, and what their condition is, thoſe who have ſeen them, will judge: In fine, what is actually the preſent ſtate of the whole Britiſh army, one who has not ſeen all of it cannot with preciſion determine, but if I might judge from thoſe regiments, which, in their tour of duty, have been ſent here, I ſhould pronounce it more than verſed <hi>in the tricks of the parade.</hi> I ſhould pronounce it highly trained and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for ſervice; but it is objected that <hi>few of them have ſeen action,</hi> and therefore they are much to be <hi>doubted:</hi> Who can have told this author ſo? For moſt ſurely he has been ſtrangely miſinformed; of the little army ſtationed in this capital there are two of the Quebec, and one of the Minden battalions, in which many of the officers and ſoldiers who conquered on thoſe glorious days, ſtill remain, and in moſt of the other regiments, which compoſe it, many of the veterans of laſt war to be found: and for my own part, when I view this ſmall, but finely appointed army, and conſider that it is under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of two Generals of approved knowledge and experience in war, I feel much confidence in the difficulties it would be able to ſurmount, and the victories over irregulars, which, in human probability, it would aſſuredly obtain.</p>
                  <p>In order to induce in you a belief of his military principles and knowledge, he produces an inſtance in proof from the conſtitution of the King of Pruſſia's army, but even was it, which I have the greateſt reaſon to doubt, literally as he has ſtated, it cannot then, I apprehend, be brought as a precedent in this caſe, for there is no ſimilarity between the connected and abſolute power of that monarch over all his dominions, and the diſtinct and widely ſeparated colonies of North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica: Between ſupporting the authority of the lawful Sovereign, and rebelling againſt him.</p>
                  <p>He tells you alſo, that <hi>no inferences can be drawn</hi> from the conqueſt of Quebec, by the army under General Wolfe, but believe me, he is much miſtaken, for laſt war will afford abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant proofs to the contrary: Was it the <hi>conquering attributes</hi>

In fact, it is not more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded than a papal bull, when it oppoſes the inclinations of a Monarch.

                        <hi>This is perhaps the moſt prepoſterous idea that ever was hatched in a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered brain;</hi> but I beg pardon, perhaps this author is intruſted with the purport of the Obſervator on the Boſton Port Bill's embaſſy, and can tell that he is ſent to divulge to the Landgrave of Heſſe, this amazing ſecret.</note> but how the Elector of Hanover, backed by the power of Britain, to enforce his commands, ſhould want credit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a few thouſands of his own ſubjects, is what I cannot comprehend:<note n="†" place="bottom">Britain has another reſource, which has perhaps not occurred to the Friendly Addreſſer, or his critic: She is in the ſtricteſt alliance with Ruſſia, whoſe troops, come from ravaging the extenſive provinces of Turky, would over-run this continent with the ſame facility they paſſed the Danube, ſtill carrying conqueſt in their front, and ſwept before them unnumbered for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes.</note> It is as myſterious to me, that Great-Britain, when divorced from her colonies, ſhould be deſtitute of every requiſite for ſupporting her navy, though ſhe poſſeſſes the northern and ſouthern extremities of this continent, and her trade to Ruſſia and the Baltic, is open and free, and ſhe can from thence ſupply herſelf with all the materials for ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building, on at leaſt as reaſonable conditions as ſhe does now from America.</p>

                  <p>A PAMPHLET, entitled <hi>A Friendly Addreſs to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Americans,</hi> advertiſed and ſold by Mr. James Rivington, of New-York, is of ſo extraordinary a nature that it is difficult for any Man, who is intereſted in the welfare of the Community (whatever contempt he may have for the performance) to remain ſilent. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the author is a Layman or Eccleſiaſtick, but he bears ſtrongly the characters of the latter. He has the want of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and truth, the apparent ſpirit of perſecution, the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givingneſs, the deadly hatred to Diſſenters, and the zeal for arbitrary power, which has diſtinguiſhed Churchmen in all ages, and more particularly the <hi>high</hi> part of the Church of England; I cannot help therefore conſidering him as one of this order.</p>
                  <p>The deſign of his Pamphlet is manifeſtly to diſſolve the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of union, and check the noble ardor prevailing through the continent; but his zeal ſo far out-runs his abilities, that there is the greateſt reaſon to think that his Reverence has laboured to little effect. His diſcretion ſeems to be ſtill leſs than his genius. A man of common judgment would not ſo wantonly have attacked the general reigning principles and opinions of a People, whom he intends to ſeduce or intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date out of their rights and privileges: For inſtance, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there are at leaſt ninety-nine Americans in an hundred, who think that Charles the Firſt was an execrable tyrant, that he met with no harder fate than he deſerved, and that his two Sons ought in juſtice to have made the ſame exit. To deſcant therefore on the criminality of the reſiſtance made to that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; to affect on every occaſion giving the title of rebellion

to the civil war which brought him to juſtice, is a degree of weakneſs which no man who is not blinded by the daemon of jacobitiſm could poſſibly be guilty of. But to preach up in this enlightend age (as he does in almoſt expreſs terms) paſſive obedience, is a mark of lunacy, or at leaſt it proves that the moment a head begins to itch for a mitre, it loſes the faculty of reaſoning, for if the principle of paſſive obedience is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the gracious Prince, for whom his Reverence profeſſes ſo great a devotion is a downright uſurper, and the Parliament of which he ſpeaks ſo reſpectfully, Lords and Commons, are rebels and traitors.</p>
                  <p>The doctrines he aims to inculcate are as follow—<hi>That the Parliament has a right to tax you without your conſent; that the duty upon tea is no tax; that this duty is your only grievance; that the cauſe of Boſton is their own concern; that it is not your cauſe; that the puniſhment of Boſton is a juſt puniſhment; that it is lenient; that it is not equal to their crimes; that the Boſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are rebels, traitors, and pampered fanatics; that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs are little better; that no miſconduct of adminiſtration can juſtify or excuſe open diſreſpect; that ſubmiſſion is to be paid to the higher powers, whatever character they be; that an Apoſtle enjoined ſubmiſſion to the tyrant Nero; that of all people under heaven, the King's American ſubjects have the leaſt cauſe for complaint; that the preſent confuſion of the Colonies has been occaſioned by falſe alarms; that none of your legal rights have been invaded; no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury has been done you, and conſequently that you can never be juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in reſenting that of which you have no reaſon to complain; that you are no judges of the rights of Parliament; that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ought to act according to their own judgment, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to yours, even in things which concern you principally or ſoley: that they aſſert they have the right in queſtion; that you have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proved they have not; that you have always believed or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed they have it until the preſent occaſion; that the Quebec Bill is a juſt and conſtitutional Bill; that the Canadians are likely to prove the beſt and moſt loyal ſubjects in his Majeſty's American do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; that there is too much reaſon to believe that the minds of the Americans are unprincipled, and their hearts diſpoſed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; that ſince the reduction of Canada they have been bloated with a vain opinion of their own power and importance; that the Iſland of Great-Britain is able to govern</hi> (that is to dragoon) <hi>ten Americas; that the moment it is known that America is no longer under the protection of Great-Britain, all the maritime pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Europe would join to ravage your ſea ports, plander and ſeize
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013824_0015_0F91B599816C5970"/>
your ſhips merely for the pleaſure of ravaging;</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">This is perhaps the moſt prepoſterous idea that ever was hatched in a diſtempered brain. America (more particularly ſince the diſtractions in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land have taken place) has been the great granary or <hi>cella penaria</hi> of Europe. Is it poſſible to conceive that the different maritime powers ſhould unite to deprive themſelves of the chief means of ſubſiſtance, merely for the fun's ſake? Is it not more natural to ſuppoſe that they would out-bid each other, for your friendſhip and commerce on which ſo much depends? When the Low Countries withdrew themſelves from the dominion of Spain, did Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France, and the other Powers immediately ſet about ravaging their ſea ports and ſeizing their ſhips? Did they not, on the contrary, exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves directly and indirectly to aſſiſt them? The caſe is ſimilar, the event would be ſimilar; and that Great-Britain would not be powerful enough at ſea, when ſeparated from her Colonies; to prevent this aſſiſtance, I ſhall refer my readers to Maſſie's Eſtimates, the authority of which has never been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and which demonſtrate, that more than half the naval power of Great-Britain ſtands on her American foundation.</note> 
                     <hi>that all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime powers of the world would not diſpoſſeſs Great-Britain of the empire of the ſea even when America is ſeparated from her.</hi>—Now I challenge the world to produce ſo many wicked ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſtupid principles, audaciouſly falſe aſſertions, and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous abſurdities crowded together into ſo ſmall a compaſs. All his poſitions are indeed ſo ſelf evidently abſurd and falſe, that it would be an inſult to American underſtandings, ſeriouſly to attempt refuting them. I ſhall only beg leave to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the curious argument he uſes to prove the duty on tea to be no tax, it is that, <hi>unleſs we conſent to the tax we are not to pay the duty. We may refuſe purchaſing it if we pleaſe.</hi> The ſame logic would demonſtrate that a duty on beer, candles, or ſoap, would be no tax, as we are not abſolutely obliged to drink beer; we may drink water, we may go to bed before it is dark, and we are not forced to waſh our ſhirts. His aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Great-Britain, when divorced from her Colonies, will ſtill hold the empire of the ſeas in ſpite of all the powers of the world, is ſtill more ingenious. It amounts to this, that <hi>without the poſſible means of procuring timber, iron, plank, maſts, pitch, tar, or hemp, to furniſh out a ſingle frigate, they may build more ſhips then all the world put together;</hi> that <hi>when her nurſery for ſeamen is deſtroyed, and all the commerce on which the exiſtence of ſeamen depends, is annihilated, they will then be able to man more fleets than the whole univerſe put together.</hi> But I am aſhamed of treſpaſſing on the public patience, in making ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on ſuch ridiculous articles, I ſhall therefore paſs to ſome queſtions which have not been ſo much agitated, and on which, if I miſtake not, his reverence lays the greateſt ſtreſs; for as
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013824_0016_0F91B59A40B970A8"/>
he modeſtly declares, that he has no opinion of your courage, it was natural for him to conſider intimidation and terror, as the moſt powerful figures of rhetoric. <hi>Regular armies from Great-Britain, Heſſians, Hanoverians, royal, ſtandards erected, ſkilful Generals, legions of Canadians, and unnumbered tribes of ſavages ſwords flaming in the front and rear, peſtilence, deſolation and famine,</hi> are all marſhalled in a moſt dreadful order by this church militant author. But let us ſomewhat minutely exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the picture, and ſee whether, ſtript of its falſe colouring, it has any thing really terrifying. His reverence begins with aſſuring us, that there is no room to doubt, but that ſuch an army as was employed in the reduction of Canada (that is an army of ſeven thouſand men) would be more than ſufficient for the conqueſt of all the diſaffected American Colonies, (which are in fact all the Colonies.) Should <hi>ſuch</hi> a reſolution become neceſſary in order to reduce them to obedience. For my own part I think there is very great reaſon to doubt, that ſeven thouſand, even of the beſt troops, are able to conquer two hundred thouſand of the moſt diſorderly peaſantry upon earth, if they are animated in defence of every thing they hold moſt dear and ſacred; and there is ſtill greater reaſon to doubt, that ſeven thouſand very indifferent troops, compoſed of the refuſe of an exhauſted nation, few of whom have ſeen action of any kind, ſhould be able to conquer two hundred thouſand active, vigorous yeomanry, fired with the noble ardor, we ſee prevalent through the continent all armed, all expert in the uſe of arms almoſt from their cradles. The ſucceſs of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec it is true, does infinite honour to the Engliſh arms, the army was, I believe, only ſeven thouſand, the enemy were perhaps more than double, but ſixteen thouſand men are not two hundred thouſand. The fate of Canada, depended upon one deciſive action, but it is impoſſible to calculate how many victories muſt be gained before theſe Colonies could be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, whereas a ſingle victory gained by the Colonies muſt decide the conteſt in their favour. In the affair of Quebec there is another circumſtance to be conſidered, it was Wolfe, who commanded: a man of the moſt wonderful talents, formed to level all difficulties; to render the moſt deſpicable ſoldiery, almoſt inſtaneouſly, an army of Heroes. In ſhort, the genius of the man was ſo extraordinary, the event was ſo extraordinary, that no inferences can be drawn from it; but this without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption may be aſſerted, that no General now exiſting in the Britiſh ſervice, would with double or treble his number have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the ſame circumſtances. One thing more I muſt add
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013824_0017_0F91B59ADB04ABF8"/>
in honour of that illuſtrious perſonage, that the ſame greatneſs of ſoul which qualified him to conquer the natural hereditary ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his country, would have made him reject with horror the Hangman's office, which others who are not endowed with conquering attributes, will with readineſs accept.</p>
                  <p>It is notorious that Mr. Wolfe was not only the firſt of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, but that he was a moſt liberal virtuous citizen, that he was paſſionately attached to the liberties of his country, and of mankind; and that he was particularly an enemy to large ſtanding armies in time of peace. It is on the other hand remarkable, that all the advocates for ſtanding armies; all thoſe who are the fondeſt of the faddling and parade of war are the moſt active in avoiding real ſervice.</p>
                  <p>This tremendous ſoothſayer, on the ſuppoſition that ſo great a miracle ſhould happen in our favour, as that the trifling bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of five hundred thouſand men though firmly united (for every man in America, firmly united, would not amount to leſs,) ſhould be able to withſtand his ſeven thouſand goes on to rattle in our ears, armies of Heſſians and Hanoverians. I wiſh to Heaven he had for once deviated into probability and truth. I wiſh ten thouſand of them could poſſibly be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to-morrow. The purpoſe they would anſwer, is a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe devoutly to be wiſhed for; they would be an addition to this continent of juſt ſo many uſeful and excellent citizens, for I will venture to affirm, (affirming is infectious) that in leſs than four months not two of theſe ten thouſand would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with their Colours. But does not this Reverend Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman know that in the year 1764 a convention was formed by moſt of the Princes of the empire, at the head of which convention were the Emperor himſelf and the King of Pruſſia, to prevent the alarming emigrations which threatned depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation to Germany? Does he not know that no troops can march out of the empire without the conſent of the empire? Does he not know that the Elector of Hanover and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror are upon exceedingly ill terms? Does he not know that the Elector of Hanover and the King of Pruſſia are ſtill upon worſe? Is he ſure that the Landgrave of Heſs would ſell his troops (for as not one man would return back to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he muſt conſider them as for ever ſold?) Is he ſure that as the finances of Great-Britain ſtand, the vaſt ſum neceſſary for this purchaſe would be conveniently found? Is he ſure that the State of Hanover would conſent to ſuch a draining of their country? I know not how it is; but his moſt excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty GEORGE the Third, who in England is juſtly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013824_0018_0F91B59B9FAA23E0"/>
the moſt gracious of Sovereigns, the wifeſt, greateſt, and beſt of Kings, is not very popular in the Electorate of Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over. Theſe people ſeem to think it hard that Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Twenty Thouſand Pounds ſhould annually be drawn from them, for the purpoſes (as they conceive it) of corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Members of St. Stephen's Chapel, in order to ſupport the power and authority of a ſett of men, who from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning have been enemies to the ſucceſſion of the Hanover line, and who ſhewed a particular animoſity to their laſt and favourite Prince, George the Second; but theſe difficulties (great and unfurmountable as to a common mortal they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear) our divine Exorciſt has in an inſtant conjured down, and by a ſingle motion of his enchanted wand, has tranſported whole armies, in ſpite of their reſpective Princes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of their reſpective States, from the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior parts of Germany acroſs the Atlantic into the plains of New-England and Pennſylvania. But he does not confine himſelf to the introduction of his Germans. He proceeds next to erect the Royal Standard, to which he tells us that all who have the courage to declare themſelves now friends to government, will undoubtedly reſort, and theſe he ſays in a good cauſe, will be of themſelves formidable to their oppoſers: Dreadfully formidable they muſt be indeed: There would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to it, let me ſee, (for the reſpectable town of Rye have declared themſelves a kind of neutrals <hi>rather than friends to government</hi>) there would reſort to it, Mr. Juſtice Sewell, the honourable Mr. Paxton, Brigadier Ruggles, and about eight or ten more mandamus Councilmen, with perhaps twice their number of Expectants, and not leſs than twenty of the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted Hutchinſonian Addreſſers. Theſe the four Provinces of New-England alone would ſend forth. New-York would furniſh ſix, ſeven or probably eight volunteers from a certain knot, who are in poſſeſſion or expectation of contracts, and the fourth part of a dozen of high flying Church of England Romaniſed Prieſts. I repreſent to myſelf the formidable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance they will make, when arranged under the Royal or miniſterial Standard; but what will add to the terror of the appearance, will be their Reverend Pontifex himſelf, whom I conceive marching in the front, an inquiſitorial frown upon his brow, his bands and canonicals floating to the air, bearing a croſs in his hands, with the tremendous motto, <hi>In hoc ſigno vinces,</hi> flaming upon it in capital letters of blood, leading them on, and exciting them to victory. It is impoſſible that men, who are not under an infatuation by the judgment of heaven ſhould flatter themſelves, that forty thouſand Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can

Yeomanry (for we are aſſured by the ſame great authority that more than forty thouſand cannot be brought to action) ſhould ſtand the ſhock of this dreadful Phalanx.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhould beg pardon for attempting to be ludicrous upon a ſubject which demands our utmoſt indignation. I ſhall now therefore on the preſumption that the People of England ſhould be ſo loſt to ſenſe, virtue and ſpirit as to ſuffer their profligate Miſrulers to perſevere in their preſent meaſures, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſtate to you what is their force, and what is yours. I ſhall endeavour to remove the falſe terrors which this writer would hold out, in order to intimidate you from the defence of your liberties and thoſe of your poſterity, that he and his ſimilars may wallow in ſinecures and benefices heaped up from the fruits of your labour and induſtry.</p>
                  <p>Great-Britain has, I believe, of infantry at home (compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending Ireland, and excluſive of the guards) fifteen thouſand men. They find the greateſt difficulty in keeping the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments up to any thing near their eſtabliſhment—what they are able to procure are of the worſt ſort. They are compoſed of the moſt debauched Weavers prentices, the ſcum of the Iriſh Roman Catholics, who deſert upon every occaſion, and a few, very few, Scotch, who are not ſtrong enough to carry packs—This is no exaggeration; thoſe who have been lately at Boſton, repreſent the ſoldiers there (one or two regiments excepted) as very defective in ſize, and apparently in ſtrength: But we ſhall be told they are ſtill regulars, and regulars have an irreſiſtable advantage.—There is, perhaps, more impoſition in the term <hi>regular troops,</hi> than in any of the jargon which iſſues from the mouth of a Quack Doctor. I do not mean to inſinuate, that a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly mob are equal to a trained diſciplined body of men; but I mean, that all the eſſentials neceſſary to form infantry for real ſervice may be acquired in a few months.<note n="*" place="bottom">There cannot be a ſtronger illuſtration of the truth here advanced, than the Pruſſian army. They are compoſed of about one third of the King's own ſubjects, two-thirds foreigners. The third, conſiſting of his own ſubjects, are, when the exerciſing ſeaſon is over, (which laſts ſix or ſeven weeks) ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to return to their families, and attend to the buſineſs of huſbandry—half of the other two thirds, conſiſting of foreigners, are not only permitted, but encouraged to work at their trades in the garriſon towns, and never touch a muſket for the reſt of the year, ſo that, in fact, only one third are, in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern language, to be called regular Soldiers; theſe generally make their eſcape the firſt opportunity: It may be ſaid therefore, that the King of Pruſſia has gained all his victories with a ſort of Militia.</note> I mean, that it is very poſſible for men to be cloathed in red, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in all the tricks of the parade, to call themſelves regular

troops, and yet, by attaching themſelves principally or ſolely to the tinſel and ſhew of war, be totally unfit for real ſervice. This, I am told, is a good deal the caſe of the preſent Britiſh Infantry; If they can acquit themſelves tolerably in the puer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile reviews, exhibited for the amuſement of royal Maſters and Miſſes in Hyde Park or Wimbledon Common, it is ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the late war, ſome of the moſt eſteemed regular regiments were ſent over to this country; they were well dreſſed; they were well powdered; they were perfect maſters of their manual exerciſe; they fired together in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons; but fatal experience taught us they knew not how to ſight. While your Militia were frequently crowned with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, theſe regulars were defeated or baffled for three years ſucceſſively in every part of the continent. At length, indeed, (after repeated loſſes and diſgraces) they became excellent troops, but not until they had abſolutely forgotten every thing which, we are aſſured, muſt render regulars quite irreſiſtable. The corps ſent from this country under General Monkton was, I believe, for its number, one of the beſt armies that ever was led to conqueſt, and yet, if I have been rightly informed, there was not a ſingle regiment of them that could go through the manual exerciſe, or at beſt, they performed it moſt wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly. It is likewiſe ſaid, that when, after their glorious and rapid conqueſt of Martinico, they were joined by the ſpruce regiments from Europe; ſuch was their uncough appearance, that they were ſcarce honoured with the title of Soldiers by thoſe Gentlemen. Upon the whole, it is moſt certain, that men may be ſmartly dreſſed, keep their arms bright, be called regulars, be expert in all the anticks of a review, and yet be very unfit for real action. It is equally certain, that a Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, by confining themſelves to eſſentials, by a ſimplification of the neceſſary manoeuvres, may become, in a very few months, a moſt formidable infantry. The Yeomanry of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica have, beſides infinite advantages, over the peaſantry of other countries; they are accuſtomed from their infancy to fire arms; they are expert in the uſe of them: Whereas the lower and middle people of England are, by the tyranny of certain laws almoſt as ignorant in the uſe of a muſket, as they are of the ancient Catepulta. The Americans are likewiſe, to a man, ſkilful in the management of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments neceſſary for all military works; ſuch as ſpades, pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axes, hatchets, &amp;c. Taking, therefore, all circumſtances into conſideration, there will be no raſhneſs in affirming, that this continent may have formed for action, in three or four months,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013824_0021_0F91B59EA948EC88"/>
an hundred thouſand infantry: For as to the aſſertion of one friendly adviſer, <hi>that no more than forty thouſand could act to advantage,</hi> I confeſs I do not underſtand it, nor does he, I believe, underſtand himſelf. If he means that ſixty thouſad men cannot be ranged in a field capable of containing only forty thouſand, we ſhall all agree with him; but how in the operations of a war upon a vaſt continent double this number ſhould be a diſadvantage, I can have no conception.</p>
                  <p>Let one ſimple general plan be adopted for the formation and ſubdiviſion of your battalions; let them be inſtructed only in ſo much of the manual exerciſe as to prevent confuſion, and accident in loading and firing; let them be taught to form, to retreat, to advance, to change their front, to rally by their colours; let them be taught to reduce themſelves from a line of fire to a line of impreſſion, that is, from two deep, to four, ſix, or eight. This is all ſo eaſy and ſimple, that it may be acquired in three months. Let ſome plan of this ſort be adopted. I ſay, and there is no doubt but that, in the time I have preſcribed, you may have an army on foot of ſeventy, eighty, or an hundred thouſand men, equal to all the ſervices of war.</p>
                  <p>Should this be admitted, it will be ſtill objected, that you have no able officers to conduct you. I do not know that you have; but is it certain that thoſe ſent to dragoon you have better? I have taken ſome pains to inform myſelf what methods theſe Gentlemen, ſaid to be bred to arms, take to qualify themſelves in a ſuperior degree for the profeſſion. What is their rotine of inſtruction? Do they read much? I am aſſured that they do not; from books alone the theory of war can be acquired, and the Engliſh ſervice in times of peace affords them no practical leſſons; for mounting guard once or twice a week, or the preparation for the review of a ſingle regiment can never be eſteemed as ſuch.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>It is much to be lamented, that the Gentlemen of the Army do not apply more of the many leiſure hours they have upon their hands to reading. The majority of them are of a generous diſpoſition, which, did they cultivate, by converſing with the great hiſtorians and orators of antiquity, and the more liberal political writers of our own country, a ſtanding army would be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs an object of jealouſy to all virtuous citizens. We might perhaps ſee them inſtead of being advocates and partizans of the preſent Miniſtry, a check upon their wickedneſs. I am inclined to think that few or none of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers have condeſcended to inform themſelves of the merit of the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. Let me conjure them for once to read coolly and candidly the whole proceſs, afterwards to lay their hands upon their hearts, and anſwer, whether the People of America in general, and of Boſton in particular, are "more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt or finning?"</p>
                        <p>Now I am upon the ſubject of the Officers of the Army, I take the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of mentinning, with the reſpect due to him, one Gentleman of high rank amongſt them—the tenure of his conduct while in command, was ſo liberal, and his letters quoted in the Houſe of Commons, were ſo fair, candid and friendly to this Continent, that he is entitled to the thanks of America. He is indeed of a country that owes not only its proſperity, but its exiſtence to the ſame principles which actuate America.</p>

Another circumſtance, Americans, may be added for your comfort. It has been allowed by ſome of the moſt candid of the regulars themſelves, that during the laſt war upon this continent, your countrymen the provincial Field-Officers were in general, more underſtanding and capable than their own of the ſame rank. But the hiſtory of the civil war in the year 1641, furniſhes us with the ſtrongeſt inſtances that excellent officers may be ſoon formed from country gentlemen, citizens, lawyers, and Farmers. The Parliament's army (as our prieſtly writer would call them, the rebellious Republicans) were chiefly compoſed of this claſs of men. In the beginning of this war, they were treated with the ſame affected contempt, and almoſt in the ſame opprobious terms as you, the people of America, are by your friendly and decent adviſer.</p>
                  <p>Whoever would infer from the tenure of theſe papers, that the writer is deſirous of precipitating, or could look with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference upon the calamities of a civil war, does him great injuſtice. He conſiders them with all the horror natural to a feeling man and honeſt citizen. He execrates the memory of thoſe men to whom they may juſtly be attributed, but he is perſuaded that they never originated, (at leaſt in ſtates of any conſiderable extent) in the turbulent diſpoſitions of the people, nor in the arts of demagogues, but in the oppreſſion of their rulers, in the wantonneſs, folly, pride, or avarice of Kings, Miniſters, or Governors. The Griſlers of Switzerland the Granvels of Holland, the Lauds and Straffords of England, were the undoubted authors of the tragedies acted in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective countries: And if this continent ſhould be ſtained with the blood of a ſingle citizen, it can never be charged to the unreaſonable pretenſions of the people, but to the Bernards, Hutchinſons, and ſome other traitors of a ſimilar ſtamp.</p>
                  <p>He is convinced, that being prepared for a civil war is the ſureſt means of preventing it; that to keep the ſwords of your enemies in their ſcabbards, you muſt whet your own. He is convinced, that remonſtrances, petitions, prayers and ſupplca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013824_0023_0F91B5A098C92F30"/>
will make no impreſſion on our callous Court and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned Parliament; England, Ireland, America, even Guern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, Jerſey and Minorca are witneſſes of their ineſſicacy. He in convinced, that fear alone can operate; there are ſymptoms that it already begins to operate; the monſter, Tyranny, already begins to pant, preſs her now with ardor, and ſhe is down; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the Miniſtry have expreſſed in their letters an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make ſome conceſſions; to meet you half way. Which, I ſuppoſe, may be conſtrued thus, that as they find they have it not in their power to eſtabliſh, by force, the deſpotiſm which they aimed at, they ſhall be very well ſatisfied, if you will juſt cede ſo much of your rights and privileges, as will enable them, by extending their pecuniary influence and ſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping your virtue, to take away the reſt at their leiſure.</p>
                  <p>There now remains, people of America, one conſideration which (however it may be taken) I think it my duty to offer. Hiſtory tells us that the free ſtates of Greece, Thebes, Sparta, Athens, and Syracuſe were all in their turns ſubjugated by the force or art of tyrants. They almoſt all in their turns re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their liberty and deſtroyed their tyrants. The first act upon the recovery of their liberty was to demoliſh thoſe badges of ſlavery, citadels, ſtrong holds, and military tenements; the Switzers did the ſame; the people of England (loſt in corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and lethargy as they are) could never be prevailed upon to ſuffer barracks amongſt them; even the courtly Blackſtone is ſtartled at the idea. No ſeperate camps, no barracks no inland fortreſſes, ſays he, ſhould be allowed; in fact, wherever barracks are freedom cannot be ſaid to exiſt, or ſhe exiſts ſo lamely as ſcarcely to deſerve the name.</p>
                  <p>It is worth your conſideration, Americans, whether theſe badges ſhould remain or no. I ſhall now conclude, brave ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, with invoking the Almighty God from whom all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues flow, to continue you in that ſpirit of unanimity and vigour which muſt inſure your ſucceſs, and immortalize you through all ages, as the champions and patrons of the human race.</p>
