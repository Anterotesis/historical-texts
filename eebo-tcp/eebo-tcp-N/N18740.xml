            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE Captivity, Sufferings &amp; Deliverance, OF Mrs. Jemima Howe.</head>
            <p>AS Meſſrs.<note place="margin">July 27, 1755.</note> Caleb Howe, Hilkiah Grout, and Benjamin Gaffield, who had been hoeing corn in the meadow, weſt of the river, were returning home, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before ſunſent, to a place called Bridgman's Fort, they were fired upon by twelve Indians, who had ambuſhed their path. Howe was on horſeback, with two young lads, his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, behind him. A ball, which broke his thigh, brought him to the ground. His horſe ran a few rods and fell likewiſe, and both the lads were taken. The Indians in their ſavage manner, coming up to Howe, pierced his body with a ſpear, tore off his ſcalp, ſtuck a hatchet in his head, and left him in this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn condition. He was found alive the morning after, by a party of men from Fort Hinſdale; and being aſked by one of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whether he knew him, he anſwered, yes, I know you all. Theſe were his laſt words, though he did not expire until after his friends had arrived with him at Fort Hinſdale. Grout was ſo fortunate as to eſcape unhurt. But Gaffield, in attempting to wade through the river, at a certain place which was indeed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024343_0003_0FC61F7B6308AC78"/>
fordable at that time, was unfortunately drowned. Fluſhed with the ſucceſs they had met with here, the ſavages went directly to Bridgman's Fort. There was no man in it, and only three women and ſome children, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Mrs. Jemima Howe, Mrs. Submit Grout, and Mrs. Eunice Gaffield. Their huſbands, I need not mention again, and their feelings at this juncture I will not attempt to deſcribe. They had heard the enemies guns, but knew not what had happened to their friends. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely anxious for their ſafety, they ſtood longing to embrace them, until at length, concluding from the noiſe they heard without that ſome of them were come, they unbarred the gate in a hurry to receive them; when lo! to their inexpreſſible diſappointment and ſurpriſe, inſtead of their huſbands, in ruſhed a number of hideous Indians, to whom they and their tender offspring became an eaſy prey; and from whom they had nothing to expect, but either an immediate death, or a long and doleful captivity. The latter of theſe, by the favor of Providence, turned out to be the lot of theſe unhappy women and their ſtill more unhappy, becauſe more helpleſs, children. Mrs. Gaffield had but one, Mrs. Grout had three, and Mrs. Howe ſeven. The eldeſt of Mrs. Howe's was eleven years old, and the youngeſt but ſix months. The two eldeſt were daughters, which ſhe had by her firſt huſband, Mr. William Phipps, who was alſo ſlain by the Indians, of which, I doubt not
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024343_0004_0FC61F7CDD47A6B8"/>
but you have ſeen an account in Mr. Doolit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's hiſtory. It was from the mouth of this woman that I lately received the foregoing account. She alſo gave me, I doubt not, a true, though to be ſure, a very brief and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect hiſtory of her captivity, which I here inſert for your peruſal. It may perhaps af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you ſome amuſement, and can do no harm; if after it has undergone your critical inſpection, you ſhould not think it (or an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

            <p>The Indians (ſhe ſays) having plundered and put fire to the Fort, we marched as near as could judge, a mile and a half into the wools, where we encamped that night. When the morning came, and we had advanced as much farther, ſix Indians were ſent back to the place of our late abode, who collected a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> more plunder, and deſtroyed ſome other <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that had been left behind,; but they did not return until the day was ſo far ſpent, that it was judged beſt to continue where we were, through the night. Early the next morning we ſet off for Canada, and continued our march eight days ſucceſſively, until we had reached the place where the Indians had left their canoes, about fifteen miles from Crown Point. This was a long and tedious march; but the captives, by divine aſſiſtance, were enabled to endure it with leſs trouble and difficulty, than they had reaſon to expect. From ſuch ſavage maſters, in ſuch indigent
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024343_0005_0FC61F7F09320CB8"/>
circumſtances, we could not rationally hope for kinder treatment than we received. Some of us, it is true, had a harder lot than others; and, among the children, I thought my ſon Squire had the hardeſt of any. He was then only four years old, and when we ſtopped to reſt our wearly limbs, and he ſat down on his maſter's pack, the ſavage monſter would often knock him off; and ſometimes too, with the handle of his hatchet. Several ugly marks, indented in his head by the cruel Indians, at that tender age, are ſtill plainly to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>At length we arrived at Crown Point, and took up our quarters there, for the ſpace of near a week. In the mean time ſome of the Indians went to Montreal, and took ſeveral of the weary captives along with them, with a view of ſelling them to the French. They did not ſucceed, however, in finding a market for any of them. They gave my youngeſt daughter, Submit Phipps, to the Governor, de Vaudreuil, had a drunken frolick, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again to Crown Point, with the reſt of their priſoners. From hence we ſet off for St. John's, in four or five canoes, juſt as night was coming on, and were ſoon ſurrounded with darkneſs. A heavy ſtorm hung over us. The found of the rolling thunder was very terrible upon the waters, which at every flaſh of expanſive lightning, ſeemed to be all in a blaze. Yet to this we were indebted for all the light we enjoyed. No object could we diſcern any longer than the flaſhes laſted.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024343_0006_0FC61F8014DF6DF8"/>
In this poſture we ſailed in our open tottering canoes, almoſt the whole of that dreary night. The morning indeed had not yet begun to dawn, when we all went aſhore; and having collected a heap of ſand and gravel for a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, I laid myſelf down, with my tender infant by my ſide, not knowing where any of my other children were, or what a miſerable condition they might be in. The next day, however, under the wing of that ever preſent and all-powerful Providence, which had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved us through the darkneſs, and imminent dangers of the preceding night, we all arrived in ſafety at St. Johns.</p>
            <p>Our next movement was to St. Francois, the metropolis, if I may ſo call it, to which the Indians, who led us captive, belonged. Soon after our arrival at their wretched capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, a council, conſiſting of the chief Sachem, and ſome principal warriors of the St. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cois tribe, was convened; and after the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies uſual on ſuch occaſions, were over, I was conducted and delivered to an old ſquaw, whom the Indians told me, I muſt call my mother. My infant ſtill continuing to be the property of its original Indian owners. I was nevertheleſs permitted to keep it with me a while longer, for the ſake of ſaving them the trouble of looking after it, and of maintaining it with my milk. When the weather began to grow cold, ſhuddering at the proſpect of approaching winter, I acquainted my new mother that I did not think it would be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024343_0007_0FC61F8AB9826598"/>
for me to endure it, if I muſt ſpend it with her, and fare as the Indians did. Liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my repeated and earneſt ſolicitations, that I might be diſpoſed of among ſome of the French inhabitants of Canada, ſhe, at length, ſet off with me and my infant, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by ſome male Indians, upon a journey to Montreal, in hopes of finding a market for me there. But the attempt proved unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the journey tedious indeed. Our proviſions were ſo ſcanty as well as inſipid and unſavory, the weather was ſo cold, and the travelling ſo very bad, that it often ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if I muſt have periſhed on the way. The lips of my poor child were ſometimes ſo benumbed, that when I put it to my breaſt, it could not, till it grew warm, imbibe the nouriſhment requiſite for its ſupport. While we were at Montreal, we went into the houſe of a certain French gentleman, whoſe lady, being ſent for, and coming into the room where I was, to examine me, ſeeing I had an infant, exclaimed ſuddenly in this manner, <q>Damn it, I will not buy a woman that has a child to look after.</q> There was a ſwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pail ſtanding near me, in which I obſerved ſome cruſts and crumbs of bread ſwiming on the ſurface of the greaſy liquor it contained: Sorely pinched with hunger, I ſkimmed them off with my hands and eat them; and this
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024343_0008_0FC61F8C06F7D810"/>
was all the refreſhment which the houſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me. Some where in the courſe of this viſit to Montreal, my Indian mother was ſo unfortunate as to catch the ſmall pox, of which diſtemper ſhe died, ſoon after our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, which was by water, to St. Francois.</p>
            <p>And now came on the ſeaſon when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians begun to prepare for a winter's hunt. I was ordered to return my poor child to thoſe of them, who ſtill claimed it as their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This was a ſevere trial. The babe clung to my boſom with all its might; but I was obliged to pluck it thence, and deliver it, ſhrieking and ſcreaming, enough to penetrate a heart of ſtone, into the hands of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling wretches whoſe tender mercies may be termed cruel. It was ſoon carried off by a hunting party of thoſe Indians, to a place call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Meſſiſkow, at the lower end of Lake Champlain, whither, in about a month after, it was my fortune to follow them. I had preſerved my milk, in hopes of ſeeing my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved child again. And here I found it, it is true, but in a condition that afforded me no great ſatisfaction; it being greatly emaciated, and almoſt ſtarved. I took it in my arms, put its face to mine, and it inſtantly bit me with ſuch violence, that it ſeemed as if I muſt have parted with a piece of my cheek. I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to lodge with it that, and the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024343_0009_0FC61F8D551D9BF0"/>
nights; but every morning that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, the Indians, I ſuppoſe on purpoſe to torment me, ſent me away to another wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wam, which ſtood at a little diſtance, though not ſo far from the one in which my diſtreſſed infant was confined, but that I could plainly hear its inceſſant cries, and heart rending la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations. In this deplorable condition I was obliged to take my leave of it, on the morning of the third day after my arrival at the place. We moved down the Lake ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al miles the ſame day; and the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was remarkable on account of the <hi>great earthquake</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">November 18, 1755.</note> which terribly ſhook that howling wilderneſs. Among the iſlands hereabouts we ſpent the winter ſeaſon, often ſhifting our quarters, and roving about from one place to another; our family conſiſting of three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only, beſides myſelf, <abbr>viz.</abbr> my late mother's daughter, whom therefore I called my ſiſter, her ſanhop, and a pappooſe. They once left me alone two diſmal nights; and when they returned to me again, perceiving them ſmile at each other, I aſked what is the matter? They replied, that two of my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren were no more: One of which, they ſaid, died a natural death, and the other was knocked on the head. I did not utter many words, but my heart was ſorely pained within
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024343_0010_0FC61F94E354FF88"/>
me, and my mind exceedingly troubled with ſtrange and awful ideas. I often imagined, for inſtance, that I plainly ſaw the naked car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes of my deceaſed children hanging upon the limbs of the trees, as the Indians are wont to hang the raw hides of thoſe beaſts which they take in hunting. It was not long, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, before it was ſo ordered by kind Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that I ſhould be relieved in a good meaſure from thoſe horrid imaginations; for as I was walking one day upon the ice, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a ſmoke at ſome diſtance upon the land, it muſt proceed, thought I, from the fire of ſome Indian hut, and who knows but ſome one of my poor children may be there. My curioſity, thus excited, led me to the place, and there I found my ſon Caleb, a little boy between two and three years old, whom I had lately buried, in ſentiment at leaſt; or rather imagined to have been deprived of life, and perhaps alſo denied a decent grave. I found him likewiſe in tolerable health and circumſtances, under the protection of a fond Indian mother; and moreover had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of lodging with him in my arms one joyful night. Again we ſhifted our quarters, and when we had travelled eight or ten miles upon the ſnow and ice, came to a place where the Indians manufactured ſugar which they extracted from the maple trees. Here an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024343_0011_0FC61F99171EE648"/>
came to viſt us, whom I knew, and could ſpeak Engliſh. He aſked me why I did not go to ſee my ſon Squire. I replied that I had lately been informed that he was dead. He aſſured me that he was yet alive, and but two or three miles off, on the oppoſite ſide of the Lake. At my requeſt he gave me the beſt directions he could to the place of his abode. I reſolved to embrace the firſt opportunity that offered of endeavoring to ſearch it out. While I was buſy in contemplating this affair, the Indians obtained a little bread, of which they gave me a ſmall ſhare. I did not taſte a morſel of it myſelf, but ſaved it all for my poor child, if I ſhould be ſo lucky as to find him. At length, having obtained of my keepers leave to be abſent for one day. I ſet off early in the morning, and ſteering, as well as I could, according to the directions which the friendly Indian had given me, I quickly found the place, which he had ſo accurately marked out. I beheld, as I drew nigh, my little ſon without the camp; but he looked, thought I, like a ſtarved and mangy puppy, that had been wallowing in the aſhes. I took him in my arms, and he ſpoke to me theſe words, in the Indian tongue: "Mother, are you come?' I took him into the wigwam with me, and obſerving a number of Indian children in it, I diſtributed all the bread
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024343_0012_0FC61F9ADF2ED578"/>
which I had reſerved for my own child, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them all, otherwiſe I ſhould have given great offence. My little boy appeared to be very fond of his new mother, kept as near me as poſſible while I ſtaid, and when I told him I muſt go, he fell as though he had been knocked down with a club. But having rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommended him to the care of Him that made him, when the day was far ſpent, and the time would permit me to ſtay no longer, I departed, you may well ſuppoſe with a heavy load at my heart. The tidings I had received of the death of my youngeſt child had, a little before, been confirmed to me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a doubt, but I could not mourn ſo heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily for the deceaſed, as for the living child.</p>
            <p>When the winter broke up, we removed to St. John's; and, through the enſuing ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, our principal reſidence was at no great diſtance from the fort at that place. In the mean time, however, my ſiſter's huſband having been out with a ſcouting party to ſome of the Engliſh ſettlements, had a drunken frolick at the fort, when he returned. His wife, who never got drunk, but had often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, the ill effects of her huſband's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance fearing what the conſquence might prove, if he ſhould come home in a moroſe and turbulent humour, to avoid his inſolence, propoſed that we ſhould both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024343_0013_0FC61F9E960C2270"/>
and keep out of the reach of it, until the ſtorm abated. We abſconded accordingly, but ſo it happened, that I returned, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured into his preſence, before his wife had preſumed to come nigh him. I found him in his wigwam, and in a ſurly mood; and not being able to revenge upon his wife, becauſe ſhe was not at home, he laid hold of me, and hurried me to the fort; and, for a trifling conſideration, ſold me to a French gentleman, whoſe name was Saccapee. 'Tis an ill wind certainly that blows no body any good. I had been with the Indians a year lacking four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days; and, if not for my ſiſter, yet for me, 'twas a lucky circumſtance indeed, which thus at laſt, in an unexpected moment, ſnatched me out of their cruel hands, and placed me beyond the reach of their inſolent power.</p>
            <p>After my Indian maſter had diſpoſed of me in the manner related above, and the moment of ſober reflection had arrived, perceiving that the man who bought me had taken the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of him in an unguarded hour, his reſentments begun to kindle, and his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion roſe ſo high, that he threatened to kill me if he ſhould meet me alone, or if he could not revenge himſelf thus, that he would ſet fire to the fort. I was therefore ſecreted in an upper chamber, and the fort carefully
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024343_0014_0FC61FA13A135EE0"/>
guarded, until his wrath had time to cool. My ſervice in the family to which I was now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, was perfect freedom, in compariſon of what it had been among the barbarous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. My new maſter and miſtreſs were both as kind and generous towards me as I could any ways expect. I ſeldom aſked a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of either of them, but it was readily granted: In conſequence of which I had it in my power, in many inſtances, to adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aid and refreſhment to the poor priſoners of my own nation, who were brought into St. John's during my abode in the family of the above-mentioned benevolent and hoſpitable Saccapee. Yet even in this family ſuch trials awaited me as I had little reaſon to expect, but ſtood in need of a large ſtock of prudence, to enable me to encounter them. Muſt I tell you then, that even the good old man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who conſidered me as his property, and likewiſe a warm and reſolute ſon of his, at that ſame time, and under the ſame roof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came both exceſſively fond of my company; ſo that between theſe two rivals, the father and the ſon, I found myſelf in a very critical ſituation indeed, and was greatly embarraſſed and perplexed, hardly knowing many times, how to behave in ſuch a manner as at once to ſecure my own virtue, and the good eſteem of the family in which I reſided, and upon which
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024343_0015_0FC61FA254731F68"/>
I was wholly dependent for my daily ſupport. At length, however, through the tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of a certain Engliſh gentleman,<note n="*" place="bottom">Col. Peter Schuyler, then a priſoner.</note> the Governor de Vaudreuil being made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the condition I had fallen into, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ordered the young amorous Sacca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pee, then an officer in the French army, from the field of Venus to the field of Mars, and at the ſame time alſo wrote a letter to his father, enjoining it upon him, by no means to ſuffer me to be abuſed, but to make my ſituation and ſervice in his family as eaſy and delightful as poſſible. I was moreover under unſpeakable obligations to the Governor upon another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. I had received intelligence from my daughter Mary, the purport of which was, that there was a proſpect of her being ſhortly married to a young Indian of the tribe of Saint Francois, with which tribe ſhe had continued from the beginning of her captivity. Theſe were heavy tidings, and added greatly to the poignancy of my other afflictions. However, not long after I had heard this melancholy news, an opportunity preſented, of acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that humane and generous gentleman, the commander in chief, and my illuſtrious bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, with this affair alſo, who in compaſſion for my ſufferings, and to mitigate my ſorrows, iſſued his orders in good time, and had my daughter taken away from the Indians, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024343_0016_0FC61FA493CA21B0"/>
conveyed to the ſame nunnery where her ſiſter was then lodged, with his expreſs injunction; that they ſhould both of them together, be well looked after, and carefully educated, as his adopted children. In this ſchool of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and bigotry, they continued while the war in thoſe days between France and Great-Britain laſted. At the concluſion of which war, the Governor went home to France, took my oldeſt daughter along with him, and married her then to a French gentleman, whoſe name is Cron Lewis. He was at Boſton with the fleet under Count de Eſtaing, [1778] and one of his Clerks. My other daughter ſtill continuing in the nunnery, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time had elapſed after my return from captivity, when I made a journey to Canada, reſolving to uſe my beſt endeavours not to return without her. I arrived juſt in time to prevent her being ſent to France. She was to have gone in the next veſſel that ſailed for that place. And I found it extremely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to prevail with her to quit the nunnery and go home with me. Yea, ſhe abſolutely refuſed, and all the perſuaſions and arguments I could uſe with her, were to no effect, until after I had been to the Governor, and obtained a letter from him to the ſuperintendant of the nuns, in which he threatened, if my daughter ſhould not be immediately delivered into my
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024343_0017_0FC61FA9AD7E58D8"/>
hands, or could not be prevailed with to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to my parental authority, that he would ſent a band of ſoldiers to aſſiſt me in bringing her away. Upon hearing this ſhe made no farther reſiſtance. But ſo extremely bigoted was ſhe to the cuſtoms and religion of the place, that after all, ſhe left it with the greateſt reluctance, and the moſt bitter lamentations, which ſhe continued as we paſſed the ſtreets, and wholly refuſed to be comforted. My good friend, Major Small, whom we met with on the way, tried all he could to conſole her; and was ſo very kind and obliging as to bear us company, and carry my daughter behind him on horſeback.</p>
            <p>But I have run on a little before my ſtory, for I have not yet informed you of the means and manner of my own redemption, to the accompliſhing of which, the recovery of my daughter juſt mentioned, and the ranſoming of ſome of my other children, ſeveral gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of note, contributed not a little; to whoſe goodneſs, therefore, I am greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted, and ſincerely hope I ſhall never be ſo ungrateful as to forget. Col. Schuyler in particular was ſo very kind and generous as to advance 2700 livres to procure a ranſom for myſelf and three of my children. He accompanied and conducted us from Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal to Albany, and entertained us in the moſt
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024343_0018_0FC61FAB9EEDF418"/>
friendly and hoſpitable manner a conſiderable time, at his own houſe, and I believe entirely at his own expenſe.</p>
            <p>I have ſpun out the above narrative to a much greater length than I at firſt intended, and ſhall conclude it with referring you, for a more ample and <hi>brilliant</hi> account of the captive heroine, who is the ſubject of it, to Col. Humphrey's hiſtory of the life of Gen. Iſrael Putnum, together with ſome remarks upon a few clauſes in it. I never indeed had the pleaſure of peruſing the whole of ſaid hiſtory, but remember to have ſeen, ſome time ago, an extract from it in one of the Boſton newſpapers, in which the Colonel has extolled the beauty and good ſenſe, and rare accompliſhments of Mrs. Howe, the perſon whom he endeavors to paint in the moſt lively and engaging colours, perhaps a little too highly, and in a ſtyle, that may appear to thoſe who are acquainted with her at this day, romantick and extravagant. And the Colonel muſt needs have been miſinformed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſome particulars that he has mentioned in her ſtory. Indeed, when I read the extract from his hiſtory to Mrs. Tute, (which name ſhe has derived from a third huſband, whoſe widow ſhe now remains) ſhe ſeemed to be well pleaſed, and ſaid, at firſt, is was all true, but ſoon after contradicted the circumſtance of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024343_0019_0FC61FACD38D4B78"/>
her lover's being ſo bereft of his ſenſes when he ſaw her moving off in a boat at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the ſhore, as to plunge into the water after, in conſequence of which he was ſeen no more. It is true, ſhe ſaid; that as ſhe was returning from Montreal to Albany, ſhe met with young Saccapee on the way, That ſhe was in a boat with Col. Schuyler, that the French officer came on board the boat, made her ſome handſome preſents, took his final leave of her, and departed, to outward appearance, in tolerable good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
            <p>She moreover ſays, that when ſhe went to Canada for her daughter, ſhe met with him again, that he ſhowed her a lock of her hair; and her name likewiſe, printed with vermil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion on his arm. As to her being choſen agent to go to Europe, in behalf of the people of Hinſdale, when Col. Howard obtained from the government of New-York a patent of their lands on the weſt-ſide of Connecticut river, it was never once thought of by Hinſdale people until the above-mentioned extract ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived among them, in which the author has inſerted it as a matter of undoubted fact.</p>
