            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>UPON the reading of theſe words your Thoughts will doubtleſs have immediate recourſe to the awful Providences of GOD to this People in the <hi>laſt Summer,</hi> and eſpecially on the laſt <hi>Lord's-Day Evening</hi> in the often repeated <hi>Shocks</hi> of an <hi>Earthquake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD that is mighty has done <hi>terrible things in Righteouſneſs;</hi> and when He thus diſplays
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002833_0004_0FE6727882E98778"/>His Greatneſs, it becomes us to take a very ſerious notice of it our ſelves, and to ſpeak to one another with a holy Fear and Reverence of His mighty Acts, that can't be parallel'd by the united force of all Creatures.</p>
            <p>TO let ſuch <hi>Providences</hi> paſs off careleſly and in Silence, is in a very high degree to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, and thereby we become expoſed to the deſtructive Judgments which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> prophetically denounces againſt them that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not the works of the Lord, nor the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his hands,</hi> Pſal. 28.5. I hope there is not a Soul here preſent to whom this Charge and Threatning belong, but that we are all ſenſible of and deeply affected with this His <hi>Strange work</hi> wherein he has been loudly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us; and I pray God ſo to keep this for ever in the Imagination of the thoughts of our Hearts as to prepare our Hearts unto Him, and that the Impreſſion which that Night of terror made upon us, wherein we looked upon our ſelves as dead men, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons appointed to an immediate Deſtruction, may never ſo wear off as that we ſhall return to our former ſinful Courſes, and become the ſame People, or worſe than we were before.</p>
            <p>THE terrible Judgments which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> foretold were coming againſt <hi>Ariel,</hi> have lately befallen this Land without a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapher,</hi> and the deſign of all is to awaken us to Repentance and Reformation; to humble
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002833_0004_0FE6727882E98778"/>us for paſt Sins, and to prevent future Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; to bring us down from that height of wickedneſs to which we are grown, that we may lie low before him, and ſpeak to Him out of the Duſt: And it will be well for us if this may be the Conſequence.</p>
            <p>BUT if we are reſolved to perſiſt in Sin in defiance of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and will not take the repeated Warnings He has given us, inſtead of Diſtreſs, Heavineſs and Sorrow, he <hi>will make us ſmall as Duſt — and as Chaff that paſſeth away, and it ſhall be at an inſtant ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ver. 2, — 5. <hi>Wo to Ariel — Thou ſhalt be viſited</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ariel is Jeruſalem,</hi> the chief City of God's own People. Yet ſhe muſt be told that God was coming forth againſt her in his hot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: From whence we may learn that God will not bear with Sin in his profeſſing People; but that they as well as others ſhall ſuffer for it, and more than others, as their Sins have been peculiarly aggravated. <hi>Ariel</hi>'s Fidelity to her God was her glory and ſafety, and they that invaded her were like a Wheel, and as ſtubble before the Wind; but her Sin prov'd her ruin, as it deprived her of his Favour and Protection, and opened a door for Calamities of all ſorts. His Heart was turned againſt <hi>Ariel</hi> when ſhe was irreclaimable by all the wiſe and gracious Methods he had uſed with her, and therefore He reſolves to puniſh her; <hi>Thou ſhalt be viſited</hi> — The word is uſed both in a good and bad ſenſe, carrying in it the intention of God, either to diſplay his
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002833_0005_0FE6728B224C9FD8"/>
               <hi>Juſtice</hi> or his <hi>Mercy</hi> to a People, according as they behave towards Him. In the latter ſenſe <hi>David</hi> and others implored a Viſit from Him, and having obtained it, they bowed their heads and worſhipped in token of Gratitude. But it is a <hi>Judicial Viſitation</hi> the Text ſpeaks of, Thou ſhalt be <hi>viſited with Thunder and Earthquake.</hi> This Threatning has had a <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Accompliſhment</hi> among us the <hi>laſt Summer.</hi> GOD in his juſt Diſpleaſure has ſpread over us his thick and black <hi>Cloud,</hi> deeply charged with moſt awful <hi>Thunders,</hi> the effects whereof were ſorrowful. The Earth under us has been horribly <hi>convulſed.</hi> And the <hi>Stormy Wind</hi> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling his Word, has ſhaken our Houſes &amp;c.</p>
            <p>IN diſcourſing on this <hi>Text</hi> I ſhall ſay</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>THAT Thunder and Earthquake are the dreadful Viſitations of GOD to a People.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. <hi>THEY are very evident Teſtimonies of His Diſpleaſure againſt a People.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. <hi>THAT a People by perſiſting in their Sins expoſe themſelves to ſuch awful Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from GOD.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>IV. <hi>THEY are loud Calls to Repentance; and the Reformation of this People is the only Method of Safety to be taken by us, when we are thus viſited.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I. <hi>THUNDER and Earthquake are the dreadful Viſitations of GOD to a People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002833_0005_0FE6728B224C9FD8"/>
THAT they are the Viſitations of GOD none will deny, but the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> who ſays <hi>There is no God,</hi> and attributes all to <hi>Chance;</hi> or the wild herd of <hi>Epicurus</hi> who won't al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Him to have any concern at all in the Government of this lower World. I perſwade my ſelf that there are none in this Aſſembly under any manner of doubt but that the late terrible <hi>Earthquake</hi> was the Work of GOD; and it is upon that Principle of Faith, that we are now acting in our <hi>Joint Praiſes</hi> to Him for our <hi>wonderful Preſervation</hi> in that danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hour, and in our <hi>united Prayers</hi> for his continued Protection as the day and occaſion ſhall require; ſo that it might ſeem a needleſs expence of Time and Words, to prove that <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Earthquakes</hi> are the <hi>Operations of GOD</hi> which you believe already. What I ſhall endeavour therefore from this particular ſhall be chiefly to impreſs your Minds with a more warm and affecting ſenſe of this Truth; or to aſſiſt your Faith in the more vigorous exerciſe of it, which you are now called unto by the late Occurrence of the Earthquake.</p>
            <p>IN Order to this I ſhall ſay</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THUNDER is the Work of GOD.</hi> And very much of his Majeſty and Power is to be ſeen in it; accordingly it is ſometimes called, <hi>The Thunder of his Power,</hi> and His <hi>Powerful Voice,</hi> from its mighty noiſe and terrible effects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:002833_0006_0FE672921B271C60"/>
THE <hi>Heathen</hi> aſcribed the Thunder to their great Idol <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and as a diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing character of honour called him the <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer;</hi> but we have learned from the <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Oracles</hi> in our Bibles to ſay it is God that ſpeaks to us in the Thunder, and to invocate Him in our Dangers by it, and to praiſe Him as our great Deliverer. <hi>Give unto the Lord O ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and ſtrength. Give unto the Lord the glory due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Name: worſhip the Lord is the beauty of holineſs. The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: the GOD of glory thundereth,</hi> Pſal. 29. begin. <hi>Elihu</hi> attributes the firſt Production, and the ſubſequent Motion and Effects of Thunder and Lightning to GOD, all which are above the reach and influence of the moſt potent Creatures, Job. 37. <hi>Hear attentively the noiſe of his voice, and the ſound that goeth out of his mouth. He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth. After it a voice roareth: he thundreth with the voice of his excellency — GOD thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth marvellouſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE are very probably <hi>natural Cauſes</hi> of Thunder and Lightning which <hi>Philoſophers</hi> undertake to account for, which brings to Mind the <hi>bold Saying</hi> of an obdurate Sinner, <hi>viz.</hi> That to have <hi>the Awe and Impreſſion of a Deity upon our Minds when we ſee the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and hear the Thunder is vain and childiſh, becauſe we can aſſign the natural Cauſes of them.</hi> But this is to pervert the great Deſign of their
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002833_0006_0FE672921B271C60"/>glorious Author, which is to make us Fear Him, to rouze up an unthinking World to the conſideration of a GOD above us, that can in a Moment deſtroy our lives. This was the happy influence of it upon a <hi>celebrated Man</hi> who was reclaimed <hi>from Atheiſm</hi> by the terrors of Thunder and Lightning.</p>
            <p>THE Lightning is very evidently a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Sulphurous</hi> and <hi>Nitrous Particles</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the Earth by the Sun, which meeting in the middle Region of the Air, are put into a quick motion, or by an <hi>Antiperiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> are ſet on Fire; which is alſo the true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Stella cadens;</hi> the odds between them being only this the <hi>Meteor</hi> which cauſes the Lightning being ſhut up in a thick Cloud, and taking Fire there, and ſo burſting the Cloud, throws it ſelf out with the mighty and irreſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table force we ſometimes ſee: Whereas the other being under no Confinement is more gradual in its motion, and uſually ſpends its ſtrength in the Air. The <hi>perpendicular motion</hi> in the Lightning is from the <hi>Nitre,</hi> the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Quality of which is to burn downwards, and 'tis this renders it ſo quick and penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Thunder</hi> follows the Lightning as the Effect the Cauſe, and is made either by the Colliſion of the Clouds from the breaking out of the Lightning, or by the divided Clouds falling together after it's Expulſion. The moſt lively Emblem in nature of Thunder and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002833_0007_0FE6729248163C78"/>Lightning is <hi>Gunpowder,</hi> both in reſpect of its Noiſe from the mouth of a Cannon, and the Effects of it. Hence it is called <hi>Artificial Thundring.</hi>

            <p>THUS according to our beſt Conception, Thunder and Lightning are made; but then GOD is the Cauſe of this Cauſe; He forms the Cloud, prepares the matter for the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and gives Fire to it. This <hi>Artillery of Heaven</hi> is diſcharged by Him who is the GOD of Heaven; 'tis He that <hi>makes way for the Lightning of the Thunder.</hi> And it is certain that <hi>Second Cauſes</hi> could produce no ſuch <hi>Effect</hi> without leave from Him; He gives them that Virtue or Power whereby they act, and He can alter their Properties, or withhold their Influences when He will; and this He often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times does when it beſt ſerves his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the good of his People: He appoints when and where it ſhall thunder, and what ſhall be the Effect. He ſends forth his Voice from the black Cloud either more low or leſs terrible, or ſtrong and loud to our greater Amazement. He commiſſions the fiery Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor ſometimes to rend and tear in pieces or to diſſolve the Objects it ſtrikes on according to their different Natures; ſometimes to blaſt or ſcorch them, and ſometimes to burn them to Aſhes, and there's nothing that can reſiſt the force of it; no Creature but is liable to be hurt by it; for it is a ridiculous Fiction of the <hi>Poets</hi> that the <hi>Eagle carries Jupiter's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi> ſcil. the Lightning, meaning that it
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002833_0007_0FE6729248163C78"/>can't ſtrike upon the Eagle. And it is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no leſs abſurd that Perſons or Things co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the Skins of <hi>Seals,</hi> or <hi>Sea-Calves</hi> are ſecure, from whence ſome have made uſe of them in Storms of Thunder, as <hi>Tiberius</hi> did of the <hi>Lawrel-tree</hi> which he formed into a Crown, and wore upon his head.</p>
            <p>THE commanding Providence, as well as the creating Power of GOD extends to every thing. <hi>Wiſdom and Might are his, He changeth the Times and Seaſons, and the Fire and Hail, Snow and Vapour and the ſtormy Wind fulfil His Word.</hi> And His Deſigns both of Mercy and Judgment to a People are many times ſerved by the <hi>Wind.</hi> GOD ſometimes makes uſe of it to cleanſe and purge the Air from noxious Vapours, which would be of fatal Conſequence to us. Sometimes to fan and cool our Bodies in the heat of Summer: and by the Wind we are able to viſit far diſtant Countries, and commerce with all Nations, and to bring from them the rareſt and moſt uſeful Productions of their Soil, as well as carry to them the beſt of our own. And then on the other hand by the Wind GOD ſometimes blaſts our Fruit, brings mortal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers upon a People, overturns our Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, throws down vaſt numbers of Trees of all ſorts, and of the largeſt Size. A ſad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this we had <hi>September</hi> 16th. which is freſh in your Memories. And then as a yet more awful Inſtance, by this he ſhakes terribly
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002833_0008_0FE6729372A4A538"/>the Earth, and ſometimes rends it in pieces, and in a moment cauſes it and it's Inhabitants to <hi>ſink as Lead in the mighty Waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND ſo GOD orders every clap of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and flaſh of Lightning, when and where they ſhall be, how far they ſhall extend, &amp; what Execution they ſhall do, and no Man may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſay, <hi>a Chance has befallen me,</hi> when the Thunder breaks upon his Houſe, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys his Cattle or any part of his Eſtate. GOD has often puniſhed the Wickedneſs of Men with <hi>hot Thunderbolts.</hi> The Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> were deſtroyed by Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Lightning. And it was one of the Plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 9.23. <hi>The Lord ſent Thunder and Hail, and the Fire ran along upon the ground.</hi> And ſo very ſurpriſing and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it was to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> as to force the obſtinate wretch into a Confeſſion of his Sin, and a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for Mercy. And by awful Thunders GOD fought againſt the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded <hi>Iſrael:</hi> 1 Sam. 7.10. — <hi>The Lord thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred with a great Thunder on that day upon the Philiſtines, and diſcomfited them</hi> —. In a very lively and elegant manner the diſmal effects of Thunder are exhibited to us in the 29th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which ſome think was compoſed by <hi>David</hi> upon the Occaſion of ſome great Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ſtorm, <hi>The voice of the Lord is Powerful — The voice of the Lord breaketh the Cedars: yea, the Lord breaketh the Cedars of Lebanon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHICH has been remarkably exemplified with us this laſt Summer. The deſtructive
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002833_0008_0FE6729372A4A538"/>Effects of Thunder having been many more than we have ever known in any one, or in many Years. The long continued and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Heat has been productive of abundance of Thunder, and there has ſeldom been a Thunder-ſtorm, but that ſome hurt has been done by it; and ſometimes the ſame Storm has broke in many Places; ſometimes Trees have been rent and ſplit to Pieces; ſometimes it ſtruck upon our <hi>Houſes;</hi> ſeveral <hi>Barns</hi> have been burnt to the ground, and ſome of them richly ſtored with Grain: Sometimes it has killed fome of our <hi>Cattle;</hi> but in all, GOD <hi>who is a Covert from the Storm,</hi> has wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>ſpared his People;</hi> and though ſome of them have been wounded, yet none that I have heard of have been deſtroyed. GOD might have commiſſion'd his Thunder againſt our <hi>Perſons</hi> and not our <hi>Subſtance,</hi> and laid our fleſhly Tabernacles in Aſhes in a Moment; but inſtead of this He ſaid to it, <hi>Deſtroy them not.</hi> He turned the point of his arrows ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and only diſplay'd his awful Power in our Sight, to let us know how eaſy it was for him to deſtroy us.</p>
            <p>THUS Thunder is the Work of GOD, his terrible Work, and one great deſign he has in it is to make us fear Him. We ſhould therefore improve the Thunder to a more juſt apprehenſion of GOD, and reſolve that we will no more expoſe our ſelves to his fiery In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation by breaking his Laws, leſt he ſhould
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002833_0009_0FE672939DD7E480"/>preſently raiſe a Storm of Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to avenge our Tranſgreſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh the Days and Nights of Terror that have lately paſſed ever us!</hi> The dreadful Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps we have heard, wherein an angry GOD has proclaimed War againſt his Enemies, and threatned them with ſpeedy Deſtruction by Fire from Heaven, if they did not ſubmit themſelves and turn unto Him.</p>
            <p>HOW very terrible was the Storm in the <hi>Month of July;</hi> the <hi>Thunder</hi> almoſt continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly roaring over our Heads for the ſpace of an Hour or more, and the deeply tinctured <hi>blue Lightning</hi> flaſhing in our Faces, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſtriking one, and very near to another of our Houſes. Who of us thought then of ever living the Storm out, but GOD was better to us than our Fears.</p>
            <p>AND the <hi>amazing Lightnings</hi> in the Night after the 1ſt Day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> will never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by many, wherein there was hardly a Moments intermiſſion for ſeveral Hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the moſt diſmal Flames that ever our Eyes beheld: The Darkneſs vaniſh'd as at the light of the Sun before them, and the ſmalleſt Objects were viſible to us, as at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
            <p>THIS was attended with ſome Thunder, and one Clap broke among us; but without harm to Man or Beaſt. And now, from the whole, we ſee how very juſtly we aſcribe the Thunder to GOD as the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of it. We are
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002833_0009_0FE672939DD7E480"/>taught by Example of wiſe and good Men to call it <hi>His Voice, the Sound that goeth out of His Mouth, the Fire of GOD</hi> &amp;c. As if it was the immediate Production of His Hand, and ſecond Cauſes had nothing to do in it. And in our Text GOD himſelf aſſerts his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and claims the Honour of being <hi>Lord of this Hoſt.</hi> And accordingly we are to apply to Him in all our Dangers by it, to ſpread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us the wing of His Protection, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Thunder not to ſtrike and deſtroy us, or our Subſtance.</p>
            <p>AND let our <hi>many Preſervations</hi> in the Thunder <hi>excite</hi> our ſincere and affectionate <hi>Thankſgivings</hi> to him; for it muſt be entirely reſolved into his Mercy that we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
            <p>LET the Children of GOD <hi>correct</hi> their <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Fears</hi> of the Thunder. Oh act Faith in GOD then as yours. Conſider it as the Voice of your beſt Friend, and heavenly Father, who dearly loves you, is always thoughtful of you, and whoſe Perfections are ever engaged for your Benefit. This will help to ſilence your Complaints, allay your Fears, and create a Divine Calm in your Breaſts.</p>
            <p>AND let the Thunder and Lightning ſerve <hi>to put us all in Mind of that Great and Terrible Day of the Lord, in which the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the elements ſhall melt with fervent, the earth alſo and the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up:</hi> Yea, let it extend our thoughts farther, to the <hi>devouring
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002833_0010_0FE672A220722ED0"/>Fire and everlaſting Burnings conſequent upon the Judgment,</hi> to every impenitent Sinner. Which Conſideration has a natural tendency to awaken us out of our dozing Frames, and excite us to flee from this Wrath by a timely and deep Repentance, a thorough and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Reformation.</p>
            <p>EVERY Thunder-clap we hear has this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Voice in it, <hi>Agree with your Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quickly,</hi> by an humble Confeſſion of your many Sins, and by ſtriving no more againſt your Maker; but by practically acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing GOD for your Sovereign, and by a moſt free and hearty Conſent to all his Claims and Demands upon you. Attend then to the Call of GOD. 'Tis at our utmoſt Peril if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in Sin any longer in defiance of ſuch aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Admonitions, and we can in reaſon expect no other but that a provoked GOD in the very next Thunder-ſtorm will <hi>rain upon us Fire and Brimſtone, and a Tempeſt of Horrors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET not the moſt ſtout and reſolved Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner among us <hi>dare to meet another Thunder-ſtorm in a ſtate of Sin,</hi> not knowing what may be the Conſequence, and but that the <hi>Fire of Heaven</hi> may in a moment diſpatch you to the <hi>Flames of Hell.</hi> Your Sins and Luſts are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fuel for the Fire of GOD's Lightning to ſtrike on, and it is impoſſible you can be ſafe with theſe about you. Betake your ſelves then to CHRIST without delay to unload you of Guilt and the Curſe, to take off from you
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002833_0010_0FE672A220722ED0"/>the <hi>Garment ſpotted with the Fleſh,</hi> and to put on you <hi>the Robe of Holineſs,</hi> the only <hi>Amulet</hi> in that Evil Day.</p>
            <p>ENDEAVOUR to impreſs upon your Mind the lively and affecting Senſe of the Evil of sin, which you have ſometimes had in a Thunder-ſtorm, and let your whole Life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be a practical Comment upon the pious Reſolutions you have formed then. Always dread the <hi>Divine Power</hi> as you do then, and let Sin be as far from your Deſire and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and don't (with <hi>Caligula</hi>) tremble at GOD's Voice in a <hi>Storm,</hi> and bid Defiance to Him in a <hi>Calm.</hi> He is the ſame GOD al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and ſhould be ſo apprehended by us, and have the ſame Reſpect and Reverence from us<note n="‡" place="bottom">

2. <hi>GOD is the Primary Efficient Cauſe of Earthquakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS <hi>Thunder</hi> is His Voice, and <hi>Lightning</hi> a Flame that goeth out of His Mouth; ſo <hi>Earthquakes</hi> are cauſed by His ſtrong Hand: And how much ſoever it exceeds the Strength of any Creature or all united, to ſhake the Earth, the <hi>Omnipotent Author</hi> of it, can do it with greater Eaſe, than any of us can move a Finger or wave a Feather. <hi>Job</hi> having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the Power of GOD in general, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to prove it by an Induction of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Inſtances, Job 9.5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>6. <hi>He is mighty in Strength,—removeth the Mountains, and they know not, overturneth them in his anger, ſhaketh the Earth out of her place and the Pillars thereof tremble.</hi> What is it that infinite Power exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the height can't effect? As He gave Exiſtence to the whole <hi>Globe</hi> of Earth by a Word, ſo He can deſtroy it in a Moment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:002833_0011_0FE6727B6045CF70"/>
'TIS abſurd and atheiſtical to aſſert that Earthquakes are the Effects of a <hi>blind Chance;</hi> or to reſolve them into <hi>natural Cauſes,</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the <hi>Divine Superimendency</hi> and Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency: We may affirm on equal grounds that GOD does nothing in the World in reſpect to Government, that there is no ſuch thing as Reward and Puniſhment in any degree admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred here; as deny Him this great and moſt ſenſible and awful Inſtance of His Power and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>OUR <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> would have us to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge GOD and His Providence in the moſt minute and common Occurrences of Life; certainly then we muſt attribute this <hi>Prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Work</hi> to Him, and ſay when this Evil is in the City or Country, it is the Lord has done it.</p>
            <p>SOME Earthquakes are from GOD imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, others by the agency of ſecond Cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and both are aſcribed to Him in Holy Scripture without Diſtinction. And agreeably I ſhall here ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>EARTHQUAKES are ſometimes the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Works of GOD,</hi> that is, they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Him either beyond the Courſe and above the Power of Nature, or ſecond Cauſes are by His immediate influence ſo diſpoſed, and operate ſo as to produce ſuch Effects.</p>
            <p>THUS the <hi>Earthquake at Sinai,</hi> when the <hi>SON of GOD,</hi> our King and Lawgiver came down upon the Mount to publiſh His Law,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002833_0012_0FE6728CBB213CD0"/>was a <hi>Supernatural Operation.</hi> That was a Day of <hi>Miracles,</hi> and every thing in it was extraordinary, ſuitable to the Pomp and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of it. 'Tis of this awful Tranſaction that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, Pſal. 114. <hi>When Iſrael went out of Egypt — the Sea ſaw it and fled, Jordan was driven back, the Mountains ſkipped like Rame, and the little Hills like Lambs. What ailed thee, O thou Sea?</hi> By which Queſtion he means to expreſs the Reality of the <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi> and that it was not the Effect of any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſe. So the <hi>Violent Earthquake</hi> that ſhook the Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> out of their Chains, and converted the <hi>Jaylour</hi> was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs extraordinary, and ſent of GOD on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to accompliſh theſe things. And I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe none will deny but that the repeated Earthquakes at our Saviour's <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> were <hi>miraculous;</hi> as the <hi>Ecclipſe</hi> of the Sun was at that time, which according to Nature was impoſſible; and deſign'd for Tokens of GOD's Anger at the horrid Fact, and for the Conviction of that ſtupid Nation that the Perſon they had ſo baſely treated was more than a Man.</p>
            <p>THE Earthquake in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which we read of <hi>Amos</hi> 1.1. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. was an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Judgment of GOD upon <hi>Uzziah</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the Prieſt's Office. <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays that it rent their <hi>Temple</hi> in the midſt at the very time when he was offering Incenſe, and that a great Light of the Sun broke in at the Chaſm, and reflected on the King's Face, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002833_0012_0FE6728CBB213CD0"/>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly overſpread his whole Body with a Leproſy; he adds, that half a Mountain was thrown down by it, and rolled upon the Ground for the ſpace of four Stadia or Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and then reſted upon the King's Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. And now from theſe Inſtances may we not reaſonably think, that GOD ſometimes immediately and in way of Admonition or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment viſits a People with Earthquakes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>EARTHQUAKES are produced by the agency of ſecond Cauſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE great former of the <hi>Earth</hi> has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſo made it as to ſerve His eternal Deſign in this awful Diſpenſation; and then he has endowed the Celeſtial and Elementary World with ſuch Virtues and Powers as to produce ſuch an Effect; and though He has not obliged himſelf always to act by the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh'd Laws of Nature, yet He ordinarily does. Thus He produces the Fruits of the Earth by the Influences of the Sun and Moon; and thus He brings on the ſucceſſive Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Day and Night in a natural Way, and the quaternial Seaſons of the Year, by the Suns paſſing thro' ſuch and ſuch Signs of the <hi>Zodiack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT now what are the natural Cauſes of Earthquakes, Men of the greateſt Sagacity and deepeſt Penetration, can but gueſs. And hence ariſes the great Diverſity of Thought about them, one fixing upon this thing, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002833_0013_0FE6724CDD7E3F48"/>upon that, which ſeems to them moſt probable.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Ancient Heathen</hi> ſuppoſed them to proceed from the <hi>Fluctuations</hi> of Waters in the Subterraneous <hi>Caverns,</hi> and celebrated <hi>Neptune</hi> as the Cauſe of them; but this hath no Solid Foundation.</p>
            <p>OTHERS tell us that a ſtrong <hi>Windy Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> impriſoned in the Bowels of the Earth and wanting Vent, makes an Earthquake; this alſo is liable to Exception, it being altogether impoſſible in Nature that the Wind can have ſo ſwift a Currency thro' the Earth as to ſhake it for five hundred Miles in length within a few Minutes of time; for if we ſuppoſe a <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> ſhot, which glides much ſwifter thro' the Air then the ſtrongeſt blaſt of Wind, flies after the rate of a League in a minute; according to that Computation it muſt be near three Hours and half in going 500 Miles, or if we double the Motion it muſt be one Hour and half, which is above a full Hour more than the diſtance of time betwixt the late Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake's being felt at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and at <hi>Arowſick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT Opinion which to me carries in it the greateſt Probability of Truth is this; That <hi>Subterraneous Fires</hi> occaſion'd by the <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi> of combuſtible Minerals in the Earth, ſuch as <hi>Sulpher, Salt-Petre, Vitriol</hi> &amp;c. are the cauſe of this <hi>Prodigy.</hi> Theſe Fires being made of the ſame Matter with <hi>Lightning,</hi> fly as the Lightning does with an incredible
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002833_0013_0FE6724CDD7E3F48"/>Swiftneſs, and carry in them an irreſiſtable Force, and give the Earth thoſe violent Shocks we have lately felt; but whether this ſolves the Matter, I don't pretend to ſay, I ſhall leave it to them whoſe Buſineſs it is more properly to ſearch into it.</p>
            <p>BUT let the <hi>natural Cauſes</hi> be what they will, this is moſt certain, that they are all in the <hi>Hand,</hi> and entirely ſubject to the <hi>Will of GOD.</hi> We may not think that He has thrown off the Government of them, and left them to effect what is in their own Power! What wild Diſorder and Confuſion would this create in the World? No verily! He guides and directs, reſtrains and limits them, or gives them a Liberty according to the Deſign He is to accompliſh by them; and from hence it is that we are to attribute all to Him; both the good we enjoy, and the Evils we ſuffer. What Foundation for Prayer to him would there be, either to prevent Judgments or to confer Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: What Dependance could we have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to protect us in our Dangers, or do any thing at all for us, if he had not the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Command of all the ſprings of Nature? So that to reſolve all Events into natural Cauſes is derogatory to the Honour of GOD, and the direct Courſe to baniſh all Religion out of the World, and will prove of fatal Conſequence to all who adhere to it. All his <hi>Promiſes</hi> are but meer <hi>Cheat</hi> and Deluſion, and his <hi>Threatnings ridiculous Terrors,</hi> and worthy of no Regard, if ſuch a Perſwaſion
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002833_0014_0FE6724E071BDAD0"/>is true; and for Men under the influence of this Principle to apply to him to make good his Promiſes, or not to execute his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, is the moſt provoking Mockery, ſince according to them, He can accompliſh neither.</p>
            <p>GOD every where in His Word challenges the Honour of being the immediate <hi>abſolute Governour</hi> of the World, and this we muſt firmly believe He is; and as his Perfections take their turns to act and diſplay themſelves, ſo we muſt obſerve the Order of them, and give them the Honours which are reſpectively due to them. <hi>I will ſing of Mercy and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unto thee O Lord will I ſing.</hi> And thus in particular we muſt acknowledge that GOD is the Cauſe of <hi>Earthquakes.</hi> He that ſupports and guides the <hi>Orbs of Light</hi> and Fire over our Heads, holds in his Hand the <hi>rolling World</hi> under our Feet, and makes it tremble and ſhake when he pleaſes; and without any ſtrain of Power can disjoin the infinite Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles whereof it conſiſts, and cauſe them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe and wander in the Air, at a wide diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from one another.</p>
            <p>HE that in Strength has <hi>ſet faſt</hi> the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> can <hi>take them off</hi> from their <hi>ancient Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> and tranſplant them remote from where they ſtood. Or he can ſo convulſe the Earth as that it ſhall throw Mountains out of her Bowels upon the level Ground, or in the Sea. He can cauſe the dry and ſolid Earth to ſwell and riſe like the Waves of the Sea under our
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002833_0014_0FE6724E071BDAD0"/>Feet, and then to ſink down again to the Deſtruction of its Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>AS to the diſtinct <hi>kinds</hi> of Earthquakes, and their <hi>Antecendentia</hi> or Prognoſticks which <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi> ſpeak of, I ſhall ſay<note n="*" place="bottom">Excepting in one Inſtance, the like having happened with us, It is one preceeding Sign of an Earthquake, ſays my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, when the Water in deep Pits or Wells, is from an inviſible Cauſe put into Motion, or gives a diſagreeable Taſte or Smell. The latter of theſe Signs, ſeveral of my Neighbours, three at leaſt, have had in their Wells: About <hi>3</hi> days before the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake they perceiv'd an ill ſtinking Smell in the Water, and not thinking of the proper Cauſe, ſearched the Wells, but finding nothing that might thus infect them, were at a Loſs into what to reſolve it, till ſome Days ſince the Earthquake being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd that Earthquakes ſometimes had ſuch an Influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Wells, judged it to be that. The Scent was ſo ſtrong and offenſive that they could not ſuffer the Water in their Houſes, and for about <hi>8</hi> or <hi>10</hi> Days they entirely omitted the uſe of them. In the deepeſt of theſe Wells which was <hi>36</hi> feet, the Water turn'd to a Brimſtone colour, but had nothing of the Smell of it, and was thick like puddle Water. It is now (and ſo are the others) perfectly recovered as to colour and taſte.</note> nothing, but proceed from the Cauſe to the <hi>Effects</hi> of this wonderful Diſpenſation: And here I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon a large Field, and might expatiate almoſt endleſly; but it is not my preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to write a Hiſtory of Earthquakes, but to exhibit to you ſomething of the <hi>Terrors of the Lord</hi> in this ſort, that I may <hi>perſwade Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE World has been alarm'd by <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,</hi> and the <hi>tragical Effects</hi> of them have rendred them formidable to all Nations; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of late they have been numerous. A
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002833_0015_0FE6724E2D5FDC28"/>learned Writer has reckon'd up near <hi>Forty,</hi> that have happen'd in about <hi>Thirty Years;</hi> which as he ſays are more than the World has known for ſeveral <hi>Centuries</hi> before; and ſince 1713, which is the date of his Account, there have been ſeveral, as in <hi>Sicily, China, Jamaica, England, Paris,</hi> and now in <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Deſign</hi> of GOD in Earthquakes is not always the ſame; and from hence it follows that the <hi>Effects</hi> of them are different; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they come in <hi>Mercy;</hi> but for the moſt part in <hi>Judgment;</hi> ſometimes they are ſent to <hi>admoniſh</hi> a ſinful People, and often to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES the Terror of them has been comparatively little, the Roar and Shake being both ſmall, and they paſs off without Harm; and then ſometimes they are terrible beyond Expreſſion.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES they have rais'd up <hi>Iſlands</hi> in the Sea, and thrown out Fire, Sand and Rocks almoſt as high as to the very Clouds, to the Aſtoniſhment of poor Sailors.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES they have turned the <hi>Courſe of Rivers,</hi> and cauſed Rivers to break out in new Places.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES they have divided Kingdoms and Countries, as <hi>Britain</hi> from <hi>France, Africa</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> from <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SOMETIMES they have cauſed violent Eruptions of Fire out of the Earth, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered new burning Mountains.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:002833_0015_0FE6724E2D5FDC28"/>
SOMETIMES they have ſhaken down many Thouſands of Houſes, Churches and Caſtles &amp;c. and made very <hi>flouriſhing Cities</hi> almoſt <hi>ruin'd Heaps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SOMETIMES they have ſwallowed up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cities and Towns without leaving any Mark at all of them; they have ſunk as Lead in the mighty Waters.</p>
            <p>THUS it was in <hi>Sicily</hi> in the Year 1693, of which Prodigy my <hi>Author</hi> writes that on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day <hi>January 9.</hi> after a warm ſerene and calm Day, the Earth began to tremble ſuddenly; the firſt ſhake was attended as is common, with a hollow thundring noiſe, and ſucceeded by another early the next Morning; but on the Day following viz. 11, happen'd a third which was ſtupendous beyond human Imagination which almoſt totally deſtroyed 20 or more Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Towns, and above one hundred Thouſand Inhabitants, after which vaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the Earth continued trembling at times for ſeveral Months.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>Earthquake</hi> was preceeded like ours with <hi>Southerly Winds,</hi> extreme heat and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Storms of Thunder and Lightning, and after this, profuſe Rains.</p>
            <p>THE Earthquake at <hi>Port-Royal</hi> in <hi>Jamaica</hi> the Year before this <hi>June</hi> 7. at noon was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terrible, Rocks and Mountains were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and all the Buildings in the Town fell, whole Streets were ſwallowed up; both Houſes and Inhabitants went down together.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002833_0016_0FE6725644606C20"/>Some were killed by the fall of Houſes, ſome were wounded, ſome were floted off to Sea upon pieces of Timber &amp;c. and ſo periſhed. Others that were falling to the Earth, by its cloſing together again on a ſudden were catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſome by the Legs, others by the Neck, &amp;c. and ſome that were actually fallen into it's Caverns were thrown out again by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Eruption of Waters.</p>
            <p>AND then, the late <hi>China</hi> Earthquake, was very awful: this fell out <hi>June</hi> 19. 1719. and was ſo violent as to remove Mountains two full Leagues over a Plain, and to ſwallow up the Plain without leaving any Mark of Men, Houſes or Animals. In another Place the Earth opened, and a Mountain was rolled down upon the Town, and in the twinkling of an Eye the Town was ſwallowed up, and the Plain roſe in Waves ſix fathom.</p>
            <p>BUT above all that the World has known, was that at <hi>Antioch</hi> in the <hi>ſecond Century</hi> after CHRIST, and tho' of long ſtanding yet it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be recogniſed, and ſpoken of to the Honour of GOD, and the terror of Men as long as the Sun and Moon ſhall endure. The whole City was deſtroy'd by this Earthquake, not an Houſe left; almoſt incredible Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were killed and wounded; for it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd at ſuch a time when they were met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from all Parts of the Empire at the Command of <hi>Trajan</hi> their Emperor. All the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002833_0016_0FE6725644606C20"/>Elements conſpired in their ruin. The Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders roared from above, the Earth ſhaking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and an horrible Tempeſt of Wind, and as the Effect of theſe the Sea raging, the Houſes and City Walls falling; and all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made ſuch a Noiſe and thick Duſt that they were not able to ſee the Faces, or hear the Voices of one another. And when all was over, and the Survivors ſaw the Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their City, and the heaps of dead Bodies in all places, they were ready to wiſh to have undergone the fate of their Brethren, rather than live to behold ſuch deplorable Ruins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>NEW-ENGLAND</hi> has never felt any <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions</hi> to be compared with theſe; not an Hair of our Heads has ever periſhed by an Earthquake. And this <hi>laſt</hi> which has in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſpects exceeded any that have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and was indeed very violent, yet has been ſo far reſtrained as that but little hurt has been done by it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here inſert a <hi>ſhort Narrative</hi> of this awful Diſpenſation, and ſo conclude this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT begun as I conceive in the <hi>South-Eaſt,</hi> about half an Hour after Ten in the <hi>Lord's-Day Evening</hi> after the 29th of <hi>October,</hi> 1727. All on a ſudden our Houſes ſhook as if they were falling to pieces, and this was attended with a great Noiſe, which laſted about one Minute, and then took it's Courſe <hi>Northward.</hi> In a
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002833_0017_0FE6725671CF7AE8"/>very ſhort time it return'd upon us, tho' with far leſs Strength, and the <hi>Shocks were repeated ſeven Times</hi> in my hearing that Night; but they were many more at <hi>Salem, Ipſwich</hi> &amp;c. Diſtant Rumbles were heard by us many times until the next <hi>Friday-Evening:</hi> Since that we don't know that we have heard it; but it has been heard at <hi>Newbury</hi> every Day ſince, and now for more than three Weeks.</p>
            <p>THE Surpriſe and Terror of it were very great: ſome thought their Houſes were all on Fire about them, and made all poſſible haſte to eſcape the Burning; others who were free from this Fear, were ſeized with the Terrors of the <hi>Laſt Day,</hi> and could think of nothing but the <hi>diſſolving World,</hi> the ſound of the <hi>laſt Trumpet,</hi> and the ſudden Appearance of <hi>CHRIST</hi> their Judge; others expected to die by the falling of their Houſes, or that the Earth under them would open, and they ſhould go down alive into the Pit. Words can't expreſs the <hi>Agonies</hi> that our Souls were in; our Faces were pale as Aſhes, our Lips quivered, our Speech faultred, and our Knees ſmote together, and there was no ſtrength left in us; <hi>Our Fleſh then trembled for fear of GOD, and we were afraid of his Judgments.</hi> And we were ready, like the Men of <hi>Judah,</hi> to have fled, if we had known where, becauſe of the Earthquake. And thus I have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>firſt Particular</hi> that I propounded to ſpeak to; viz. <hi>That Thunder and Earthquake
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002833_0017_0FE6725671CF7AE8"/>are the awful Viſitations of GOD to a People</hi> And now proceed to the <hi>Second,</hi> namely this</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>GOD's terrible Viſits to a People by Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Earthquake are evident Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his Anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE efficient Cauſe of Earthquakes is the Power of GOD, the final is the Signification of his Anger moved by the execrable Crimes of a wicked People, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 18.7. <hi>Then the Earth ſhock and trembled, the Foundations of the Hills mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and were ſhaken, becauſe he was Wroth.</hi> The very <hi>Heathen</hi> have accounted Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes Tokens of GOD's Diſpleaſure, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they prayed and offered Sacrifice to avert his Wrath. The <hi>Romans</hi> paſſed it into a Law that Prayers ſhould be made to GOD in time of an Earthquake: And verily ſo great Occaſion there is for this, that it is ſtrange any one that has a Mouth to ſpeak to Him, ſhould be ſilent at ſuch a Time.</p>
            <p>WE read of ſome Earthquakes that have been ſent <hi>in Mercy;</hi> but for the moſt part they come <hi>in Wrath,</hi> and are the Threatnings or Executions of <hi>Divine Juſtice.</hi> 'Tis no <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole</hi> to ſay that Sin ſets the Heavens on Fire over us, and the Earth under our Feet. That Earthquakes are Evidences of GOD's Anger appears from his Threatnings to viſit a ſinful People with them, and from the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002833_0018_0FE6725A5C009440"/>Deſolations he has brought upon the World by them; for it is an offended GOD that is a <hi>conſuming Fire.</hi> Yea, they are not Marks of common Anger, but of Wrath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed; for GOD obſerves a Proportion and Gradation in his Judgments, as the Sins of a People riſe and multiply; and Earthquakes are juſtly reckoned among his moſt terrible Judgments, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. —</p>
            <p>'TIS certain that GOD can be angry at nothing but Sin, and there had never been the leaſt ſpark of Indignation in Him towards Mankind, if Sin had not occaſion'd it. 'Tis Sin that turns the Heart of GOD againſt us, converts his Care into Neglect, his Bleſſings into Curſes, and makes the Arrows of his Vengeance go forth as Lightning, fly ſwift and far; ſcatter and deſtroy his People.</p>
            <p>WHEREVER we read in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of their ſuffering State we are told, That Sin was the Cauſe. GOD never would have drawn his Sword againſt them, but to avenge the Quarrel of his Covenant. It is for the <hi>unrighteouſneſs of Men</hi> that the <hi>Wrath of GOD is revealed from Heaven.</hi> So that when He viſits a People with Earthquake, they muſt charge the Fault upon themſelves, and ſet His Throne guiltleſs, ſaying, <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous art thou, O LORD, becauſe thou haſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Series of <hi>awful Providences</hi> the Lord of Hoſts has viſited this People with of late
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002833_0018_0FE6725A5C009440"/>are evident Tokens that His Anger is out againſt us. It has been an extraordinary Year, not any that we have known like it in ſome reſpects; early in the <hi>Spring</hi> we were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with ſeveral very <hi>ſudden Deaths,</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons falling down Dead as they walked the Streets, as Mr. <hi>Hirſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Summer</hi> was remarkable for extream Heat, by which ſome alſo died ſuddenly; and for moſt <hi>awful Thunder</hi> and Lightning. After this we had the violent <hi>Storm of Wind</hi> which threatned us with the Deſtruction of our Houſes, and made us think our ſelves in the greateſt Danger from thoſe Places of common Safety. And now the <hi>terrible Earthquake:</hi> Thus a provoked GOD has been repeating his awful Viſits, one in a ſhort time after another. And what do all theſe ſpeak, but his hot An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt us; and that Man is certainly under a judicial Blindneſs, and his Heart like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s is hardned under Judgments, who makes light of ſuch Diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>THUS GOD's late viſit to this People by Earthquake is a Teſtimony of his Anger, and this I doubt not but we ſhall all readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; but then the difficulty lies in rightly ſtating the Matter, and ſaying who are the faulty Cauſes; for ſome who have as deep a ſhare it may be in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence as any, will be very loth to own they have any Hand at all in it, and ſhift off the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002833_0019_0FE6725A8B1AD988"/>Blame to others. They ſee as they imagine a <hi>Beam</hi> in their Neighbours Eye, but a <hi>Mote</hi> in their own; when in reality the Beam is theirs, and the Mote their Neighbours: But thus partial are Men in their own Caſe, and by thus miſapplying the Plaſter, the Wound remains, corrupts and putrifies, and affords many a threatning Symptom to the Body.</p>
            <p>IN ſuch an <hi>Evil Day</hi> as this we muſt every one look at home, <hi>examine his own Heart,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly propoſe the Queſtion to himſelf, <hi>What have I done?</hi> And charge himſelf in the Name of GOD to give a juſt and full Anſwer to it. And upon a ſtrict Review of his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, every one will find enough amiſs in himſelf to bring down the awful Judgments of Heaven upon his own Head. We are certainly <hi>all faulty;</hi> there are none among us but have dealt wickedly; yea among the <hi>faithful</hi> there is none that has not done <hi>amiſs,</hi> and highly offended.</p>
            <p>THERE is no Rank or Degree of Men to be acquitted.</p>
            <p>IS there not too much of a <hi>ſelfiſh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Spirit</hi> in too many that are intruſted with the publick Intereſts of this People? And is it not moſt evident that there is too little Regard had to the Execution of the Laws of the Province upon bold Offenders; and though Iniquity appears bare-faced, yet it goes unpuniſhed. Some in Authority want
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002833_0019_0FE6725A8B1AD988"/>Courage, others ('tis to be feared) Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to proſecute the Actors of it; and by this Neglect a private perſonal Offence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes publick, and the whole muſt ſuffer for it.</p>
            <p>AND may not the <hi>Miniſters of Religion</hi> charge themſelves with too much <hi>Sloth</hi> and Negligence in their great Work? Oh! Have they been enough concerned about the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and Happineſs of the precious Souls of their People. I do moſt freely own my ſelf chargeable with many Defects, and fly to the great and common Saviour for Pardon and Mercy. Has not a <hi>worldly Spirit</hi> too much the Aſcendant over many of us? The hot and fierce Debates about Sallaries, may not, I fear, be every where imputed to real Neceſſity.</p>
            <p>BUT then this People would do well to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Whether they are chargeable with no Omiſſions as to their Miniſters; but that they have in all Reſpects a proper Notice taken of them.</p>
            <p>HOW little Regard is paid to the Law of the <hi>Fourth Commandment.</hi> Worldly Concerns too often croud out the Buſineſs of Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Many are late from Home on Saturday-Evenings, who ſhould be with their Families, Reading, Catechiſing and Inſtructing their Children and Servants. And is there not a ſcandalous Neglect of the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002833_0020_0FE672626A4C56B0"/>publick Worſhip upon the Lord's-Day and Lecture-Days, generally through the Land. And then Sabbath-Day Evenings are ſpent by very many in unneceſſary Viſits, vain Company &amp;c. And has not the jealous GOD, jealous of His Sabbath been dreadfully teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying His Abhorrence of ſuch Practices by the Storm and by the Earthquake on the Saturday and Sabbath Evening?</p>
            <p>LET Sabbath-breakers then take theſe aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Admonitions, let them hear and fear and do no more ſo wickedly—</p>
            <p>IS not the <hi>Table of CHRIST neglected,</hi> and thereby His plain Law violated by very many; and is there a due Care taken by Church-Members that they may <hi>worthily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> the conſecrated Elements?</p>
            <p>AND then, are not <hi>Pride, Oppreſſion, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Swearing, Drunkenneſs, Adultery</hi> &amp;c. crying Sins of this People?</p>
            <p>AND now, ſeeing there are all theſe (and many more) <hi>evil Deeds and great Treſpaſſes</hi> to be found amongſt all Orders of Men, we can be at no Loſs for the deſerving Cauſes of GOD's Controverſy with us. This People need not make that Inquiry, <hi>Shew me where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou contendeſt with me?</hi> As if we were wholly in the dark about the Matter, and the Sin like <hi>Achan</hi>'s, was ſome great Secret; when the Reaſons of His Anger are as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002833_0020_0FE672626A4C56B0"/>as the Sun at Noon-Day. And his Anger won't be turned away, but <hi>His Hand will be ſtretched out ſtill,</hi> unleſs theſe Evils are reformed. Which brings me to the <hi>third Particular,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Namely this,</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>THE profeſſing People of GOD may very juſtly expect His awful Viſits by Thunder and Earthquake, ſo long as they perſiſt in Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SEEING Sin is the Cauſe of GOD's Anger, we can't rationally think that He will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to us ſo long as that is unrepented of and perſiſted in, and then what can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from an angry GOD but Thunder and Earthquake &amp;c. His Wrath can't burn againſt a People, but they will be made ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it by ſome terrible Judgment or other. Not to puniſh them, but to own and protect a People that practically diſown Him, would be to patronize their Sin, and take part with His Enemies againſt Himſelf, which ſurely no Man in his Wits would do; much leſs may we ſuppoſe it of GOD only wiſe, and His Throne holy.</p>
            <p>'TIS a mighty Aggravation of Sin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it after a great Variety of Methods uſed by GOD to reclaim us, and what can we expect but that He will ſay of us as He ſaid
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002833_0021_0FE6726291C9CD70"/>of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> he <hi>is joined to Idols, let him alone.</hi> Since he is irreclaimable both by Mercies and Judgments, I will leave him to ſin himſelf into final Ruin.</p>
            <p>IT extremely provokes GOD when a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple harden themſelves in Sin after Judgments, as it directly contradicts his Deſign in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and bids an open Defiance to his Power and Juſtice, and is an implicit chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging the Almighty to do his worſt. The plain Language of ſuch Obſtinacy is that, <hi>I know not the Lord,</hi> neither will I let my Sins go. There is not a more ſad and certain Preſage of Ruin to a People than this, it looks as if GOD had utterly rejected ſuch a People, and had no further uſe to make of them but only to puniſh them, this is plainly intimated by the Prophet <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Confeſſion and Prayer, Ezra 9. <hi>After all that is come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us for our evil Deeds, and great Treſpaſs,</hi> after all the Judgments that are come upon us to reform us, and after all the Mercies that are beſtowed upon us to engage us to thee and Duty, <hi>ſhould we again break thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, — wouldeſt thou not be angry with us till thou hadſt conſumed us, ſo that there ſhould be no remnant nor eſcaping.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> threatned <hi>Judah</hi> with a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Overthrow, for their Contempt of the Tokens of GOD's Anger, Jer. 44.10. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, I will ſet my Face againſt you for Evil, and out off all Judah.</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:002833_0021_0FE6726291C9CD70"/>Which Prediction was anſwered, and they are groaning under the Accompliſhment of it to this very Day.</p>
            <p>AND indeed there ſeems to be a Neceſſity of ſuch a Proceedure with a ſtubborn People, for what elſe can be done with them. To let them alone in their Sins after all, looks diſhonourable to GOD, as if He wanted Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Power to controul their Exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; or to bring them to a ſuitable Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, His Mercy is the only Attribute he can think to glorify by ſuch a Delay, and this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuffers, His Pity and Patience are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, and they are ready to reſolve the Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of his deſtructive Threats into ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe than meer Lenity and Goodneſs, and thus His Power is ſlighted, and the bright Character of his Holineſs is ſlurr'd, as if they were beyond the reach of His Arm, and He could not puniſh them, or He was too much like what they are to have any Diſpoſition to it, ſo that it ſeems to be high time for GOD to pour His Wrath to the uttermoſt upon ſuch a People, and thereby manifeſt that He is a GOD hating Iniquity, and both able and faithful to execute His Threatnings. We are plainly told <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. from ver. 14. to ver. 40. what an incorrigible People may expect from GOD.</p>
            <p>LET not this People then, becauſe they have outliv'd the Earthquake, think their
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002833_0022_0FE67265E1D46A68"/>Danger is over; that Juſtice has no further Work and ſo return to their Sins again. If we are not reformed by the <hi>Threatning,</hi> we have Reaſon to fear being ruin'd by the <hi>Execution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt <hi>Particular</hi> is this</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>THUNDER and Earthquake are loud Calls to Repentance; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of this People is the only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Safety to be taken by us under theſe awful Tokens of GOD's Anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Lord of Hoſts thus beſpeaks the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this People by theſe Providences; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and ſeek thy GOD O Iſrael;</hi> both great and ſmall are comprehended in it, Rulers and ruled, Miniſters and their People, Old and Young, Rich and Poor, Bond and Free. O that he would ſpeak it to all our Hearts, and give us the Grace of Repentance, as well as the Command to repent, and then it ſhall be well with us, both we and our Seed ſhall live.</p>
            <p>HERE are <hi>two Articles</hi> I ſhall briefly ſpeak to,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THUNDER and Earthquake are loud Calls to Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:002833_0022_0FE67265E1D46A68"/>
THE Deſign of GOD in the Earthquake was evidently not to deſtroy, but reclaim us. So that how much ſo ever it carries in it the Face of Wrath, it may eventually prove a great Mercy, if it is not our own Fault. The Fire of Affliction is to conſume our Luſts; <hi>By this ſhall the Iniquity of Jacob be purged.</hi> We are chaſtned of the Lord for our Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. GOD who is rich in Mercy, and does not afflict willingly, would not thus ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify and diſtreſs us, if there was no need of it; if our Forgetfulneſs of Him, and Duty did not call for it. It is to ſhake Sin out of it's Inhabitants, that the Lord ſhaketh thus terribly the Earth.</p>
            <p>HE calls us to think ſericuſly of what we have done againſt Him, to own our Injuſtice in it, and expreſs our Penitence for it. And He expects that we come before him this Day in the moſt humble and ſelf-abaſing Manner, mourning every one for His own Sins, and for the Sins of this People.</p>
            <p>OUR Conſciences are called upon by the Earthquake to do their Office, to charge Sin upon us wherein we have been guilty. That we may <hi>humble our ſelves under the mighty Hand of GOD;</hi> that we may <hi>abhor our ſelves, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes.</hi> The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation from GOD is that, ſoel 2.13. <hi>Blow the Trumpet in Zion, ſanctify a Poſt, call a ſolemn Aſſembly, gather the Children
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002833_0023_0FE6726614158E48"/>and thoſe that ſuck the Breaſts: let the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom go forth of his Chamber, and the Bride out of her Cloſet. Let the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord weep between the Porch and the Altar, and let them ſay, Spare thy People. Turn ye unto me with all your Heart, and with faſting add with weeping, and with mourning, and rent your Heart, and not your Garments, and turn unto the Lord.</hi> Let it not be ſaid of us as of them, Iſai. 22.12, 13. <hi>In that Day did the LORD GOD of Hoſts call to Weeping, and to Mourning, and to Baldneſs, and to girding with Sackcloth. And behold Joy and Gladneſs, ſlaying Oxen, and killing Sheep, eating Fleſh, and drinking Wine; let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die.</hi> This is to pervert the Intention of the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for it is ſent for this End, that we may ſee the Evil and taſte the Bitterneſs of Sin; that our Hearts may be rent both for Sin; and from it; that we may mortify our Luſts, purify our ſelves from all our carnal and ſpiritual Pollutions.</p>
            <p>GOD ſays to us in the <hi>Earthquake,</hi> Sin muſt be parted with, our Pride, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Worldlymindedneſs, Uncharitableneſs, Injuſtice, Intemperance, Senſuality, &amp;c. all Ungodlineſs.</p>
            <p>AND then He calls us to devote our ſelves entirely to Him, to avouch Him for
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002833_0023_0FE6726614158E48"/>our GOD, and firmly reſolve that for the time to come, if He ſhall pleaſe in His great Mercy to ſpare us, we will be obedient to Him in all Things, renouncing all others who claim our Service.</p>
            <p>AND then, He calls us thus to return to Him without Delay, NOW, this preſent Time, and for ought we know, it may be His laſt Call. The Earthquake came upon us ſuddenly and without a Minutes Warning, and it may return upon us as ſuddenly, and with much greater Violence, ſo as to deſtroy us in a Moment.</p>
            <p>IT highly concerns us then to <hi>hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it,</hi> and learn to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves to His preceptive Will in all Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LET the wicked forſake his Way, and the unrighteous Man his Thoughts, and turn unto the Lord.</hi> Let the <hi>Drunkard</hi> leave his <hi>Cups,</hi> the prophane <hi>Swearer</hi> his <hi>Oaths,</hi> the Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and <hi>Unclean</hi> his <hi>Adulteries,</hi> and every ſort of Sinner bid an everlaſting Farewell and Defiance to his Sin whatever it is. If we do thus, we have Reaſon to hope that GOD will ſtay the Progreſs of His Judgment, and turn from His Anger that we periſh not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:002833_0024_0FE6726F2A5ABA48"/>
WHICH brings me to the other Article, viz.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THAT the Reformation of this People is the only Method to avert theſe awful Tokens of GOD's Anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS He has called us to repent by his Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, ſo he has promiſed Mercy to us by his Word upon this Condition, Ezek. 18.30. <hi>Repent, and turn your ſelves from all your Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, ſo Iniquity ſhall not be your Ruin.</hi> Our Repentance has a powerful Influence upon GOD, ſo as that he has obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to forgive the Sins of a penitent People. Iſai. 1.16 —. Hoſ. 14.1, 4. <hi>O Iſrael re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the Lord thy GOD,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will heal their Backſliding —.</hi> But if ye refuſe and rebel ye ſhall be devour'd, the Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it. Which Promiſes are not to be looked upon as limited to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Nation, but extend to all Nations under Heaven, that take Care to fulfil the Conditions that ſupport them. But yet, if any ſhould object againſt theſe Promiſes, I ſhall offer one that is liable to no Exception, Jerem. 18.7, 8. <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it. If that Nation, againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their Evil, I will repent of the Evil that I thought to do unto them.</hi> And then it
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002833_0024_0FE6726F2A5ABA48"/>follow, <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Nation and concerning a Kingdom, to build, and to plant it. If it do Evil in my ſight, that it obey not my Voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I ſaid I would benefit them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM all which appears the abſolute Neceſſity of our Repentance and Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in order to prevent our Ruin, and the infallible Certainty of our Proſperity and Happineſs on this Condition. But without this we ſhall not eſcape his righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>WE ſee then what our Buſineſs is with GOD this Day, and upon what Terms he will hear our Prayers, and ſave this People. The Reply he makes to us now we are ſpreading forth our Hands, and offering up fervent Prayers and ſtrong Cries for Mercy and Salvation, is this, <hi>Repent, Repent, Put away the Evil of your Doings from before mine Eyes,</hi> ceaſe to do Evil, and learn to do well, &amp;c. Which if we do, we may humbly hope that he will hear us, but otherwiſe we pray in Vain, and our Returns will be in Wrath, and not in Mercy.</p>
            <p>AND thus I have finiſhed the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Particulars laid down in the beginning of this Diſcourſe and ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002833_0026_0FE6726F545FD9D0"/>a brief and ſutable Improvement of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LET us all learn then to Reverence the Great GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is the Deſign of the late diſplay of his Power in the Earthquake, and we are ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid indeed if ſo bright an Evidence of a boundleſs Strength, does not produce this Effect. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> obſerves that <hi>when His Judgments are in the Earth, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the World will learn righteouſneſs,</hi> Iſai. 26.9. He has been uttering his mighty Voice not only by Thunder, but from the Earth alſo to excite our Fears and reform our Lives, that we may renounce Sin as our Plague and Miſery; and chuſe him for our higheſt Lord and our only Happineſs, and make an intire and hearty ſurrender and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of our ſelves to Him and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and if we do thus the Conſequence will be happy, the thick and black Cloud of his Anger will blow over, and he will ordain Peace for us.</p>
            <p>THE contemplative and admiring Pſalmiſt ſays, Pſalm 92. <hi>O Lord how great are thy Works, and thy Thoughts are very deep. A bruitiſh Man knoweth not: neither doth a Fool underſtand this.</hi> They are Fools and bruitiſh indeed, who don't take notice of GOD's
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002833_0026_0FE6726F545FD9D0"/>Hand in the Earthquake, but bid Defiance to this Threatning of the ALMIGHTY. Some ſuch hardned Wretches there are, as can let this tremendous Diſpenſation of an angry GOD paſs off, and not be affected with it, when the very Brutes fear and tremble. Surely this is the Temper we ſhould be in, and the Language we ſhould expreſs at ſuch a Time as this, <hi>My Fleſh trembleth for Fear of Thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</hi> Oh! Who is able to ſtand before this GOD? With Him is terrible Majeſty. There is no Creature that has an Arm like Him, neither is there any that hath ever hardned himſelf againſt Him, and proſpered. Fear the Lord all ye his Saints. <hi>Let all the Earth fear Him. Let all the Inhabitants of the World ſtand in awe of Him,</hi> Pſalm 33.8. and 34.9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LET us all bleſs GOD for His great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in ſparing our Lives in the Earthquake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is certainly a very important Article in the Matter of our Praiſes, and the Grace of GOD to us herein we can't ſufficiently admire and celebrate. Let us then deeply impreſs upon our Hearts this great Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, often reflect upon it our ſelves, and ſpeak of it to others with Hearts full of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Gratitude. Let us with holy <hi>David, Call upon our Souls, and all that is within us, to bleſs the Name of the Lord, who
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:002833_0025_0FE67270CCFA5788"/>has redeemed our Lives from Deſtruction,</hi> Pſalm 103. begin.</p>
            <p>LET us ſing with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> after their great Deliverance, Exod. 15.2. <hi>The Lord is my Strength and Song, and He is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my Salvation. He is my GOD, and I will praiſe Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT Cauſe have the <hi>Unregenerate to bleſs GOD that they are alive, and have a little longer Time given them for Repentance?</hi> What a miſerable State did the Earthquake find you in, and if you had died that Moment, what had become of your Souls to all Eternity? <hi>Better had it been for you that you had never been born.</hi> The immediate Conſequence of Death had been Hell and Damnation to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LET us pray earneſtly to GOD to ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Earthquake to us, and accompliſh all the merciful Deſigns of it upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD ſent it doubtleſs for the Prevention and Cure of Sin. Let us pray that this may be the Effect, and this being obtained, let us pray for the Removal of it. 'Tis GOD only can give us help from this Trouble, and quiet the diſturbed Earth. He can ſay Peace, be ſtill, to the natural Cauſe of the Earthquake, and not a ſingle Atom of Duſt
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:002833_0025_0FE67270CCFA5788"/>ſhall any more be diſturbed by it. We hope in the Mercy of GOD, together with his Power to do this for us.</p>
            <p>WE learn by this Earthquake the <hi>great Uncertainty of all worldly Things, and the great Folly of Men in placing their Happineſs in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SINCE the Earth may ſink, and fail us in a Moment which has the greateſt Stability of any Thing here, what Dependance can there be upon other Things more liable to periſh?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HOW happy are all thoſe who in ſuch a Time as this have Peace with GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SUCH Perſons are above all juſt Fears and Dangers from an Earthquake, and may triumph with the Pſalmiſt, Pſalm 46.1, 2, 3. <hi>GOD is our Refuge and Strength: a very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent help in Trouble. Therefore will not we Fear, though the Earth be removed: and though the Mountains be carried into the midſt of the Sea. Though the Waters thereof roar, and be troubled, though the Mountains ſhake with the ſwelling thereof.</hi> No Calamity can hurt a good Man; his Faith and his Hope are as an Anchor within the Vail, and he is ſecure in the midſt of all Storms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:002833_0027_0FE67270F90CC450"/>
BUT what have Sinners to ſupport them when <hi>GOD above</hi> them is in this terrible Manner teſtifying his Anger againſt them, and the <hi>Earth under them</hi> is ſinking and leaving them? O deplorable State! A CHRIST in ſuch an Hour is worth infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Worlds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THIS Earthquake may ſerve to ſtrengthen our Faith in the great and important Doctrine of the Reſurrection, ſo far as Concerns the Power of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR certainly it requires a much greater Degree of Power thus to ſhake the Earth, than to call up a dead Body from the Grave. A Specimen of the general Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection we have had by an Earthquake: Matth. 27.51, 52. <hi>And behold, the Vail of the Temple was rent in twain, from the Top to the Bottom, and the Earth did quake, and the Rocks rent, And the Graves were opened, and many Bodies of Saints which ſlept, aroſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET the ſhaking Earth remind us of the <hi>Things that cannot be ſhaken. The World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove is a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken.</hi> The Inhabitants there are unchangeably happy.</p>
            <p>THIS World's glory paſſeth away. The <hi>Earth</hi> is nigh unto <hi>burning,</hi> and all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:002833_0027_0FE67270F90CC450"/>Works both of Nature and Art ſhall be deſtroyed, but the <hi>third Heaven</hi> is an <hi>enduring Subſtance;</hi> a Treaſure there we are in no danger of loſing.</p>
            <p>'TIS the Song of the Bleſſed, <hi>This GOD is our GOD for ever and ever;</hi> And that it may be our Song, GOD of his infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy grant unto us for the ſake of JESUS CHRIST. <hi>Amen.</hi>
