            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TWO motives, principally, have induced me to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the following diſcourſe; the one is, that thoſe who diſapproved of certain parts may have an opportunity of giving them a ſecond and diſpaſſionate conſideration; the other is, that the ſentiments advanced appear to me highly ſeaſonable, and ought to be diffuſed as extenſively as poſſible. The diſcourſe is printed, <hi>word for word,</hi> as it was written in the firſt copy; and only three ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, which will be found marked, were forgotten at the time of delivery. This is mentioned to apologize for the inaccuracies which will occur, and which would have been corrected, had it not been judged beſt ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly to adhere to the very words, which all who were preſent can be called to atteſt.—The notes are entirely added.</p>
            <p>There are ſome general objections which have been made to the diſcourſe, of which it may be proper here to take a little notice. It has been ſaid, that the ſentiments are different from thoſe contained in other publications of mine, particularly in the "Signs of the Times."
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:034003_0003_0FF9F42F4609E600"/>That publication was made in 1794, and is the lateſt which can be alledged againſt me. The ſcope of that performance I ſtill heartily approve. If, in proſecuting my main object, I expreſſed ſanguine expectations from the revolution in France, both as to herſelf and to the world, thouſands, in all countries, at the time, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſame, and have been equally diſappointed. If the French nation have departed from their original prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, I am not obliged to follow them. I will be no advocate for enormities unequalled in the annals of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; for principles which ſubvert all religion, morality and order, and which threaten to involve us, with the whole human race, in the utmoſt confuſion and miſery. Whatever may be the deſigns of God in theſe convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and though they ſhall certainly be made ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his glory, yet we muſt not countenance or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the wickedneſs of the inſtruments.</p>
            <p>Again; it has been ſaid, that it is improper to carry polities into the pulpit. This is a ſaying to which many have no preciſe idea affixed. If they mean, that it is improper to diſcuſs political queſtions, and to eſpouſe a particular party, they have reaſon on their ſide. But, if they mean, that the love of country, the duty of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and obedience to lawful government, have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with religion, and that a Preacher ought not to inculcate theſe, I <hi>have not ſo learned Chriſt.</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, morality, and obedience to government, are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably connected. The true chriſtian faithfully and conſcientiouſly endeavours to perſorm all the duties of
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:034003_0004_0FF9C971C2EA3F10"/>his ſeveral ſtations and relations. The apoſtles were not politicians, and yet we find them ſtrongly enjoining the duties which we owe as members of civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>Again; it has been ſaid, that the diſcourſe, admitting that it contains nothing but the truth, is not adapted to the occaſion, and is alſo culpable for an imprudent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of ſentiments. As to the charge of unſeaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, what can be more ſeaſonable, on ſuch a day, than to point out thoſe ſins which are the cauſe of divine judgments? Were we not called to confeſs and forſake theſe? Deplorable muſt be our ſituation, if we cannot bear even a recital of them. But, why ſpeak ſo much about France? Becauſe the danger from France was the very occaſion of our faſting; her ſins prevail among us; and her miſeries exhibit to us an awfully inſtructive leſſon.</p>
            <p>As to imprudence, I have only to ſay, that the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſeemed to demand great plainneſs and faithfulneſs. I become more convinced that ſilence has been kept too long, and that to perſiſt in it will be attended with the moſt fatal conſequences. Our enemies have already gotten too faſt a hold; and they wiſh for nothing but to retain us in blindneſs and lukewarmneſs to accompliſh our ruin. The ſhock which the diſcourſe, as was to be expected, gave to ſome, will eventually prove bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial. I anticipate the time when what is ſaid will be thought moderate; when I ſhall be commended rather than cenſured; and I am contented to wait. The views of France are diſcloſing daily, and the film removing
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:034003_0005_0FF9F4351AC6A128"/>from our eyes. If, however, I am miſtaken in all this, the charitable will impute the error to the head, and not to the heart, for I have no other intereſt than the beſt welfare of men. I love my God, I love my country, and I love my enemies.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>JOSHUA vii. 13.</bibl>
                  <p>Up, ſanctify the people, and ſay, Sanctify yourſelves againſt to-morrow; for thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, There is an accurſed thing in the midſt of thee, O Iſrael: thou canſt not ſtand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accurſed thing from among you.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE ſlighteſt conſideration of the occaſion of theſe words, will ſhow that they are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly choſen as the ſubject of diſcourſe on this day. Notwithſtanding the expreſs command of God to the children of Iſrael, to ſave nothing for their own uſe in the deſtruction of Jericho, a man, named Achan, had taken from <q>among the ſpoils a goodly Babyloniſh garment, and two hundred ſhekels of ſilver, and a wedge of gold of fifty ſhekels, and hid them in his tent.</q> When they, afterwards, went up againſt Ai, God
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034003_0007_0FF9F4369E254900"/>manifeſted his diſpleaſure for the diſobedience, by ſuffering their enemies to prevail. This great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcouraged the people, and afflicted Joſhua. He humbled himſelf before God, and earneſtly intreated his interpoſition. Joſhua was then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the true cauſe of the calamity; and that, until reparation was made, the divine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance would be withheld.</p>
            <p>Although only one man was particularly charged, yet all are repreſented as having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a treſpaſs, and they ſhared in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Others might have been guilty; or, at leaſt, have had covetous deſires, or have concealed what was done. But, if neither of theſe be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the precedent was extremely dangerous, and the community, of which the individual was a member, were to be conſidered as partakers of the ſin, unleſs it was openly diſclaimed.</p>
            <p>The application of the text to our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as a nation, is natural and eaſy. For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years paſt, one calamity has ſucceeded an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, with little intermiſſion, or we have been kept in a ſtate of alarm. Though the cloud has not always burſt, yet it has been continually hanging over us. All who acknowledge the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence and government of God, muſt believe that theſe things befal us by his direction, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034003_0008_0FF9F439BB1B06F8"/>are tokens of his anger. <q>He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</q> There is an <hi>accurſed thing</hi> in the midſt of us. Why have we ſuffered by fires? Becauſe of our ſins. Why have we fallen by peſtilence? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our ſins. Why have we been threatened with war? Becauſe of our ſins. Without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, an entire removal of judgments is not to be expected. The rod may be taken away for a time, but it will return with double force. Puniſhments will follow ſins, as ſure as juſtice and judgment are the habitation of the eternal throne.</p>
            <p>Danger impends, at preſent, from a quarter of which we had not once the ſmalleſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and of which we may not yet be ſufficiently aware. It was hardly to be conceived, that ſo diſtant as we are from the ſcene of blood, ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of peace, and deſirous of doing juſtice to all nations, any circumſtances ſhould ariſe to involve us. We fondly dreamed, that the mighty craſh of kingdoms would be like thunder heard remote. Leaſt of all was it to be ſuſpected, that a nation to whom we were enthuſiaſtically attached, at whoſe victories we have rejoiced, whoſe crimes we have palliated, and whoſe injuries we have borne, ſhould meditate our deſtruction. But, as they
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034003_0009_0FF9C977D7B52EF0"/>are the inſtrument, in the hand of God, for chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing the inhabitants of the old world for their iniquities, ſo they may be likewiſe uſed for our correction; or, he may mercifully intend to force us to a diſtance from them, to <q>come out from them, that we be not partakers of their ſins, and that we receive not of their plagues.</q> Though there is reaſon to hope, from the uſual diſpenſations of Providence, that we are not doomed to ruin, and that we ſhall not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in the calamities of other nations, yet we may not eſcape unpuniſhed. Numerous and aggravated as our offences are, we have not <q>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the beaſt;</q> and, rapid as our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs has been in vice, we have not arrived at that height in which the righteous Governor of the univerſe gives command, <q>to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is a matter, my brethren, of the moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and intereſting inquiry, what thoſe ſins are, among us, with which God is juſtly diſpleaſed. To determine on theſe, we muſt conſider the ſins which abound in the community, are the moſt deſtructive of its peace and order, and which have been invariably puniſhed. Theſe appear to be—the inattention to family inſtruction and government—the neglect of the ordinances of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034003_0010_0FF9F42C10A133C0"/>divine worſhip, and of the due obſervance of the Sabbath—the abuſe of temporal proſperity—the prevalence of infidelity—and the want of union. Other things might be particularized, but theſe are the principal, and more than will admit of a full diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>Think not that I unreaſonably detain you by remarking, that it is impoſſible to ſpeak, on an occaſion like this, ſo as to ſatisfy all. If the duty of faſting and prayer be handled only in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ſome will blame the Preacher for trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; and he may even fall under the charge of unfaithfulneſs. If he touch on public affairs, then ſome will ſay, that he carries politics into the pulpit, and ſides with a party. The beſt way is, to preſerve a good conſcience; neither to invite unneceſſarily the reſentment of the world, nor to diſſemble, ſhould it enſure the richeſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
            <p>FIRST, The inattention to family inſtruction and government is an evil we have to deplore. It is a ſign of the decay of religion, and has moſt pernicious effects. Were perſons rightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the importance of divine things, they would be ſolicitous for the beſt welfare of thoſe whom Providence has committed to their care. In this reſpect, Abraham was a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034003_0011_0FF9F43B783F8D28"/>"I know him," ſaith God, <q>that he will command his children and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgment.</q> How few, at this day, deſerve this glorious teſtimony! Who copy this illuſtrious pattern! Many act as though nothing more was required than to give their children human learning, and provide for their advancement to riches or honors: whereas, their happineſs, and their ſervice to ſociety, depend much more on a religious education, and habits of induſtry and virtue, than on the fineſt talents, and the moſt improved underſtandings. What are all human acquirements, without a ſound faith to direct? What can parents ſubſtitute as an equivalent for this? <q>What is a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</q> It is by early inſtruction in families, the force of good example, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent diſcipline, that perſons are formed to be uſeful members in both Church and State. The influence of theſe is felt through the whole courſe of life. <q>Train up a child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On the contrary, when children are permitted to grow up without pious inſtruction, and to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034003_0012_0FF9F4416E70E2B0"/>follow, without reſtraint, their own inclinations, they are likely to bring diſgrace upon themſelves, and ruin to ſociety. The very foundations of order and morality are deſtroyed. Nor is the evil confined to the generation in which they live, but reaches to ſucceſſive ones. Who is to teach when all are ignorant? What hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains when the whole maſs is corrupted?</p>
            <p>We feel the diſmal conſequences of our neglect in this country, and, unleſs a ſpeedy remedy is applied, muſt feel them yet more ſeverely. To this is greatly to be aſcribed thoſe dangerous principles, and thoſe diſſolute manners, which prevail. The untutored youth is prone to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſuggeſtions of infidelity, and run into the utmoſt licentiouſneſs. When his mind is not ſtored with divine truths, and he is unacquainted with the holy ſcriptures, or the evidence with which they are ſupported, he is eaſily perſuaded to reject their authority. It may be well queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, whether the excluſion of the bible, as a ſchool-book, is not highly improper. Children, by learning to read in this, obtain a knowledge of its contents, which they may never otherwiſe obtain. Many of its hiſtorical parts, its para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and its precepts, make an indelible impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon them.</p>

The importance of a religious education ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the injunction given to the children of Iſrael. <q>Theſe words, which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thine heart: and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou fitteſt in thine houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</q> The apoſtle alſo exhorts fathers to <q>bring their children up in the nurture and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Lord.</q> The lamentable fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure in what has been mentioned, is connected,</p>

It cannot be ſuppoſed, that thoſe who neglect divine worſhip pay a proper reſpect to the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. No; many of them ſpend the time ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in tranſacting their worldly buſineſs, or in vain amuſements. They not only omit religious exerciſes, but engage in what is a direct profana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the day. Too frequently, even with thoſe who profeſs to reverence the command of God, are worldly converſation, criminal indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and unneceſſary viſits, indulged. This is one of the reigning ſins, and for which the Lord has a controverſy with us.</p>
            <p>That this is a ſin which brings judgments upon a people, is apparent from the dealings of God towards the children of Iſrael, and his many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations. Their proſperity and adverſity, as a nation, depended on the regard which they paid to the Sabbath. This charge is often brought againſt them; <q>My ſabbaths they greatly pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted.</q> No leſs than three times does it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the ſame chapter, with a puniſhment denounced; <q>I ſaid, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderneſs, to conſume them.</q> It is mentioned as a ſign of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034003_0016_0FF9F44A98ACC5C0"/>that they ſaid, <q>When will the new moon be gone, that we may ſell corn, and the ſabbath, that we may ſet forth wheat.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As the profanation of the ſabbath drew down the divine diſpleaſure, ſo, for the ſanctification of it, bleſſings were promiſed. <q>Bleſſed is the man that keepeth the ſabbath from polluting it.</q> Again; <q>If thou turn away thy foot from the ſabbath, from doing thy pleaſure on my holy day; and call the ſabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honorable; and ſhalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleaſure, nor ſpeaking thine own words, then ſhalt thou delight thyſelf in the LORD, and I will cauſe thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob, thy father; for the mouth of the LORD hath ſpoken it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Who but might have anticipated the growing corruption of that nation, and its fearful calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which blotted the ſabbath from the week! which aboliſhed all times and forms of religious worſhip! This opened the floodgates of vice, and kindled the anger of the Lord againſt them. Not contented with removing ſuperſtition, and correcting abuſes, they inſidiouſly endeavoured to overturn the Chriſtian religion itſelf. To ſay
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034003_0017_0FF9F450A1F21040"/>nothing of the monſtrous wickedneſs, there was an extreme folly in their conduct. Of what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage their diviſion of time? How vain to imagine that it can long continue, even among themſelves; much more, that it will be adopted by others? Their intention was, evidently, to deſtroy religion; for they knew that while aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies were held for worſhip on the ſabbath, there would be a memorial of Chriſt, and a teſtimony in favour of divine revelation.<note n="*" place="bottom">The conduct of the French rulers cannot be better ſtated, than in the words of an author (Wright) already quoted. <q>They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly forbade the public worſhip of the God of the univerſe. They began with aboliſhing the ſabbath day as a day to be kept holy to the Lord. They ordered the doors of the ſeveral churches to be kept ſhut on the Lord's day. They ordered the ſhops to be kept open on that holy day; and they permitted every ſort of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to be tranſacted on the ſabbath day as on the other days of the week. Nay, they even impriſoned ſome of the people, who, from reverence for God, and from the force of religious educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and cuſtoms,</q> &amp;c.
<p>
                     <q>In order to carry this infamous decree into full effect, or in order to obliterate the very remembrance of the ſabbath day, they changed the old calendar, and they formed a new one; wherein, inſtead of a week conſiſting of ſeven days, they have ſubſtituted what they call a Decade, or a portion of time conſiſting of ten days, three of which are to conſtitute a month. And even to the months of the year they have given new names.</q>— <q>This act of the French legiſlature, aboliſhing the obſervance of the ſabbath day as a day to be kept holy to the Lord, might be ſhewn to be an inſtance of the moſt ſhocking profanity, and of the moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous policy. It is a decree moſt deteſtable, both in a civil and in a religious view.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have expreſſed my doubt of the continuance of their diviſion of time, on the principle of the difficulty to change old habits, and that God would ſpeedily avenge the contempt of his authority. If, however, it ſhould be permitted to continue ſo long as that the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſabbath will be forgotten in France, who but muſt deplore their awful fate?</p>

The ſame attempt to bring the ſabbath into diſcredit, has been made, by ſome, with us. Publications have appeared for the purpoſe of ſhowing, that it is not of divine inſtitution, and that the obſervance of it is improper. Different as opinions may be about the utility of a legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative act on this ſubject, it is certain, that the neglect of the ſabbath is an evil, in a political view, as it corrupts the morals of men, and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately endangers the peace of ſociety. Where-ever a diſregard to the ſabbath becomes univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, there can be no religion, no morality, and no ſafe government.<note n="*" place="bottom">It was to be expected, that ſo enlightened a ſtateſman, and one who ſo conſtantly enforces religion by his own example, as the worthy Governor of New-York, would not be inattentive to this ſubject. In his ſpeech to the legiſlature, at the opening of the laſt ſeſſion, he ſays, <q>There is alſo much reaſon to regret, that more reſpect is not generally paid to the injunctions of the act relative to Sunday. If the ſabbath be, as I am convinced it is, of divine appointment, this ſubject ought not to be regarded with indifference.</q>
                  <p>Though the advocates for a bill on this ſubject could not obtain one ſo ſtrict as they wiſhed, yet one was carried reſtraining certain immoralities.</p>
               </note> Let me mention,</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, That we have abuſed our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral proſperity. Since the eſtabliſhment of the new conſtitution, the proſperity of this country has been rapid and unexampled. The neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034003_0019_0FF9C982628806E0"/>with reſpect to contending powers, which was early taken, the wiſdom, the impartiality, and the firmneſs of adminiſtration, have, under the bleſſing of heaven, highly advanced us.</p>
            <p>But this proſperity has been made the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin. We have turned our liberty into licentiouſneſs; for the richeſt bounties we have repaid ingratitude and diſcontent; we have been ſeized with the deſire of ſuddenly amaſſing wealth; we have been led into criminal ſpeculation; and ſucceſs has adminiſtered to our luxury and our pleaſures. The expenſiveneſs of public build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the variety of amuſements, and the ſtyle of living, are far beyond what ſimplicity, ſobriety, and prudence, ought to have dictated. We have cleaved to the gifts, and forgotten the giver; we have uſed them as our own, and not improved them for his glory; we have acted as though we were to continue here always, and there was no future ſtate of account.</p>
            <p>The almighty Rule, by his preſent diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, gives us a ſalutary check, teaches us to feel and acknowledge his ſuperintending providence, and the obligations which we owe him. Long continued proſperity is dangerous both to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals and ſocieties. <q>Jeſhurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034003_0020_0FF9F45403CB2D18"/>thick, thou art covered with fatneſs: then he forſook God which made him, and lightly eſteemed the Rock of his ſalvation.</q> I haſten to ſay,</p>
            <p>IN THE FOURTH PLACE, That the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of infidelity is a cauſe of divine judgments. Not many years ago, a profeſſed deiſt, in this country, was rare. If any doubted, they were aſhamed to avow it, and they had ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency as not to ridicule what the generality of mankind held ſacred. But infidelity is now no longer concealed. Its advocates are numerous, and propagate their ſentiments with a brazen front. Formerly, ſome of the moſt celebrated infidels attacked the Chriſtian religion indirectly; but we have ſeen it repreſented as a fable not even <hi>cunningly</hi> deviſed, as deſtructive of morality, and the ſource of innumerable miſeries. We have ſeen it loaded with all manner of reproach, and a bold attempt made to eradicate it from the earth. From an American preſs have iſſued the moſt horrid blaſphemies which have ever been uttered. From an American preſs iſſued the firſt part of the "Age of Reaſon;" and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part was re-printed here; a multitude of copies were imported, and circulated with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common induſtry. Surely, if our ports be ſhut,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034003_0021_0FF9F45A163FC530"/>it ſhould be againſt ſuch principles as theſe. Were it poſſible to lay an embargo on them in the country from which they come, it ought to be done; for they are infinitely more to be dreaded than all the fleets and armies of Europe.</p>
            <p>Perhaps we may date the growth of infidelity among us, from the entrance of the French army. While they brought us the aſſiſtance we deſired, and accelerated our independence, they leavened us with ungodlineſs; and it may yet be ſaid of us, <q>The ſtrength of Pharaoh ſhall be your ſhame, and the truſt in the ſhadow of Egypt your confuſion.</q> Deiſm and atheiſm have long been propagated among that people, and at their revolution appeared in full maturity. Their very Clergy, the profeſſed Miniſters of the religion of Chriſt, headed by the Archbiſhop of Paris, came before the National Convention, and abjured the Chriſtian religion, declaring that they conſidered it as an impoſture. What elſe but horrid deeds were to be expected from thoſe who gloried in the confeſſion of their hypocriſy? What confidence can be placed in thoſe who defy the Majeſty of heaven and earth?<note n="*" place="bottom">It is not intended, by any thing in this paragraph, to condemn the alliance with France, or to detract from the aſſiſtance which ſhe afforded. Due credit and gratitude are acknowledged here, and in other parts of the diſcourſe. But the alliance may, notwithſtanding, by an unreaſonable partiality on our part, by an exaltation of France in the ſtead of God, and by evil communication, prove the mean of the greateſt injury to us. As to the opinion, that the growth of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity was promoted by the French army, it is my own; and I have expreſſed it with diffidence. I think that ſome influence is to be aſcribed to them. The French officers had drank deep of a vain philoſophy; and I remember to have heard it ſaid, that they were generally mathematicians and deiſts.—The alarming prevalence of infidelity in France is atteſted in the fulleſt manner. Let me quote only the words of a late writer. <q>On the 19th of November, 1793, the Archbiſhop of Paris came to the bar of the aſſembly, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by his Vicar and eleven other Clergymen, who there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their Chriſtianity and their clerical vows; acknowledging that they had played the villain for many year againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, teaching what they knew to be a lie, and were now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be honeſt men.</q> Note, p. 280, Philadelphia edition, of a book entitled, <q>Proofs of a Conſpiracy againſt all the Religions and Governments of Europe, carried on in the ſecret meetings of Free-Maſons, Illuminati, and Reading Societies. Collected from good Authorities, by John Robiſon, A. M. Profeſſor of Natural Philoſophy, and Secretary to the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</q> This book is now re-printing, by Mr. George Forman, in this city, and deſerves the higheſt attention. It diſplays an aſtoniſhing ſcene of wickedneſs, and is peculiarly calculated to open the eyes of all on thoſe horrid principles which have been ſo induſtriouſly propagated in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, have ſo deeply penetrated the French nation, hurried them into their exceſſes, and plunged them into their miſeries.</note>

There is, however, a more cloſe alliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the principles of infidelity and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of government than many apprehend. How are we to account for the fact, that many of thoſe who bluſter about the mal-conduct of men in office, are avowed unbelievers? It is not meant to alledge, that all who are wild with falſe notions of liberty are in this claſs; or that none of the friends of tyranny are liable to the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:034003_0023_0FF9F45D1E571700"/>imputation; but that the moſt furious advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for what they call the rights of man, are generally notorious infidels. There is a connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the two, and it is well underſtood by ſome of theſe men. It has been practiſed upon us. What was the main object of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication already mentioned? Beſides the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of a ridiculous vanity, it was to produce a revolution; and it would have infallibly done this, had the principles pervaded the bulk of the citizens. This happy nation would now have been in the ſame unſettled, confuſed, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſtate of France. The vain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible author thought he had accompliſhed the end, and that nothing more was neceſſary than to blow the trumpet of ſedition, in his ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous letter to our chief magiſtrate, at that time, and the firſt man in the world. When we ſee ſo much ignorance, miſrepreſentation, and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, employed by a perſon againſt the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we may well ſuſpect his political creed, and cannot ſafely reſign ourſelves to his direction.<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſee nothing in this paragraph which I wiſh to retract. I have only ſaid what is fact, that <hi>many</hi> mal-contents avow themſelves to be infidels; that the moſt furious of them were <hi>generally</hi> ſuch. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ſome ſerious profeſſors of religion is accounted for on other principles. To ſhow that what I have ſtated is the caſe abroad as well as at home, hear the words of Dr. Watſon, Biſhop of Landaff, in his late elegant and animated <q>Addreſs to the People of Great-Britain. "It is here ſuppoſed," ſays he, "that the enemies of religion are alſo the enemies of government, but this muſt be underſtood with ſome reſtriction. There are, it may be ſaid, many deiſts in this country, who are ſenſible of the advantages of a regular government, and who would be as unwilling as the moſt orthodox believers in the kingdom, that our own ſhould be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. This may be true, but it is true alſo, that they who wiſh to overthrown the government are not only, generally ſpeaking, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers themſelves, but that they found their hopes of ſucceſs in the infidelity of the common people. They are ſenſible that no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment can long ſubſiſt, if the bulk of the people have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for a ſupreme being, no fear of perjury, no apprehenſion of futurity, no check from conſcience; and foreſeeing the rapine, devaſtation and bloodſhed, which uſually attend the laſt convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of a ſtate ſtruggling for its political exiſtence, they wiſh to prepare proper actors for this dreadful cataſtrophe, by brutalizing mankind; for it is by religion more than by any other principle of human nature, that men are diſtinguiſhed from brutes.</q> As to the leading object of Thomas Paine, I have expreſſed an opinion. It is certain that his principles directly tend to confuſion, and every evil work. Any favorable mention which I may have made of this man, I wiſh to be obliterated and forgotten.</note>

As to the connection between licentious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions upon religion and upon government, a late writer, who includes the diſciples of Socinus, gives the following account: <q>We may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,  ſays he, "that they who, denying the neceſſity of a propitiatory ſacrifice, preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly lay claim to eternal happineſs upon the ground of their own merit; and who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade the character of the divine Jeſus into that of mere man, ſhould endeavour to deſtroy all ſuperiority in their fellow-creatures, and ſeek the gratification of their pride in the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034003_0025_0FF9F4619B4811E0"/>of all worldly diſtinctions. The ſame captious and reſtleſs ſpirit, which leads men to cavil at the articles of our religious faith, and to reject the myſteries of the goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſurpaſs their comprehenſion, cauſes them to be diſſatisfied with our civil conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to repreſent its eſſential parts as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and dangerous, becauſe they do not agree with their own imaginary ideas of unattaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perfection. We here obſerve the ſame temper of mind directed to different objects, a ſimilar error in judging of the diſpenſations of God, and of the inſtitutions of men: and this natural alliance between certain opinions in matters of Church and State, can alone ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for events.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Pretyman's Charge to the Clergy.</note>
               </q> This is the only ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution I have ſeen attempted of a fact which has frequently occurred to my mind, and it appears to be a rational one. Let me add, that as ſome, led away by the names of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, liberality, and free inquiry, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed into lax doctrines in religion, ſo there are ſome who, deceived by the names of liberty and equality, embrace principles utterly ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of all peace and order.

"Ye ſhall not die," ſays the ſubtile ſerpent; "the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is arbitrary; aſſert your <hi>liberty;</hi> eat, and ye ſhall be upon an <hi>equality</hi> with gods."

            <p>Did time admit, it might be ſhown, that ſome form of religion is abſolutely neceſſary for the ſupport of civil government; that there never was a civilized nation without ceremonies of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; that the neceſſity of them is declared by heathen writers, and acknowledged by atheiſts themſelves; and that the preſent appearance in France is monſtrous; and ſo long as it exiſts, revolution muſt ſucceed revolution, torrents of blood flow after torrents, and the wretched inhabitants become a terror to themſelves and all around them.

<p>The declaration of infidels, that religion is the invention of kings and prieſts, is a plain confeſſion of its utility in ſupporting civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. All the ancient ſages and lawgivers were of one opinion on this point. Cicero ſays, in his Treatiſe de Nat.

Atque hand ſcio, an pietate adverſus Deos ſublatâ, fides etiam, et ſocietas humani generis, et una excellentiſſima virtus juſtitia, tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latur.</q> To the neceſſity of religion, Preſident Waſhington has borne ample teſtimony, in his moſt excellent addreſs on his reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; an addreſs fraught with political wiſdom, and which, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and manner, is worthy the pen of the greateſt philoſopher and ſtateſman in the world. "Of all the diſpoſitions and habits," ſays he, <q>which lead to political proſperity, religion and morality are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable ſupports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotiſm, who ſhould labour to ſubvert theſe great pillars of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man happineſs, theſe firmeſt props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to reſpect and to cheriſh them. A volume could not trace all their connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with private and public felicity. Let it ſimply be aſked, were is the ſecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if the ſenſe of religious obligation deſert the oaths, which are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of inveſtigation in courts of juſtice? And let us with caution indulge the ſuppoſition, that morality can be maintained without religion.</q>—If the heathen found their religious inſtitutions and worſhip abſolutely neceſſary, and highly beneficial, what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages are to be expected from the profeſſion and influence of the true religion? "There was never found," ſays the great Lord Bacon, who may be ſet againſt an hoſt of infidels, <q>in any age of the world, either philoſophy, or ſect, or religion, which did ſo highly exalt the public good, as the Chriſtian Faith.</q>—The French legiſlators have not ſatisfied themſelves with renouncing revealed religion, but have endeavoured to deſtroy natural religion itſelf. They have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the being of God and his providence; that there is any future ſtate of exiſtence; declared death to be an eternal ſleep; and ſet up, as objects of worſhip, Reaſon and Liberty.</p>

ONCE MORE, The want of union as a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful evil. The diviſion of profeſſing chriſtians is not now intended. On this, you are in full poſſeſſion of my ſentiments; but I refer to that party ſpirit which has diſgraced and diſtracted our public councils. <q>We cannot ſtand before our enemies until we take away this accurſed thing from among us.<note n="*" place="bottom">There is no part of the diſcourſe in which an addition might be made more advantageouſly than here. There might be pointed out, in a religious view, the baneful effects of the indulgence of party ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and diſunion; in that it weakens the ſavour of divine things; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſes the mind with objects foreign to its peace and happineſs; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys charity to our neighbour; and excites malevolent paſſions in the breaſt. Such conſiderations ought to have great weight with thoſe who <q>exerciſe themſelves to have always conſciences void of offence toward God and toward men.</q> I am happy in being able to ſay, with truth, that I bear no hatred, and wiſh no injury to thoſe who may differ from me in ſentiment; yea, that I cordially eſteem ſome of theſe; and that, if any ſpeak ill of me, and manifeſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I can forgive, as I hope to be forgiven, and quietly commit myſelf to him who judgeth righteouſly.</note>

            <p>There are ſome who continually blame the meaſures of government for plunging us into the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034003_0029_0FF9F46A874BA918"/>preſent difficulties; who impute to our rulers enmity to France, and partiality to Britain; who publicly alledge, that it has been the ſyſtem to break with the one, and to join the other. But the ſecret is laid open; it is DISUNION. This has leſſened us in the eyes of our enemies, and encouraged them in their repeated inſults. This had led them to attempt a ſeparation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the government, and to think that their late inſolent demands would be ſucceſsful; yea, to threaten, that unleſs we complied, their veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels would ravage our coaſts, and we would ſhare the fare of other nations which they have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. What was ſome time ago made the pretext for hoſtile meaſures, was not ſo much as hinted to our meſſengers of peace; but all their requiſitions are enforced by an appeal to our weakneſs, and this weakneſs ariſing from friends here on whom they reckon. O France! at thy firſt revolution our hearts beat high with expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for thy help in our need, we felt the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſt gratitude; when thou waſt environed by numerous hoſts, we alone acknowledged thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public; and when thou didſt complain, we ſent an honorable embaſſy renew and ſtrengthen the bands of peace. Is it thus thou requiteſt us?</p>

Nothing is more eaſy and common than to find fault with meaſures, when they prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful. Perhaps the error, if there be any, is in not having ſpoken, from the firſt, in a bold and decided tone to whatever nation ſought to impoſe upon us. Peace, ſo neceſſary and deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, was the great object; it has been protract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if, at laſt, we are obliged to repel ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions by force, we may confidently appeal to Him who "ruleth in the kingdom of men."<note n="*" place="bottom">The three preceding ſentences are thoſe mentioned in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to have been forgotten at the delivery of the Diſcourſe. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will allow himſelf to reflect ſeriouſly, muſt ſee how oppoſite has been the conduct of Britain and of France in accommodating their differences with us. The firſt immediately honored our Envoy, and entered into negociation; the latter has treated us with ſtudied contempt. No one can ſay that Britain had not received ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, and had not juſt cauſe to fear as to the part we would act; and yet had ſhe behaved like the other, there would have been but one voice in America. With reſpect to a connection with foreign powers, it will ever involve us in difficulties. How proper the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of Preſident Waſhington on this head:—<q>The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little <hi>political</hi> connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as poſſible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us ſtop</q>

            <p>Happily, union in the means of ſelf-defence is daily gaining ground, in proportion as the tranſactions are underſtood. The queſtion is not now about a form of government, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall govern ourſelves. It is not, whether the moſt proper meaſures have been purſued to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:034003_0031_0FF9C98B76059AE8"/>obtain peace, but what is the effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. THE CONTEST IS FOR NATIONAL SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEREIGNTY AND INDEPENDENCE. Spirit of ſeventy-ſix, whither art thou fled? Where the ſpirit that declared, <q>We never will ſubmit to be hewers of wood, or drawers of water, for any miniſtry and nation in the world.</q> Did unanimity and vigor once appear in our public councils, our enemies would relinquiſh their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as idle, or, if they did not, would be covered with ſhame and confuſion. Even the unparalleled conqueror of Italy would have the laurels ſnatched from his brow, and be covered with willows.</p>
            <p>War is, indeed, a dreadful calamity. It is juſtifiable on no principle but that of ſelf-defence. Through the kind interpoſition of Heaven, it was averted, when, a few years ago, it ſeemed to be at hand. Negociation was ſucceſsful. Negociation has been tried again—open—fair— and liberal. It has been ſpurned. Money has been demanded, but no ſecurity given for peace. Sums have been fixed, but accompanied with a hint, that more would be expected. What aſſurance that ſuch rapacity would ever be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? To hearken to theſe claims is diſgrace, to comply with them is death. Look at Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:034003_0032_0FF9F47189493E38"/>at Belgium, at Switzerland. Look, above all, at Holland, the country of your anceſtors, and if you inherit a drop of blood from thoſe brave Dutchmen who, in former years, ſo nobly aſſerted their privileges—Holland, the ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of the world, the nurſery of arts, learning and religion, has loſt her eminence among the nations. She is dictated to, exhauſted by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, her youth infected with infidelity, her commerce annihilated, and is little better than a province of France. How is the glory departed ſince the admiſſion of a foreign maſter! How ignoble do men become when they willingly ſtoop to oppreſſion! They are like aſſes couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down under their burdens.</p>
            <p>I have not ſpecified among our ſins gaming, tipling, profane ſwearing, railing, lying, and other immoralities. They are the native fruits of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, and abuſed proſperity. Nor has there been taken into the enumeration, the retention of a multitude of our fellow-creatures in ſlavery. Beſides, that this could not be ſo fully ſtated as it ought, there are many circumſtances which forbid it. Prudence may condemn the moſt diſtant reference, but conſcience remonſtrates againſt an entire ſilence We know where we are moſt vulnerable; and melancholy is the tale
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:034003_0033_0FF9C9901963C568"/>of St. Domingo. O thou Judge of the earth! incline us to do all the juſtice we can, and when thou viſiteſt <q>the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,</q> in wrath remember mercy!</p>
            <p>HAVING conſidered the ſins moſt prevalent among us, let us ſincerely confeſs and forſake them. This is the important duty for which our excellent Preſident has recommended to us to aſſemble on this day. He, impreſſed with a ſenſe of the ſins of the land, ſaw the neceſſity of deep humiliation; and, from the diſtinguiſhed part he acted in our revolutionary war, knew that our ſafety depended on the favour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of almighty God. How innocent ſoever we may be in provoking the aſſaults of men, we have grievouſly tranſgreſſed the divine law. Each of us is addreſſed this day in the words of Joſhua to Achan; <q>My ſon, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Iſrael, and make confeſſion unto him.</q> Let us remember that each, by his perſonal ſins, adds to the ſins of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; that the reformation of the one is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the other; and that, had we not contributed to the ſtock of iniquity, the ſins of others ſhould excite our ſorrow. "Go," ſaid the Lord, <q>through the midſt of the city, through the midſt of Jeruſalem, and ſet a mark
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:034003_0034_0FF9F4762338B558"/>upon the foreheads of the men that ſigh, and that cry, for all the abominations that be done in the midſt thereof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If we thus turn from the evil of our ways, we will have nothing to fear. The ſame God who hath ſo often and ſo remarkably interpoſed in our behalf, will again plead our cauſe. We live in an eventful period. What will be the iſſue as to France herſelf, to the other nations in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, or as to ourſelves, is beyond conjecture. We are only aſſured, that <q>the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in the ſtorm, and the clouds are the duſt of his feet.</q> We have already ſeen the power of the Church of Rome, if not deſtroyed, yet receiving its death would. What more deſigns of Providence ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by the preſent convulſions, are unknown. The words of the Lord reſpecting Aſſyria are ſo remarkable as to demand our attention here. <q>O Aſſyrian, the rood of mine anger, and the ſtaff in their hand is mine indignation. I will ſend him againſt an hypocritical nation, and againſt the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the ſpoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the ſtreets. Howbeit, he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo; but it is in his heart
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:034003_0035_0FF9F477EA4941A0"/>to deſtroy, and cut off nations not a few. Wherefore it ſhall come to paſs, that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion, and on Jeruſalem, I will puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the king of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria, and the glory of his high looks.</q> What follows is no leſs remarkable, and the whole paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage recorded in Iſaiah, 10th chapter, from the 5th to the 19th verſe, is full of inſtruction as to the ways and dealings of Providence towards nations.</p>
            <p>Let the children of God truſt and rejoice in him; and let thoſe who are living in diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſpeedily make their peace with him, through his Son Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath <q>ſet forth as a propitiation for ſin.</q> If, as a people, we are corrupt and vicious, judgments muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; and if, as individuals, we continue to reject the goſpel, future and eternal miſery muſt be our portion.</p>
            <p>Next to the duties which we owe immediately to God, are thoſe which we owe to one another, in the ſupport of the conſtituted authorities, and the defence of our civil and religious privileges. Unnatural children we are, if, when that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which holds all that is dear to us is threatened, we do not breathe one ſpirit, and exert one
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:034003_0036_0FF9F47ADDEBF150"/>ſtrength; if we do not renounce all partialities to this or to the other nation, be they who they will; and if we do not baniſh all party diſſenſions for the name of AMERICAN.<note n="*" place="bottom">There are ſome who alledge, that parties neceſſarily exiſt in all free governments, and that they are of real ſervice. Britain is brought as an example. In my opinion the reaſoning is deluſive. The government of Britain is an old and eſtabliſhed one; ours is of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent date; the one is monarchical; the other of the popular form. With us, there is much more danger of weakneſs than of energy, of anarchy than of tyranny. But whatever may be ſaid on this, ſurely there ought to be no parties with reſpect to foreign nations. The prevalence of ſuch a ſpirit would expoſe us to all their intrigues, and finally bring us under their domination. Much is ſaid about grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to France. It ought to be remembered, that forgiveneſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries is equally a part of morals; and that, with reſpect to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we ought to be, "in war, enemies; in peace, friends."</note>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, Let us earneſtly pray that our Counſellors may be inſpired with integrity, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, firmneſs, and unanimity, in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our national affairs; that the deſolations of war may ſoon ceaſe unto the ends of the earth; that univerſal righteouſneſs may prevail, and that this tranſporting anthem may be ſung by all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <q>The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt; and he ſhall reign for ever and ever.</q>
