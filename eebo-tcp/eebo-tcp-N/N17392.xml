            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is to be hoped, that no man, who believes a future ſtate of exiſtence, will grudge the time and pains which are neceſſary to obtain ſatisfactory evidence concerning the nature of that ſtate. A miſtake here may be fatal. If the doctrine advanced in the following pages be true, it is a moſt important, a moſt intereſting doctrine. However contrary to the wiſhes of any, however mortifying to their feelings, however dreadful, it is by all means neceſſary to be known. Surely no man would wiſh
<q>to flatter himſelf in his own eyes, till his iniquity be found to be hateful.</q>
To a rational and ſcriptural view of the truth in this caſe, and to a ſatisfactory ſolution of the difficulties which have been objected to it, great attention and cloſe examination are neceſſary. And whether both our duty and intereſt require us to ſubject ourſelves to the labour of this atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and examination, rather than to ſit down eaſy in the expectation
<q>of peace and ſafety, till ſudden deſtruction come upon us;</q>
no rational man can heſitate.</p>
            <p>IF any object to the ſize of my book, my apologies are, the ſize of that to which it is intended as an anſwer, and the extent and importance of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR Chauncy's book is indeed anonymous. Yet, as I am informed, that he and his moſt intimate friends have made no ſecret of the author's name; I preſume I need not apologize for uſing the ſame name.</p>
            <p>I AM ſenſible of the prejudice of many againſt contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy on religious ſubjects. But is it poſſible in all caſes to avoid it? What is controverſy properly managed, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional or argumentative diſcuſſion? And is there to be no rational diſcuſſion of the ſubjects of religion?—Heat and perſonal invective in ſuch diſquiſitions are both impertinent and hurtful. But a cool diſcuſſion of the doctrines of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:022478_0003_0FB93545AF766400"/>
on the ground of reaſon and revelation, is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly one of the beſt means of inveſtigating truth, of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the knowledge of it, and of obtaining and giving ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction with regard to the difficulties which attend many moral and religious ſubjects. This is the mode of diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which I have endeavoured to obſerve in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pages. To point out the inconſiſtence and abſurdity of an erroneous ſyſtem, and even to ſet them in the moſt gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring light; is not at all inconſiſtent with this mode of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion. If in any inſtances I have deviated from this mode, and inſtead of adhering cloſely to the argument, have deſcended to perſonalities, and have endeavoured to bear hard on Dr. Chauncy, otherwiſe than by ſhowing the weakneſs and inconſiſtence of his arguments; for every ſuch inſtance I aſk pardon of the reader, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it is of no advantage to the cauſe which I eſpouſe. That cauſe muſt be a bad one indeed, which cannot be ſupported without the aid of perſonal reflections.</p>

                  <p>BESIDE the doctrine of the ſalvation of all men, to eſtabliſh which is the deſign of his whole book; there are ſeveral other doctrines, which may be conſidered as fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental to his ſyſtem. He does not deny all future pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of the wicked; but allows that they will be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed according to their demerits, or according to ſtrict juſtice. Thus he allows that
<q>many men will be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable in the next ſtate of exiſtence, in proportion to the moral depravity they have contracted in this. There is no room for debate here<note n="*" place="bottom">Page <hi>9.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>IN theſe paſſages concerning the blaſphemers of the HOLY GHOST, the author plainly ſuppoſes, that not only thoſe of that character, but all who ſuffer the torments of hell are finally ſaved without forgiveneſs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſatisfied by their own ſufferings the utmoſt demands of ſtrict juſtice. He who is delivered from further pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment in conſequence of having ſuffered a puniſhment however great in degree and long in duration, but not equal to that, to which he is liable by ſtrict juſtice, is the ſubject of forgiveneſs. Juſt ſo much puniſhment is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him, as is lacking to make the puniſhment, which
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:022478_0008_0FB9354EB448BC30"/>
he hath ſuffered, equal to that, to which he is liable by ſtrict juſtice. Now our author, in the paſſages juſt quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſuppoſes that both the blaſphemers of the Holy Ghoſt and all others who paſs through the torments of hell, are finally delivered, not in conſequence of a puniſhment inferior in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or duration, to that which may be inflicted on them, according to ſtrict juſtice; as in that caſe they would be the ſubjects of forgiveneſs: but in conſequence of that pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, which is according to ſtrict juſtice, and therefore they are delivered without forgiveneſs. He ſays, "The pardonableneſs of all other ſins, lies in the poſſibility, that thoſe who have been guilty of them, ſhould eſcape the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell." Thoſe therefore who actually paſs through the torments of hell receive no forgiveneſs; but are liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated on the footing of ſtrict juſtice. If pardonableneſs, or which is the ſame, a poſſibility of pardon conſiſt in a poſſibility of eſcaping the torments of hell; then actual par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don conſiſts in an actual eſcape from thoſe torments. Of courſe they who do not eſcape them, but paſs through them, receive no pardon.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN: the only obſervation made by Dr. C. to ſhow, that the blaſphemers of the Holy Ghoſt are not forgiven; or the only reſpect in which he aſſerts, that they are not forgiven, is, that they paſs through the torments of hell. But as this holds good with regard to all the damned, it equally proves, that none of them are forgiven; and that the divine law takes its courſe on them all; and that no intervening pardon will ever prevent the full execution of the threatened penalty on them.— Now if the divine law take its courſe on the damned, and the penalty threatened in the law, be fully executed on them; they are undoubtedly puniſhed according to their demerits, or according to ſtrict juſtice; and if after all, they be liberated from puniſhment, they are liberated not in the way of forgiveneſs, nor on the footing of grace or favour; but on the footing of ſtrict juſtice.</p>
                  <p>But if this concluſion concerning all the damned be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; yet as the blaſphemers of the Holy Ghoſt are ſome of mankind, <hi>ſome</hi> of mankind at leaſt, if not all the dam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned, will be ſaved on the footing of ſtrict juſtice, and without forgiveneſs.</p>
                  <p>The ſame obſervations for ſubſtance, may be made on the other quotations above. If the damned ſuffer
<q>a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022478_0009_0FB93550332B3A58"/>
in proportion to the number and greatneſs of their vices;</q>
if "they receive the wages of ſin;" if they be
<q>tormented variouſly as to time, in proportion to their deſerts;</q>
and
<q>according to the difference there has been in the nature and number of their evil deeds</q>;
if they ſuffer
<q>poſitive torments awfully great in degree and long in continuance, in proportion to the number and greatneſs of their crimes</q>;
they are puniſhed to the utmoſt extent of juſtice. To puniſh them any further would be exceſſive, injurious and oppreſſive. To exempt them from puniſhment, is ſo far from an act of grace or favour, that it is an act called for by the moſt rigorous juſtice.</p>
                  <p>BY theſe quotations, and by the obſervations on them, it appears, that our author holds, that the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuffer a puniſhment properly and ſtrictly vindictive, and vindictive to the higheſt degree, and to the utmoſt extent to which vengeance in any juſt government can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Indeed ſpeaking of the deſtruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, he plainly aſſerts a vindictive puniſhment both of thoſe cities, and of the damned; he ſays,<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 274.</note> that "the deſtruction of thoſe cities" was, "for a public example of the divine vengeance to after ages. And the fire of hell is doubtleſs called everlaſting for the like reaſon;" i. e. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will laſt, till it ſhall have accompliſhed the deſign of heaven in the deſtruction of the damned, for a public example of the divine vengeance. In his <hi>Five Diſſertations</hi> p. 110, he ſpeaks of the labour, ſorrow and death which men ſuffer in this world, as
<q>teſtimonies of GOD's <hi>vengeance,</hi> —as <hi>judgments</hi> on his part, and <hi>real evils</hi> on theirs;</q>
By vindictive puniſhment is meant, that which is ſufficient to ſupport and vindicate the authority of the divine law, or which is ſufficient to ſatisfy the juſtice of GOD. But no advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for vindictive puniſhment ever ſuppoſed, that to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the authority of the law and to ſatisfy the juſtice of God, a greater puniſhment is neceſſary, than is according to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or according to the deſert, or the nature and number of the ſins, the vices, the crimes of the perſon puniſhed: or that to thoſe ends, a greater puniſhment is neceſſary, than is inflicted, when "the divine law takes its courſe;" or than is implied "in the full execution of the threatened pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty." A puniſhment greater than that which anſwers
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022478_0010_0FB93553246AA990"/>
thoſe deſcriptions, would be ſo far from ſatisfying juſtice, that it would be poſitively <hi>unjuſt</hi>: it would be ſo far from ſupporting the authority of the divine law, that it would bring it into contempt by violating it. If that poſitive torment, which in degree and continuance is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deſert and the nature and number of the evil deeds of the ſinner, be not ſufficient to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the juſtice of GOD, I wiſh to be informed what would ſatisfy it. — But Dr. C. himſelf holds, that the puniſhment which ſatisfies the juſtice of GOD, is vindictive and oppoſed to that which is diſciplinary and medicinal;
<q>If the next ſtate is a ſtate of puniſhment not intended for the cure of the patients themſelves, but to ſatisfy the juſtice of GOD, and give warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others; it is impoſſible all men ſhould be final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaved <note n="†" place="bottom">

So that I am perfectly agreed with Dr. C. in his idea of a vindictive puniſhment, and whether he do not hold ſuch puniſhment in the utmoſt extent, I appeal to every candid reader, who ſhall have peruſed the forecited quotations, or the pages from which they are taken.</p>
                  <p>YET Dr. C. is a great enemy to vindictive puniſhment, and it is a fundamental principle of his book, that the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puniſhment of the wicked is <hi>diſciplinary</hi> and intended for the good, the repentance and reformation of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and not to ſatisfy the juſtice of God. This appears from the quotation juſt now made from page 11th; and by innumerable other paſſages, ſome of which I ſhall now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite.
<q>The wicked ſhall be ſent to a place of weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth; not to continue there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, but till the rebellion of their hearts is ſubdued, and they are wrought upon to become the willing and obedient ſubjects of God</q>

<q>The reſt "[the wicked]" ſhall have their portion in the place of blackneſs of darkneſs, as a ſuitable and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſcipline, in order to their being reduced under mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſubjection to CHRIST<note n="‡" place="bottom">

<q>Is it not far more reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the miſeries of the other world are <hi>a proper diſcipline,</hi> in order to accompliſh the end</q>

With approbation he quotes from Mr. Hartley theſe words;

                  </p>
                  <p>AS this is his idea of the nature and end of the future pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of the wicked, he often rejects with abhorrence the idea, that they are to be puniſhed for any other end excluſive of their own perſonal good. What he ſays in p. 325, implies, that unleſs we believe, that the future puniſhment of the wicked is intended for their perſonal good, we muſt believe, that
<q>the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of GOD, as the Father of mercies, and the God of pity, is limited to this world only;</q>
and that he is not the
<q>ſame good being in the other world, that he is in this;</q>
—That on that ſuppoſition,
<q>we ſhall ſay that of our father in heaven, which we cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of any father on earth, till we have firſt diveſted him of the heart of a father<note n="†" place="bottom">
                           <hi>P.</hi> 327.</note>.</q>
And in page 11th, before quoted, he abſolutely rejects all puniſhment which is not diſciplinary.</p>
                  <p>BUT how theſe two fundamental parts of Dr. C's ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem can be conſiſtent with each other, is difficult to be conceived. Is that puniſhment which is according to the deſerts of the ſinner; that which in degree and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is according to the nature and number of his evil deeds; in which the divine law takes its courſe upon him, and in which the penalty threatened in the law is fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted:
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022478_0012_0FB93557B14ACE10"/>
is this puniſhment no more than a ſuitable and neceſſary diſcipline to the ſinner; neceſſary "to reduce him to a moral ſubjection to CHRIST;" neceſſary
<q>to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal good,</q>
"his benefit," &amp;c? If ſo, then that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is according to ſtrict juſtice and
<q>ſatisfies the juſtice of GOD,</q>
and that which is a mere merciful and beneficial diſcipline, are one and the ſame. The damned ſinner ſuffers no more puniſhment, than is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for his good, nor can without injury and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be made to ſuffer more: and all ground of diſtinction between vindictive and diſciplinary puniſhment entirely vaniſhes. But if any man ſhould avow this ſentiment, that ſuch puniſhment only, as is neceſſary and conducive to the ſinner's perſonal good, can conſiſtently with juſtice be inflicted; I beg leave to refer him to the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which the ſubject is conſidered at large.</p>
                  <p>IN the mean time, it may be proper to obſerve, that Dr. C. could not conſiſtently adopt the ſentiment juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; becauſe he in page 11th before quoted, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes expreſly between that puniſhment, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the cure of the patients, and that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſatisfy the juſtice of GOD; and aſſerts that the latter is inconſiſtent with the ſalvation of all men. His words are,
<q>If the next ſtate is a ſtate of puniſhment, not intended for the cure of the patients themſelves, but to ſatisfy the juſtice of GOD—'tis impoſſible all men ſhould be finally ſaved.</q>
On this notable paſſage, I obſerve, 1. That Dr. C. here, as every where elſe through his book, diſtinguiſhes between a vindictive and diſciplina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry puniſhment; or between that puniſhment which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the ſinner's good, and that which ſatisfies divine juſtice. It cannot therefore be ſaid, that according to Dr. C. a puniſhment conducive to the ſinner's good, is all that can in ſtrict juſtice be inflicted on him.—2. He aſſerts, that if future puniſhment be intended to ſatisfy divine juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, it is impoſſible all men ſhould be ſaved. Yet he himſelf in holding, that the wicked will be puniſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deſerts, and in degree and continuance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature and number of their ſins, crimes and evil deeds; and that the divine law will take its courſe on them, the whole threatened penalty be inflicted, and they never be forgiven; holds that puniſhment, which entirely ſatisfies the juſtice of GOD. Therefore, as he
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022478_0013_0FB9355ECAC20B28"/>
alſo holds that ſuch future puniſhment as ſatisfies the juſtice of GOD, is inconſiſtent with the ſalvation of all men; to be conſiſtent, he muſt give up the doctrine of the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all men, to prove which, he wrote his whole book.</p>
                  <p>ANOTHER fundamental principle of Dr. C's book, is, that all men, both thoſe who are ſaved immediately from this life, and thoſe who are ſaved after they have ſuffered the pains of hell; are ſaved by the mere <hi>mercy, compaſſion, grace</hi> or <hi>favour</hi> of GOD, <hi>through</hi> CHRIST.—He allows<note n="*" place="bottom">Page <hi>43.</hi>
                     </note>, that the Apoſtle's Doctrine of juſtification ſtands
<q>upon the foot of grace through CHRIST,</q>
and
<q>that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have univerſally ſinned and conſequently cannot be juſtified upon any claim founded on <hi>mere law.</hi>
                     </q>
—
<q>The gift by CHRIST takes riſe from the many offences, which mankind commit in their own perſons, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally terminates in oppoſition to the power and demerit of them all, in their being reſtored, not ſimply to life, but to reign in it forever<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  <p>NOW, how can this part of Dr. C's ſyſtem be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with that part, in which he holds, that all the damned will be puniſhed <hi>according to their deſerts?</hi> Can thoſe who are puniſhed <hi>according to their deſerts,</hi> after that be ſaved <hi>on the foot of grace through</hi> CHRIST? Can thoſe who are puniſhed according to the nature and number of their evil deeds; in degree and continuance, in proportion to the number and greatneſs of their crimes; in whoſe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the divine law takes its courſe, and the threatened penalty is fully executed: can theſe perſons be ſaved by <hi>a gift?</hi> by a gift taken <hi>in the abounding ſenſe? by the free gift of</hi> GOD <hi>through Chriſt</hi>? by <hi>rich mercy?</hi> by <hi>pity, tender compaſſion</hi> and <hi>grace?</hi> by <hi>mercy extenſively benevolent?</hi> by a <hi>wonderful</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of <hi>mercy?</hi> by <hi>boundleſs</hi> and <hi>inexhauſtible goodneſs?</hi> by the <hi>utmoſt bowels of the divine compaſſion?</hi> by the <hi>infinite indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and love of their</hi> CREATOR? Is the man who by his crimes has, according to law, expoſed himſelf to the pillory, or to be cropt and branded, and on whom the law has tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en its courſe, and the threatened penalty has been fully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; is he after all delivered from further ſuffering by <hi>grace,</hi> by <hi>pity,</hi> by <hi>tender compaſſion,</hi> by <hi>indulgence and love,</hi> by the <hi>utmoſt bowels of compaſſion?</hi>—No; he has a right on the foot of <hi>mere law,</hi> and of <hi>the moſt rigorous juſtice,</hi> to ſubſequent impunity, with reſpect to the crime or crimes, for which he has been thus puniſhed: and to tell him after
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022478_0015_0FB93562F52481E8"/>
he is thus puniſhed, that he is now releaſed by grace, by pity, by utmoſt compaſſion, by indulgence and love, would be the groſſeſt inſult.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN; how can thoſe who have been puniſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their deſerts, be ſaved <hi>through</hi> CHRIST, or <hi>on his account?</hi> How can the obedience and death of CHRIST be the <hi>ground</hi> or <hi>reaſon</hi> of their ſalvation? Having ſuffered the full penalty threatened in the law, they have a right to demand future impunity, on account of their own ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. What need then have they of CHRIST, of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and death, or of his mediatory intervention, to be brought into the account? Dr. C. ſpeaks of the "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance" or "the redemption which CHRIST has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed" for all men<note n="§" place="bottom">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 153, 154.</note>. But what need is there, that CHRIST ſhould purchaſe deliverance for thoſe, who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it for themſelves, by their own perſonal ſufferings? Nay, what juſtice would there be in refuſing deliverance to a man, unleſs it be purchaſed for him by another, when he hath fully purchaſed it for himſelf? What if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon before deſcribed to have ſuffered ſome corporal pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment according to the ſtrictneſs of law, ſhould be told at his releaſe, that he is delivered from further pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, not on account of his own ſufferings; but <hi>on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> of ſome other perſon? <hi>on the ground,</hi> and <hi>for the reaſon</hi> of the obedience or merit of that other perſon? Might he not with juſt indignation reply; Wherein hath that other perſon afforded me any relief? I have ſuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered all that could be inflicted on me conſiſtently with law and juſtice; and let the merit of that other perſon be what it may, I thank him for nothing: his merit hath benefited me nothing. As little benefit from CHRIST does he derive towards his deliverance, who ſuffers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deſerts; and with as little propriety can it be ſaid, that he is redeemed or delivered <hi>through</hi> CHRIST or <hi>on his account.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ON the whole, Dr. C's ſcheme comes to this; That not bare goodneſs, but that goodneſs, which is boundleſs and inexhauſtible; not bare compaſſion but the utmoſt bowels of the divine compaſſion; not bare indulgence and love, but the infinite indulgence and love of our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; will grant to his creatures of mankind, juſt ſo much relief from miſery, as they are entitled to by the moſt rigorous juſtice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="unknown:022478_0016_0FB9356485FF9948"/>NOR did Dr. C. fall into theſe inconſiſtences, by mere inattention; he was driven to them by dire neceſſity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it was neceſſary for him, to adopt his favorite doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the ſalvation of all men. Every one of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned principles is eſſential to his ſyſtem, and can by no means be ſpared.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. THAT the damned are puniſhed according to their deſerts, is manifeſtly eſſential to his ſyſtem. For if in ages of ages they do not ſuffer a puniſhment which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their deſerts, they do not ſuffer that which might juſtly be inflicted upon them; or, which is the ſame thing, that puniſhment which is denounced in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law: and according both to juſtice and the divine law, the damned might be made to ſuffer a greater puniſhment, than that which is for ages of ages; or than the longeſt puniſhment, which any of them will in fact ſuffer. But as no body pretends there is any greater puniſhment threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in the law, or in any part of ſcripture, than that which in ſcriptural language is ſaid to be for ever and ever, which D. C. ſuppoſes to be for ages of ages only, and to be actually ſuffered by ſome men at leaſt; he was neceſſitated to hold, that ſome ſuffer the utmoſt puniſhment threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the law, and of courſe the utmoſt which they deſerve.</p>
                  <p>BESIDE; if he had allowed, that the damned do not ſuffer ſo long a puniſhment, as they deſerve, or as is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in the law; he might have been aſked, how much longer that puniſhment is, which is threatened in the law, than that which they actually ſuffer. And the anſwer muſt have been, either that it is a longer temporary puniſhment; or that it is an endleſs puniſhment. But which ever anſwer ſhould have been given, inexplicable difficulties would have followed. If he ſhould have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the puniſhment threatened in the law, and which the ſinner juſtly deſerves, is a longer tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary puniſhment, than that which the damned actually ſuffer, he might have been challenged, to point it out, as contained in the law, or in any part of ſcripture: and it is preſumed, that he would not have been able to do it.</p>
                  <p>BUT if he ſhould have anſwered, that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatened in the law, and which the ſinner juſtly deſerves, is an <hi>endleſs</hi> puniſhment, he muſt at once have given up all arguments in favour of univerſal ſalvation,
<pb facs="unknown:022478_0017_0FB93566024062B0"/>
and againſt endleſs puniſhment, drawn from the <hi>juſtice</hi> of GOD. Surely the juſtice of GOD does not oppoſe that which is juſt, and which the ſinner deſerves; or that which the juſt law of GOD threatens. He muſt alſo have acknowledged the infinite evil of ſin, which ſeems to have been a moſt grievous eye-ſore to him. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more is meant by the infinite evil of ſin, than that on the account of ſin, the ſinner deſerves an endleſs puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Again; Dr. C. could not aſſert, that the damned do not ſuffer all the puniſhment, which they deſerve, without contradicting apparently at leaſt, many clear and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive declarations of ſcripture: ſuch as, That GOD will render to every man according to his deeds, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as his work ſhall be; That every one ſhall receive according to the things done in the body; That the wicked ſhall not come out of the place of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till they ſhall have paid the uttermoſt farthing, and the very laſt mite; That he ſhall have judgment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy, that ſhewed no mercy, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. IT was equally neceſſary, that he ſhould hold that the puniſhment of the damned is a diſcipline, neceſſary and happily conducive to lead them to repentance, and to promote their good.—Otherwiſe he muſt have holden, that future puniſhment is vindictive and intended to ſatisfy the juſtice of GOD; which kind of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is, according to his own account, inconſiſtent with the ſalvation of all men<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 11.</note>. And otherwiſe he muſt have given up all his arguments from the divine goodneſs, mercy, compaſſion and grace, which are the chief argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, on which he himſelf depended moſt, for the ſupport of his cauſe, and which are the moſt popular, and the moſt perſuaſive to the majority of his readers. Otherwiſe too, he could not have pretended, that his ſcheme of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſalvation is a ſcheme of ſuch benevolence, of ſuch boundleſs and inexhauſtible goodneſs, of ſuch tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and grace, of ſuch infinite indulgence and love: and muſt have given up all the principal texts of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from which he argues univerſal ſalvation; as they are inconſiſtent with the idea, that the damned will be finally admitted to happineſs, having previouſly ſuffered
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022478_0018_0FB93568AD5AE2B8"/>
the whole puniſhment, which they deſerve.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. NOR could he make out his ſcheme of univerſal ſalvation, unleſs he held, that all men are ſaved in the way of mere grace and favour through CHRIST. If he had not holden this, what I obſerved under the laſt article, would be obſervable under this too, that he muſt have given up all arguments drawn from the divine goodneſs; and alſo all arguments drawn from what the ſcriptures ſay of the extent of CHRIST's redemption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> particularly thoſe texts from which D. C. chiefly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues in ſupport of his ſcheme. Every one of thoſe texts holds forth that all who are ſaved, are ſaved <hi>by grace, through</hi> CHRIST. He muſt alſo have given up all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from ſcripture. The ſcripture knows of no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but that which is founded on the mere favour of GOD forgiving the ſins of men, according to the riches of his grace, and juſtifying them freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>Thus Dr. C. was compelled by neceſſity to aſſociate in his ſcheme, principles which will wage eternal war with each other.</p>

                  <p n="1">I.

"<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 37</note>Salvation <hi>from  wrath</hi> is one thing <hi>eſſentially</hi> included in that juſtification which is the reſult of true faith." He ſpeaks to the ſame effect in many other plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Indeed he never gives the leaſt hint implying, that he imagined, that the introduction of the ſinner to the poſitive happineſs of heaven is more an act of grace, than his <hi>deliverance from the pains of hell</hi>: but all that he ſays on the ſubject, implies the contrary. Nor do I ſtate this objection, becauſe I find it in his book; but leſt ſome of his admirers ſhould ſtart it, and ſhould ſuppoſe, that it relieves the difficulties before preſſed upon him.</p>
                  <p>AS Dr. C. allows, that the deliverance of ſinners from the pains of hell, in all inſtances, is as really an act of grace, and as really through CHRIST, as their admiſſion to the joys of heaven; ſo the ſcriptures are very clear as to the ſame matter. Gal. III. 13.
<q>CHRIST hath redeemed us <hi>from the curſe of the law,</hi> being made a curſe for us.</q>
Rom. V. 9.
<q>We ſhall be ſaved <hi>from wrath</hi> through him.</q>
1 Theſ. I. 10.
<q>JESUS which <hi>delivered us from the wrath to come.</hi>
                     </q>
And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don or forgiveneſs, which is a diſcharge from deſerved puniſhment, is, in its very nature, an act of grace, and is, in ſcripture, always ſpoken of as ſuch, and as diſpenſed through CHRIST only. Nor is any thing more clear from the ſcriptures, than that every perſon, who is ſaved, is ſaved in the way of <hi>forgiveneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. THERE would be no propriety in ſaying, that a perſon who has ſuffered all the puniſhment which he juſtly deſerves, who is on the footing of law and juſtice releaſed from all further puniſhment, and is placed in a ſtate of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022478_0020_0FB9356C0D65C388"/>
in which he is the ſubject of no miſery; is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the poſitive happineſs of heaven, by <hi>mercy,</hi> by <hi>pity</hi> or <hi>compaſſion</hi>: much leſs by "<hi>tender</hi> compaſſion" and "<hi>wonderful</hi> mercy," and by the
<q>
                        <hi>utmoſt bowels</hi> of the divine compaſſion.</q>
A being who has by his perſonal ſufferings, ſatisfied the law, ſtands as right with reſpect to that law, as if he had never tranſgreſſed it; or as another perſon, who retains his original innocence. N<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, does any man ſuppoſe, that Gabriel was admitted to celeſtial happineſs, in the way of <hi>mercy, pity,</hi> or <hi>tender compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>—That he was admitted to it in the exerciſe of <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> is granted. The ſame may be ſaid of his creation, and of the creation of every being rational and animal. But no being is created <hi>out of compaſſion.</hi> With no more propriety can it be ſaid, that an innocent being, or, which is the ſame as to the preſent purpoſe, that a being who has indeed tranſgreſſed, but has in his own perſon made ſatisfaction for his tranſgreſſion, and on that footing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from all puniſhment and miſery, is admitted to high poſitive happineſs, by mercy, pity or compaſſion. And how much more improperly are the ſtrong epithets uſed by Dr. C. applied in this caſe? Is it an inſtance of <hi>tender</hi> pity, of <hi>wonderful</hi> mercy, of the <hi>utmoſt bowels</hi> of the DIVINE compaſſion, to admit to the happineſs of heaven, an <hi>innocent</hi> creature, or one who, in his own perſon, ſtands perfectly right with reſpect to the divine law, and is not the ſubject of any miſery?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To grant that thoſe who ſhall have ſuffered a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment according to their deſerts, will on the footing of juſtice, be delivered from further wrath or puniſhment, and yet to inſiſt that their admiſſion to high poſitive hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, is truly and properly an act of <hi>grace</hi>; would be only to raiſe a diſpute concerning the proper meaning of the word <hi>grace,</hi> and at the ſame time to grant, that the deliverance of the ſinner from wrath, is no fruit of <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,</hi> or of <hi>grace,</hi> even in the very ſenſe in which the objector uſes the word <hi>grace.</hi> It is no act of favour, or of <hi>goodneſs,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from <hi>juſtice,</hi> to deliver a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from wrath, who is innocent, or who in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has ſatisfied the law, and therefore now ſtands right with reſpect to it. But the idea of delivering a ſinner from wrath, without forgiveneſs, and without grace, is as foreign from the ſcriptures, as that of the admiſſion of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022478_0021_0FB9356D83751220"/>
a ſinner, without grace, to the poſitive joys of heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. PERHAPS it may be objected to part of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding ſection, that by puniſhment
<q>in proportion to their deſerts,</q>
and "according to their evil deeds," &amp;c. Dr. C. meant not a puniſhment <hi>equal</hi> to ſtrict juſtice, or <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> to the juſtice of GOD; but one in which a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the deſerts of the various perſons, with reſpect to one another, who are the ſubjects of the puniſhment, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.—But to this it may be anſwered, Dr. C. doubtleſs meant to uſe the expreſſions,
<q>in proportion to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts,</q>
"according to their evil deeds," &amp;c. in the ſame ſenſe in which the ſcriptures ſay,
<q>according to their works;</q>
"according to the fruit of their doings," &amp;c. This is manifeſt not only by the ſimilarity of the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but by his own reference to thoſe phraſes in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as in the following paſſages,
<q>Which is plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with that difference <hi>the ſcripture</hi> often <hi>declares</hi> there ſhall be, in the puniſhment of wicked men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the difference there has been in the nature and number of their evil deeds<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 320.</note>.</q>
                     <q>Under the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of being condemned <hi>by the righteous</hi> JUDGE of all the earth—to poſitive torments awfully great in degree, and long in continuance, in proportion to the number and greatneſs of their crimes<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 350.</note>.</q>
Here he undoubtedly refers to thoſe paſſages in which the ſcriptures aſſure us, that the judge
<q>will render to every man according to his deeds;</q>
"according as his work ſhall be," &amp;c. Now theſe phraſes of ſcripture are clearly explained to us, by thoſe repreſentations, in which the puniſhment of the wicked is illuſtrated by the impriſonment of a debtor, till he ſhall have paid the uttermoſt farthing, the very laſt mite, &amp;c. and by the paſſages, in which it is declared, that the wicked ſhall have <hi>judgment without mercy</hi>; that GOD will <hi>not pity, nor ſpare</hi> them &amp;c. Whereas, if they ſuffer leſs than they deſerve according to ſtrict juſtice; ſo far they are the objects of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>pity</hi>; ſo far GOD does <hi>ſpare</hi> them; ſo far they have <hi>mercy mixed with judgment.</hi> Nor can it be ſaid, that they pay the <hi>uttermoſt farthing</hi> of the debt.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN; Dr. C. allows, that the wicked will in the ſecond death receive the wages of ſin. But the wages of a man are not merely a part, or a certain proportion of what he deſerves, or has earned, but the whole. No
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022478_0022_0FB9356FC01FD470"/>
man who has faithfully done the work, which he contracted to do for ten pounds, will allow, that five pounds are his wages for that work.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. IT may alſo be objected to a part of the former ſection, that though "the law ſhall have its courſe" on ſome men, and "the full penalty threatened in the law, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted on them;" ſtill this does not imply a puniſhment equal or ſatisfactory to ſtrict juſtice; as the divine law itſelf does not, nor ever did threaten all that puniſhment, which is deſerved according to ſtrict juſtice: and therefore though the damned ſhall ſuffer all which is threatened in the law, yet they will not ſuffer a vindictive puniſhment, a puniſhment which ſhall "ſatisfy the juſtice of GOD."—Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this objection it may be obſerved;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. THAT by <hi>the law</hi> is meant, to uſe Dr. C's own words, "the moral law,"
<q>the law of nature, the law of <hi>reaſon,</hi> which is the law of GOD:</q>
and to ſay, that this law does not threaten a penalty adequate to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of juſtice, is to ſay, that it does not threaten a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty adequate to the demands of reaſon. If ſo, it is not the law of reaſon; which is contrary to the ſuppoſition. Therefore to ſay, that the law of reaſon does not threaten a penalty adequate to the demands of juſtice, is a real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. THAT Dr. C. neither does nor could conſiſtently make this objection; becauſe if the objection were juſt, men might be juſtified, "on a claim founded on <hi>mere law.</hi>" On the principle of the objection, the law threatens a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment far leſs than we deſerve; and a man having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered this puniſhment, may be juſtified on the foundation of mere law: the law would be ſatisfied, and the man would ſtand right with reſpect to it, nor would it have any further claim on him, in the way of puniſhment, more than on a perſon who had never tranſgreſſed. Therefore he thenceforward obeying the law, might as truly be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied on the foot of <hi>mere law,</hi> as if he had rendered the ſame obedience, without ever tranſgreſſing.</p>
                  <p>BUT Dr. C. holds,
<q>that mankind univerſally have ſinned, and conſequently cannot be juſtified upon a claim founded on <hi>mere law</hi>

To the ſame effect in various other paſſages. So that according to Dr. C. if future puniſhment be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſatisfy <hi>the law,</hi> it is equally impoſſible, that all men ſhould be ſaved, as it is on the ſuppoſition, that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puniſhment is intended to ſatisfy <hi>juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Dr. C. ALLOWS, that a man having ſuffered the penalty of the law, is not, and cannot be, the object of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs.

But if thoſe who ſuffer the penalty of the law, are not, in their ſubſequent exemption from puniſhment, the objects of forgiveneſs, they ſuffer all they <hi>deſerve.</hi> So far as they are exempted from <hi>deſerved</hi> puniſhment, they are forgiven: forgiveneſs means nothing elſe than an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from deſerved puniſhment.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Dr. C. ſays, that Adam (and for the ſame reaſon doubtleſs men in general)

                     </q>
of the moral law, the law of which the Doctor is ſpeaking in that paſſage. But the righteous reſentment of GOD for tranſgreſſion is a juſt puniſhment of tranſgreſſion; and a juſt puniſhment is any puniſhment, which is not unjuſt. And it is impoſſible that Adam ſhould be obnoxious to ſuch a puniſhment, if the law, the moſt ſtrict rule of GOD's proceedings with his creatures, had not threatened it.— Thus Dr. C. himſelf grants, that the puniſhment threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in the law is the ſame which is deſerved according to ſtrict juſtice.</p>
                  <p>THE Doctor every where holds, that "the law of GOD is a perfect rule of righteouſneſs<note n="‡" place="bottom">Particularly <hi>12</hi> Sermons P. <hi>36.</hi>
                     </note>." But if the law do not threaten all the puniſhment which is juſtly deſerved by ſin, it is no more truly a perfect rule of righteouſneſs, than the goſpel is. —Again;
<q>Is the law that rule of right, which GOD knows to be the meaſure of men's duty to

him, and of what is fit he ſhould do for, or inflict upon them, as they are either obedient, or diſobedient? There is, without all doubt, ſuch a rule of men's duty towards GOD, and of GOD's conduct towards men, in a way of reward or puniſhment, according to their works.<note n="‡" place="bottom">

There could ſcarcely be a more explicit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, that the divine law threatens all that puniſhment, which is acording to juſtice. It is declared to be, not only the <hi>rule of right,</hi> but the <hi>meaſure of what is fit in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,</hi> as well as of duty. Indeed Dr. C. never once, ſo far as I have noticed, ſuggeſts the idea, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law does not threaten all that puniſhment, which is deſerved by ſin.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. ACCORDING to this objection, the moral law is a diſpenſation of grace, as truly as the goſpel. But how does this accord with the ſcripture? That declares, that "the <hi>law</hi> was given by Moſes, but <hi>grace</hi> and truth," or the gracious truth, "came by JESUS CHRIST;" Joh. I. 17. —"If they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promiſe made of none effect. Becauſe the law worketh <hi>wrath.</hi>—Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by <hi>grace</hi>;" Rom. IV. 14. — "The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the law;" 1 Cor. XV. 56.—As in the objection now under conſideration, the law is ſuppoſed to be as really a diſpenſation of grace, as the goſpel; we may ſay, The ſtrength of ſin is the <hi>goſpel,</hi> as truly as, The ſtrength of ſin is the <hi>law.</hi>—Beſide; if the law be a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace, how can it be ſaid to be the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of ſin? It threatens a part only of the puniſhment deſerved by ſin; and therefore it neither points out, how ſtrong ſin is, to bring into condemnation, nor does it give to ſin its proper force to terrify and torment the ſinner, by exhibiting the whole puniſhment deſerved by ſin. On the ground of this objection, the ſtrength of ſin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the rule of ſtrict juſtice, not in the law.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The apoſtle tells us, that "by the law is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſin." But the knowledge of the evil or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of ſin is obtained by the knowledge of the <hi>threatening</hi> of the law only. If the law do not threaten all that puniſhment, which ſin deſerves, we know not by the law, what ſin deſerves, or how evil it is.— And if we know not this by the law, neither do we

                     </gap> means whatever. Nor do we know our own demerit, nor our own proper characters as ſinners; nor are we in any capacity to judge concerning our obligation to gratitude for the redemption of CHRIST, or for ſalvation through him; nor have we the the proper motive to repentance ſet before us, in all the ſcriptures. The proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to repentance is the evil of ſin.—And if we have not the knowledge of the evil of ſin, it is impoſſible we ſhould know the grace of pardon, or of ſalvation from that puniſhment which is juſtly deſerved by ſin.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The apoſtle declares, as we have ſeen, that "by the law is the knowledge of <hi>ſin,</hi>" and that "the law worketh <hi>wrath.</hi>" But on the principle of this objection, by the law is the knowledge of <hi>grace,</hi> and the law worketh <hi>grace</hi>: and GOD without any atonement did grant to ſinners ſome remiſſion or mitigation of deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed puniſhment. Why then could not complete remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or pardon have been granted in the ſame way? What need was there of CHRIST and his death? Yet Dr. C. holds, that it was with a view to the obedience and death of CHRIST, <hi>upon this account, upon this ground, for this reaſon,</hi> that GOD was pleaſed to make the goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a glorious immortality to the miſerable ſons of men."</p>
                  <p n="8">8. IF the full puniſhment to which the ſinner juſtly expoſes himſelf by ſin, be not pointed out in the law; it is not a good law, as it does not teach the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the law the truth in this matter; but it is a deceitful law, or is directly calculated to deceive. It threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens a puniſhment, which the ſubject would naturally believe to be the whole puniſhment to which he is expoſed by tranſgreſſion, or which can be juſtly inflicted on him.—But this, if the objection be well grounded, is by no means the caſe. Thus the law would naturally tend to deceive fatally all its ſubjects.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. From what is granted by Dr. C. it certainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the threatening of the law is all that can be inflicted conſiſtently with juſtice, and that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatened in the law, and that which is allowed by ſtrict juſtice, is one and the ſame. He ſays, "Whatever ſin may in its own nature, be ſuppoſed to deſerve; it is not reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that it ſhould be univerſally
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022478_0026_0FB9357E932B16D8"/>
reckoned to death, when no law is in being that makes death the ſpecial penalty of tranſgreſſion."*—"Sin is not reckoned, brought to account, <hi>ought</hi> not to be looked upon as being taxed with the forfeiture of life, when there is no law in being, with death as its aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffixed ſanction."‡ Therefore whatever ſin may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to deſerve, it is not <hi>reaſonable,</hi> that it ſhould be reckoned, it <hi>ought not</hi> to be reckoned, or which is the ſame thing, it is <hi>not juſt,</hi> that it ſhould be reckoned to any puniſhment whatever, when there is no law in being, which makes that puniſhment the ſpecial penalty of tranſgreſſion. Therefore, as I ſaid, the puniſhment threatened in the law, is all which can be inflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with juſtice; and the puniſhment threatened in the law, and that which is allowed by ſtrict juſtice, are one and the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If the law do not threaten all that puniſhment, which is juſt, we cannot poſſibly tell what is a juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or what juſtice threatens or admits with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to puniſhment, and what it does not admit. If once we give up the law and the teſtimony, we are left to our own imaginations. Dr. C. holds, that the wages of ſin are the ſecond death, and that this death is a puniſhment which ſhall laſt, according to the language of ſcripture, <hi>for ever and ever.</hi> Are theſe wages, and this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſhall continue <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> adequate to the demand of juſtice or not? If they are, then the law threatens all which juſtice requires.—If they are not; then the wages of ſin, and the puniſhment for ever and ever, are a <hi>gracious</hi> puniſhment, and ſinners <hi>deſerve</hi> a longer puniſhment. But how do we know, that ſinners deſerve a longer puniſhment, than this? No longer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is threatened in the law, or in any part of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. IF ſin deſerve a longer puniſhment, than that which is threatened in the law, it deſerves either an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhment, or a temporary puniſhment longer than that which is threatened in the law. But if ſin deſerve an endleſs puniſhment, it is an <hi>infinite evil.</hi>—If it deſerve a temporary puniſhment though longer than that which is threatened in the law, all men may finally be ſaved, even though the ſtate of future puniſhment be intended to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the divine juſtice: the contrary of which however is aſſerted by Dr. C.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:022478_0027_0FB93580ED43A968"/>12. IF the damned, though they ſhall be puniſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to law, will not be puniſhed as much as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; what ſhall we make of the ſcriptures, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that they ſhall have judgment without mercy; that GOD will not ſpare, nor pity them; that wrath ſhall be poured upon them without mixture? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I NOW appeal to the reader, whether, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this objection, the damned, in ſuffering the whole penalty thretened in the divine law, do not ſuffer as much as they deſerve according to ſtrict juſtice, and therefore ſuffer a penalty to the higheſt degree vindictive.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. IF it ſhould be further objected, that there is no inconſiſtency in repreſenting future puniſhment to be fully adequate to the demerit of ſin; and yet to repreſent it as diſciplinary, and adapted to the repentance and perſonal good of the patient: as both the ends of the perſonal good of the patient, and of the ſatisfaction of juſtice, are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by it: it is to be noticed,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. IF this objection mean, that the puniſhment which is merely adapted to the perſonal good of the patient, be all which is deſerved by ſin; I beg leave to refer the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector to the next chapter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. IF it mean, that though ſin do deſerve, and the damned will ſuffer, more puniſhment, than that which is conducive to the perſonal good of the patient; even all that puniſhment which is according to ſtrict juſtice; yet all will be ſaved finally: then it will follow that an endleſs puniſhment is not deſerved by ſin. In this caſe, I beg leave to refer the objector to chapter VI.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. STILL on the foundation of this objection, the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as they will have previouſly ſuffered all that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, will finally be delivered from further ſuffering of wrath, not by forgiveneſs, not by grace, nor through CHRIST; but entirely on the footing of ſtrict juſtice, as having ſuffered the full penalty of the law.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Dr. C. COULD not conſiſtently make this objection. The objection holds, that the damned do ſuffer a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment entirely ſatisfactory to juſtice: and Dr. C. allows, that if the puniſhment of the wicked be intended to

ſyſtem concerning future puniſhment, as to find, that it appears to be a combination of the moſt jarring princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and having particularly pointed out the mutual diſcordance of thoſe principles; I might ſpare myſelf the labour of a further examination of his book; until at leaſt it ſhould be made to appear, that thoſe principles do in reality harmonize with each other.—But as ſome may entertain the opinion, that though there be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences in the Book, yet the general doctrine of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſalvation is true, and is defenſible, if not on all the grounds, on which Dr. C. has undertaken the defence of it, yet on ſome of them at leaſt; therefore I have determined to proceed to a more particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of this doctrine, and of the arguments brought by Dr. C. in ſupport of it.</p>

               <p>ON the ſuppoſition, that future puniſhment is a mere diſcipline neceſſary and happily conducive to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and good of the damned; it may be aſked, whether ſuch diſcipline be all which they <hi>deſerve,</hi> and which can conſiſtently with ſtrict juſtice be inflicted; or whether they do indeed deſerve a greater degree or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of puniſhment, than that which is ſufficient to lead them to repentance, and that additional puniſhment be by grace remitted to them. Let us conſider both theſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>firſt</hi> is, that the wicked deſerve, according to ſtrict juſtice, no more puniſhment, than is neceſſary to lead them to repentance, and to prepare them for happineſs.— That this is not a mere hypotheſis made by an opponent of Dr. C. but is a doctrine <hi>implied</hi> at leaſt, if not expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted in his book, may appear by the following quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <q>The conſideration of hell as a purging fire, is that only which can make the matter ſit eaſy on one's mind.</q>
But if hell, though not merely a purging fire, be juſtly deſerved, why does not the thought of it ſit eaſy on one's mind? So that it is manifeſtly implied in this reaſoning of Dr. C. that no other puniſhment of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed can be reconciled with juſtice, than that which is adapted to their perſonal good.</p>
               <p>THE ſame is implicitly aſſerted by other writers on the ſame ſide of the queſtion concerning future puniſhment. Biſhop <hi>Newton,</hi> in his <hi>Diſſertation on the final ſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">As tranſcribed in the Monthly Review for March <hi>1783.</hi>
                  </note> ſays,
<q>It is <hi>juſt</hi> and wiſe and good, and even mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, to correct a ſinner as long as he <hi>deſerves</hi> correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; to whip and ſcourge him, as I may ſay, out of his faults.</q>
Therefore all the puniſhment of the ſinner, which is <hi>juſt,</hi> and which he <hi>deſerves,</hi> is correction, or to be ſcourged out of his faults. The Chevalier <hi>Ramſay</hi> tells us, that
<q>Juſtice is that perfection in GOD, by which he endevaours to make all intelligences juſt<note n="‡" place="bottom">Principles of Nat. &amp; Rev'd Religion, Vol. I. P. <hi>432.</hi>
                     </note>.</q>
                  <q>Vindictive juſtice, is that attribute in GOD, by which he purſues vice with all ſorts of torments, till it be totally extirpated, deſtroyed and annihilated‖.</q>
Therefore if GOD inflict any puniſhment with any other deſign, than to make the ſubject of that puniſhment juſt, and to extirpate vice from him, he violates even <hi>vindictive</hi> juſtice. M. <hi>Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itpierre</hi> in a tract lately publiſhed in England, and highly applauded by ſome, declares, that
<q>repentance appeaſes divine anger, and diſarms its juſtice; becauſe it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhes the end infinite goodneſs has in view, even when arrayed in the awful majeſty of avenging ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; which was ſevere, becauſe the moral ſtate of the ſinner required ſuch diſcipline; and which when that ſtate is reverſed, by converſion and holineſs, will have nothing to beſtow ſuitable to it, but the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manifeſtations of mercy and forgiveneſs.</q>**
<q>The honour of the divine law is ſufficiently guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the puniſhment of the ſinner as long as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains impenitent, and by the faithful and obedient adherence of the penitent offender. Divine juſtice is
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:022478_0030_0FB93587940D7410"/>
always ſatisfied when it attains its end; and this end is always attained, whenever the ſinner is brought to repentance.</q>
                  <note n="**" place="bottom">Ibid. 112.</note> So that it is evident, that all theſe writers implicitly held the propoſition now under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which is, that the wicked deſerve according to ſtrict juſtice, no more puniſhment than is neceſſary to lead them to repentance, and prepare them for happineſs. This is not only a real tenet of thoſe writers, but is moſt eſſential and important to their ſyſtem; for if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary can be eſtabliſhed, conſequences will follow, which will greatly embarraſs, if not entirely overthrow that ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem. I therefore beg the patience of the reader, while I particularly examine that tenet: Concerning it the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing obſervations may be made,</p>
               <p n="1">1. IT implies that the puniſhment which is neceſſary to lead the wicked to repentance is the curſe of the divine law. Without doubt that puniſhment which amounts to the utmoſt, which ſtrict juſtice admits, includes the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty or curſe of the divine law. The latter does not exceed the former; becauſe the divine law is founded in perfect juſtice, and whatever is inconſiſtent with juſtice, is equally inconſiſtent with the divine law. If therefore the ſinner deſerve, according to ſtrict juſtice, preciſely ſo much puniſhment as is neceſſary to lead him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and no more, then this is the true and utmoſt curſe of the divine law.—Yet ſuch a puniſhment as this, is really <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> whole no evil, and therefore no curſe even to the ſubject; becauſe by the ſuppoſition it is neceſſary to lead him to repentance, and prepare him for the everlaſting joys and glory of heaven.</p>
               <p>Dr. C. has given us his idea of a <hi>curſe,</hi> in his Five Diſſertations,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 109 110.</note> in the following words, "A teſtimony of the divine diſpleaſure againſt man's offence": "A teſtimony of the <hi>vengeance</hi> of GOD, which is a <hi>judgment</hi> on his part and <hi>a real evil</hi> on man's part." In the ſame book,<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 112.</note> he ſtates his idea of a bleſſing to a man, to be, "That which is greatly to his advantage." But the pains of hell, if they be abſolutely neceſſary, and moſt happily conducive to the repentance and endleſs happineſs of the damned, are no <hi>real evil</hi> on their part, nor any <hi>judgment</hi> or teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>vengeance</hi> on GOD's part: and therefore are no curſe at all; but are according to the Doctor's own definition
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:022478_0031_0FB9358891742B90"/>
a real <hi>bleſſing,</hi> and a real teſtimony of the <hi>benevolence</hi> of GOD to the damned. Surely a medicine of diſagreeable taſte, but abſolutely neceſſary to preſerve the life, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the health of a man, and adminiſtered with conſummate judgment, is no evil or curſe to the man to whom it is adminiſtered; but is a deſirable good, or a bleſſing to him; and the adminiſtration of it, is a full proof of the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the phyſician to his patient. A proof equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative of the divine benevolence to the damned, is the whole of their puniſhment in hell, if it be deſigned merely to lead them to repentance and to prepare them for happineſs: and this fruit of the divine benevolence can, according to Dr. C's own definition of a curſe, be no curſe.</p>
               <p>IT is granted by Dr. C. and in general by other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for univerſal ſalvation, that the torments of hell are not only wiſely adapted, but that they are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to lead the damned to repentance; that no more gentle means would ſo well anſwer the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed end; that therefore the divine goodneſs and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom have choſen and applied thoſe torments, as the means of good to the damned. But certainly that which is on the whole neceſſary for a perſon's own good, is to him, on the whole, no real evil, and therefore no curſe; but a good, a bleſſing; a wiſe man would chooſe it for himſelf, as it is, in its connection, really and properly eligible or deſirable. If the torments of hell taken in connection with repentance and endleſs happineſs be a curſe, then repentance and endleſs happineſs taken in connection with the torments of hell, are a curſe too. If ſome bitter pill, conſidered as connected with life, be a curſe; than life connected with that pill, is a curſe too. That and that only is a curſe to a perſon, which taken in its proper connections and dependences, renders him more miſerable, than he would be without it. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that is a bleſſing to a perſon, which taken in its proper connections and dependences, renders him more happy than he would be without it. It is juſt as great a bleſſing and juſt as great a privilege, as happineſs itſelf. And with what propriety this can be called a <hi>curſe,</hi> I appeal to every man acquainted with propriety of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to determine. To call this a curſe is to confound
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022478_0032_0FB9358A27060938"/>
a curſe and a bleſſing.—This being the true idea of a curſe and a bleſſing, it immediately follows on the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition now under conſideration, that the torments of hell are no curſe, but a bleſſing to thoſe on whom they are inflicted; becauſe the very ſuppoſition is, that they are neceſſary to ſecure and promote their happineſs and are inflicted for this end only.</p>
               <p>THE abſurdity then, to which on the whole we are reduced is, that thoſe means, which are the beſt that infinite wiſdom itſelf could deviſe and apply, for the ſalvation of thoſe who die in impenitence, are the curſe of the divine law; and that the greateſt evil which God can conſiſtently with juſtice inflict on the greateſt and moſt obdurate enemy of himſelf, of his Son our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Saviour, of his law, of his grace, and of mankind, is, to put him under the beſt poſſible advantages to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and promote his higheſt everlaſting happineſs: Which is no more nor leſs than to ſay, That the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt curſe which God can conſiſtently with his perfections inflict on the ſinner dying in impenitence, is to beſtow on him the greateſt bleſſing, which it is in the power of omnipotence and infinite bounty to beſtow on him, in his preſent temper of mind; that the divine law has no curſe at all annexed to it; and that the penalty of the law is an ineſtimable bleſſing, the bleſſing of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or of that diſcipline, which is abſolutely neceſſary, and moſt wiſely adapted to lead to repentance, and to prepare for the greateſt happineſs.</p>
               <p>IF on this view of the matter, it ſhould be ſaid, that the puniſhment of hell is not the greateſt bleſſing which God can beſtow on the ſinner who dies in impenitence; that it would be a greater bleſſing, to grant him repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by immediate efficacious grace, and then receive him to heavenly happineſs;—Concerning this I obſerve, that it gives up the only ground, on which the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now under conſideration reſts, and on which alone it can be ſupported. The ſuppoſition is, that the puniſhment of hell is inflicted with the ſole view of leading the ſuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erers to repentance, and of promoting their good. But if their good might be as effectually ſecured and promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by other means, as is now aſſerted, then the torments of hell are not inflicted to promote the good of the ſufferers.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:022478_0033_0FB9358B73AB66D8"/>
So far as their good is concerned, thoſe torments are needleſs, nay they are a wanton exerciſe of cruelty. But as cruelty cannot be aſcribed to <hi>the only wiſe God,</hi> he muſt, if this objection be valid, inflict the torments of hell, for ſome other end, than the final happineſs of thoſe who are ſent to that world of miſery.</p>
               <p>BESIDE; Dr. C. and other oppoſers of endleſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are no friends to the doctrine of <hi>efficacious grace.</hi> According to their ſyſtem, efficacious grace deſtroys all liberty and moral agency, and reduces men to mere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines. Therefore in their view, to be led to repentance by efficacious grace, is not a greater bleſſing, than to be led to repentance by the torments of hell; becauſe it is not a greater bleſſing to be a watch or a windmill than to be a rational moral agent. Nay, according to their ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, there is no poſſibility of leading by efficacious grace any man to a repentence which is of a holy or of a moral nature: becauſe according to their ſyſtem, a neceſſary holineſs is no holineſs, and a neceſſary repentance is no more of a moral nature, than the working of a machine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IF all who are ſaved, be delivered from wrath on account of the merit of Chriſt in any ſenſe, then that puniſhment, which leads to repentance, is not the curſe of the law, or is not all the puniſhment which juſtice admits. They who ſuffer the curſe of the law, ſatisfy the law, and therefore ſtand in no need of the merit of Chriſt to ſatisfy the law or to deliver them from the curſe of it. They can no longer conſiſtently with juſtice be holden under that curſe. To hold ſuch perſons ſtill under the curſe of the law, unleſs they can obtain an intereſt in the merit of Chriſt, can never be reconciled with the moral perfection of God. Yet this is the very fact, if that puniſhment which leads to repentance be the curſe of the law and at the ſame time, as Dr. C. abundantly holds, ſalvation in the deliverance from wrath, as well as in the beſtowment of poſitive happineſs, be granted to no man, but on account of the merit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. ON this hypotheſis, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt will not ſave all men, nor will all men be ſaved, whether by Chriſt, or without him.—Deliverance from the curſe of the law is eſſential to ſalvation. But if the curſe of the law be that puniſhment, which is neceſſary to lead to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:022478_0034_0FB9358D004D4540"/>
repentance; and if, as the advocates for univerſal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hold, a great part of mankind will ſuffer this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it follows, that a great part of mankind will not be ſaved. For to be ſaved, and yet to ſuffer the curſe of the law, is a direct contradiction. To ſuffer the curſe of the law is to be damned, and is all the damnation to which any ſinner is expoſed, and to which juſtice, the moſt ſtrict and rigorous juſtice, can doom him. If then any man have ſuffered this damnation, from what is he or can he be ſaved? Certainly from nothing, becauſe he is expoſed to nothing: unleſs we ſay, that by the <hi>juſt</hi> law of the God of <hi>perfect juſtice,</hi> he is expoſed to <hi>unjuſt</hi> pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment.</p>
               <p>IF to this argument it be objected, that though all men are not ſaved from the curſe of the law, whether by Chriſt, or without him; yet all are finally admitted to happineſs; thoſe who repent in this life, are admitted to happineſs through the merits of Chriſt; thoſe who die impenitent, are admitted to the ſame, in conſequence of enduring in their own perſons, the curſe of the law: and that this is all which is intended by the ſalvation of all men:—with reſpect to this I obſerve.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) THIS is no proper <hi>ſalvation,</hi> which in its primary meaning ſignifies a deliverance from evil. But accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the caſe now ſtated, ſome men are not deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered from any evil, to which they ever were expoſed; but ſuffer it all. Therefore they are not ſaved.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) That this objection entirely ſets aſide, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to a great part of mankind, ſalvation in the way of forgiveneſs of ſin, and the free grace of God in the pardon of the ſinner, which is contrary to the whole goſpel.</p>
               <p>But to proceed; as Chriſt, on the preſent hypotheſis, doth not in fact ſave all men; ſo it would be no favour to them, for him to attempt the ſalvation of all thoſe who die impenitent. An attempt to deliver them from the curſe of the law, would be an attempt to deprive them of the moſt neceſſary, wiſe, deſirable and merciful means of grace, on which their eternal happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends: an attempt not to deliver them from any thing which on the whole is an evil, a diſadvantage even to themſelves; but to deprive them of that on which their
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:022478_0035_0FB9359236986120"/>
ſupreme intereſt depends; of that which is in fact the greateſt good, which they, in their preſent temper can enjoy, and the greateſt bleſſing which at preſent God can poſſibly beſtow on them.—Now to deprive them of this, is certainly no favour, nor any fruit of grace, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or goodneſs to them perſonally. Even to take them to heaven, before they have paſſed through this diſcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line would by no means be ſo great a favour to them, as to cauſe them to paſs through this diſcipline; as it would be to take them to heaven before they were prepared for it, or could enjoy happineſs in it.</p>
               <p>FURTHER; if the curſe of the law be that puniſhment, which is neceſſary to lead to repentance, then Chriſt came not to deliver from the curſe of the law, all who are to be finally happy, but to inflict that curſe on a part of them. Chriſt is exalted to be a prince and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to give repentance and forgiveneſs of ſins. It is a part of his office, to bring men to repentance, by all wiſe and proper means. Dr. C. and other advocates for univerſal ſalvation, ſuppoſe, that hell torments are the means, and moſt wiſe, proper and neceſſary means too, by which Chriſt will execute the work of giving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to all the damned. Therefore his work as a ſaviour, ſo far as reſpects <hi>them,</hi> is, on Dr. C's plan, not to deliver them from the curſe of the law, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict that curſe on them. But who is not ſtruck with the contrariety of this idea, to the conſtant, uniform declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſcripture, that Chriſt came to redeem us from the curſe of the law, to ſave us from wrath, to deliver us from the wrath to come, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>WILL it be ſaid in oppoſition to the laſt obſervation, that thoſe who die in impenitence, are not ſaved in any ſenſe by or through Chriſt, whether by his atonement, or by him as God's prime miniſter, in the fulneſs of times bringing all to repentance; and that therefore Chriſt is not come to inflict the curſe of the law on any who ſhall be finally happy? Then let it never more be pleaded, that Chriſt is the ſaviour of all men; that he gave himſelf a ranſom for all; that he taſted death for every man; that the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto the many, (meaning all men) that by the righteouſneſs of one the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:022478_0036_0FB9359AAE10F800"/>
free gift ſhall come upon all men to juſtification of life; that Chriſt muſt reign, till he ſhall have put all enemies under his feet, in genuine repentance; that peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made by the blood of the croſs, it pleaſed the father <hi>by Chriſt</hi> to reconcile all things to himſelf. For if Chriſt ſhall not finally have ſaved all men by his merit, nor ſhall have led them to repentance in the execution of the ſcheme of providence; in what ſenſe can the ſalvation of all men be aſcribed to Chriſt? In what conceivable ſenſe can he be called the Saviour of all men?—Therefore if any adopt the idea of the objection juſt ſtated, let them never more plead in favour of the ſalvation of all men, any of thoſe paſſages of ſcripture referred to above, nor any paſſage, which relates to ſalvation by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>BESIDE; if the damned be led to repentance by the torments of hell, by whom are thoſe torments inflicted? Not by Chriſt it ſeems, becauſe that would imply, that Chriſt came not to deliver all who ſhall be finally happy, from the curſe of the law; but to inflict that curſe on a part of them. By whom then will thoſe torments, thoſe moſt excellent means of grace, be adminiſtered? Is not Chriſt the judge of all men? The father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the ſon. We muſt all ſtand at his judgment ſeat and receive according to that which we ſhall have done in the body whether good or evil: and he will ſay; Depart, ye curſed, into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</p>
               <p n="4">4. IF the penalty of the law conſiſt in that puniſhment, which is neceſſary to lead to repentance, then all the damned, if brought to repentance at all, are delivered out of hell, not on the footing of <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> or of <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> and <hi>goodneſs;</hi> but on the footing of the ſtricteſt juſtice; not on the footing of the goſpel, but of the rigour of law.—By the preſent hypotheſis, the damned all ſuffer that puniſhment, which is neceſſary to lead them to repentance, and therein ſuffer the curſe of the law, or all that puniſhment which the utmoſt rigour of law and juſtice denounces or can inflict. If the Deity himſelf were to proceed in puniſhing, one ſtep beyond this line, he would exceed the bounds of juſtice, would riſe in oppoſition to his own perfections, would deny himſelf; in ſhort, would no longer be God. Therefore as ſoon as a ſinner
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:022478_0037_0FB9359FE7E833A8"/>
in hell is brought to repentance, he muſt be immediately releaſed. Nor is he under obligation to plead for grace or favour; he may demand rele<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> on the footing of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal juſtice. He is under no neceſſity to have recourſe to the goſpel, he may inſiſt on his perſonal right, on the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the law. He hath ſatisfied the law; he hath ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the juſtice of God; it hath taken its courſe on him; he hath nothing more to fear from it; and he muſt be delivered from further puniſhment or elſe he is injured, he is oppreſſed.</p>
               <p>NAY; to plead for mercy or favour in order to his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, is not merely needleſs; it is out of character, it is degrading himſelf who ſtands right with reſpect to the law, to the place of one who is obnoxious to ſtill further puniſhment. It implies that he is ignorant of his own character and relation to the Deity and his law. Equally out of character would he act, if on his deliverance, he ſhould render praiſe or thanks, either to God the father, or to his ſon Jeſus Chriſt. Surely a man condemned by a civil judge, to receive forty ſtripes ſave one, after he has recived them, is under no obligation to render praiſe or thanks for his releaſe, either to the judge or to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive officer.</p>
               <p>BUT how are theſe things reconcileable with the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Surely theſe conſequences fairly deducible from the hypotheſis under conſideration, are entirely inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the goſpel; and the hypotheſis itſelf cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently be embraced by any believer in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>PARTICULARLY: This hypotheſis precludes all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> of the damned, even, on the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they are finally to be admitted to heavenly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.—Forgivneſs implies, that the ſinner forgiven is not puniſhed in his own perſon, according to law and juſtice. But on the hypotheſis under conſideration in this chapter, all the damned, are in their own perſons puniſhed according to law and juſtice, in that they ſuffer that puniſhment, which is neceſſary to lead them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Who would think of telling a man, who has in his own perſon, received the corporal puniſhment, to which he had been condemned, that the crime for which he received that puniſhment, is freely forgiven him!
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:022478_0038_0FB935A1F8EDE210"/>
This would be adding inſult to the rigour of juſtice.— But according to the ſcriptures, it ſeems there is no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation on the footing of the law, or without forgivneſs. Therefore either it muſt be made to appear, that the ſcriptures do admit the idea, that ſome men will be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to heaven on the footing of law, and without forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins; or the hypotheſis, that the puniſhment, which is ſufficient to lead to repentance, is the curſe of the law, muſt be renounced.</p>
               <p n="5">5. ALL men who are by any means brought to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, whether by the torment of hell or any other cauſe, are on the footing of juſtice entitled to perfect ſubſequent impunity. By the ſuppoſition, the ſole juſt end of all the puniſhment inflicted by the Deity, is the repentance of the ſinner. But this end is already obtained in all who are the ſubjects of repentance. Therefore to puniſh them is to inflict pain or miſery for no juſt end whatever. But that the Deity ſhould inflict miſery for no juſt end, is for him to commit injuſtice and wanton cruelty, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. What then is become of the curſe or penalty of the divine law? The apoſtle declares, "Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them." This ſeems to import, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tranſgreſſor is expoſed to a curſe. But he who tranſgreſſes in ever ſo many inſtances, and then whether ſooner or later repents, whether his repentance be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by mercies, or by judgments, or by any other cauſe, is expoſed to no curſe, no puniſhment whatever; nor can without injuſtice be made the ſubject of any. On this ſcheme, if there be any curſe in the law, it muſt, be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance itſelf.</hi> By the curſe of the law, is doubtleſs meant the ill conſequence, to which the ſinner is by law and juſtice ſubjected, on account of his tranſgreſſion.— BUT according to the ſcheme now before us, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whenſoever and by what cauſe ſoever it may exiſt in a ſinner, is all the ill conſequence (if it may be ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to which he is by law and juſtice ſubjected on account of any ſin or ſins. This therefore with reſpect to him is the whole curſe of the law, and can this be true? "Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us." But hath Chriſt redeemed us from <hi>repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance?</hi> and did he effect that redemption, by becoming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a penitent?</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:022478_0039_0FB935A3772F3280"/>6. ON the hypotheſis, that no man can be juſtly pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed for any other end, than his own perſonal good; no man commits any ſin or moral evil, by any damage which he does, or can do, to any being beſide himſelf; and the whole evil of ſin conſiſts in this, that by it a man does more or leſs damage to himſelf; but he never does, nor can poſſibly commit ſin, by diſhonouring or doing damage to any other being created or divine, only ſo far as, in the ſame action, he does damage to himſelf personally conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered—If God never do nor can juſtly puniſh a ſinner, for any other end, than to lead him to repentance and to promote his good; and if all juſt puniſhment be a mere diſcipline neceſſary and wholeſome to the recipient; then puniſhment inflicted for any other end is unjuſt. It is unjuſt to puniſh a ſinner on account of any contempt of the Deity, any oppoſition to his deſigns, to his cauſe or kingdom in the world, or on account of any abuſes of any man or men, excepting ſo far as he damages himſelf at the ſame time. If it be juſt to puniſh a ſinner for any of thoſe ſins, further, or in any other reſpect, than as he damages himſelf; it is juſt to puniſh him for other end or ends, than his own perſonal good; which is contrary to the ſuppoſition.—But if it be unjuſt to puniſh for actions in any other reſpect than as in thoſe actions a man damages himſelf or his own intereſt; it muſt be becauſe there is no moral evil in thoſe actions, on any other account, or in any other view of them, than that by them he does a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to himſelf, and the whole evil of ſin muſt conſiſt in this, that it is diſadvantageous to the ſinner's own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt or happineſs. The end of all puniſhment is the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val or prevention of evil: and the evil to be removed or prevented by puniſhment, and which is the only ground of puniſhment, is the only evil of ſin. But the hypotheſis which we are oppoſing throughout this chapter is, that the only juſt ends of puniſhment, are the repentance and good of the ſinner himſelf; that is, the removal or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of perſonal evil to the ſinner, is the only juſt end of puniſhing him. Of courſe this perſonal evil to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is the only juſt ground of puniſhing him, and is the whole evil of ſin.</p>
               <p>NOW if this be the whole evil of ſin, and it deſerve puniſhment on no other account than this; no wonder
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:022478_0040_0FB935A4F08B0850"/>
there is ſuch oppoſition made to the doctrine of endleſs puniſhment. For truly, if the nature and evil of ſin be ſuch, as hath been juſt now ſtated, not only the <hi>endleſs</hi> puniſhment of it is unjuſt, but any puniſhment of however ſhort duration is unjuſt; becauſe ſin carries its own full puniſhment in itſelf. All that puniſhment which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, is either contained in ſin at the time it is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or it follows afterward, as a natural and neceſſary conſequence, without any pain inflicted by the Deity; and to inflict any the leaſt pain on the ſinner, as a puniſhment of his ſin, is manifeſtly unjuſt and abſurd.—If a child, in conſequence of thruſting its finger into a candle, ſhould ſuffer great pain, ſurely it would not, beſide that pain, deſerve chaſtiſement: becauſe all the evil of its impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence conſiſts in bringing on itſelf that pain, and that pain itſelf is the full puniſhment of the imprudence. Therefore to inflict any further puniſhment muſt be unjuſt and cruel.—To apply this; all the moral evil of which the ſinner is guilty, conſiſts in bringing pain or loſs on himſelf, and to puniſh him for this, is as abſurd, as to puniſh the child juſt ſuppoſed; or to puniſh a man becauſe he will walk with pebbles in his ſhoes, will whip him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or will bring on himſelf the pain of hunger, by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without his ordinary meal.</p>
               <p n="7">7. ON this hypotheſis, he that repenteth, ſhall be ſaved, from what? from that wiſe, wholeſome and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary diſcipline, which cannot be juſtly inflicted, after he becomes a penitent; or in other words, he ſhall be ſaved from a puniſhment which is entirely unjuſt.—Therefore the promiſes of ſalvation to thoſe who repent, amount to nothing more than aſſurances; that GOD will not abuſe, injure or rob them of their <hi>perſonal</hi> rights. But do we want ſo many "exceeding great and precious promiſes," to aſſure us of this? Or are theſe promiſes ſo exceeding great and precious, as it ſeems they were in the judgment of an apoſtle? Have we not abundant evidence of the ſame truth, from the moral rectitude of the Deity, without the aid of even a ſingle promiſe?</p>
               <p n="8">8. IF the ſinner deſerve no more puniſhment, than is neceſſary to lead to repentance, then he experiences much
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:022478_0041_0FB935A682590748"/>
more of the grace and mercy of GOD, while he is <hi>in hell,</hi> than he does while he is on earth, or than he does in his deliverance <hi>from</hi> hell. In hell he enjoys thoſe means of grace which are far better and more wiſely and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally calculated to ſecure his everlaſting happineſs, than thoſe means which he enjoys on earth. In hell he receives real and demonſtrative tokens of the divine grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in that diſcipline which is ſo neceſſary and ſo happily conducive to his everlaſting happineſs. But in deliverance from hell on his repentance, he receives <hi>no favour</hi>; his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance is a mere act of juſtice which cannot be denied him.</p>
               <p n="9">9. ON the ſame hypotheſis, the curſe of the law, and the greateſt, moſt neceſſary and moſt deſirable mean of grace with reſpect to the impenitent, are one and the ſame thing. This is ſo plain, that not a word need be ſaid to elucidate it. Therefore if Chriſt were to ſave any man from the curſe of the law, he would deprive him of the beſt mean of grace, which he does or can enjoy; and this ſalvation itſelf, ſo far from a bleſſing to the ſinner, would be an infinitely greater curſe, then the curſe of the law; becauſe it would deprive him of a neceſſary and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent mean of grace, the puniſhment which is neceſſary to lead him to repentance. Nor would the gift of Chriſt himſelf, his incarnation, ſufferings, death, atonement, or any thing which he hath done, or can poſſibly do, to ſave us from the curſe of the law, be any favour or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the perſon to be ſaved, but utterly the reverſe. It is evidently no bleſſing to any man perſonally, but the reverſe, that any meaſures ſhould be taken to deprive him of the beſt and moſt neceſſary mean of grace, without which he would not be prepared for heaven and could not be admitted to it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. THE doctrine, that the ſinner deſerves no more puniſhment, than is neceſſary to lead to repentance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes itſelf in this reſpect; that while it holds forth, that no puniſhment can juſtly be inflicted on the ſinner, but that which is merely <hi>diſciplinary,</hi> at the ſame time it ſuppoſes, that ſuch a puniſhment is in fact inflicted on all the damned, as is to the higheſt degree <hi>vindictive.</hi> What is a proper
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:022478_0042_0FB935A7F9913A78"/>
vindictive puniſhment, but that which ſatisfies the demands of law and <hi>juſtice</hi>? But that ſuch a puniſhment is inflicted on all the damned, is ſuppoſed by all who eſpouſe the principle, which I am now oppoſing. Therefore in that very doctrine, in which they mean to oppoſe all vindictive puniſhment, they in the fulleſt ſenſe hold it, by holding that ſuch puniſhment as is conducive to the good of the ſufferer, is all which juſtice admits.</p>
               <p>IF they ſhould ſay, that the puniſhment of the damned is not <hi>merely</hi> vindictive; but at the ſame time diſciplinary too, and therefore juſt: though if it were <hi>merely</hi> vindic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, it would be <hi>unjuſt:</hi> I anſwer, the preſent queſtion entirely reſpects puniſhment which is <hi>merely</hi> diſciplinary. Therefore to allow, that the puniſhment of the damned is partly vindictive, is to give up this queſtion, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute another.—Beſide; if a vindictive puniſhment be unjuſt, how can it become juſt by being connected with a puniſhment, which is juſt? To correct a child, to gratify a malicious temper, is doubtleſs unjuſt. Now, if a man correct his child from two motives, partly from malice, and partly from a view to the good of the child; the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his conduct, ſo far as he is influenced by the latter motive, can never render his conduct juſt, ſo far as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the former.</p>
               <p>A vindictive puniſhment is that which is inflicted with a deſign to ſupport the authority of a broken law, and of a diſpiſed government: And if the puniſhment be juſt, it is at the ſame time according to the conduct or demerit of the tranſgreſſor. This is demanded by every law; and if the law be juſt, it is juſtly demanded: Or in other words, ſuch a puniſhment of the tranſgreſſion of a juſt law, as is ſufficient to ſupport the authority of that law, is a juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. At the ſame time it is a puniſhment as truly, and to as high a degree vindictive, as juſtice will admit. Now if that puniſhment which is neceſſary to lead the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to repentance, be ſufficient thus to ſupport the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and dignity of the divine law and government, and be inflicted for this end; it is to the higheſt degree vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive, and deſignedly vindictive. If it be not ſufficient to anſwer thoſe ends, it is not the whole puniſhment,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:022478_0043_0FB935AA55963EC0"/>
which the divine law and juſtice demand: For as I have before obſerved, every juſt and wiſe law demands that puniſhment which is neceſſary to its own ſupport or exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and juſtice and wiſdom enforce this demand.</p>
               <p>Therefore let the advocates for univerſal ſalvation make their choice. If they ſhall chooſe to hold agreeably to the preſent ſuppoſition, that ſuch puniſhment as is neceſſary to lead to repentance, is all that can juſtly be inflicted on the ſinner, and that therefore it is ſufficient to ſupport the authority and dignity of the divine law and government; they ſtand convicted of holding, that the puniſhment of the damned is by no means merely diſciplinary, but to the higheſt degree vindictive. If on the other hand, they chooſe to hold, that the puniſhment which is neceſſary to lead the ſinner to repentance, is not adequate to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes before mentioned; then they muſt renounce the principle, which we have been ſo long conſidering, and allow the divine law does denounce a further puniſhment, than that which is neceſſary to lead the ſinner to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and is a mere diſcipline. Becauſe the divine law being perfectly juſt, does juſtly, and muſt neceſſarily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of that puniſhment, which is ſufficient to its own ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or exiſtence.—Thus on either ſuppoſition, they muſt renounce a very favourite tenet.</p>
               <p n="11">11. WITH what propriety can we talk of ſatisfying the law by repentance, or by that puniſhment, which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to lead to repentance; when the law ſays not a word expreſsly concerning repentance, either in conſequence of puniſhment, or without it? By the law is the knowledge of ſin; but by it we know nothing of any good, to be obtained by repentance, whether in the way of favour, or in the way of juſtice. The doctrine of any advantage to be obtained by repentance, is a doctrine of the goſpel only, not of the law. Yet if it be unjuſt to puniſh a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with any other view, than to lead him to repentance, this doctrine would undoubtedly be found in the law. The voice of the law is, not curſed is every one that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth, and doth not repent: But curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them.</p>

                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:022478_0044_0FB935AC6DD594E0"/>12. From the principle, that ſin deſerves no other pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, than that which is ſubſervient to the good of the ſinner, it will follow, that what we call ſin, is no <hi>moral evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT ſeems to be a dictate of reaſon and the common ſenſe of mankind, that moral evil ſhould be followed, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be followed, with natural evil or with pain and ſhame: and that this natural evil be a real evil to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, an evil to him on the whole. But that evil, which is neceſſary and ſubſervient to a man's perſonal good, is to him no real evil; but on the whole is, even to him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, a good, a bleſſing, and not a curſe. Now it is not a dictate of reaſon and common ſenſe, that moral evil deſerves a bleſſing. That which deſerves a bleſſing and no curſe, is no moral evil. Therefore if ſin deſerve no other puniſhment than that which is ſubſervient to the perſonal good of the ſinner, it is no moral evil.</p>
               <p>IF it be ſaid to be no dictate of common ſenſe, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil ſhould be followed with natural evil: it may be anſwered, that ſurely it is not a dictate of common ſenſe, that it be followed, with natural good. This would imply, that it deſerves a reward.—Nor is it a dictate of common ſenſe, that it be followed with neither natural good nor natural evil. This would imply, that it is worthy of neither praiſe nor blame, reward nor puniſhment; and therefore is neither a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good nor a moral evil. Both which concluſions are abſurd. Therefore it remains, that it is a dictate of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and common ſenſe, that moral evil be followed with natural evil.—Or if it be further urged, that it is a dictate of common ſenſe, that moral evil conſidering the <hi>infinite goodneſs and mercy of God,</hi> ſhould be followed with no natural evil; it is to be obſerved, that this is giving up the ground of juſtice, and going on that of goodneſs and mercy, which is entirely foreign to the ſubject of this chapter. The inquiry of this chapter is what ſin deſerves <hi>on the footing of juſtice,</hi> not what it will actually ſuffer on the footing the divine infinite <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>mercy.</hi> This latter inquiry ſhall be carefully attended to in its place, chapter VIII.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:022478_0045_0FB935B3A82C3DA0"/>AGAIN; Moral evil is in itſelf, or in its own nature, odious and the proper object of diſapprobation and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. By its own nature I mean its tendency to evil, the diſhonour of the Deity and the miſery or diminution of the happineſs of the created ſyſtem. Therefore it is not injurious to the perſon who perpetrates moral evil, to diſapprove, hate and abhor it in itſelf, aſide from all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the conſequences of ſuch diſapprobation, whether ſuch conſequences be to the perpetrator perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good or bad. Hence it follows, that it is not injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the perpetrator of moral evil, to manifeſt diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of his conduct, ſo far as morally evil, whether ſuch manifeſtation be ſubſervient to his good or not. And if <hi>ſin</hi> be a moral evil, it is not injurious to the ſinner, both to diſapprove, and to manifeſt diſapprobation of ſin, whether ſuch manifeſtation be ſubſervient to his good or not.—But this directly contradicts the principle, that ſin deſerves no other puniſhment, than that which is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the good of the ſinner. For what is puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a manifeſtation of diſapprobation, which a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon veſted with authority has, of the conduct of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? And if it be not injurious to the ſinner, to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his ſin, and to manifeſt that diſapprobation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſubſerve his good or not; then his ſin, or he on account of his ſin, deſerves both diſapprobation, and the manifeſtation of diſapprobation, though that manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not ſubſervient to his perſonal good: which is the ſame thing as to ſay, that the ſinner deſerves puniſhment, whether that puniſhment ſubſerve his own good or not. On the other hand, if it be not juſt to manifeſt diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of ſin, it is not juſt to diſapprove ſin. If it be not juſt to diſapprove or to hate ſin, aſide from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the diſapprobation is conducive to the perſonal good of the ſinner; then ſin is not in itſelf, or in its own nature and tendency, hateful or odious, but becomes odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then only, when the hatred of it conduces to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal good of the ſinner. But if ſin be not in itſelf odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it is not a moral evil; which was the thing to be proved.</p>
               <p>THERE ſeems to be no way to avoid this conſequence
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:022478_0046_0FB935B767E201B8"/>
but by holding, that <hi>moral evil</hi> is not in itſelf odious and abominable, but that it becomes odious then only, when the diſapprobation of it ſubſerves the perſonal good of the perpetrator: which is the ſame as to hold, that moral e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as ſuch, is not at all odious, but is odious in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſe only, when the diſapprobation of it ſubſerves the good of the perpetrator: but in all other caſes, it is a matter of indifferency at leaſt, if not an object of cordial complacency; and therefore in all other caſes is no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil.</p>
               <p>ON the ſuppoſition which I am now oppoſing, when a man ſins and immediately repents, he deſerves no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the end of all puniſhment is already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by his repentance, and a tendency of puniſhment to the repentance of the ſinner, which is the only circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, on the preſent hypotheſis which can juſtify his puniſhment, cannot now be pretended, as a reaſon for his puniſhment. Therefore any puniſhment after repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, muſt be undeſerved and unjuſt. But if ſin be a moral evil or a crime, it is in its own nature diſpleaſing to GOD, and he may juſtly both be diſpleaſed at it, and manifeſt his diſpleaſure; that is, he may puniſh it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſinner repent or not, Repentance though it is a renunciation of ſin in future, makes no alteration in the nature of the ſin which is paſt; nor is it any ſatisfaction for that ſin. If it were, it would be either <hi>the curſe of the law,</hi> or ſuch a meritorius act of virtue, as to balance the demerit of ſin: Neither of which will be pretended. But if the only reaſon why it is, or can be juſt for GOD to ſhew diſpleaſure at ſin, be, that the ſinner may thereby be led to repentance; then ſin itſelf, or the proper nature of ſin, is not a juſt reaſon, why God ſhould either be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, or ſhow diſpleaſure at it. Impenitence or the repetition of ſin or the continuance of the ſinner in it, is on this ſuppoſition, the only juſt reaſon or ground of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpleaſure, or of any manifeſtation of diſpleaſure at ſin. Therefore ſin in general, or ſin as ſuch, deſerves no diſpleaſure or manifeſtation of diſpleaſure; but ſin in ſome particular caſe only, as when it is perſiſted in or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. If we ſhould hold, that ſins committed in the day time, do not deſerve puniſhment; but that thoſe which are committed in the night, do deſerve puniſhment, I
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:022478_0047_0FB935B8A42EF850"/>
think it would be manifeſt to every man, that we denied, that ſin as ſuch, and by the general nature common to all ſins, deſerves puniſhment; and that we confined the deſert of puniſhment to ſomething which is merely accidental, and not at all eſſential to ſin. And is it not manifeſt, that the deſert of puniſhment is as really not extended to the general nature of ſin, but is confined to ſomething merely accidental, when it is aſſerted, that ſin deſerves no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſs it be followed with impenitence? or unleſs it be perſiſted in? or, which is the ſame thing, that no pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment is juſt, except that which is deſigned to lead the ſinner to repentance?</p>
               <p>IF ſin do not by its general nature deſerve puniſhment, it does not by its general nature deſerve the manifeſtation of divine diſpleaſure; becauſe all manifeſtation of divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure at ſin, is puniſhment.—Again, if ſin do not by its general nature deſerve the manifeſtation of divine diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, it does not by its general nature deſerve diſpleaſure it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: and if ſo, it is not by its general nature a moral evil.</p>
               <p>IT appears then, that on the hypotheſis now under conſideration, ſin deſerves neither puniſhment nor hatred, and is no moral evil, unleſs it be followed with impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; or unleſs it be perſiſted in, for at leaſt ſome time. The firſt act of ſin is no moral evil. But if the firſt act be not a moral evil, why is the ſecond, the third, or any ſubſequent act? Impenitence is nothing but a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition or perſeverance in acts the ſame or ſimilar to that of which we do not repent. But if the firſt act, abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſubſequent, be not a moral evil, what reaſon can be aſſigned, why the ſubſequent ſhould be a moral evil? Thus the principle, that ſin deſerves puniſhment ſo far only, as the puniſhment of it tends to the repentance and good of the ſinner, implies, that there is no moral evil in the univerſe, either in the firſt ſin, or in any which follow; none even in impenitence itſelf.—On the other hand, if ſin in all inſtances be a moral evil, it is juſtly to be abhorred by the Deity, whether repentance ſucceed or not: and if it may juſtly be abhorred by the Deity, he may juſtly manifeſt his abhorrence of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repentance ſucceed or not. But to allow this, is to give up the principle, that ſin deſerves no other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than that which is ſubſervient to the repentance and good of the ſinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:022478_0048_0FB935B9FACF3CA0"/>PUNISHMENT is a proper manifeſtation of diſpleaſure, made by a perſon in authority, at ſome crime or moral e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. If ſin, though repented of, be ſtill a moral evil, and the juſt object of the divine diſpleaſure; why is it not juſt, that this diſpleaſure ſhould be manifeſted? But the manifeſtation of the divine diſpleaſure at moral evil, is puniſhment.—If on the other hand, it be an injurious treatment of a ſinner, that the Deity ſhould, after repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, manifeſt his diſpleaſure at him, on account of his ſin; then doubtleſs it is injurious in the Deity to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with him on account of his ſin, of which he has repented. Again; if it be injurious in the Deity to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with a man on account of his ſin, after he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted from it in repentance, why is it not injurious to be diſpleaſed with him, on account of his paſt ſin, though he is ſtill perſiſting in ſin? If one act of murder be not the proper object of the abhorrence of all holy intelligences, creator and creatures why are two or one hundred acts of murder proper objects of abhorrence. Add nought to itſelf as often as you pleaſe, you can never make it ſomething.—So that by this principle we ſeem to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily led to this concluſion, that no man on account of any ſin whatever, whether repented of or not, can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with juſtice be made the object of divine abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or diſpleaſure, and conſequently that ſin in no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whatever is a moral evil.</p>
               <p>ON the principle which I am now oppoſing, whenever a man commits any ſin, for inſtance murder, neither God, nor man hath any right to <hi>manifeſt</hi> diſpleaſure at his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, or even to be diſpleaſed with it, till two things are fully known; firſt whether the murderer do or do not repent; ſecondly, whether diſpleaſure in this caſe, or the manifeſtation of diſpleaſure, will conduce to the happineſs of the murderer. If he do repent, no intelligent being hath a right, on the footing of juſtice, to be diſpleaſed; nor even if he be impenitent, unleſs it be known for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, that the diſpleaſure of the perſon, who is inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether he have a right to be diſpleaſed or not, will conduce to the repentance and good of the murderer. To ſay otherwiſe; to ſay that we have a right in juſtice to be diſpleaſed with the conduct of a murderer, though he does repent, or though ſuch diſpleaſure does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:022478_0049_0FB935BB73E81DD0"/>
to his repentance and happineſs, is to give up the principle in queſtion. For if we may juſtly be diſpleaſed with his conduct, though he is penitent, or though our diſpleaſure does not conduce to his perſonal happineſs; we may juſtly manifeſt our diſpleaſure. But manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſpleaſure, eſpecially by a ruler, at the miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a ſubject, is puniſhment.</p>
               <p>ONCE more; on the ſuppoſition that we have no right to be diſpleaſed with murder, unleſs our diſpleaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the good of the murderer; if there be any moral evil or turpitude in murder, it conſiſts not in the murder itſelf, or in the malicious action of murder; but wholly in this circumſtance attending it, that diſpleaſure at it, conduces to the perſonal good of the murderer.</p>
               <p>PERHAPS it may be objected to the reaſoning in the laſt argument, that if it prove any thing, it proves too much, and therefore really proves nothing; that if ſin, or any crime, do in all caſes, and on account of its own <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and turpitude, deſerve diſapprobation and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will follow, that it deſerves the ſame, even after it has been puniſhed according to ſtrict diſtributive juſtice; that after ſuch puniſhment the nature of the crime is the ſame which it was before; that the crime therefore is ſtill the proper object of diſapprobation, and of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of diſapprobation; and on the ground of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding reaſoning, deſerves an additional puniſhment, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has been once puniſhed according to ſtrict diſtributive juſtice; which is abſurd.</p>
               <p>TO this it may be anſwered, that a crime conſidered in connection with its juſt and full puniſhment, is not that crime conſidered, <hi>in itſelf,</hi> or <hi>in its own nature mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Water mingled with wine, and thus become a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſubſtance, is no longer mere water. The prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding reaſoning ſuppoſes, that a crime in its own nature and tendency deſerves diſapprobation and the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſapprobation. But a crime taken with the full puniſhment of it which is according to ſtrict diſtributive juſtice, and conſidered in this complex view, or that crime and the juſt puniſhment of it conſidered as one complex object, is not that crime conſidered <hi>in itſelf</hi> and <hi>in its own nature merely.</hi> Therefore although the crime conſidered in itſelf deſerves puniſhment, yet conſidered
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:022478_0050_0FB935BCF38A88C8"/>
in the complex view juſt ſtated, it deſerves not additional puniſhment.—And whereas it is implied in the object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion now under conſideration, that a crime even after it has been puniſhed according to ſtrict diſtributive juſtice, is ſtill the juſt object of diſapprobation, and therefore that diſapprobation may juſtly be manifeſted even by the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, or the crime may be puniſhed; it is to be obſerved, that the whole force of this reaſoning depends on the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the expreſſion, <hi>a crime even after it has been puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to ſtrict diſtributive juſtice, is ſtill the juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of diſapprobation.</hi> If the meaning of that expreſſion be, that the crime conſidered in its own nature and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and as abſtracted from the puniſhment or any thing done to prevent the ill effect of the crime, is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object of diſapprobation, and is an event moſt ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be deprecated, or it is moſt ardently to be wiſhed, that it might never have come into exiſtence, and in this ſenſe, it is the juſt object of diſapprobation and of the manifeſtation of diſapprobation: this is undoubtedly true, and no ill conſequence to the preceding reaſoning will follow. But if the meaning of that expreſſion be, that a crime conſidered in connection with its juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the good effects of that puniſhment, as one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex object, is a proper object of diſapprobation, ſo that it is proper to wiſh, that this complex object had not come into exiſtence; it is not true that in this ſenſe a crime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has been puniſhed according to ſtrict diſtributive juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, is ſtill the juſt object of diſapprobation. There have doubtleſs been many inſtances of crimes in civil ſociety, which taken with the juſt puniſhments inflicted on them, have been on the whole the occaſion of great good to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, have eſtabliſhed government and preſerved the peace of ſociety longer and more effectually, than would have been the caſe, had no ſuch crimes been committed. Therefore the exiſtence of thoſe crimes taken with the puniſhments, as one complex object, is no proper object of diſapprobation or deprecation, but of acquieſcence and joy: becauſe in this connection they tend not to impair, but eſtabliſh and promote the general good. In this ſenſe any crime or any ſin, after it has been puniſhed according to ſtrict diſtributive juſtice, is not the juſt object of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and therefore not of the manifeſtation of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:022478_0051_0FB935BF30165D20"/>
or of puniſhment.—So that the foregoing reaſoning will not prove that a ſin or crime, once pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed according to ſtrict diſtributive juſtice, deſerves an additional puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The eſſence of moral evil is, that it tends to impair the good and happineſs of the univerſe: in that the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of ſin or of moral evil conſiſts. And a puniſhment in the diſtributive ſenſe juſt, is that puniſhment inflicted on the perſon of the ſinner, which effectually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents any ill conſequence to the good of the univerſe, of the ſin or crime puniſhed. Now therefore ſin taken with the juſt puniſhment of it, no more tends to impair the good of the univerſe, than poiſon taken with an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual antidote, tends to deſtroy the life of him who takes it.</p>
               <p>Objection. 1. IF ſin taken with its juſt puniſhment, do not tend to impair the good of the univerſe, and if the eſſence of moral evil conſiſt in its tendency to impair the good of the univerſe, it ſeems that ſin taken with its juſt puniſhment is no ſin at all. Anſwer: It is indeed not <hi>mere</hi> ſin. It is no more ſin, than poiſon taken with its antidote, is poiſon. That poiſon which is mixed with the antidote, if it were ſeparated from the antidote, would produce the ſame effects, is of the ſame tendency, and conſequently of the ſame nature, as before the mixture. Yet the compound made by the mixture, produces no ſuch effects, is of no ſuch tendency, and conſequently is of a very different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So any ſin which is puniſhed according to ſtrict ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, abſtracted from the puniſhment, is of the ſame ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and nature, of which it was before the puniſhment. Yet that ſin taken with its full and juſt puniſhment, as one complex object, is of a very different tendency and nature, and will be followed with no ſuch effects as would have followed from it, had it not been puniſhed. In this ſenſe, ſin taken with its full and juſt puniſhment is indeed no ſin at all.</p>
               <p>Objection. 2. If the ſinner do not deſerve puniſhment, when the ill conſequences of his ſin are prevented by his perſonal puniſhment; why does he deſerve puniſhment, when the ill conſequences are prevented by the ſufferings of his ſubſtitute?—Anſwer. Deſert and ill deſert are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the character of the perſon himſelf, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of his repreſentative or ſubſtitute. Now ſatisfaction for a crime by perſonal ſuffering is as really a
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:022478_0052_0FB935C0B4766F68"/>
part of the criminal's perſonal character, as the crime itſelf. But ſatisfaction by the ſuffering of another, is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> part of the perſonal character of the criminal.</p>
               <p>IF then on the whole, it be an eſtabliſhed point, that on the ſuppoſition that no other puniſhment can be juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the ſinner, than that which is neceſſary for his repentance and happineſs, ſin is no moral evil; this will be attended with many other conſequences equally, or if poſſible, ſtill more abſurd:</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT ſin deſerves no puniſhment at all. Surely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but moral evil deſerves puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THAT neither ſin itſelf, nor we as ſinners are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the divine diſapprobation.</p>
               <p n="3">3, THAT neither ought we to diſapprove it, whether in ourſelves or others.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THAT repentance is no duty of any man; yea, it is poſitively wrong. Shall we repent of an innocent action?</p>
               <p n="5">5. THAT the calamities which God brings on men in this life, are not reconcileable with juſtice. That theſe cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in general are puniſhments or demonſtrations of God's diſpleaſure at the ſins of mankind, is manifeſt from the ſcriptures. This is eſpecially manifeſt concerning the moſt extraordinary and unuſual calamities which in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are mentioned to have befallen communities or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals; as the flood of Noah, the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, the deſtruction of Jeruſalem and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the Chaldeans, and afterwards by the Romans, the death of Korah, Dathan and Abiram, of Nadab and Abihu, of Uzzah, &amp;c. &amp;c. But all theſe puniſhments were unjuſt, if ſin be no moral evil.</p>
               <p n="6">6. THAT there is no foundation in any human actions or characters, for praiſe or blame, reward or puniſhment. If ſin be no moral evil, it is not blameable; and if ſin or vice do not deſerve blame or puniſhment, virtue which is the oppoſite, does not deſerve praiſe or reward: and all moral diſtinctions are groundleſs, as in a moral view there is no difference between virtue and vice, ſin and holineſs. Therefore there is no moral government in the univerſe, nor any foundation for it.</p>
               <p>I NOW appeal to the reader, with regard to the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the preceding remarks, and whether the abſurdities before mentioned, be not indeed implied in the hypotheſis,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:022478_0053_0FB935C242CBDDB8"/>
that the ſinner can, conſiſtently with juſtice, be made to ſuffer no other puniſhment, than that which is diſciplinary or conducive to the good of the ſufferer, by leading him to repentance and preparing him for happineſs. If thoſe abſurdities juſtly follow, not the leaſt doubt can remain, but that the principle from which they follow, is abſurd and falſe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Whether the damned will <hi>in fact</hi> ſuffer any other puniſhment, than that which is conducive to their perſonal good.</head>
               <p>IN the laſt chapter the ſubject of inquiry was, whether the damned ſinner <hi>deſerve,</hi> according to ſtrict juſtice and the law of God, any other puniſhment, than that which is neceſſary to lead to repentance and prepare for happineſs. But though it ſhould be granted, that he does indeed deſerve a further or greater puniſhment, than that which is ſufficient for the ends juſt mentioned; yet it may be pleaded, that in fact he never will ſuffer any other pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment; that in hell the damned are puniſhed with the ſole deſign of leading them to repentance; that when this deſign ſhall have been accompliſhed, whatever further puniſhment they may deſerve, will be graciouſly remitted, and they immediately received to celeſtial felicity. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be indeed the truth, is the ſubject of our preſent inquiry.—With regard to this ſubject, I have to propoſe the following conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the damned do indeed deſerve more puniſhment, than is ſufficient barely to lead them to repentance; then they may, conſiſtently with juſtice, be made in fact to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more. That they may conſiſtently with juſtice be made to ſuffer according to their demerits, is a ſelf-evident pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. To puniſh them ſo far, is not at all inconſiſtent with the juſtice of God, therefore the objection drawn from the juſtice of God againſt vindictive puniſhment as oppoſed to mere diſcipline, muſt be wholly relinquiſhed. A merely diſciplinary puniſhment is one which is ſuited and deſigned to lead the ſinner to repentance only. A vindic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive puniſhment is one which is deſigned to be a teſtimony of the diſpleaſure of God at the conduct of the ſinner, and
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:022478_0054_0FB935C3C463D720"/>
by that teſtimony, to ſupport the authority of the divine law, ſubſerve the general good, and thus ſatisfy juſtice: and it muſt be no more than adequate to the demerit of the ſinner. I do not find that Dr. C. has in his whole book, given us a definition of a vindictive puniſhment, as he ought moſt certainly to have done. According to Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>Ramſay's</hi> definition of divine vindictive juſtice, vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive puniſhment is,
<q>That diſpenſation of God, by which he purſues vice with all ſorts of torments, till it is totally extirpated, deſtroyed and annihilated.</q>
                  <note place="bottom">Principles, Vol. I. P. 434.</note> What then is a diſciplinary puniſhment? This definition perfectly confounds diſciplinary and vindictive puniſhment.</p>
               <p>IF it be juſt to puniſh a ſinner according to his demerit; as it certainly is by the very terms; and if ſuch a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be greater than is ſufficient to lead him to repentance merely; as is now ſuppoſed: then all objections drawn from the juſtice of God, againſt a vindictive puniſhment, and all arguments from the ſame topic, in favour of a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment merely diſciplinary, are perfectly groundleſs and futile. The ſinner lies at mercy; and if he be releaſed on his repentance, it is an act of grace, and not of juſtice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IF the damned <hi>do deſerve</hi> more puniſhment than is ſufficient barely to lead them to repentance, they will <hi>in fact</hi> ſuffer more. As it is juſt, ſo juſtice will be executed. That they will be puniſhed according to their demerits, is capable of clear proof, both by the authority of ſcripture, and by that of Dr. C.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) By the authority of ſcripture.—This aſſures us, that God will
<q>render to every man <hi>according to his deeds</hi> to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, indignation and wrath, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul that doth evil,</q>
Rom. II. 6, &amp;c.
<q>For the work of a man, ſhall he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto him, and cauſe every man to find according to his ways,</q>

<q>Behold I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work ſhall be,</q>

<q>Agree with thine adverſary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him: leſt at any time the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be caſt into priſon. Verily I ſay unto thee, Thou ſhalt by no means come out thence, till thou haſt paid the uttermoſt farthing,</q>
Mat. V. 25, 26. In the parallel text in Luke, it is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<q>I tell thee, thou ſhalt not depart thence till thou haſt paid the very laſt mite.</q>
James. II. 13,
<q>He ſhall have judgment without mercy, that hath ſhewed no mercy.</q>
Rev. XIV. 10,
<q>The ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of his indignation? and he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of the holy angels and in the preſence of the Lamb; and the ſmoke of their torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe texts, it is preſumed, ſufficiently ſhew, that we have the authority of ſcripture to prove, that in the future world, the wicked will be puniſhed accoding to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits, and that no mercy will be ſhewn them.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) The ſame truth is evidently holden by Dr. C.— He aſſerts, <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 10.</note>that
<q>there will be no ſalvation for thoſe in the next ſtate, who habitually indulge to luſt in this; but they muſt be unavoidably miſerable, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the infinite benevolence of the Deity, and to a great degree, God only knows how long, <hi>in proportion to the number and greatneſs of their vices.</hi>

That they will ſuffer

                     <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 350.</note>poſitive tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>in proportion to the number and greatneſs of their crimes</hi>:</q>
That
<q>
                     <note n="**" place="bottom">P. 320.</note>there will be a difference in the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of wicked men, according to the difference there has been in the nature and number of their evil deeds:</q>
That "<note n="††" place="bottom">P. 336.</note> if they" [the blaſphmers of the Holy Ghoſt are
<q>
                     <pb n="51" facs="unknown:022478_0056_0FB935C831FEBC90"/>not ſaved till after they have paſſed through theſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</q>
[of hell]
<q>they have never been forgiven.— The divine <hi>law has taken its courſe;</hi> nor has any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening pardon prevented the <hi>full execution of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened penalty.</hi>
                  </q>
Some obſervations have been already <note n="‡‡" place="bottom">P. 2, &amp;c.</note> made on theſe paſſages concerning the blaſphemers of the Holy Ghoſt, to ſhow, that on Dr. C's plan they equally prove, that all the damned are ſaved without forgiveneſs; that the divine law has its courſe on them all; that they all ſuffer the full threatened penalty, and of courſe they ſuffer all that puniſhment which they deſerve.</p>
               <p>THE other quotations ſet this matter in a light equally clear. If the wicked ſhall be puniſhed in proportion to the number and greatneſs of their vices; in proportion to the number and greatneſs of their crimes; according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and number of their evil deeds; in proportion to their deſerts; they will moſt certainly receive the full puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to them according to their demerits, and nothing will be remitted to them.</p>
               <p>THUS it appears both by the authority of ſcripture and alſo by that of Dr. C. that the damned will actually ſuffer all that puniſhment, which they deſerve. And as it is now ſuppoſed to be proved in the preceding chapter, that the damned deſerve a further puniſhment than that which is conducive to their repentance and perſonal good; of courſe it follows, that they will in fact ſuffer ſuch further puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>OBJECTION.—The argument from the ſcriptural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, that the wicked ſhall be puniſhed according to their works &amp;c, to prove, that they will ſuffer all which they juſtly deſerve, is not concluſive; becauſe the ſame expreſſions are uſed concerning the righteous, ſetting forth, <hi>that they ſhall be rewarded according to their works</hi> &amp;c. Yet it is granted on all hands, that their reward is not merely ſuch as they deſerve, or is not ſtrictly according to juſtice.</p>
               <p>ANSWER. The reward of the righteous is indeed not merely ſuch as they deſerve, but infinitely exceeds their deſerts. It is therefore at leaſt equal to their deſerts; or it falls not ſhort of them. If this be allowed concerning the puniſhment of the wicked, it is ſufficient for every purpoſe of the preceding argument. If the wicked ſuffer a puniſhment at leaſt equal to their demerits; then no part of the puniſhment deſerved by them, is remitted to them.
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:022478_0057_0FB935CA9A57F520"/>
Beſide; the declarations of ſcripture are, that the wicked ſhall pay the uttermoſt farthing, the very laſt mite; that they ſhall have judgment without mercy, wrath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture, &amp;c. which are as ſtrong and determinate expreſſions, to repreſent that they will be puniſhed to the full extent of juſtice, as can be conceived.</p>
               <p n="3">3. ALTHOUGH Dr. C. is ſo great an enemy to vindict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive puniſhment; yet he himſelf, holds that men do even in this life ſuffer ſuch puniſhment.
<q>But do thoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his <hi>vengeance</hi> loſe their nature as <hi>judgments</hi> on his part, and <hi>real evils</hi> on their's, becauſe they may be an occaſion of that repentance, which ſhall iſſue in their ſalvation? When God threatened the Jewiſh nation, in caſe they would not do his commandments, with famine, the peſtilence, the ſword, and a diſperſion into all parts of the earth; did he threaten them with a <hi>benefit</hi>? And when thoſe threatenings were for their ſins carried into execution, did he inflict a <hi>bleſſing</hi> on them? When he threatened in particular, that if they where diſobedient, they ſhould be <hi>curſed</hi> in the field, Deut. XXVIII. 16, did he hereby intend, that the <hi>field</hi> ſhould be curſed; but that he meant thereby <hi>a real benefit</hi> to <hi>them</hi>?</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">5 Diſſertations, P. 110.</note>If vindictive puniſhment be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted even in this life, much more may we conclude that it is inflicted in hell, the proper place of retribution to the wicked.</p>
               <p n="4">4. IF the puniſhment of hell be a mere diſcipline hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily conducive to the good of the ſufferers, there is no forgiveneſs in the preſervation of a man from it. It is no forgiveneſs for a parent to give his child a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to tarry from ſchool; or for a phyſician to allow his patient to deſiſt from the cold bath, which he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. Or if a parent, to inure his child to hunger and cold, have kept him for ſome time on a ſcanty diet, and have clothed him but thinly; it is no act of forgiveneſs, to allow the child in future a full diet, or warm cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Forgiveneſs is to remit a <hi>deſerved penalty,</hi> or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from <hi>penal</hi> evil; not to deprive of a benefit, or of any thing which is abſolutely neceſſary to our happineſs, and which is therefore on the whole no real evil, but a real good. If therefore there be nothing more <hi>penal</hi> or <hi>vindictive</hi> in the puniſhment of hell, than in the cold
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:022478_0058_0FB935CBEACE5020"/>
bath, or in the ſcanty diet and thin clothing juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; there is no more of forgiveneſs in exemption from the former, than in exemption from the latter.— Thus the ſcheme of diſciplinary puniſhment in hell leads to a concluſion utterly inconſiſtent with the whole tenor of ſcripture, and of the writings of Dr. C.</p>
               <p n="5">5. ALL thoſe texts which ſpeak of the divine <hi>vengeance, fury, wrath, indignation, fiery</hi> indignation, &amp;c. hold forth ſome other puniſhment, than that which is merely diſciplinary. The texts to which I refer are ſuch as theſe; Deut. XXXII. 41,
<q>If I whet my glittering ſword and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> to mine enemies, and will <hi>reward</hi> them that hate me.</q>
Rom. III. 5, 6,
<q>Is God unrighteous, who taketh <hi>vengeance?</hi>
                  </q>
—"God forbid." Chap. XII. 19, "<hi>Vengeance</hi> is mine: I will <hi>repay</hi> ſaith the Lord." Luke. XXI. 22, "Theſe be the days of <hi>vengeance.</hi>" 2 Theſ. I. 8,

—Job. XX. 23,
<q>When he is about to fill his belly, God ſhall caſt the <hi>fury</hi> of his wrath upon him.</q>
—Iſai. LI. 17,
<q>Awake, awake, ſtand up O Jeruſalem, which haſt drunk at the hand of the Lord, the cup of his <hi>fury</hi>; thou haſt drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.</q>
—Chap. LIX. 18,
<q>According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay <hi>fury</hi> to his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>recompence</hi> to his enemies</q>
&amp;c. Inſtances of the denunciation of <hi>wrath</hi> againſt the wicked, are noted in the margin.<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. III. 7. Luke III. 7, XXI. 23. John III. 36. Rom. IV. 15, V. 9. IX 22. 1 Teſ. I. 10. V. 9.</note>—Rom. II. 8, 9, "<hi>Indignation</hi> and <hi>wrath,</hi> tribulation and anguiſh, upon every ſoul of man that doth evil." Heb. X. 27,
<q>A certain fearful looking for of <hi>judgment,</hi> and <hi>fiery indignation,</hi> which ſhall devour the adverſaries.</q>
See alſo Pſal. L. 22. Heb. XII. 29, Luke. XII. 46.—Rev. XIV. 10. "Shall drink of the wine of the <hi>wrath</hi> of God poured out <hi>without mixture,</hi> into the cup of his <hi>indignation.</hi>" Therefore in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked there will be no mixture of mercy or forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>IT is of no importance, that in ſome of the texts now quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a reference is not had to the puniſhments of the future
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:022478_0059_0FB935D01F1C4390"/>
world, but to thoſe of this life. If God can conſiſtently with his perfections inflict a partial vengeance, why not the whole of that which is juſtly due? If he can and does inflict vengeance in this life, why not in the future too, provided, as is now granted, it be juſt?</p>
               <p>THAT the paſſages now quoted, do indeed ſpeak of a puniſhment more than merely diſciplinary, is manifeſt by the very terms of the paſſages themſelves. To ſay that <hi>vengeance, wrath, fury, indignation, fiery indignation, wrath without mixture,</hi> mean a mere wholeſome, fatherly diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, deſigned for the good only of the ſubjects, is to ſay that the inſpired writers were groſſly ignorant of the proper and common uſe of language; and particularly that they were wholly ignorant of that important diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between vindictive and diſciplinary puniſhment, on which Dr. C. and other writers of his claſs ſo much inſiſt. If vengeance mean fatherly diſcipline, what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vengeance? If it be proper to call fatherly chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vengeance, wrath, fury, fiery indignation, wrath without mixture; by what name is it proper to call a puniſhment really vindictive?</p>
               <p n="6">6. THE ſame may be argued from various other paſſag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of ſcripture, ſome of which I ſhall now cite. 1 Cor. XVI. 22.
<q>If any man love not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be anathema maranatha.</q>
It is abſurd to ſuppoſe, that this curſe means a diſcipline deſigned for the good on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the patients. Such a diſcipline is ſo far from a curſe, that it is a very great bleſſing.—Deut. XXVII. 26, compared with Gal. III. 10,
<q>
                     <hi>Curſed</hi> be he that confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not all the words of this law, to do them.</q>
Deut. XXIX. 19.
<q>And it come to paſs, when he heareth the words of this <hi>curſe,</hi> that he bleſs himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of my heart, to add drunkenneſs to thirſt. The Lord will <hi>not ſpare</hi> him, but the <hi>anger</hi> of the Lord and his <hi>jealouſy</hi> ſhall <hi>ſmoke</hi> againſt that man, and all the <hi>curſes that are written in this book,</hi> ſhall lie upon him, and the Lord will <hi>blot out his name from under heaven.</hi> And the Lord ſhall ſeparate him <hi>unto evil,</hi> out of all the tribes of Iſrael, according to <hi>all the curſes</hi> of the covenant, that are written in this book of the law.</q>
—This text ſeems to be in ſeveral reſpects inconſiſtent with the idea, that

the future puniſhment of the ſinner it merely diſciplinary. IT declares, that "the Lord will not <hi>ſpare</hi> him." But to inflict that puniſhment only, which is far leſs than the ſinner deſerves, and which is not at all vindictive, but wholly conducive to his good, is very greatly to <hi>ſpare</hi> him. It is further ſaid, that the

which is not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion properly and naturally repreſenting the diſcipline, which proceeds from parental affection ſeeking the good on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the child. The ſame may be obſerved of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<q>The Lord ſhall <hi>blot out</hi> his name from under heaven.</q>
It is added,
<q>
                     <hi>All the curſes</hi> that are written <hi>in this book</hi> ſhall lie upon him</q>

<q>And the Lord ſhall ſeparate him unto <hi>evil</hi>—according to <hi>all the curſes</hi> of the covenant, which are written in this book of the <hi>law.</hi>
                  </q>
Theſe laſt expreſſions ſeem to be very determinate. <hi>Curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> are not bleſſings: but that diſcipline which is ſubſervient to the good of the ſubject is a bleſſing. The curſes here mentioned are all the curſes written in this book of Moſes, or the book of the LAW. Therefore ſome men will ſuffer the curſe of the law, even the whole curſe of the law, or all the curſes mentioned in the law; which, by what has come up to our view in the laſt chapter, appears to be more than a diſcipline promoting the good of the ſubject.</p>
               <p>AGAIN; Deut. XI. 26—29,
<q>Behold I ſet before you this day a <hi>bleſſing</hi> and a <hi>curſe.</hi> A bleſſing, if ye will obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you this day; and a <hi>curſe,</hi> if ye will not obey the commandments of the Lord your God.</q>
— Prov. III. 33,
<q>The <hi>curſe</hi> of the Lord is in the houſe of the wicked; but he <hi>bleſſeth</hi> the habitation of the juſt.</q>
—Job XXIV. 18,
<q>Their portion is <hi>curſed</hi> in the earth.</q>

Ibid. chap. XVII. 5,

Mal. I. 14, "<hi>Curſed</hi> be the deceiver," &amp;c Chap. III. 9, "Ye are <hi>curſed</hi> with a curſe." 2 Pet. II. 14, "<hi>Curſed</hi> children."</p>
               <p>BY all theſe texts it appears, that ſome men do or ſhall
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:022478_0061_0FB935D2B319D920"/>
ſuffer the curſe of God. Whether all theſe texts refer to a curſe to be inflicted after death, does not for reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given materially affect the preſent argument. A curſe is undoubtedly a puniſhment which does not promote the good of the ſubject<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> otherwiſe a curſe and a bleſſing are perfectly confounded.</p>
               <p>IF it ſhall ſtill be inſiſted, that the curſe ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, means that puniſhment only, which is conducive to the good of the ſubject: it may be anſwered, then there would be no impropriety in calling the preſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the real diſciples of Chriſt, by the name of a curſe. Why then are they not ſo called in ſcripture? Why are not the real children of God, even the moſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and pious of them, ſaid to be curſed by God, &amp;c.? And why are not the curſes of the wicked, as well as the afflictions of the righteous, ſaid to work together for their good, and to work out for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory? Dr. C. loves to illuſtrate the puniſhment of hell by the diſcipline inflicted by fathers on earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a ſole view to the good of their children. But would it be proper to call the neceſſary, wiſe and wholeſome diſcipline of earthly parents, by the name of a <hi>curſe?</hi> or is it ever ſo called, either by God or man?— Equally abſurd is it, to call the puniſhment of hell by that name, if it be deſigned for the good only of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.</p>
               <p>I beſeech the reader to conſider what a contraſt there is between the texts, which have now been quoted, and thoſe in which a puniſhment really diſciplinary is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſcribed. In the former the puniſhment is called by the names of <hi>vengeance, fury, wrath, ſmoaking</hi> wrath, <hi>fiery indignation,</hi> wrath <hi>without mixture,</hi> a <hi>curſe,</hi> an <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema, all the curſes of the law, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas the real diſcipline of God's children is called a <hi>chaſtiſement</hi>;
<q>If ye be without chaſtiſement, then are ye baſtards and not ſons:</q>
a <hi>correction</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <q>I will correct thee in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and will not leave thee altogether unpuniſhed.</q>
This correction is ſaid to be <hi>mingled with pity.</hi>
                  <q>Like as a father pitieth his children; ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</q>
                  <q>I will viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes, nevertheleſs, my loving kindneſs will I not utterly take from him.</q>
But where
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:022478_0062_0FB935D4B6A23C90"/>
in all the ſcriptures is the puniſhment of the future ſtate repreſented to be deſigned for the good of the ſubjects? Where is it in ſcripture called a fatherly chaſtiſement, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or diſcipline, or by any other appellation of the like import? What right then have we to conſider it as a mere chaſtiſement? Is not this an idea formed in the fond ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of thoſe who would fain ſupport a favourite ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem?</p>
               <p n="7">7. IF future puniſhment be merely diſciplinary, the diſcipline will produce its proper effect on ſome, ſooner than on others. Some who ſhall in this life have contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a leſs degree of depravity and hardneſs of heart, will be more eaſily and ſpeedily brought to repentance, than others. This on the hypotheſis now made, is both agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the dictates of reaſon, and is the very doctrine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly and abundantly taught by Dr. C. But how is this to be reconciled with the account of ſcripture? That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that all thoſe on the left hand of the judge are to be ſentenced to everlaſting fire, and ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment. The ſentence denounced on all is in the ſame terms, and not the leaſt intimation is given, that ſome of them ſhall be puniſhed longer than others; much leſs that only <hi>ſome</hi> ſhall be puniſhed for ages of ages; others releaſed, in a much ſhorter time. Dr. C. and other writers of his claſs ſuppoſe, that in hell the wicked are put under thoſe means of grace, which are vaſtly more advantageous, powerful and conducive to the effect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, than thoſe means which are enjoyed in this life. But the ſame writers will allow, that in many inſtances, even the means which are enjoyed in this life are followed with the deſired effect of repentance, and this within ſo ſhort a term as threeſcore years and ten. Therefore we may reaſonably conclude that within the like term, many more will be brought to repentance by the vaſtly more powerful means to be uſed with the damned: and ſo on through every ſucceſſive period of ſeventy years. I think then an anſwer to two queſtions may juſtly be demanded of any one in Dr. C's ſcheme.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) WITH what truth or propriety can a ſentence of everlaſting puniſhment be pronounced on the whole body of ſinners, when ſome of them ſhall repent and be ſaved very ſoon; others in large numbers, in every ſucceeding
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:022478_0063_0FB935D5CA37D840"/>
age, and even every year? As well might a ſentence of excluſion from pardon and the favour of God during this life, be pronounced againſt the whole of every generation of mankind, becauſe ſome men do indeed continue in that ſtate during this life. Nay, with much greater truth and propriety might this latter ſentence be pronounced, than the former; becauſe it is granted by Dr. C. and others, that the <hi>greater</hi> part of men live and die in impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence and alienation from God. Whereas, allowing that the puniſhment of the wicked is a mere diſcipline, we may preſume, that very few indeed of the whole number of the damned, will remain in torment, for that duration, which according to the ideas of our opponents, is intended by <hi>everlaſting</hi> and <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> and which is the longeſt puniſhment to be inflicted on any of the human race. This is a puniſhment reſerved for a very few, the moſt depraved, hardened, abandoned ſinners, perhaps one in a thouſand or ten thouſand. The reſt leſs hardened and more eaſily wrought on by the powerful means of grace uſed with the damned, will be brought to repentance by a puniſhment of ſhorter continuance.</p>
               <p>I know Dr. C. ſays, that though all the damned ſhall not, yet as ſome of them ſhall, ſuffer that puniſhment, which in his ſenſe, is everlaſting and forever and ever, therefore everlaſting puniſhment may be truly aſſerted of them collectively. But the ſame reaſon would juſtify a ſentence excluding the whole human race from pardon and the divine ſavour, during the whole of the preſent life. God might with the ſame truth and propriety have ſaid to Adam and all his poſterity, even after the revelation of the covenant of grace, I doom you, in righteous judgment, to live and die the objects of my wrath. This latter ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence would, for the reaſon before aſſigned, have been not only equally, but much more conformed to truth and fact, than that which ſhall be pronounced on the wicked at the end of the world; if they ſhall be delivered out of hell from time to time in every age and perhaps every year. Yet it is preſumed, no man will plead for the truth and propriety of the ſentence juſt ſuppoſed.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) THE other queſtion to which an anſwer may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, is, how has it come to paſs, that no intimation of a difference in the duration of the puniſhment of the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:022478_0064_0FB935D78AFC64A8"/>
wicked, is hinted in any part of the ſcriptures? The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a puniſhment of a few years, and one which is to laſt for ages of ages, or for ſuch a duration, as may with propriety be called an <hi>eternity,</hi> is very great, and we ſhould think, well worthy to be noticed in the ſcriptures. To ſay, that it is noticed in thoſe texts, which inform us, that the wicked ſhall be puniſhed <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their works,</hi> &amp;c. is to beg a point in diſpute: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe who believe endleſs puniſhment, believe that the works of all ſinners deſerve an endleſs puniſhment; and though they will ſuffer different puniſhments accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their different demerits; yet the difference will not conſiſt in duration, but in degree: as the righteous will be rewarded differently according to their works; yet the reward of every individual of the righteous will be of endleſs duration.</p>
               <p n="8">8. IF future puniſhment be deſigned as a mere diſcipline, to lead ſinners to repentance, it is inflicted without any neceſſity, and therefore muſt be a wanton exerciſe of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.—The repentance of ſinners may be eaſily obtained without thoſe dreadful torments endured for ages of ages. Doubtleſs that ſame wiſdom and power which leads a goodly number of mankind to repentance in this life, without the help of the torments of hell, might by the like or ſuperior means, produce the like effect on all. The goſpel might have been preached to all the heathens, and all thoſe means of grace, which have been ſucceſsful on ſome men, might have been uſed with all. And who will venture to ſay, that thoſe means and that grace, which effected the repentance of <hi>Saul</hi> the perſecutor, of the thief on the croſs, of <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> and of the old, idolatrous <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> who had filled Jeruſalem with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood; could not have effected the repentance of any, or at leaſt ſome of thoſe who have been, or ſhall be, ſent into the future ſtate of puniſhment? How does it appear, that thoſe means and that grace which were ſufficient for the converſion of thoſe noted ſinners before mentioned, would not, had they been applied, have been ſufficient for the converſion of thouſands of others, who in fact have not been converted? And how does it appear, but that ſimilar though more powerful grace and means, which are doubtleſs within the reach of divine power and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:022478_0065_0FB935D8AB438020"/>
would have been ſufficient for the repentance and converſion of all mankind? If ſo, the repentance of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners might have been accompliſhed, at a cheaper rate, and in a way more demonſtrative of the divine goodneſs, than by the awful means of hell-torments. Thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments therefore are inflicted without any real neceſſity, unleſs they be inflicted for ſome other end, than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of the damned.</p>
               <p>I AM aware, it will be objected, that if God ſhould bring men to repentance by efficacious grace or means, it would be inconſiſtent with their moral agency, would deſtroy their liberty, and reduce them to mere machines. But were <hi>Paul, Mary Magdalene</hi> &amp;c. brought to repentance in ſuch a way as to deſtroy their liberty? It will not be pretended. Neither can it be pretended, that the ſame means and grace would have deſtroyed the liberty of others. This being granted, it neceſſarily follows, that if repentance be the only end, hell-torments are arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily inflicted on all thoſe, who might have been, or may in future be brought to repentance by thoſe means, and that grace, by which Paul or any other man hath been brought to repentance in this life.—I aſk, does God in this life, apply all thoſe means and all that grace, to all men, to lead them to repentance, which are conſiſtent with their moral agency? And if he apply to any man, more powerful means, or more efficacious grace, than he does apply to him, would he deſtroy all his liberty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to a mere machine? If ſo, then how are the more powerful means of hell-torments conſiſtent with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agency or liberty? They, it is ſaid, are more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and efficacious means of grace, than any employed in this life: and if in this life the utmoſt is done to lead ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to repentance, which is conſiſtent with moral agency; hell-torments muſt entirely deſtroy moral agency and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce poor damned ſouls to mere machines; and of courſe they will be no more capable of repentance or ſalvation, than clocks and watches.</p>
               <p>If on the other hand it be ſaid, that the utmoſt which is conſiſtent with moral agency, is not done in this life, to lead men, to repentance; it will follow, that God chooſes to inflict hell-torments, not merely as a neceſſary mean to lead ſinners to repentance; to grant which, is to give up
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:022478_0066_0FB935DA610C9DF8"/>
the whole idea, that they are merely diſciplinary.</p>
               <p>Thoſe whom I am now oppoſing, hold, that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, conſiſtently with their moral agency, bring all men to repentance in this life. How then can he, conſiſtently with their moral agency, bring them to repentance in hell? If thoſe means which would be effectual in this life, would be inconſiſtent with moral agency, why are not hell-torments equally inconſiſtent with moral agency, ſince it is allowed that they will be effectual? Or if thoſe means which are barely effectual in hell, be not inconſiſtent with moral agency, I wiſh to have a reaſon aſſigned, why thoſe means which would be barely effectual in this life, would be any more inconſiſtent with moral agency.</p>
               <p>Dr. C. and others hold, that to ſay, that God cannot conſiſtently with moral agency, or in a moral way, bring men to repentance in hell, is to limit his power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But to ſay, that God cannot, conſiſtently with moral agency, bring men to repentance in this life, as really implies a limitation of the divine power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as to ſay, that he cannot, conſiſtently with moral agency, bring them to repentance in hell. How is it any more reconcileable with thoſe divine perfections, that he cannot reduce a ſinner to repentance, in threeſcore years and ten, than that he cannot produce the ſame effect, throughout eternity? To ſay, that there is not time in this life, for the ſinner to obtain a thorough conviction of the neceſſity of repentance, affords no relief to the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For though it ſhould be granted, that there is not time for the ſinner to obtain this conviction by experience, which however there ſeems to be no neceſſity of grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet cannot God exhibit the truth in ſuch a manner, as to produce that conviction? And let a reaſon be given, why that conviction produced by a clear divine exhibition of truth and a ſenſe of happineſs and miſery, ſet in ſuch a light, as to lead to repentance, is more inconſiſtent with moral agency, than the ſame conviction obtained by experience, or by the torments of hell.</p>
               <p>If hell-torments be neceſſary to lead ſinners to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, becauſe they are more painful, than the afflictions or other means uſed with men in this life; why are not greater afflictions ſent on men in this life? It is manifeſt, that moſt men might ſuffer much greater afflictions, than
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:022478_0067_0FB935DBB61DAEF8"/>
they really do ſuffer. And if greater pain be all that is wanting to lead them to repentance, it ſeems that to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict that, would be the greateſt inſtance of goodneſs, and might ſuperſede the neceſſity of hell-torments.</p>
               <p>IT is granted by Dr. C. and others, that hell-torments will <hi>certainly</hi> lead to repentance all who ſuffer them. At the ſame time he objects to the idea of leading ſinners to repentance by the efficacious grace of God, that it deſtroys moral agency. But if there be a certain eſtabliſhed, un. failing connection between hell-torments continued for a proper time, and repentance; thoſe torments as effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually overthrow moral agency, as efficacious grace. All that need be intended in this inſtance, by efficacious grace, is ſuch an exhibition or view of the truth and of motives, as will certainly be attended with repentance. But ſuch an exhibition of the truth as this, is ſuppoſed by Dr. C. to be made in hell. And why this exhibition made in hell is more conſiſtent with moral agency, than an exhibition which is no more effectual, powerful or overbearing, made in this life, I wiſh to be informed.</p>
               <p>PERHAPS it will be further pleaded, that though it be feaſible to lead ſinners to repentance in this life; yet it is not wiſe and beſt. But why is it not as wiſe and good, to perſuade ſinners to repent, without the uſe of hell-tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as by thoſe torments? If indeed it be fact, that God does not inflict endleſs but diſciplinary miſery on ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, we may thence conclude, that it is wiſely ſo ordered. But this is not to be taken for granted; it ought to be proved before an inference is draw from it. It is the great queſtion of this diſpute.</p>
               <p n="9">9. THAT future puniſhment is not merely diſciplinary, appears from the various declarations of ſcripture, that thoſe who die impenitent, are <hi>loſt,</hi> are <hi>caſt away, periſh,</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>perdition,</hi> are <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> ſuffer everlaſting <hi>deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c. as in theſe texts; John XVII. 12.

—But what truth or propriety is there in theſe expreſſions, if future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment be a mere diſcipline? The damned in hell are no more caſt away, loſt, deſtroyed; they no more periſh, or ſuffer perdition, than any of God's elect are caſt away, &amp;c. while they are in this world. Hell is no more a place of deſtruction, than this world. The wicked in hell are no more veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction, than the ſaints are in this world. The damned are under diſcipline; ſo are even the moſt virtuous and holy, while in this life. Yet they are not loſt, caſt away, rejected as reprobate ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or deſtroyed by God; but are kept as the apple of his eye. And as the means of grace, under which the damned are placed, are far more adapted certainly to ſecure and pomote their greateſt good, than any means which we enjoy in this ſtate; to conſider and to ſpeak of them as loſt, caſt away, deſtroyed, &amp;c. becauſe they are under thoſe means, is to the higheſt degree abſurd. They are juſt as much further removed from a ſtate, which can juſtly be called deſtruction, perdition, &amp;c. than they were, while in this world, as the means of grace which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in hell are more powerful and effectual to prepare them for happineſs, than thoſe means which they enjoyed in this world.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE a man ſeized with ſome dangerous diſeaſe, and a variety of means is uſed for his recovery, but in vain. Suppoſe it appears, that if no more effectual means be employed, he will never be recovered. Suppoſe further, that at length an entirely different courſe is taken with him, a courſe which is not only far more likely than the former to be ſucceſsful; but concerning which there is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute certainty, that it will be ſucceſsful: I aſk, can the man now under the operation of theſe moſt excellent and infallible means, with any truth be ſaid to be <hi>loſt,</hi> to be <hi>caſt away,</hi> to be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> &amp;c? Or if thoſe terms muſt
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:022478_0069_0FB935DEACB0C3F0"/>
be applied to one or other of thoſe ſituations, in which we have ſuppoſed him to be at different times; to which of them are they applied with the leaſt truth and reaſon? This example may illuſtrate the ſubject now under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
               <p n="10">10. IF it be conſiſtent with the divine perfections, to ſubject a ſinner to miſery, for the ſake of advancing <hi>his own</hi> good, as is implied in the very idea of diſciplinary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; why is it not equally conſiſtent with the ſame perfections, to ſubject a ſinner to miſery, for the ſake of promoting the good of <hi>the ſyſtem</hi>; provided that miſery do not exceed the demerit of the ſubject?—I preſume no believer in endleſs puniſhment, will plead for any degree or duration of puniſhment, which is not ſubſervient to the glory of the Deity implying the greateſt good of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. Therefore, all ſuch puniſhment, as is not ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to that end, is foreign to the preſent queſtion. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is now ſuppoſed to be proved, that other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment than that which is adapted to prepare the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for happineſs, is juſtly deſerved by the ſinner. Now ſince this it allowed or proved, why is it not conſiſtent with every attribute of the Deity, to inflict that other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, provided only it be ſubſervient to the good of the ſyſtem?</p>
               <p>IT is holden by our opponents, that the puniſhment of a ſinner may lead him to repentance. So it may lead other ſinners to repentance; or it may reſtrain them from ſin, and in a variety of ways may equally ſubſerve the good of thoſe who are not the ſubjects of the puniſhment, as it may the good of him who is the ſubject of it. And that the good of other perſons may be of equal worth and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nay, of far greater worth to the ſyſtem, than the good of the tranſgreſſor himſelf, cannot be denied. Therefore, as I ſaid in the beginning of this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, if the perſonal good of the ſinner be a ſufficient reaſon why he ſhould be puniſhed according to juſtice; why is not the good of others, or the good of the ſyſtem, a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reaſon for the ſame proceeding? And is it not evident, not only that ſuch a puniſhment is conſiſtent with the perfections of God; but that thoſe perfections, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs itſelf not excepted, require it? In this caſe, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a puniſhment merely conducive to the good of the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:022478_0070_0FB935E17790AF88"/>
perſon puniſhed, would be no fruit of goodneſs, but of a contrary principle; and the doctrine of merely diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary puniſhment, if it mean a puniſhment conducive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to the good of the ſubject, but deſtructive to the good of the ſyſtem, is ſo far from being built on the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs, as ſome boaſt; that it is built on a very different foundation. I am aware, that it is holden by the advocates for univerſal ſalvation, that the good of the ſyſtem cannot be promoted by the endleſs miſery of any individual, but requires the final happineſs of every one. Merely to aſſert this however, as ſome do very confidently, is perfect impertinence. Let them prove it, and they will do ſomething to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="11">11. IF none of the damned will be puniſhed for any other end than their own good, and yet they all deſerve to be puniſhed more than is ſubſervient to their own good; then ſome of them deſerve to be puniſhed for a longer term, than that which in ſcripture, according to Dr. C's ſenſe of it, is ſaid to be <hi>forever and ever.</hi> The puniſhment, which in the language of ſcripture, is ſaid to be <hi>everlaſting, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever,</hi> &amp;c. will actually be ſuffered by ſome of the damned, as is agreed on all hands. But if none of the damned will ſuffer any other puniſhment than that which is conducive to their perſonal good, then the puniſhment which in ſcripture is ſaid to be forever and ever, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to their perſonal good. They therefore deſerve a puniſhment of greater duration than that which in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſaid to be <hi>forever and ever</hi>: and of courſe that more durable puniſhment is the curſe of the divine law, and is threatened in the law. But where in all the law, or in all the ſcripture, is any puniſhment threatened, or even hinted at, of greater duration than that which ſhall laſt <hi>forever and ever?</hi>—So that this ſcheme of diſciplinary puniſhment neceſſarily brings us to this abſurdity, that the true and real curſe of the divine law, is not contained in the law; and that the puniſhment juſtly deſerved by the ſinner, is no where revealed or even hinted at, in all the ſcripture. Yet the ſcripture aſſures us, that ſome ſinners will be in fact puniſhed according to their demerits, ſo as to pay the uttermoſt farthing, and to receive judgment without mercy. And no man pretends that any ſinner will ſuffer more than that puniſhment which in ſcripture is ſaid to be <hi>forever and ever.</hi> The conſequence is, that
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:022478_0071_0FB935E344155190"/>
that puniſhment which is <hi>forever and ever,</hi> is the whole that the ſinner deſerves, and therefore is by no means a mere diſcipline.</p>
               <p n="12">12. OUR Lord informs us, Matt. X. 33; That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall deny him before men, ſhall be denied by him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father. But on the hypotheſis now under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, this means only, that Chriſt will deny him till he repents. In Luke XIII. 25, &amp;c. we read, that when once the maſter of the houſe ſhall have riſen and ſhut the door, ſome will begin to ſtand without and to knock, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Lord, Lord, open to us, and will urge ſeveral ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in favour of their admiſſion: to whom the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will anſwer, I know you not, whence you are; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, all ye workers of iniquity. But on the preſent hypotheſis, Chriſt will deny them in no other ſenſe than he denies every real penitent and believer, during the preſent life. He will deny the wicked after the general judgment no longer than till they ſhall have been ſufficiently diſciplined; after that, he will know them, will own them, and receive them to eternal and bliſsful communion with himſelf. The ſame is obſervable of all his moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere diſciples in this life. While here, they are under diſcipline, though not ſo merciful and gracious a diſcipline as that with which the damned are favoured. However, during the continuance of the diſcipline of this life, Chriſt denies and refuſes to confer on any of his diſciples, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire exemption from pain, diſtreſs, or affliction; and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects them equally with the reſt of the world, to theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities: ſo that in this reſpect all things come alike to all. He does indeed give them aſſurance of reſt and glory after this life. As full aſſurance of reſt and glory after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of the term of their diſcipline, is, on the preſent hypotheſis, given to all the damned. Alſo in the proſpect of this reſt and glory, and in the certain knowledge that they are the objects of his favour, he affords his diſciples much relief and comfort under their preſent trials. The ſame ſources of relief and comfort are afforded to all the damned. So that Chriſt denies the damned in no other ſenſe, than that in which he denies his moſt ſincere fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, during this life.</p>
               <p>THE ſame obſervations for ſubſtance may be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the application of the damned for admiſſion into heaven, after the general judgment, and the anſwer and
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:022478_0072_0FB935E609C44A38"/>
treatment which they ſhall receive on that occaſion. The door ſhall be ſhut againſt them no longer than till they ſhall have been ſufficiently diſciplined. The ſame is true of every real chriſtian in this life.—The maſter of the houſe will anſwer, <hi>I know you not, (i. e.)</hi> I do not as yet own you as my friends and diſciples, becauſe you have not yet been ſufficiently diſciplined. The ſame is true of every real chriſtian in this life.—He will tell them,
<q>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.</q>
But this means no more, than that they muſt not be admitted but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, till they ſhall have been ſufficiently diſciplined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſame is true of all real chriſtians in this life.</p>
               <p n="13">13. ON the hypotheſis now under conſideration, what damnation do thoſe in hell ſuffer, more than real chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſuffer in this life? They are kept in a ſtate of moſt merciful and gracious diſcipline, till they are prepared, and then they are taken to heaven. The ſame is true of every real chriſtian in this life. This difference however is worthy of notice, that the diſcipline of hell is far more advantageous than that of this life, becauſe more effectual, and likely to fit the ſubject for heaven more ſpeedily and thoroughly; otherwiſe it would never have been applied. It is alſo a more merciful and gracious exhibiton of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs. Doubtleſs that mean of grace, which is moſt happily and effectually conducive to the ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and preparation of the ſinner for heaven, is to him the moſt merciful and gracious exhibition and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the divine goodneſs.</p>
               <p>IT is true, the diſcipline of hell is attended with more pain than that of this life. So the diſcipline of this life, with reſpect to ſome individuals, is attended with more pain, than it is with reſpect to others. Yet it doth not hence follow, that ſome chriſtians ſuffer damnation in this life: nor will it be pretended, that either the ſcriptures or common ſenſe would juſtify the calling of thoſe greater pains of ſome chiſtians in this life, by the name of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in any other ſenſe, than the leſs pains or afflictions of other chriſtians, may be called by the ſame name.</p>
               <p>ON the whole then, when the ſcripture ſays,
<q>He that believeth, and is baptized ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned:</q>
The whole meaning is, he that believeth, ſhall be admitted to heaven immediately after death: but he that believeth not, ſhall not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:022478_0073_0FB935E7AD38D010"/>
be admitted, merely becauſe he is not yet prepared for it by repentance; but he ſhall be put under a diſcipline abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for his own good, and the moſt wiſe, effectual, merciful and gracious, that divine wiſdom and goodneſs can deviſe; and as ſoon as this diſcipline ſhall have prepared him for heaven, he ſhall be admitted without further delay. When the ſcriptures ſay, he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him; the meaning is, he ſhall not ſee life till he is brought to repentance by the merciful diſcipline juſt now mentioned; and not the <hi>wrath</hi> of God abideth on him; becauſe he ſhall be made the ſubject of nothing wrathful or vindictive; but the <hi>mercy,</hi> or moſt merciful and benevolent diſcipline of God abideth on him.</p>
               <p n="14">14. IF the only end of future puniſhment be the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the ſinner, and if the means uſed with ſinners in hell be ſo much more powerful and happily adapted to the end, than thoſe uſed in this life; it is unaccountable, that while ſo many are led to repentance by the compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively weak means uſed with men in this life, and within ſo ſhort a period as ſeventy years, the far more powerful means applied in hell, ſhould not be productive of the ſame effect, in a ſingle inſtance, within ſo long a period as a thouſand years. That none are to be delivered out of hell, within a thouſand years after the general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is explicitly taught by Dr. C. His words are,<note n="*" place="bottom">Page <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               <p>WE all doubtleſs believe, that many ſinners die impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, who are not the ſubjects of depravity and hardneſs of heart vaſtly greater, than are in ſome, who are brought to repentance in this life. Now put the caſe of the claſs of ſinners, who are the ſubjects of a depravity and hardneſs of heart, the very next in degree to that of the moſt depraved of thoſe who are brought to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this life. Is it reaſonable to believe, that theſe cannot be brought to repentance, even by the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful means of grace enjoyed in hell, within a leſs time than a thouſand years? If it be not reaſonable to believe this, then it is not reaſonable to believe Dr. C's ſcheme of diſciplinary puniſhment.</p>

THE laſt <hi>enemy</hi> that ſhall be deſtroyed is <hi>death.</hi> This death is underſtood by Dr. C. and other advocates for univerſal ſalvation, to mean the ſecond death. Then the ſecond death is doubtleſs an <hi>enemy.</hi> But if it conſiſt in a neceſſary diſcipline, the moſt wiſe and wholeſome, the moſt conducive to the good of the recipients, and to the divine glory, which the wiſdom of God can deviſe; ſurely it is no enemy either to God or the recipients; but is a perfect friend to both. With what truth then could the apoſtle call it an enemy?</p>
               <p n="16">16. THE ſcripture, ſo far from declaring thoſe who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer chaſtiſement and diſciplinary pains, <hi>accurſed,</hi> merely on that account, expreſſly declares them <hi>bleſſed.</hi> Pſal. XCIV. 12;
<q>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſteneſt, O Lord, and teacheſt him out of thy law; that thou mayeſt give him reſt from the days of adverſity.</q>
But where are the damned ever ſaid to be bleſſed? They are conſtantly declared to be accurſed.—Heb. XII. 5—9,
<q>Ye have forgotten the exhortation, which ſpeaketh to you, as unto children, my ſon, deſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked of him. For whom the Lord loveth, he chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth. If ye endure chaſtening, God dealeth with you as with ſons. For what ſon is he, whom the Father chaſteneth not? But if ye be without chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof all are partakers, then are ye baſtards and not ſons.</q>
—This paſſage evidently conſiders thoſe who ſuffer chaſtiſement from the hand of God, as his children, his ſons. If therefore the damned ſuffer a mere chaſtiſement, they are not accurſed, but are the bleſſed ſons or children of God. But are they ever ſo called in ſcripture?—Beſide; this paſſage evidently ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that ſome men do not ſuffer fatherly chaſtiſement, of which all the ſons or children of God are partakers: and expreſſly declares, that ſuch as do not ſuffer it are baſtards and not ſons: which ſeems not to agree with the idea, that all the damned, will by fatherly chaſtiſement be brought to final ſalvation. If no other puniſhment be inflicted by God, than fatherly chaſtiſement, then there
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:022478_0075_0FB935EC3A0C5618"/>
are no baſtards in the univerſe. Yet it is evidently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in this text, that there are baſtards.</p>
               <p>HEB. X. 28,
<q>He that deſpiſed Moſes law <hi>died without mercy</hi>—of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the ſon of God?</q>
&amp;c. But if all who die impenitent, be ſent to a ſtate of diſcipline moſt excellently adapted to their good and ſalvation, no man dies without mercy. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline itſelf is the greateſt mercy which can, in their ſtate of mind, be beſtowed upon them. With reſpect to the ſame ſubject, it is ſaid, Heb. II. 2;
<q>That every tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and diſobedience, received <hi>a juſt recompence</hi> of reward.</q>
—<hi>A juſt recompence,</hi> is a puniſhment ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the demands of juſtice; and this, as we have ſeen in the preceding chapter, cannot be a mere merciful diſcipline.</p>
               <p n="17">17. IF the puniſhment of hell be a mere wholeſome diſcipline, then what the apoſtle ſays of the diſcipline of chriſtians in this life, may be ſaid with equal truth and propriety of the puniſhment of the damned: thus, We glory in damnation; knowing that damnation worketh repentance, and repentance ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="18">18. IF no other than a diſciplinary puniſhment be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the divine goodneſs; ſurely the requirement of an atonement in order to pardon, is unaccountable. The doctrine of atonement, and of the neceſſity of it to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſalvation, is abundantly holden by Dr. C. He ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 17.</note>

                  <note n="‖‖" place="bottom">12 ſermons, p. 334.</note> According to Dr. C. then, Chriſt hath not only made <hi>atonement</hi> by his obedience and death, but that atonement was neceſſary to the <hi>wiſe, juſt</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> exerciſe of mercy to the ſinner; and without that atonement, ſaving mercy could not have been exerciſed toward the ſinner, in a conſiſtency with wiſdom, juſtice and holineſs, or the honour of the divine perfections, or the authority of the divine law and government. The conſtitution therefore by which ſalvation can be obtained in no other way, than in conſequence and on account of his obedience and death, is not only conſiſtent with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, holineſs, juſtice, yea, all the divine perfections, and the authority of the divine law and government: but it was <hi>required by them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the ſufferings and death of Chriſt, or his atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is no diſcipline of the ſinner. They are as foreign from it as the vindictive puniſhment of the ſinner himſelf. The atonement, as Dr. C. hath explained it, makes way for the wiſe, juſt and holy exerciſe of mercy toward the ſinner. It was therefore deſigned to <hi>ſatisfy</hi> the divine <hi>wiſdom, juſtice</hi> and <hi>holineſs.</hi> It was deſigned to make the grant of life to the ſinner <hi>conſiſtent with the honour of the divine perfections,</hi> and <hi>the authority of the divine law and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> And if our Lord Jeſus Chriſt might, in the behalf of the ſinner, be made to ſuffer in order to <hi>ſatisfy</hi> divine <hi>juſtice</hi>; why may not the ſinner himſelf be made to ſuffer for the ſame end?</p>
               <p>IF Chriſt have, on the behalf of ſinners, ſuffered for the end of ſupporting the authority of the divine law and government; what reaſon can be aſſigned, why it ſhould be inconſiſtent with any attribute of the Deity, that ſinners themſelves ſhould be made to ſuffer for the ſame end? But this would be a proper vindictive puniſhment. Therefore Dr. C. is entirely inconſiſtent with himſelf, in allowing the atonement of Chriſt, in the terms before quoted; and yet denying the reaſonableneſs of a vindictive puniſhment, or its conſiſtency with the divine perfections.</p>
               <p n="19">

<q>that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpoſe;</q>
Rom. VIII. 28. But this implies, that all things do not work for good, to them who love not God. Yet all things do work for their good, if they ſuffer no other than a diſciplinary puniſhment. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe who are Chriſt's, it is ſaid, that
<q>all things are their's; whether Paul or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things <hi>to come;</hi> all are their's;</q>
1 Cor. III. 21, 22. But on the ſuppoſition, that all puniſhment is diſciplinary, it is equally true concerning all mankind, that all things preſent and to come are their's. Yet this is not ſaid, but the contrary is implied in that it is ſaid of thoſe only who are Chriſt's or are Chriſtians, that all things are their's.</p>

<q>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the grave whither thou goeſt.</q>
If future puniſhment be diſcilplinary, the damned are in a ſtate of probation, and may and will ſo exerciſe their rational powers, as ſhall finally iſſue in their ſalvation. But can this be reconciled with the words of Solomon, that in the future ſtate, there is no work to be done, no device to be invented, no knowledge or wiſdom to be exerciſed by us, to the accompliſhment of what we now leave undone? This is manifeſtly the argument, by which he preſſes on us the preſent diligent diſcharge of our duty; and this argument would be utterly inconcluſive, if there were another ſtate, in which what our hand now findeth to do, might be done.</p>
               <p>OF ſimilar import is John IX. 4;
<q>I muſt work the works of him that ſent me, while it is day; the night cometh when no man can work. As long as I am <hi>in the world,</hi> I am the light of the world.</q>
That our Lord, by <hi>the day,</hi> means this life, is manifeſt by the laſt words of the quotation. But if in the future ſtate no man can work, the future ſtate is not a ſtate of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

with him an hundred and twenty years, and no longer; for ſo long only ſhall his days be continued. But how is this conſiſtent with the idea, that God will be ſtriving with man, for ages of ages after his days ſhall have been elapſed?</p>
               <p>Objection 1. IF to ſome part of the foregoing reaſoning it be objected, that it ſuppoſes future puniſhment to be <hi>merely</hi> diſciplinary, and deſigned to ſubſerve no <hi>other</hi> end, than the repentance of the ſinner: whereas it is granted, that God may and will inflict vindictive puniſhment, but not a puniſhment <hi>merely</hi> vindictive; that he may take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the ſinner, provided at the ſame time he aim at the good of the ſinner: To this I anſwer—</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT in this objection it is granted, that God may and will inflict on the damned a puniſhment properly vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive, a puniſhment over and above that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the perſonal good of the ſinner. But this is to grant all which is pleaded for in this chapter, and all which at preſent is attempted to be proved.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IF the meaning of this objection be, that God may inflict vengeance, provided he do it with a ſole view to the good of the ſinner, it confutes itſelf; it ſeems to grant ſomething, but in reality it grants nothing. It ſeems to admit a proper vindictive puniſhment, but really admits no puniſhment beſides that which is merely diſciplinary. For to talk of inflicting vengeance with a ſole view to the good of the ſubject, can mean nothing more, than to inflict <hi>pain</hi> with a ſole view to the good of the ſubject; and this is nothing more than a puniſhment merely diſciplinary: if God ſhow diſpleaſure with a ſole view to the good of the ſinner, this is mere diſcipline.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IF the meaning of this objection be, that God may conſiſtently with his perfections, inflict a proper vindictive puniſhment, provided at the ſame time that he is aiming at a proper vindication of his broken law and deſpiſed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he aim at the good of the ſinner alſo; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, if it be right and conſiſtent with the perfections of God, to vindicate his law and government, there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of bringing in the aid of another motive or deſign, to make it right or conſiſtent with his perfections. If on the other hand, it be not in itſelf right to vindicate his law and government, no other affections, views or actions,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:022478_0079_0FB935F30C87AC10"/>
however right and benevolent, co-exiſting with the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vindication, can atone for it, or make it right.</p>
               <p>TO illuſtrate this by an example:—A parent has a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient child; and it is become neceſſary both for the good of the child, and for the ſupport of the parent's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in his family in general, and over his child in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that he be properly puniſhed. Accordingly from both theſe motives, the good of the child and the ſupport of his own authority, the parent inflicts the proper puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This according to the objection now before us, is right. But according to the ſame objection, if the child be deſperate and there be no proſpect of effecting his good by puniſhment, it is not conſiſtent with the character of a good parent to inflict the ſame puniſhment, from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of ſupporting his own government and the good of the family only. If this action done from theſe motives only, be a wrong action, it is ſtill wrong, ſo far as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the ſame motives, however it may ariſe in part from the motive of the child's good. To render this ſtill plainer, let us ſuppoſe, that a parent inflicts pain on his child merely to afford amuſement to his neighbours, as the Romans were wont to exhibit fights of gladiators. It will be agreed on all hands, that this action is abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Again, ſuppoſe the ſame pain be inflicted partly from the motive of amuſing his neighbours, and partly from a regard to the child's good. I preſume all will allow, that ſo far as the action proceeds from the former motive, it is ſtill abominable, and is not ſanctified by the co-exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent motive of the child's good.</p>
               <p>ON the whole, we arrive at this concluſion; that if it be conſiſtent with the divine perfections, that God ſhould inflict puniſhment from the two motives of vindicating his own law and government and benefiting the ſinner; it is equally conſiſtent with the divine perfections to inflict pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment from the former motive only. All the vindictive puniſhment pleaded for, is that which is deſerved by the ſinner and is neceſſary to ſupport the divine law and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral government in proper dignity, and thus to promote the general good: and this ſurely is oppoſed to no attribute of God, whether juſtice or goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Objection 2. TO the argument drawn from the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction threatened to the wicked, it may be objected, that this deſtruction means, that they ſhall be deſtroyed <hi>as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:022478_0080_0FB935F48F7E00E0"/>
only, or ſhall be brought to repentance and a renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of ſin. To this it may be anſwered, that in this ſenſe every one who in this life repents and believes, is deſtroyed, and ſuffers deſtruction. Yet this is never ſaid in ſcripture. This ſenſe of the word <hi>deſtruction</hi> makes the puniſhment of hell, and the awful curſe of the divine law, to conſiſt in <hi>repentance,</hi> which is no puniſhment or curſe, but an ineſtimable bleſſing. Beſides, that repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, on which the ſinner is forgiven if it can be called a <hi>deſtruction</hi> at all, is not an <hi>everlaſting</hi> deſtruction, but an emotion of heart, which is begun and finiſhed in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort time. Or if by this everlaſting deſtruction be underſtood the habitual and perſevering repentance of the true convert; then the glorified ſaints in heaven, are conſtantly ſuffering that <hi>deſtruction</hi> which will be everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and which is the curſe of the divine law.</p>
               <p>BEFORE this ſubject is diſmiſſed, proper notice ought to be taken of ſome arguments urged in favour of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, that the puniſhment of hell is merely diſcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinary.</p>
               <p n="1">1. IT is urged,<note place="bottom">Page 324, 325.</note> that the various afflictions of <hi>this life</hi> are deſigned for the good of the patients: therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the ſame end is deſigned by the ſufferings of hell. —To this it may be anſwered, It is by no means granted, that all the afflictions of this life are deſigned for the good of the patients. It does not appear, that men in general, who are viſited with the loſs of children, wives, or other dear friends; or with the loſs of eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, of ſome other ſenſe, or of a limb; or with diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pains or incurable diſeaſes; are thereby rendered more happy in this life. If men may be allowed to judge by their own experience, they will in moſt caſes decide the queſtion in the negative. Nor does the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in many caſes appear ill founded to thoſe, who have opportunity to obſerve perſons under thoſe afflictions. To ſay that men are no proper judges, whether they themſelves be, in this life, made more happy or not, by the afflictions which they ſuffer, is to ſay, that they are no judges of their own happineſs or miſery. This being once eſtabliſhed, we may aſſert, that hell-torments though endleſs promote the happineſs of the patients: becauſe being no judges of their own happineſs or miſery
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:022478_0081_0FB935F5F14301F8"/>
they may be extremely happy, at the very time they judge themſelves to be perfectly miſerable.</p>
               <p>IN any eaſe in which calamity proves fatal, it is abſurd to pretend, that it promotes, in this life, the happineſs of the patient, unleſs calamity itſelf be happineſs. No man has opportunity in this life to derive any good from the pains of death. Therefore at leaſt theſe pains are not deſigned for the ſubject's good during his preſent life.</p>
               <p>HERE it may be proper to mention ſeveral remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of grievous calamity recorded in ſcripture: As the inſtance of the old world, of Sodom and Gomorrah, of Pharaoh, Saul, the houſe of Eli, Nadab and Abihu, Hiel, &amp;c. It is preſumed, Dr. C, himſelf would not pretend, that theſe calamities were intended for "the profit of the ſufferers themſelves" in this life. What right then had he to argue, as in the following paſſage?<note place="bottom">Page 324, 325, &amp;c.</note>
                  <q>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tendency and final cauſe of evils in the preſent ſtate, are to do us good. This is the voice of reaſon confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by experience, and ſcripture concurs herewith.</q>
He then quotes Pſal. LXXXIX. 31—34; and proceeds,
<q>If evil, puniſhment or miſery in the preſent life is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully intended for the good of the patients themſelves why not in the next life? Is the character of God, as the father of mercies, and God of pity, confined to this world only?</q>
The force of all this depends en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on the ſuppoſition, that in all inſtances of ſuffering in this life, the end is the ſufferer's good during this life.</p>
               <p>BUT this ſuppoſition, we ſee by what has been ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, is by no means true. The ſuperſtructure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore built on this foundation falls entirely to the ground. We all grant, that in ſome inſtances afflictions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the good of the ſufferers. A proof of this, which needed no proof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dr. C. has produced out of the eighty-ninth pſalm. On this foundation extended in his own imagination to comprehend all inſtances of affliction, he built an argument in which he triumphed.—Now ſince there are thoſe ſeveral inſtances of calamity before mentioned, which Dr. C. would not pretend were deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſufferer's good in this life; I might as well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that no other inſtances of calamity are deſigned for the ſufferers good in this life; and then adopt Dr. C's
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:022478_0082_0FB935F76D6133E8"/>
ſtrain of <hi>ardent declamation,</hi> in manner following: If evil puniſhment or miſery in the preſent life, be not intended for the good of the patients themſelves, but to ſupport the authority of the divine law, and thus ſubſerve the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good; why not in the next life? Is the character of God, as a God of perfect purity and ſtrict juſtice, limited to this world only? Why ſhould it not be ſuppoſed, that the infinitely holy God has the ſame hatred of ſin in the other world which he has in this? and that he has in the next ſtate the ſame intention which he has in this, to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, by puniſhments, his law and government.</p>
               <p>THE truth is, that as ſome of the calamities of this life are intended for the patient's good in this life and others are as manifeſtly not intended for his good in this life; nothing certain can be hence concluded concerning the end of the miſery of the damned. Nay: if it were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that all the calamities of this life are intended for the patient's good in this life or that they are not intended for his good in this life; yet it could not be certainly thence concluded, that the miſeries of the damned are intended for the good of the patients, nor that they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the good of the patients. But this point muſt be determined by other evidence, the evidence of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>IF it ſhould be ſaid, that though ſome of the ſufferings of this life do not, in this life, produce good to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients; yet they will produce good to them in the future life; it will be ſufficient to reply, that this wants proof; that it is a main point in the preſent diſpute; and that it ſhould be taken for granted, is not to be ſuffered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IT is alſo urged by our author,
<q>That the whole courſe of nature, and even the revelations of ſcripture conſtantly ſpeak of God, as the univerſal father, as well as governor of men—What now is the temper and conduct of fathers on earth towards their offspring? They readily do them good and chaſtiſe them for their profit; but they do not puniſh their children, having no view to their advantage.</q>
—
<q>And ſhall we ſay that of our father in heaven, which we cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of any father on earth, till we have firſt diveſted him of the heart of a father?</q>
He abounds in pathetic diſcourſe of the ſame ſtrain, which is much more ſuited to work on the imaginations and paſſions of mankind, than on
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:022478_0083_0FB935F9AECC4150"/>
their reaſon. The foundation of all this diſcourſe is, that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on earth, acting in character, never puniſh and never can puniſh their children, but with a deſign to promote their perſonal good. But would Dr. C. himſelf adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to lay down this poſition, and to abide by it? Did never a wiſe and good father find it neceſſary, to puniſh, and even to caſt out of his family, a deſperate child, to prevent his ruining the reſt of the children? Was there never, or can there poſſibly never be, an inſtance of this? If ſuch an inſtance ever has, or ever may occur, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of argument in the forecited paſſage, vaniſhes at once. Not only do <hi>fathers</hi> find it neceſſary to puniſh deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate children, without any proſpect of their perſonal good; but very frequently do <hi>kings,</hi> governors and chief magiſtrates find this neceſſary with regard to their ſubjects. Now in the ſcripture, God much oftener illuſtrates his character, by that of a king, a prince, a ſovereign lord, than by that of a father. And askings, &amp;c. often find it neceſſary to inflict capital and other puniſhments, without any view to the perſonal good of the ſufferers; we may hence deduce an argument, that God alſo will puniſh many of his rebellious ſubjects, without any view to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal good; but to ſupport his moral government, to be an example of terror to others, and thus to ſecure the general good: and this argument would be at leaſt as ſtrong as that of Dr. C. juſt cited.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IT may be pleaded, that though calamities in this life do not always iſſue in the ſufferers good; yet God may compenſate them in the future ſtate, for the loſs or ſuffering, of which they are the ſubjects in this life. Thus our author,
<q>It is poſſible that the evils which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuffer in this, may be made up to them in another ſtate.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Benevolence of the Deity, p. 249.</note>—It is granted, that God is able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate his creatures for the evils of this life; but that he in fact will do it in all caſes, is to be proved.—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; the very idea of compenſation is inconſiſtent with the idea of diſciplinary puniſhment and that all the evils of both this life and the future are neceſſary and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the good of thoſe who ſuffer them. For if this idea be juſt, what foundation is there for compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Will a father compenſate a child for the pain of that diſcipline which is abſolutely neceſſary for his good
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:022478_0084_0FB9360160F3D638"/>
and moſt wiſely adapted to it? No man would ever think of it. Compenſation ſuppoſes, that the evil for which compenſation is made, has been inflicted from other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, than a regard to the good of the ſufferer. And if evil may in one inſtance be inflicted from other motives than a regard to the good of the ſufferer; it may in any other inſtance in which juſtice and wiſdom admit of it; and if in this ſtate, in the future too.—If the evils of life be intended for the good only of the ſubjects, we may as well talk of compenſating a man for the pain of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a tooth which is a perpetual torment to him; or for the diſagreeable taſte of the doſe which cures him of the colic; as to talk of compenſating him for the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life. The ſaints will indeed be rewarded for their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience under theſe calamities; and this part of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is doubtleſs as amiable, and is as properly as any part of their holineſs the object of the complacency of the Deity, and of thoſe rewards which are the fruits of that complacency. But thoſe rewards are not to be conſidered as compenſations of loſſes or of damages. The very idea of compenſation implies, that that for which compenſation is made, is on the whole an evil to the perſon compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But the very idea that preſent evils are neceſſary and conducive to the good of the ſubjects, implies, that on the whole they are no evils to the ſubjects.</p>
               <p>IT is now ſubmitted to the reader, whether the doctrine, that the damned will in fact ſuffer no other puniſhment, than that which is ſubſervient to their perſonal good, be not in many reſpects moſt glaringly inconſiſtent with the ſcriptures; and whether it be not equally irreconcileable with their general tenor as with many particular paſſages; and alſo with many parts of Dr. C's book.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Containing an examination of Dr. C's arguments to prove endleſs puniſhment inconſiſtent with juſtice.</head>
               <p>THAT the endleſs puniſhment of the damned is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with juſtice, is poſitively and abundantly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by Dr. C. and other advocates for univerſal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Whether the arguments which the Doctor offers to prove the injuſtice of endleſs puniſhment, be concluſive, is the ſubject of our inquiry in this chapter.</p>
               <p>BEFORE we proceed to this inquiry, it ſeems neceſſary, to explain the meaning of the propoſition—That the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhment of the damned is conſiſtent with <hi>juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I DO not find that Dr. C. hath any where given us a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of his idea of <hi>juſtice,</hi> or of a juſt puniſhment, which is certainly a great omiſſion. The Chevalier <hi>Ramſay</hi> gives the following definition of the divine juſtice: "Juſtice is that perfection of God, by which he endeavours continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make all intelligences juſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Principles, Vol. I. p. 432.</note>" But with the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he might have defined the divine mercy to be, not that perfection in God, by which he is himſelf inclined to the exerciſe of mercy to the miſerable; but that by which he endeavours to make all intelligences merciful: and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love to be, not that perfection in God, by which he loves his creatures, but that by which he endeavours to make other intelligences exerciſe love. By this definition of juſtice a human judge, who wrongs every man, whoſe cauſe is brought before him, and yet endeavours to make other men juſt, is a juſt judge.</p>
               <p>THE word <hi>juſtice</hi> is uſed in three different ſenſes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it means <hi>commutative</hi> juſtice, ſometimes <hi>diſtributive,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>general</hi> or <hi>public</hi> juſtice. Commutative juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice reſpects property only, and the equal exchange and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it. <hi>Diſtributive</hi> juſtice is the equal diſtribution of rewards and puniſhments, and it reſpects the <hi>perſonal</hi> rights and demerit of the perſon rewarded or puniſhed. <hi>General</hi> or <hi>public</hi> juſtice reſpects what are called the rights of a community, whether a city, ſtate, empire, or the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. This kind of juſtice requires the public good; and
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:022478_0086_0FB93604ED677578"/>
whenever that I violated or neglected the public is <hi>injured.</hi> This laſt uſe of the word juſtice, though very frequent, yet is an improper uſe of it; becauſe to practiſe juſtice in this ſenſe, is no other than to act from public ſpirit, or from love to the community, and with reſpect to the univerſe, it is the very ſame with general benevolence.</p>
               <p>NOW when we inquire, whether the endleſs puniſhment of the wicked be conſiſtent with juſtice, no man will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the word juſtice means <hi>commutative</hi> juſtice; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the inquiry has no reſpect to <hi>property.</hi> Nor is the word to be underſtood to mean <hi>general</hi> or <hi>public</hi> juſtice. It is indeed an important inquiry, whether the endleſs puniſhment of a man dying in impenitence, be conſiſtent with the general intereſt of the univerſe; but this is not the ſubject to be conſidered in this chapter. The queſtion to be conſidered in this and in one or two ſucceding chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is, whether to inflict an endleſs puniſhment on a man dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in impenitence, be an act of <hi>diſtributive</hi> juſtice, or be a treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him by his judge, correſpondent and no more than correſpondent or proportioned to his demerit, to his crimes, or to his moral conduct and perſonal character. This is a queſtion entirely different from the following; Whether the infliction of an endleſs puniſhment on a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dying in impenitence, be ſubſervient to the good of the univerſe? A puniſhment or calamity inflicted on a perſon may be ſubſervient to the public good of a community, yet not be deſerved by him on account of his perſonal crimes. It was for the good of the Roman republic, that <hi>Regulus</hi> ſhould return to certain death at Carthage; yet he did not deſerve that death; it was not correſpondent to his moral character. On the other hand, many a villain has by his attrocious crimes deſerved death; yet by reaſon of his power, his connections, or the peculiar circumſtances of the ſtate, it could not, conſiſtently with the public good be inflicted on him. So that in a variety of inſtances public juſtice or the public good is promoted by private or diſtributive injuſtice; and diſtributive juſtice would be productive of public injury or damage. And in ſome caſes the public good may be promoted by a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which, though not in the diſtributive ſenſe unjuſt, yet is not according to diſtributive juſtice. An innocent perſon may chooſe to be made the ſubject of ſufferings, in the ſtead of a criminal. Therefore though the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:022478_0087_0FB9360671AC1850"/>
which he chooſes to endure, be inflicted on him, no injuſtice is done him. For will it be p<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ended, that this proceeding is according to ſtrict diſtributive juſtice, which requires the criminal to be puniſhed and not his ſubſtitute. Yet it may promote the good of the community, or ſecure it from great detriment by a relaxation of its laws and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; as in the well known inſtance of Zaleucus, who put out one of his own eyes, to ſupport the authority of the law againſt adultery, which his own ſon had vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
               <p>ON the whole, when we inquire whether the endleſs puniſhment of the damned be conſiſtent with juſtice, the word <hi>juſtice</hi> means <hi>diſtributive</hi> juſtice. This, as has been already obſerved, reſpects the perſonal merit or demerit of the man rewarded or puniſhed. A man ſuffers diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive injuſtice when he is not treated as favourably as is correſpondent to his perſonal conduct or character. On the other hand, he has juſtice done him, when he is treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a manner correſpondent to his perſonal conduct or character. A juſt puniſhment then is that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned or correſpondent to the crime puniſhed. But it may be further inquired, when is a puniſhment propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the crime puniſhed? To this the anſwer ſeems to be, when by the pain or natural evil of the puniſhment, it exhibits a juſt idea of the moral evil or ruinous tendency of the crime, and a proper motive to reſtrain all intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent beings from the commiſſion of the crime.</p>
               <p>FURTHER to elucidate this matter, let it be obſerved, that any crime, by relaxing the laws and by weakening the government, is a damage to the community; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves juſt ſo much puniſhment, as, by reſtoring the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tone of the laws, and proper ſtrength to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will repair that damage. The chief evil of any crime, on account of which it principally deſerves puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſiſts in the relaxation of the laws and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the community in which the crime is committed. For example, the chief evil of theft is not that a certain perſon is clandeſtinely deprived of his property. His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty may be reſtored and he may in this reſpect ſuffer no damage. Still the thief deſerves puniſhment. If a man be defamed, the chief evil is not that the perſon defamed is injured by the loſs of his reputation. His reputation may, by a full confeſſion of the defamer or by other means,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:022478_0088_0FB93607EACC5838"/>
be reſtored. Still the defamer may deſerve puniſhment. If a man be murdered, the chief evil is not that the man is deprived of his life, and his friends and the community are deprived of the benefit of his aid. His life may have been a burden to himſelf, to his friends and to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; or he may by divine power be raiſed from the dead. Still, in either caſe, the murderer would deſerve puniſhment.</p>
               <p>THE true reaſon, why all thoſe criminals would, in all thoſe caſes, deſerve puniſhment, is, that by their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive crimes they would weaken the laws and government of the community, thereby would break in upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic peace, good order, ſafety and happineſs; inſtead of theſe would introduce confuſion and ruin; and thus would do a very great damage to the community.—Therefore, they would reſpectively deſerve juſt ſo much puniſhment, as by reſtoring the tone of the laws and government, would re-eſtabliſh the peace, good order, ſafety and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the community, and thus would repair the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage done to the community by their crimes.—A puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adequate to this end exhibits by the natural evil of it, a juſt idea of the moral evil of the crime, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motive to reſtrain all from the commiſſion of it: it is therefore duly proportioned to the crime, is correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the conduct of the criminal, and is perfectly juſt.</p>
               <p>THE paſſages in which Dr. C. <hi>declares poſitively,</hi> that the endleſs puniſhment of the wicked would be unjuſt, are very numerous; but his arguments to prove that it would be unjuſt, are, ſo far as I can find, very few. As this is a capital point in the preſent controverſy, it was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that he would go into a formal conſideration of it, and give us his reaſons methodically and distinctly. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this, in all the various parts of his book in which he declaims moſt vehemently on the ſubject, there are very few in which I find an attempt to argue. Theſe are as follows:—
<q>An eternity of miſery ſwallows up all proportion: or though there ſhould be ſome difference in the <hi>degree</hi> of pain, it is ſuch a difference, I fear, as will be ſcarce thought worthy of being brought into the account, when the circumſtance of endleſs duration is annexed to it.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 309.</note>—
<q>The ſmallneſs of the difference between thoſe in this world, to whom the character of
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:022478_0089_0FB936096E5FB828"/>
                     <hi>wicked</hi> belongs in the loweſt ſenſe, and thoſe to whom the character of <hi>good</hi> is applicable in the like ſenſe, renders it incredible, that ſuch an amazingly great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſhould be made between them in the future. The difference between them, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion, will be doubly infinite.—For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and puniſhment being both eternal, they muſt at laſt become infinite in magnitude. How to reconcile this with the abſolutely accurate impartiality of God, is, I confeſs, beyond me.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Page 320.</note>—
<q>It does not appear to me, that it would be honourable to the infinitely righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and benevolent governor of the world, to make wicked men everlaſtingly miſerable. For in what point of light ſoever we take a view of ſin, it is certainly in its nature a finite evil. It is the fault of a finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the effect of finite principles, paſſions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites. To ſay therefore, that the ſinner is doomed to infinite miſery, for the finite faults of a finite life, looks like a reflection on the infinite juſtice, as well as good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. I know it has been often urged, that ſin is an infinite evil, becauſe committed againſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite object; for which reaſon an infinite puniſhment is no more than its due deſert. But this metaphyſical nicety proves a great deal too much, if it proves any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. For according to this way of arguing, all ſinners muſt ſuffer the utmoſt in <hi>degree,</hi> as well as in <hi>duration</hi>; otherwiſe they will not ſuffer ſo much as they might do, and as they ought to do: which is plainly inconſiſtent with that difference the ſcripture often declares there ſhall be in the puniſhment of wicked men, according to the difference there has been in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and number of their evil deeds.</q>

               </p>
               <p>THESE, I think, are the paſſages in which Dr. C. offers his moſt plauſible and ſtrong, if not his only, arguments, to prove, that endleſs puniſhment is not conſiſtent with juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and the arguments here offered are theſe three on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—That endleſs puniſhment implies ſuch a different treatment of the ſmalleſt ſinners and ſmalleſt ſaints, as is out of all proportion to their reſpective characters; it is therefore incredible, and not reconcileable with the juſtice and impartiality of God.—That endleſs puniſhment is out of all proportion to the demerit of ſin, as the latter is
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:022478_0090_0FB9360AEB9C3710"/>
finite, the former infinite.—That endleſs puniſhment, on account of the infinite evil of ſin, as committed againſt a God of infinite glory, implies, that future puniſhment is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in degree too, and therefore that the puniſhment of all the damned is equal.</p>
               <p n="1">I. THAT endleſs puniſhment implies ſuch a different treatment of the ſmalleſt ſinner and ſmalleſt ſaint, as is out of all proportion to their reſpective characters; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore incredible, and not reconcileable with the juſtice and impartiality of God. On this I obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is an infinite difference between the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of two perſons, one of whom is ſent to endleſs miſery, the other not, is readily granted. But that the one, who is ſent to ſuch a puniſhment, is treated unjuſtly, is not granted; and to aſſert, that he is treated unjuſtly, is to <hi>beg</hi> and not to prove the thing in queſtion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That of the two perſons now ſuppoſed, one ſhould be treated according to his demerits, and the other by the "boundleſs goodneſs of God," ſhould be exempted from that puniſhment, to which, by his demerit, he is juſtly lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is nothing incredible or unjuſt. Surely the gracious exemption of one man from that puniſhment, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, renders not the puniſhment of another unjuſt, which would otherwiſe be juſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As there is no injuſtice in the caſe now ſtated, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any partiality in it. There is no partiality in the conduct of the Supreme Magiſtrate, who condemns one criminal according to his demerit, and pardons another criminal equally guilty. But partiality is then practiſed, when of two real and known criminals, one is condemned by the judge; the other cleared, on the pretence, that he is innocent. So that this whole argument from the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly different treatment of the ſmalleſt ſinner and ſmalleſt ſaint, whoſe characters are ſo nearly on a level, ſo far as it ſuppoſes the different treatment to be incredible, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the endleſs puniſhment of the ſinner, is a mere begging of the queſtion. It takes for granted, that the ſinner does not deſerve an endleſs puniſhment. So far as it ſuppoſes the different treatment to be incredible, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the infinite reward or happineſs beſtowed on the ſaint, it ſuppoſes, that God in his infinite goodneſs, cannot beſtow an infinite good on a creature, who in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is entirely unworthy of it. It alſo ſuppoſes, that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:022478_0091_0FB9360C73E2F198"/>
God pardon any ſinner, he muſt pardon all, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits are no more than that of the man pardoned; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he is partial: and for the ſame reaſon, that if ever he condemn any ſinner, he muſt condemn all thoſe, whoſe characters are equally ſinful with that of the man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. But it is preſumed, that theſe ſentiments will be avowed by no man.</p>
               <p n="2">II. THE next argument is. That endleſs puniſhment is out of all proportion to the demerit of ſin, as the former is infinite, the latter finite.—As this is a matter of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in the preſent diſpute, it requires our particular attention.—How then does Dr. C. make it appear, that ſin is a finite evil? By theſe ſeveral conſiderations, that it is the fault of a finite creature,—during a finite life,— and the effect of finite principles, paſſions and appetites; the ſum of which is, that it is impoſſible for a creature, in a finite duration, to commit an infinite crime; or which is the ſame thing, a crime which ſhall deſerve an endleſs puniſhment.—As to this let it be obſerved,</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT if it be impoſſible for a creature, in a finite du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to commit a crime which ſhall deſerve an endleſs puniſhment, it is as really againſt what Dr. C. holds, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the oppoſite ſyſtem. He ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 11.</note>
                  <q>If the next is a ſtate of puniſhment intended to ſatisfy the juſtice of God, 'tis impoſſible all men ſhould be finally ſaved:</q>
that is, if in the next ſtate a puniſhment be inflicted, which ſatisfies juſtice, all men will not be ſaved. But a puniſhment, which ſatisfies juſtice is a perfectly juſt puniſhment. It is therefore juſt, that ſome men ſhould finally not be ſaved; or it is juſt, that on account of their ſins, they be without end excluded from ſalvation. And what is the endleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of a ſinner from ſalvation on account of his ſins, but an endleſs puniſhment inflicted for the fault of a finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, committed in a finite life, and the effect of finite prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, paſſions and appetites?—This paſſage of Dr. C. is a plain and full conceſſion both of the juſtice of endleſs, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and of the infinite evil of ſin.</p>
               <p>THAT ſin is an infinite evil, or an evil deſerving an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhment, is implied in all thoſe paſſages alſo, in which Dr. C. aſſerts, that the ſalvation of all men, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the damned, after they have ſuffered all which they ever are to ſuffer, is the fruit of <hi>boundleſs and inexhauſtible
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:022478_0092_0FB9360E403757F8"/>
goodneſs, infinite indulgence and love,</hi> &amp;c. In his argument that the puniſhment of the damned is diſciplinary, he ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 326.</note>
                  <q>That God muſt in the other world, as well as this, be diſpoſed to <hi>make it evident,</hi> that he is a being of <hi>boundleſs</hi> and <hi>inexhauſtible</hi> goodneſs.</q>
It is plain by the connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Doctor means, that the deliverance of the damned, in conſequence of a puniſhment, which is condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to their good, is an act of boundleſs and inexhauſtible goodneſs.</p>
               <p>But that the goodneſs of that act of deliverance is not greater than the evil or puniſhment from which it delivers, will be conceded by all. There is goodneſs in delivering a man from the tooth-ache; but no man will pretend, that this is an act of <hi>boundleſs</hi> and <hi>inexhauſtible</hi> goodneſs. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver from the miſery of a thouſand years torment in hell, is an act of far greater goodneſs. But this is not an act of <hi>boundleſs</hi> and <hi>inexhauſtible</hi> goodneſs. Nor is any act of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance worthy of theſe epithets, unleſs it deliver from an evil, which is boundleſs and inexhauſtible. Doubtleſs the act of God in delivering a ſinner from the puniſhment of hell is called an act of boundleſs and inexhauſtible good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with reſpect to the greatneſs of the benefit conferred by that deliverance, and not with reſpect to the inherent and eſſential goodneſs of God. If the latter be Doctor C's meaning, what he ſays is no illuſtration of the divine goodneſs in delivering a ſinner from the pains of hell: he might have ſaid the ſame concerning the deliverance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon guilty or innocent, from the tooth-ache, or from the prick of a pin. He ſays, that God in the other world, as well as this, muſt be diſpoſed <hi>to make it evident,</hi> that he is a being of boundleſs and inexhauſtible goodneſs. But if the deliverance of a ſinner from the pains of hell be not a boundleſs benefit, it does not make it evident, that God is a being of boundleſs goodneſs. If it be a boundleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, the evil delivered from is boundleſs. If therefore the deliverance of the damned from the torments of hell, be an act and a proof of boundleſs and inexhauſtible goodneſs, as the Doctor holds, the evil from which they are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to which they are expoſed by the divine law, is boundleſs and inexhauſtible. But they are not by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law expoſed to a greater puniſhment than they juſtly deſerve: therefore they juſtly deſerve a boundleſs <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible puniſhment: of conſequence ſin, by which they
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:022478_0093_0FB9361088779E28"/>
deſerve this puniſhment, is a boundleſs and inexhauſtible or an infinite evil.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, Dr. C. in the words of Mr. <hi>Whiſton,</hi> ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 405.</note> "Many, or all of them," [the damned]
<q>may poſſibly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and ſaved at laſt, by the infinite indulgence and love of their creator.</q>
The ſame obſervations, which were made in the preceding paragraph, are applicable here. It cannot be the meaning of Dr. C. that the recovery of the damned is in no other ſenſe a fruit or proof of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite indulgence and love of their Creator, than the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of a perſon in this life from the ſmalleſt diſeaſe, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity; or the deliverance of even an innocent being from ſome ſlight evil. A leſs degree of indulgence and love, than that which is infinite, would be ſufficient for theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, or deliverances. And if nothing ſhort of infinite indulgence and love can recover the damned, then their recovery is a proof of infinite love. Now what can be a proof of infinite love, but the beſtowment of an infinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit? And no benefit conſiſting in recovery from evil is infinite, unleſs the evil, from which the recovery is made, be infinite. But if the evil from which the damned are ſuppoſed to be recovered, be infinite, ſin, by which they are expoſed to that evil, muſt itſelf be an infinite evil.</p>
               <p>IF here it ſhould be objected, that the damned are not indeed <hi>delivered from wrath,</hi> by boundleſs goodneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love; but that boundleſs goodneſs and infinite love are exerciſed in their admiſſion to the poſitive happineſs of heaven only: I entreat the reader to obſerve, that in the former of the two paſſages laſt quoted, Dr. C. is ſpeaking of God's <hi>making evident</hi> his boundleſs and inexhauſtible goodneſs, by pitying ſinners, and puniſhing them in order to their benefit, or by the <hi>deliverance</hi> of the damned, in conſequence of a diſciplinary puniſhment. In the other, he is ſpeaking in the words of Mr. Whiſton, concerning the <hi>recovery</hi> of the damned.—But for a more full anſwer I beg leave to refer the reader to page 13, where this ſame objection has been ſtated and conſidered.</p>
               <p>THAT ſin is an infinite evil, is implied in what Dr. C. holds concerning annihilation; he ſays,
<q>If the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ſcheme ſhould be found to have no truth in it— the ſecond death ought to be conſidered as that which will put an end to their exiſtence both in ſoul and body,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:022478_0094_0FB93611AEF73D38"/>
ſo that they ſhall be no more in the creation of God.</q>
By this it appears that the Doctor held, that endleſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation would be no unjuſt puniſhment of ſin. But end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs annihilation is an <hi>endleſs</hi> or <hi>infinite</hi> puniſhment. It is an endleſs loſs of not only all the good which the man at preſent enjoys; but of all that good which he would have enjoyed throughout eternity, in the ſtate of bliſs to which he would have been admitted, if he had never ſinned. This in an endleſs duration would amount to an infinite quantity of good. Annihilation therefore is an infinite puniſhment both as it is endleſs, and as the quantity of good loſt is infinite: and Dr. C. in allowing that endleſs annihilation would be no more than a juſt puniſhment of ſin, allows, that ſin deſerves an infinite puniſhment, or that it is an infinite evil, though it is the fault of a finite creature, in a finite life, and the effect of finite principles, paſſions and appetites. If therefore it be a difficulty hard to be ſolved, that a finite creature, in a finite life, ſhould commit an infinite evil, meaning a crime which may be juſtly puniſhed with an endleſs puniſhment; it is a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that equally concerned Dr. C. as myſelf; and it was abſurd for him to object that to others, which lay equally in his own way.</p>
               <p>IT may be objected to theſe obſervations, that endleſs annihilation is not an infinite puniſhment, becauſe it may be inflicted on even an innocent perſon. God having once communicated exiſtence is under no obligation to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it; but for wiſe ends may without injury ſuffer even the moſt holy of his creatures, after the enjoyment of exiſtence and of good for a ſeaſon, to drop into their original nothing. To this it may be anſwered; that this objection equally proves, that annihilation is no puniſhment at all, as that it is not an <hi>infinite</hi> puniſhment. When an innocent creature is ſuffered in ſovereign wiſdom to drop into non-exiſtence, this is not only not an infinite puniſhment, but is no puniſhment at all. A puniſhment is ſome evil brought on a perſon, in teſtimony that his conduct is diſapproved by the author of that evil. This is not the caſe in the annihilation of the innocent perſon now ſuppoſed. Therefore it equally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from the poſſible annihilation of an innocent creature, that the annihilation of the wicked would be no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all, as that it would not be an infinite puniſhment. Annihilation is an infinite loſs, and in that ſenſe, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:022478_0095_0FB9361572EFC798"/>
evil, to an innocent perſon, as well as to one ever ſo guilty. But as it is not inflicted on the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of diſapprobation, it is not a puniſhment. On the other hand, if it be inflicted at all on the wicked, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in expreſs teſtimony of the divine abhorrence of their conduct, and therefore is a puniſhment: and any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which is an infinite evil, is an infinite puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>TO illuſtrate this, let the following example be taken. A parent having begun the moſt liberal and advantageous education of his ſon, may for wiſe reaſons, entirely drop, without any injuſtice to his ſon, the courſe of education, which he had begun, and may ſuffer him to grow up in comparative ignorance. This would not only not be a very great puniſhment of his ſon, but no puniſhment at all. Whereas, if he ſhould treat his ſon in the ſame manner, from the motive of teſtifying his diſpleaſure at ſome tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling levity or childiſh inadvertence, it would be both a real and a very great puniſhment: and though it would conſiſt in a loſs or privation, yet it would be a much greater puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the infliction of a very conſiderable poſitive pain. In like manner, though annihilation may be inflicted in ſuch a manner, as to be no puniſhment; yet when it is inflicted with the declared deſign of exhibiting the divine diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at ſin; it is a far greater puniſhment, than a very great and long temporary miſery.—That annihilation is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, no man will deny, who allows that exiſtence and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs are good. And if it be an evil, it is an evil equal to the good loſt by it, taking into view the continuance of that loſs; and as this is infinite, final annihilation is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite evil: and whenever it is inflicted in teſtimony of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation of the conduct of the ſinner, it is an infinite puniſhment.</p>
               <p>DOUBTLESS Dr. C. was of the opinion, that annihilation may be a puniſhment, as it was his belief, that if his ſcheme of univerſal ſalvation be not true, the wicked are to be annihilated. He would doubtleſs have allowed, that annihilation will not be brought on them in teſtimony of the divine approbation of their conduct. Nor can it be ſuppoſed to be the fruit of perfect indifference in the divine mind, with reſpect to their conduct. It muſt therefore be a teſtimony of divine diſapprobation, which conſtitutes it a
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:022478_0096_0FB93617C0B0D970"/>
puniſhment. And as it is an infinite evil, of courſe it is an infinite puniſhment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">To prove that ſin does not deſerve an endleſs puniſhment, Dr. Prieſtly too ſays,
<q>There is no proportion between finite and infinite.</q>

               </p>
               <p>PERHAPS it may be further ſaid, in oppoſition to what has been now advanced, that the meaning of thoſe who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that ſin does not deſerve an infinite puniſhment, is not, that ſin does not deſerve an endleſs <hi>privation,</hi> or <hi>negative</hi> puniſhment; but that it does not deſerve an endleſs <hi>poſitive</hi> puniſhment, conſiſting in <hi>poſitive pains</hi> or <hi>torments.</hi>—If the objection be thus explained, it comes to this merely, that ſin does indeed deſerve an endleſs puniſhment, and ſo is truly and properly an infinite evil, in the ſenſe in which any of us hold it to be an infinite evil: but it is not <hi>ſuch</hi> an infinite evil, as to deſerve ſo great an endleſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as endleſs poſitive pain and torment. But this ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the objection entirely ſhifts the ground of the diſpute: granting, that an endleſs puniſhment is juſtly deſerved by ſin, it denies, that ſo great <hi>a degree</hi> of puniſhment, as end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs poſitive miſery, is deſerved by it. Endleſs annihilation is equally and as truly an endleſs puniſhment, as endleſs tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nor is there any ground of objection to the one more than to the other, on account of any difference in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or that in which alone the infinity conſiſts. But the ground of objection to endleſs miſery, rather than to end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs annihilation, is, that it is a greater, more dreadful, and more intolerable puniſhment; or a greater puniſhment <hi>in degree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BESIDES, not every <hi>degree</hi> of endleſs <hi>pain</hi> is a greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or puniſhment, than endleſs annihilation. No man will pretend, that any ſlight pain continued to eternity, is ſo great an evil, as endleſs annihilation and the endleſs loſs of all enjoyment and exiſtence.</p>
               <p>ON the whole, as the ſtate of the argument before us, is now wholly ſhifted; as it is granted by the objector, that ſin deſerves an infinite or endleſs puniſhment, but not ſo great an endleſs puniſhment, as is implied in <hi>ſome degrees</hi> of endleſs pain; every thing for which we contend, as to the duration of future puniſhment, is granted. It is not
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:022478_0097_0FB93619DE733A20"/>
pretended by the advocates for endleſs puniſhment, that ſin deſerves an infinite <hi>degree</hi> of endleſs puniſhment. Nor do they pretend to <hi>determine</hi> the <hi>degree</hi> of puniſhment, which it deſerves. It becomes all to leave that to God, who alone is able to determine it. The advocates for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary puniſhment will not pretend to determine the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of temporary puniſhment, which ſin deſerves. The <hi>degree</hi> of future puniſhment is not the ſubject of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſpute. I might now therefore fairly diſmiſs the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcuſſion of the infinite evil of ſin, as on account of the conceſſions already mentioned, wholly impertinent to the preſent diſpute. But wiſhing to relieve what difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to throw what light on the ſubject, I can, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to obſerve,</p>
               <p>PERHAPS it may be yet further pleaded, that the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the infinite evil of ſin mean, that ſin does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch an endleſs poſitive miſery, as is worſe than non-exiſtence.—As to this, beſides that it makes the ſubject of the diſpute to be wholly the <hi>degree</hi> of puniſhment, and not the <hi>duration</hi> of it; it may be remarked, that it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this plea, that it would be juſt, if all the wicked, who die in impenitence, were annihilated. Annihilation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the puniſhment deſerved by the leaſt ſinner, who dies in impenitence; and thoſe, whoſe guilt is more aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, deſerve a greater puniſhment; and as ſome are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably greater ſinners than the leaſt, they deſerve an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably greater puniſhment than annihilation. Again, as the leaſt ſinner deſerves annihilation, ſo he deſerves that degree of poſitive pain, or that mixture of pain and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which is equally undeſirable, or equally dreadful as non-exiſtence. Therefore thoſe, who are inconceivably greater ſinners than the leaſt, deſerve that degree of poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive endleſs pain, which is inconceivably worſe and more to be dreaded, than non-exiſtence, or than that mixture of pain and pleaſure, which is equally to be dreaded as non-exiſtence. Therefore from principles conceded by Dr. C. it clearly follows, not only that all ſinners deſerve an endleſs puniſhment, but that all ſinners, except thoſe of the very loweſt claſs, deſerve that degree of endleſs miſery, which is worſe than non-exiſtence; and which is not only an infinite evil, but an evil doubly infinite, as the loſs is infinite, and the poſitive miſery exceeding all the good enjoyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing endleſs, is infinite too.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="93" facs="unknown:022478_0098_0FB9361AE59B3E38"/>2. THE argument of Dr. C. now under conſideration, "If it prove any thing, proves a great deal too much," as it ſuppoſes, that any crime can juſtly be puniſhed for no longer time, than was conſumed in the perpetration of the crime.—That this is implied in the argument, will appear, if we conſider, that if it be once allowed, that a crime may be puniſhed for a longer time than was conſumed in the perpetration of it, the whole argument, that a creature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, in a finite life, commit ſuch ſin, as ſhall deſerve an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhment, muſt be given up. If a man may in one day commit a crime, which deſerves a puniſhment to be continued for a year, who will ſay, that he may not in one day commit a crime, which ſhall deſerve a puniſhment to be continued for <hi>two</hi> years, for <hi>ten</hi> years, or during his life? Therefore in determining the duration of the puniſhment, no regard at all is had to the time taken up in the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the crime. And if no regard be had to this, there is no abſurdity in ſuppoſing, that the crimes of a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite life may deſerve an endleſs puniſhment. To ſay, that there is an abſurdity in it, ſuppoſes, that in adjuſting the puniſhment, a regard is always to be had to the time taken up in the perpetration of the crime; which is contrary to known fact, as well as to the deduction juſt now made. Nay, it implies, as I before obſerved, that no juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be continued for a longer time, than was conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the perpetration of the crime.—The mere dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of puniſhment is of no importance or conſideration, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the whole puniſhment be exceſſive. Therefore perpetual impriſonment is inflicted for crimes, which are perpetrated in a very ſhort time.</p>
               <p>BY the ſame argument, by which Dr. C. undertakes to prove, that ſin does not deſerve an endleſs puniſhment, any man may undertake to prove, that it does not deſerve a puniſhment to continue for ages of ages. The Doctor's argument is, that ſin deſerves no more than a temporary puniſhment, becauſe it is committed in a finite duration. With the ſame ſtrength of argument it may be ſaid: Sin deſerves not a puniſhment of ages of ages, but a puniſhment of no longer duration, than ſeventy years, becauſe it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the ſpace of ſeventy years.—It is manifeſt, that when a puniſhment of ages of ages is inflicted on the ſinner, no regard is had to the time conſumed in the perpetration of ſin. And if it be juſt to inflict a puniſhment in one caſe,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:022478_0099_0FB9323BED266538"/>
without regard to the time conſumed in the perpetration of ſin, why not in another? If becauſe ſin is the fault of a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite life, it does not deſerve an infinite puniſhment; then becauſe it is the fault of a life of leſs duration, than that of ages of ages, it does not deſerve a puniſhment which is to continue for ages of ages.—Or how will Dr. C. prove, that ſin, the fault of a life, which is to continue only ſeventy years, deſerves a puniſhment, which is to continue for ages of ages? I preſume he will not pretend to prove it by any proportion between the duration of ſeventy years and that of ages of ages; but merely by revelation. From the ſame ſource of evidence, we undertake to prove both the reality and juſtice of endleſs puniſhment. And it is as ineffectual to object to our proof of endleſs puniſhment, the diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between an infinite and a finite duration, as it is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his proof of a puniſhment of ages of ages, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion between the duration of ages of ages, and that of ſeventy years. I grant that the diſproportion between infinite and finite duration, is greater, than that between ages of ages and ſeventy years. But, when the time conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the commiſſion of a crime is not at all regarded, let the diſproportion be what it may, nothing can be thence concluded.</p>
               <p>IF it be ſtill pretended, that a regard to the time conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the commiſſion of ſin is had, in determining the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of its puniſhment <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> aſk what regard is had to it? If the duration of the puniſhment may at all exceed the time conſumed in the commiſſion of ſin, how much may the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exceed the latter? To ſay there is an infinite diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between a ſi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap> life, and an endleſs eternity, affords no ſatisfaction. So there is a very great diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a life of ſeventy years, and ages of ages. And if on the principles of Dr. C. an endleſs puniſhment be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt than that of ages of ages, is not the latter on the ſame principles really unjuſt? If not, then a puniſhment, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of which is greatly diſproportionate to the time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in the commiſſion of the crime, is ſtill juſt: and who will undertake to fix the degrees of diſproportion between the duration of the puniſhment, and the time conſumed in the commiſſion of the crime, which are conſiſtent, and which are inconſiſtent with juſtice? And let a reaſon be given, why it is not as really unjuſt to inflict a puniſhment, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of which is greatly diſproportionate to the time ſpent in the commiſſion of the crime, as to inflict a puniſhment,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:022478_0100_0FB9323D700142C8"/>
the duration of which bears no proportion to the time ſpent in the commiſſion of the crime. Why would not the ſame argument from the diſproportion of the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the puniſhment, to the time ſpent in committing the ſin, prove, that Adam was unjuſtly puniſhed, in that he was condemned to eat bread in the ſweat of his face, <hi>all the days of his life,</hi> for the ſin of eating the forbidden fruit, which was doubtleſs finiſhed in a very ſhort time? Alſo, that David was unjuſtly puniſhed, in that <hi>the ſword never depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his houſe,</hi> becauſe of his ſin in the matter of Uriah?</p>
               <p>IF a finite creature, in a finite time, cannot commit an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite evil, or one which deſerves an endleſs puniſhment, it will follow, that even our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, if he be a real creature, though the firſt born of every creature,<note n="*" place="bottom">So far as can be judged from the book of Dr. C. now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der examination, and ſome others of his works, he would not have objected to this character of Chriſt.</note> cannot, if he were diſpoſed, commit an infinite evil. Yet as he created and upholds all things by the word of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he doubtleſs has power to annihilate all things. Now I aſk, whether if Chriſt ſhould annihilate the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſyſtem, himſelf only excepted, it would be a finite or an infinite evil? If the anſwer ſhould be, that it would be a finite evil, I would aſk again, whether it would not be as great an evil to the univerſe, as the endleſs miſery of one ſinner, provided he deſerves that miſery.—I make this this proviſo, becauſe we do not plead for endleſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on any other ſuppoſition, than that it is juſt: And if it ſhould be ſaid, that the endleſs puniſhment of a ſinner is an infinite evil, becauſe it is unjuſtly inflicted, this would be a begging of the queſtion: it would alſo follow, that on the ſuppoſition of the juſtice of the endleſs puniſhment of the ſinner, it is not an infinite evil, and therefore there is no foundation for the objection now under conſideration, that ſin a finite moral evil is puniſhed with an infinite natural e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil or puniſhment.—Beſide, that the endleſs annihilation of the created ſyſtem would be an infinite evil in the very ſame ſenſe, in which the endleſs puniſhment of the damned is an infinite evil, is evident from this conſideration, that the puniſhment of the damned is not pretended to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in any other reſpect, th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> in duration. In the very ſame reſpect the endleſs annihilation of which we ſpeak, is infinite.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:022478_0101_0FB9323EEF6550E8"/>IF the anſwer to the queſtion juſt propoſed, ſhould be, that the annihilation of the created ſyſtem would be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite evil; the conſequence is, that an infinite evil may be cauſed or committed by a finite creature, in a finite time.</p>
               <p>POSSIBLY it may be further objected, that if our Lord Jeſus Chriſt be a mere creature, he had no power in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to create the univerſe; but created it by a divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er communicated for that purpoſe: and that if he ſhould annihilate it, he muſt do it by the ſame communicated pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Therefore Chriſt himſelf has it not in his power, to effect an infinite evil.—But we are to obſerve, that if Chriſt was a proper intelligent moral agent in creation, that work is his work, and properly to be aſcribed to him, as properly as any actions of men are to be aſcribed to them. It is allowed on all hands, that all men have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all their powers of action from their creator; yet no man will diſpute, whether theſe actions be the proper actions of men, or whether the effects produced by theſe actions be imputable to them, as their proper cauſes. Therefore with at leaſt as great truth and propriety is Chriſt, even on the ſuppoſition that he is a mere creature, the proper cauſe of all his works, whether of creation or annihilation, as men in general are the cauſes of their works. He cannot poſſibly be more dependent for his powers, than we are for ours. Nor is it of any importance to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject now under conſideration, whether Chriſt had original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the power of creation and annihilation, or whether it was communicated to him afterwards. A power given by God at one time, is as really given by him, as if it were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at another time.</p>
               <p>IN the argument againſt the infinite evil of ſin, that a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite creature cannot commit an infinite evil, in a finite time; the finitude of <hi>the time</hi> is either eſſential to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the argument, or it is not. If it be eſſential, it implies, as was before obſerved, that no crime can deſerve to be puniſhed for a longer time, than was conſumed in the commiſſion of the crime. If the finitude of the time be not eſſential to the argument, but the meaning be, that a finite creature cannot at all commit an infinite evil, becauſe he is a <hi>finite creature,</hi> it will follow, that if the whole ſyſtem of intelligent creatures were to revolt from God, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their revolt to an abſolute eternity, it would be but a finite evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:022478_0102_0FB93241ED7EB698"/>OBJECTION: The time never can come, at which the ſyſtem of creatures ſhall have continued to an abſolute eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in their revolt from God. Though therefore we ſuppoſe that the whole created ſyſtem ſhould revolt, it is abſurd to ſuppoſe, that they ſhall have continued in their revolt to an abſolute eternity: and therefore it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that the whole created ſyſtem ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted an infinite evil.—ANSWER. For the ſame reaſon it is impoſſible, that a creature ſhould have been puniſhed to an abſolute eternity. The longeſt puniſhment to which any ſuppoſe the wicked are doomed, is in no other ſenſe infinite, than that in which the revolt which has been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, may be infinite. If then the wicked be not doomed to an infinite or endleſs puniſhment; ſin is not, on any ſcheme, puniſhed with an infinite puniſhment; and then the whole objection of puniſhing a finite evil, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite puniſhment, falls to the ground.</p>
               <p>BUT this whole argument, founded on the finitude of the life and of the capacity of the ſinner, was virtually given up by Dr. C. in that he believed, that endleſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation would be a juſt puniſhment of ſin: though the duration of the puniſhment in this caſe, would infinitely exceed the time conſumed in the commiſſion of ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">III. WE come at length to conſider the third argument of Dr. C. againſt the juſtice of endleſs puniſhment, which is, that endleſs puniſhment, on account of the infinite evil of ſin, as committed againſt a God of infinite glory, implies, that future puniſhment is infinite or to the utmoſt in <hi>degree,</hi> as well as <hi>duration,</hi> and therefore that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of all the damned is equal, which is both abſurd and contrary to ſcripture. This I take to be the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment intended in the latter part of the laſt quotation made in the beginning of this chapter.—On this it is obſervable, that though a ſinner, on account of the infinite evil of ſin as committed againſt a God of infinite glory, deſerve and ſhall ſuffer an endleſs puniſhment; it by no means follows, that he deſerves or will ſuffer that puniſhment which is infinite in degree too, or which is to the utmoſt degree in which any ſinner is puniſhed. All that follows from the infinite evil of ſin is, that it deſerves an infinite puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and an endleſs puniſhment is an infinite puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though it be not to the utmoſt in degree. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when Dr. C. ſays,
<q>According to this way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:022478_0103_0FB93244F66E9DB8"/>
all ſinners muſt ſuffer to the utmoſt <hi>in degree,</hi> as well as duration, otherwiſe, they will not ſuffer ſo much as they ought to do;</q>
he merely aſſerts what he ought to have proved. Therefore he fails in his attempt to faſten on the doctrine of the infinite evil of ſin, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity that the puniſhment of all the damned will be equal. He might as well have argued, that becauſe all ſaints ſhall receive an infinite or an endleſs reward; the reward of every one will be to the utmoſt in degree, and the reward of all will be equal.</p>
               <p>OR if the meaning of this argument be, that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will all be puniſhed equally, not becauſe they will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an <hi>endleſs</hi> puniſhment, but becauſe they all ſin againſt the ſame infinitely glorious object, and therefore their ſins are all equal: the anſwer is, that the conſequence by no means follows from the premiſes. Though it be true, that the wicked all ſin againſt the ſame God, and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all deſerve endleſs puniſhment? yet it no more fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows thence, that they all deſerve the ſame puniſhment in degree, than if a number of ſubjects ſhould rebel againſt the ſame excellent Prince, it would follow, that they are equally guilty, and all deſerve an equal puniſhment.</p>
               <p>THE expreſſion, <hi>infinite evil of ſin,</hi> ſeems to be very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to ſome gentlemen. They ſeem to conceive that it means as great an evil or crime, as it is poſſible for a man to commit, the moral turpitude of which can in no reſpect be increaſed.—This idea of the infinite evil of ſin is very different from that which is entertained by thoſe who hold, that ſin is an infinite evil. All they mean is, that ſin is in ſuch a ſenſe an infinite evil, that it may be juſtly followed by an endleſs puniſhment. It no more follows hence, that the moral turpitude of any particular ſin can not be increaſed, than that the endleſs puniſhment of it cannot be increaſed; or than that the endleſs happineſs of the ſaints in heaven cannot be increaſed. Indeed, neither the happineſs of heaven, nor the miſery of hell can be increaſed in <hi>duration</hi>: nor can the turpitude of ſin be ſo increaſed, as to deſerve a greater duration of puniſhment, than that which is endleſs. But as both the happineſs of heaven and the miſery of hell, though endleſs, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed <hi>in degree</hi>; ſo may the turpitude of ſin be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, as to deſerve a greater degree of puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="unknown:022478_0104_0FB932480F915A00"/>WHEN it is ſaid, that if the evil of ſin be infinite, it is as great as poſſible, and ſo all ſins are equal; it ſeems to be implied, that all infinites are equal in all reſpects, than which nothing is more falſe. An infinite line, an infinite ſuperficies, and an infinite ſolid, are all infinites, and they are all equal in one reſpect or dimenſion, that of <hi>length.</hi> But a line though truly infinite in length, is not in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion of breadth equal to an infinite ſuperficies. Nor is a ſuperficies, though truly infinite in the two dimenſions of length and breadth, equal in depth to an infinite ſolid.— To apply this, ſin may be infinitely aggravated with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the object againſt whom it is committed, and in that reſpect it may be incapable of an increaſe of aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Still it may not be infinite with reſpect to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of oppoſition, or virulence and malignity to the object, againſt whom it is committed.</p>
               <p>BY the infinite evil of ſin therefore is meant, that ſin tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerves an endleſs puniſhment, as it is committed againſt an infinitely glorious object, againſt God himſelf, his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, his law, his government; and as it enervates the laws, violates the peace and ſafety of his kingdom, introduces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and ruin, and would actually ruin entirely that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the happineſs of all who belong to it, were not meaſures taken by God to prevent its natural effect. In this reſpect it is infinitely evil, and in this reſpect, in which it is infinitely evil, the evil of it cannot be increaſed, becauſe the object againſt which it is committed, cannot be greater, more important, or more excellent; and in this reſpect all ſins are equal. But by the infinite evil of ſin, is not meant an evil, which deſerves an infinite degree of puniſhment; or an act of oppoſition to God and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is infinitely virulent or malicious. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the evil of ſin may be increaſed, and in this reſpect all ſins are by no means equal.—The evil of any one ſin is not ſo great, but that on the whole it may be increaſed, as the happineſs of heaven is not ſo great, but that on the whole that may be increaſed.</p>
               <p>THOUGH the turpitude of ſin is infinite with reſpect to the object oppoſed, yet it is not infinite as to the degree of oppoſition. If a ſubject rebel againſt the moſt excellent ſovereign on earth, his crime is, in reſpect to the object, as great as he can commit in rebellion againſt a temporal prince; becauſe by ſuppoſition he cannot be the ſubject of
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:022478_0105_0FB9324F5EF5B090"/>
a better temporal prince, and therefore he cannot rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a better. Yet this rebellion may be more aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by greater degrees of oppoſition, abuſe or inſult to this ſame excellent prince.</p>
               <p>WHAT has been now ſaid concerning the infinite evil of ſin, has been in the way of explanation, and in anſwer to Dr. C's objections. The poſitive proof, that ſin is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite evil, has been ſo largely and ably given by others, that the reader will allow me to refer him to them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Preſident Edwards's ſermon on the <hi>Eternity of hell-tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and his tract on <hi>Juſtification.</hi> Dr. Bellamy's <hi>Eſſay on the Goſpel,</hi> Sect. V. Mr. Hopkins on the <hi>Future State,</hi> Sect. IV.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THUS I have particularly attended to the arguments brought by Dr. C. to prove, that the endleſs puniſhment of the wicked would not be juſt.—I ſhall now proceed to a more general conſideration of the juſtice of endleſs puniſhment conſiſting in miſery, and to ſome arguments in proof of it. The firſt argument to which I wiſh to direct the attention of the reader, is, that if endleſs puniſhment be the curſe of the divine law, or the puniſhment threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the divine law, as the wages of ſin, or as the proper puniſhment of ſinners; undoubtedly it is juſt. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that a God of perfect and infinite juſtice ſhould threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en an unjuſt puniſhment.—I am indeed aware, that it is not a conceded point, that endleſs miſery is threatened in the divine law: I therefore purpoſe to attempt the proof of it.—The curſe of the divine law is either endleſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation, or it is that miſery which the wicked in fact ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in hell, or it is ſome temporary miſery of greater dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than that which is actually ſuffered in hell, or it is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs miſery. Theſe ſeveral hypotheſes ſhall come under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration in the following chapters.</p>
               <p>BUT before I proceed, it may be proper to explain in what ſenſe I uſe the word <hi>law,</hi> in this inquiry concerning the curſe of the divine law.—By the divine law, I mean not merely any poſitive, revealed law, as that given to Adam concerning the tree of knowledge of good and evil: but what Dr. C. calls "the moral law of God," and
<q>the law of works, as requiring perfect, actual, indefect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able obedience.</q>
The Doctor allows, that "he" [Adam]
<q>was, without all doubt, under ſtrict indiſpenſable obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to obey every command of God, wherein it
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:022478_0106_0FB9325411CC9460"/>
ſhould be made known to him—and muſt have rendered himſelf obnoxious to the righteous reſentments of his God and king, had he expreſſed any diſregard to any of them.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">5 Diſſ. p. 55.</note> This he ſpeaks concerning the moral law, as may be ſeen by the context. And doubtleſs as Adam was obligated to obey "every command" of the moral law, and in caſe of diſobedience, was
<q>obnoxious to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous reſentments of God,</q>
the ſame is true of every other man. The righteous reſentment of God for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to this law, is that very <hi>curſe of the law,</hi> from which Chriſt hath redeemed his people, and which is the proper object of our preſent inquiry. By law taken in this ſenſe, Dr. C. abundantly holds, that no man can be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
<q>By <hi>law,</hi> the apoſtle ſometimes means law in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, both the law written in men's hearts, and in the books of revelation—ſometimes—the Moſaic law in ſpecial. But whether he underſtand by it natural or revealed law, or law including both; works done in conformity to it, when mentioned with reference to juſtification, he always ſets aſide as totally inſufficient for the procurement of it.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">12 Sermons, p. 4.</note> Here the Doctor tells us in what ſenſe he uſes the word <hi>law,</hi> which is the ſame in which I uſe it, in the preſent inquiry: and as he aſſerts in this context, and in very many other paſſages, that no man, "Jew or Gentile," can be juſtified on the foot of law taken in the ſenſe juſt explained; of courſe all men are condemned by the law, and the puniſhment to which the law condemns all, is the curſe of the law; or the curſe of the law is that puniſhment to which the moral law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns every man who tranſgreſſes it.</p>

               <p>DOCTOR C's firſt object was, to prove that all men will be finally happy. — If he ſhould fail in this, his laſt reſort was <hi>annihilation.</hi>
                  <q>If the foregoing ſcheme,</q>

                  <q>ſhould be ſound to have no truth in it, and the wicked are ſent to hell, as ſo many <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curables,</hi> the ſecond death ought to be conſidered, as that which will put an end to their exiſtence, both in ſoul and body, ſo as that they ſhall be no more in the creation of God.</q>
Having made the ſuppoſition, that the <hi>next</hi> is the <hi>final</hi> ſtate of men, he ſays,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 288.</note>
                  <q>It is moſt peremptorily affirmed, that they</q>
(the wicked)
<q>ſhall <hi>reap corruption, periſh,</hi> be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> and <hi>die a ſecond time</hi>; which fixes the ſenſe of the word <hi>everlaſting,</hi> when joined with the <hi>miſery</hi> they ſhall be doomed to undergo, limiting its meaning to an age, or period of duration only.</q>
Corruption, perdition, deſtruction, and the ſecond death do not limit the meaning of the word everlaſting, unleſs it be on the ſuppoſition, that thoſe words themſelves mean annihilation. Sometimes by thoſe words Dr. C. ſeems to have meant a tranſition from one future ſtate of exiſtence to another; at other times he expreſſly declares that they mean <hi>miſery, torment.</hi> Now if thoſe words applied to the wicked mean a tranſition from the next ſtate of exiſtence to another, they by no means certainly limit their miſery. This tranſition may be from one ſtate of miſery to another ſtate of miſery; as Dr. C. ſuppoſed that they might paſs through ſeveral future ſtates of miſery, before they ſhould arrive at happineſs. Nay, from the words uſed in this ſenſe, no inference can be drawn, that they will <hi>ever</hi> arrive at a ſtate of happineſs: becauſe a tranſition from one ſtate of miſery to another ſtate of miſery, is as truly a tranſition, as a tranſition from a ſtate of miſery to a ſtate of happineſs.—But if thoſe words mean <hi>miſery</hi> or <hi>torment,</hi> they certainly do not limit the future miſery of the wicked; as will more fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear preſently.</p>

But this proof, if it be one, was abſolutely given up by himſelf, as he held, that thoſe words ſignify not annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but <hi>miſery</hi>; as in the following paſſages;

                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Page 337.</note> How ſtrange then is it, that Dr. C. ſhould urge the literal and original meaning of the words <hi>death, deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c. as an argument for annihilation, when he himſelf ſuppoſed that they mean not annihilation, but obviouſly mean <hi>miſery!</hi> and that he ſhould ſuppoſe, that they limit the ſenſe of the word <hi>everlaſting,</hi> when it is joined to the miſery of the damned!

               <p>Perhaps ſome admirers of Dr. C. may attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile this inconſiſtence, by ſaying, he held that the words <hi>death, deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c. mean and prove annihilation, on the ſole ſuppoſition, that the next ſtate is final: that on any other ſuppoſition he held that they mean miſery.— But this would be a vain attempt.

               <p>THE truth appears to be, that Dr. C. was led to adopt, as <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

To this preconceived opinion the ſcripture muſt ſome way or other be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated.</p>
               <p>BUT let us proceed to ſome conſiderations to confirm the propoſition, that annihilation is not the curſe or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment denounced againſt ſin in the divine law.</p>
               <p>THE doctrine, that annihilation is the curſe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law, may be holden in two different ſenſes, both which I conceive to be entirely oppoſite to the truth.— It is the ſentiment of many, that annihilation is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin threatened in the law, and is actually inflicted on thoſe who die impenitent.—Again; it is the ſentiment of ſome, that though annihilation will not be inflicted on any; yet it is the curſe which was originally in the law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt ſin; but that Chriſt hath abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed all from it; and therefore none will ſuffer it.</p>
               <p n="1">I. IT is the ſentiment of many, and was the ſentiment of Dr. C. provided his ſcheme of univerſal happineſs do not hold; that annihilation is the puniſhment threatened in the law, and is actually inflicted on thoſe who die im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent.—Concerning which it is to be remarked;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That on this hypotheſis, all Dr. C's arguments both from ſcripture and reaſon, to prove the ſalvation of all men, entirely fall to the ground; and it is nothing incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with either the juſtice or goodneſs of God, that a great part of mankind ſhould be forever caſt off, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an endleſs puniſhment; and not only a great part, but the greater part of the whole; as he acknowledges, that

                  </gap>
in the plural number, determining, that they, the devil, the beaſt and the falſe prophet, ſhall be <hi>tormented</hi> for ever and ever.—The wicked ſhall be tormented with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, <hi>in the preſence</hi> of the angels, and <hi>in the preſence</hi> of the lamb.</p>
               <p>BUT how can thoſe who are annihilated, be ſaid to be caſt into <hi>fire,</hi> into a lake of <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>brimſtone,</hi> and to be <hi>tormented</hi> there; to have no reſt; to <hi>weep,</hi> and <hi>wail</hi> and <hi>gnaſh their teeth; to dwell</hi> with everlaſting <hi>burnings?</hi>— As well might theſe things be ſaid of them before they were created.—How can they be ſaid <hi>to plead</hi> for admiſſion into heaven, and to <hi>reaſon</hi> on the ſubject with the maſter of the celeſtial manſions? How can they <hi>ſee</hi> Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob in the kingdom of God? How can they ſeeing Abraham and Lazarus in that ſtate, <hi>enter into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> with the former?—Rev. XIV. 11. The ſmoke of their torment aſcendeth up forever and ever, and they have <hi>no reſt day nor night.</hi> But thoſe who are annihilated, ſo far as they have any thing, have continual reſt day and night.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>different degrees</hi> of the puniſhment of the wicked in hell prove, that their puniſhment does not conſiſt in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation. Matt. V. 22,
<q>Whoſoever ſhall be angry with his brother without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of the judgment: whoſoever ſhall ſay to his brother, raca, ſhall be in danger of the council: but whoſoever ſhall ſay, thou fool, ſhall be in danger of hell-fire.</q>
—The
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:022478_0112_0FB93264911C18B0"/>
ſervant who knows not his maſter's will, and commits things worthy of ſtripes, ſhall be beaten with <hi>few</hi> ſtripes. but the ſervant who knows his maſter's will, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits things worthy of ſtripes, ſhall be beaten with <hi>many</hi> ſtripes.—It ſhall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon and for Sodom, than for Chorazin, Bethſaida and Capernaum. —The wicked ſhall receive according to their works, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fruit of their doings, and according to that which they ſhall have done in the body. The ſcribes and Phariſees were to receive the greater damnation, Matt. XXIII. 14.—But if annihilation be the puniſhment of the wicked, there is no difference between the puniſhment of the leaſt ſinner and the greateſt, who die impenitent: which is both abſurd in itſelf and abſolutely contradictory to the ſcriptural account.</p>
               <p>IF it ſhould be pleaded in anſwer to this argument, that though all the wicked ſhall ſuffer annihilation; yet the puniſhment of all will not be the ſame; as the more ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated ſinners will be made the ſubjects of miſery for a while, and then be annihilated: it may be replied, that this ſuppoſes the curſe of the law to conſiſt in two things, temporary miſery and annihilation. But where have we any hint in the ſcripture, that the curſe of the law, as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the future world, is ſuch a heterogeneous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound as this?—After all, it ſeems, that annihilation is but a ſmall part of that curſe; for that alone will be inflicted on the leaſt ſinner only, and on account of the leaſt ſin; and all that puniſhment which ſhall be inflicted on any perſon, above that which is due to the leaſt ſin; is to conſiſt in torment. Why then might not the conſtitution have been, that the ſmall additional part of the curſe, which is to conſiſt in annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould likewiſe be inflicted in torment? This was very feaſible. He who ſuffers the puniſhment of ninety nine ſins in torment, might by a ſmall addition, in degree or dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his torment, have ſuffered the puniſhment of an hundred ſins. Add to the torment of every ſinner dying impenitent, a degree or duration of miſery, equal to that which is deſerved by one ſin, and that the leaſt, and there would have been no need that any of them be annihilated, but having ſuffered the whole curſe of the law, they would on the foot of ſtrict juſtice be entitled to exemption from further puniſhment. And who having by miſery ſatisfied
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:022478_0113_0FB93266A97DC3E0"/>
for all the various and moſt aggravated ſins of his life, would not chooſe to ſatisfy, in the ſame way, for the leaſt of all his ſins, rather than to be ſtruck out of exiſtence, and to loſe inconceivable and endleſs enjoyment? As therefore this ſuppoſed conſtitution would be ſo apparently unneceſſary and unwiſe, it cannot be expected to obtain credit, unleſs it be moſt clearly revealed in ſcripture, which is not pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning it.—Beſides, this hypotheſis places ſo ſmall a part of the puniſhment of ſinners in annihilation, that it cannot with any propriety be ſaid, that the curſe of the law conſiſts in annihilation.</p>
               <p>SHOULD it be further objected, that though all the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be annihilated, yet their puniſhment may be of different degrees, as the loſſes they ſhall reſpectively ſuffer, will be different according to their various degrees of enjoyment or capacities for enjoyment: it may be anſwered, that the wicked are to be puniſhed according to their ſeveral crimes. A man guilty of murder, will, if his other crimes be the ſame, be puniſhed more than the thief, who ſteals the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of five ſhillings. Yet the enjoyment of the latter and his capacity for enjoyment, may be far greater than thoſe of the former. By annihilation therefore he would ſuffer a far greater loſs.—Not all thoſe who know their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's will, and yet commit things worthy of ſtripes, poſſeſs greater enjoyments or capacities for enjoyment, than thoſe who know not their maſter's will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE puniſhment of the fallen angels does not conſiſt in annihilation: and the damned ſuffer the ſame kind of puniſhment with them. That the fallen angels are as yet annihilated, I preſume, will be pretended by no believer in divine revelation, and that they are not to be annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will be evident, if we conſider, that in expectation of that full puniſhment, to which they are liable, they aſked our Lord, whether he were come to <hi>torment</hi> them before the time. It was <hi>torment</hi> then, not annihilation, which they expected. The preſent ſtate of the fallen angels is a ſtate of torment to a certain degree. They "believe and <hi>tremble</hi>:" "They are reſerved in chains under darkneſs, to the judgment of the great day," Jude, 6: "They are caſt down to hell," 2 Peter, II, 4: "The devil that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them, was caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, where the beaſt and the falſe prophet <hi>are,</hi> and [they] ſhall be <hi>tormented</hi> day and night, forever and ever," Rev. XX, 10. This text proves,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="109" facs="unknown:022478_0114_0FB93268D6B6BA50"/>(1) That the devil is now, before the general judgment, in a ſtate of torment, in the lake of fire and brimſtone.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſcene of which this text diſplays a part, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly an exhibition of what is to take place before the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral judgment. This is evident from the context.</note> And it appears from the queſtion, which he put to our Lord, to which reference was juſt now had, that he anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly dreads the removal, which he is to ſuffer, from this his preſent ſtate, to that in which he is to be after the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral judgment, and to which he and his angels, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in chains. But can we ſuppoſe, that he would anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly dread a deliverance by annihilation, out of the lake of torment by fire and brimſtone? This would imply, that endleſs annihilation is more to be dreaded, than the endleſs torment which is the ſubject of this controverſy. If ſo, Dr. C. ought to have dropped all objections to the juſtice of endleſs torments, ſince he allowed that the annihilation of the wicked would be juſt. And if that be juſt, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo endleſs continuance in the lake of fire and brimſtone, which is the utmoſt puniſhment that any man holds concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the wicked, and which is now ſuppoſed to be a leſs puniſhment than annihilation, is juſt.—But if it be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that annihilation is not ſo great a puniſhment as end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs continuance in the lake of fire and brimſtone; it is as abſurd to ſuppoſe, that the devils ſhould dread or tremble at the proſpect of annihilation, as that a man tormented with the gout or ſtone, ſhould dread or tremble at an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that he ſhould ere long be delivered from his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in their ſtead ſhould ſuffer the prick of a pin.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) THAT text directly proves, that the devil is to be <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi> tormented, and not annihilated. "And <hi>they,</hi>" [the nominative to be ſupplied] "ſhall be tormented forever and ever."—To ſay that this means, that the devil will be firſt tormented for ages of ages, and then be annihilated, leads into the abſurdities before noticed.</p>
               <p>BUT to this ſtate of torment, in which the fallen angels are, and are to be, the wicked ſhall be ſent. "Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." "The devil that deceived them, was caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, <hi>where</hi> the beaſt and the falſe prophet are." And as the devil is not to be annihilated, but puniſhed with torments, ſo are the wicked.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:022478_0115_0FB93269B19F9148"/>4. ROM. IX, 22, affords an argument pertinent to the preſent ſubject. The words are, "What if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long ſuffering, the veſſels of wrath fitted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction." One end it ſeems of permitting ſinners to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſuch lengths in ſin, is to make known the divine power in their deſtruction. But annihilation is no exertion of power, it is a mere ſuſpenſion of power.—The words imply further, that the longer God endures with the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the greater will be the manifeſtation of both his <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>power</hi> in their deſtruction. But as annihilation is the ſame to every perſon annihilated, it exhibits no greater manifeſtation of power towards one than towards another. And if it were a manifeſtation of power, there would be no greater manifeſtation of power in the annihilation of one, than of another. It is preſumed, that no unbiaſſed judge will ſay, that the meaning is, that God endures, <hi>with much long-ſuffering</hi> the veſſels of wrath, to diſplay his wrath and power <hi>in their annihilation</hi>; as the very ſame diſplay of both would be made, without any long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>THE only conſideration urged from ſcripture in ſupport of the ſentiment, which I am oppoſing, is the application of the words, <hi>death, deſtruction, periſh, corruption,</hi> &amp;c. to the puniſhment of the wicked.—This however came with a very ill grace from Dr. C. who underſtood, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated by his ſcheme of univerſal ſalvation, to underſtand, thoſe words to mean miſery, as I have already ſhown.— With regard to others, who make not this conceſſion, let them, if they believe in revelation, (and with ſuch only I diſpute) reconcile the ſcriptures with themſelves, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſuch like paſſages as thoſe I have quoted above, repreſenting the puniſhment of the damned, to conſiſt in miſery, in any conſiſtence with the threatening of <hi>death, deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c, otherwiſe than by allowing that thoſe words do mean poſitive miſery. But to allow this, is to give up the ſcheme of annihilation; or at leaſt this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it.</p>
               <p>BESIDES, the ſcriptures themſelves explain their own meaning in the uſe of the words <hi>death, deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c. The ſecond death is expreſsly ſaid to conſiſt in being caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, and in having a part in that lake; which is not a deſcription of annihilation, nor
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:022478_0116_0FB9326B341C1E50"/>
can be reconciled with it. Rev. XX, 14. Ch. XXI, 8.— Mat. XXIV, 51, "And ſhall cut him aſunder, and appoint him his portion with hypocrites, there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth." To divide a man into two parts, as determinately expreſſes annihilation, as the words <hi>death, perdition,</hi> &amp;c. This however the ſcripture ſuppoſes to be conſiſtent with a ſtate of miſery, expreſſed by wailing and gnaſhing of teeth. Gen. V, 24. "Enoch walked with God, and <hi>was not,</hi> for God took him." In this inſtance, though the ſcripture ſays, Enoch <hi>was not,</hi> which more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly expreſſes annihilation, than <hi>death, deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c, yet it explains itſelf to mean not annihilation; indeed no man pretends that the righteous are annihilated.—When the ſcriptures ſay, that men are <hi>dead</hi> in treſpaſſes and ſins, no man underſtands the expreſſion to mean annihilation. The ſame may be ſaid of the apoſtle's words in 1 Tim. V, 6. "She that liveth in pleaſure is <hi>dead</hi> while ſhe liveth."</p>
               <p>THEREFORE, ſince the ſcriptures do often uſe the word <hi>death,</hi> &amp;c. to ſignify ſomething entirely different from a ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of life or of exiſtence; and ſince we cannot make the ſcriptures conſiſtent with themſelves, unleſs we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſame words in the ſame latitude, when applied to the puniſhment of the wicked, we are neceſſitated to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them in that latitude.</p>
               <p n="2">II. As I obſerved, there is another ſenſe in which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation may be holden, and was holden by Dr. C. which is this; that though annihilation will not actually be inflicted on any man, yet it is the curſe which was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in the divine law denounced againſt ſin; but that Chriſt hath abſolutely redeemed all men from that curſe, ſo that no man is now liable to it.

               <p>ON this hypotheſis, the puniſhment actually ſuffered by the damned is no part of the curſe of the divine law, but merely a neceſſary and wholeſome diſcipline deſigned for the good of the patients. But this ſcheme of annihilation can, no more than the former, be reconciled with the ſcripture, which ſays the wicked ſhall receive according to their works, ſhall pay the uttermoſt farthing, ſhall have judgment without mercy, wrath without mixture, &amp;c. Nor indeed can it be reconciled with Dr. C's book, which ſays, The wicked will be puniſhed according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, according to their ſins, according to the nature and number of their crimes and evil deeds: and ſo that the law will have its courſe, and the threatened penalty will be executed on ſome of them at leaſt. Theſe expreſſions certainly declare, that they will ſuffer the full curſe of the divine law. Otherwiſe the curſe of the law is a greater puniſhment than that which is according to the deſerts of the wicked, and greater too than the full penalty threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in the law; which is abſurd and contradictory.</p>
               <p>HERE I might repeat the various arguments urged in the third chapter, to prove that the puniſhment of the damned is not a mere ſalutary diſcipline. But to avoid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, I beg leave to refer the reader to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there ſuggeſted: and to proceed to other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which may further ſhow, that the future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked is not diſciplinary, and that Chriſt hath not ſo redeemed all men from annihilation, that no man is now liable to it, if indeed that be the curſe of the law.</p>
               <p n="1">1. IF annihilation be the curſe of the divine law, and the torments of hell be a mere ſalutary diſcipline; then there is no forgiveneſs in exempting a ſinner from thoſe torments. To forgive a ſinner is to exempt or releaſe him from the curſe of the law; not to excuſe him from a
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:022478_0118_0FB93274EB1403E0"/>
ſalutary mean of grace. If a phyſician excuſe his patient from an emetic or from the cold bath, no man will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that he exerciſes forgiving grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I WISH the reader to attend to Gal. III. 10;
<q>For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curſe: for it is written curſed is every one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them.</q>
This proves that all men are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely delivered from the curſe of the law, whether that curſe conſiſt in annihilation, or miſery temporary or endleſs: becauſe ſome men are evidently ſuppoſed in this text, to be expoſed to that curſe.
<q>As many as are of the works of the law,</q>
as doubtleſs many of the Jews of that day were, are expreſſly ſaid to be "under the curſe." They therefore were not <hi>abſolutely and unconditionally</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from that curſe. But if the curſe of the law be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation, and all men be unconditionally delivered by Chriſt from that curſe, how can any man be under it?</p>
               <p>IF it ſhould be ſaid, that this text is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe the curſe here mentioned is the curſe, not of the moral, but of the ceremonial law; it may be anſwered, If this text, with the context ſay nothing of redemption from the curſe of the <hi>moral</hi> law, how is it known, that Chriſt, according to the hypotheſis now under conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hath delivered all men unconditionally from annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is ſuppoſed to be the curſe of the moral law? It is the 13th verſe, which aſſures us, that "Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law." If this mean the ceremonial law, it ſeems, we have no aſſurance that Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the moral law, be that annihilation or what it may; but all that Chriſt hath done or ſuffered notwithſtanding, we are as liable to that curſe, as we were before Chriſt undertook for us.</p>
               <p>BESIDES, the curſe of the law here mentioned, is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry curſe mentioned in Deut. XXVII, 26, from which it is quoted. But that was not the curſe of the ceremonial law, but of the moral, as every precept enumerated in that context, and to which this curſe is annexed, is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moral.—Or if this curſe be that to which any man is liable, who tranſgreſſes any precept, written in the <hi>book</hi> of the law; it will certainly include the curſe of the moral law. For whether the <hi>book</hi> mentioned, be the book of Deuteronomy, or the whole Pentateuch, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:022478_0119_0FB9327A03FD8BA0"/>
the whole <hi>moral</hi> law. Therefore the curſe here mentioned includes the curſe of the <hi>moral</hi> law. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with reſpect to us under the goſpel, the text muſt mean the moral law only, becauſe, as the ceremonial law is now repealed, it is no longer in exiſtence, and therefore is no longer contained in the book of the law.—Further, if the redemption of Chriſt was a redemption from the curſe of the ceremonial law only; then it had no reſpect at all to us Gentiles, who never were under the ceremonial law; nor are we in any reſpect redeemed by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>IT is alſo to be obſerved, that this curſe is oppoſed by the apoſtle, throughout the context, to the bleſſing of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, as is manifeſt by inſpection. But the bleſſing of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham did not conſiſt in freedom from the ceremonial law. If it conſiſted in that, the Gentiles originally poſſeſſed the bleſſing of Abraham, ſince they were as perfectly free from the ceremonial law, as Abraham himſelf. Whereas the coming of the bleſſing of Abraham on the Gentiles is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as a new and adventitious bleſſing, not as one origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally poſſeſſed by them; ſee v. 8 and 14. The bleſſing of Abraham is not only not ſaid to conſiſt in bare freedom from the ceremonial law, but it is poſitively ſaid to conſiſt in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith; v. 6—10. v. 14 and 29.</p>
               <p>THIS paſſage throws light on the preſent queſtion in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother point of view. As the curſe of the law is ſet in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect oppoſition to the bleſſing of Abraham, all who are not entitled to the bleſſing of Abraham, are of courſe under the curſe, and are not unconditionally reſcued from it by Jeſus Chriſt.—If it ſhould be ſaid, that the bleſſing of Abraham is common to all mankind, all being juſtified and exempted from the curſe of the law, as he was; let it be obſerved, that Abraham obtained this bleſſing in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of faith only: and will it be pretended, that all men are now the ſubjects of the faith of Abraham? The apoſtle conſtantly ſpeaks of this bleſſing as ſuſpended on the condition of faith: v. 7, "They which are of faith, the ſame are the children of Abraham." V. 8, "The ſcripture, foreſeeing that God would juſtify the heathen through faith." V. 9, "They which be of faith, are bleſſed with faithful Abraham." V. 14, "That the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; that we might receive the promiſe of the ſpirit through faith." V. 29, "If ye be Chriſt's, then
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:022478_0120_0FB9327AF5809820"/>
are ye Abraham's ſeed, and heirs according to the promiſe." Now if faith in Chriſt be neceſſary to the inheritance of the bleſſing of Abraham, and all who are not entitled to that bleſſing, be liable to the curſe of the law; then it cannot be true, that all mankind are unconditionally freed by Chriſt from the curſe of the law, whether that curſe be annihilation or any thing elſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. ON the hypotheſis now under conſideration, what are pardon and juſtification? They are every where in ſcripture repreſented to be conditional, ſuſpended on the conditions of repentance and faith; and the ſame is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly holden by Dr. C. however inconſiſtently with his other tenet concerning the unconditional exemption of all men from the curſe of the law. The language of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, He that believeth ſhall be ſaved; but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not, ſhall be damned. He that believeth not is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already—the wrath of God abideth on him, &amp;c, &amp;c. How can thoſe be <hi>condemned,</hi> and how can the <hi>wrath of God abide</hi> on thoſe, who are unconditionally delivered from the curſe of the law? Pardon is generally ſuppoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in an acquittance from the curſe of the law: but if all men, penitent and impenitent, believing and unbelieving, be acquitted and delivered from that curſe, where is the propriety or truth of limiting pardon to the penitent and believing, and of declaring, that all the reſt of men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned? To what are they condemned? Not to ſuffer the curſe of the law: From this they are by ſuppoſition unconditionally delivered. By what are they condemned? Not by the law: this would imply, that they are under the curſe of it.</p>
               <p>IF to this it be ſaid, that the impenitent are condemned to ſuffer the curſe of the law, in this ſenſe only, that the law declares the puniſhment to which, according to ſtrict juſtice, they are liable; but not that puniſhment to which they are now liable, ſince the redemption of Chriſt:—To this it may be anſwered, In this ſenſe the penitent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving are equally condemned, as the impenitent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing; nay, the whole body of the ſaints in heaven. Nor would there be any truth in ſaying, in this ſenſe, "He that believeth on Chriſt, is not condemned."</p>
               <p n="4">4. THAT ſingle text, Gal V. 2, ſeems to confute the hypotheſis now in queſtion. The words are,
<q>If ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</q>
Whereas
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:022478_0121_0FB9327C838A72C8"/>
according to the hypotheſis now in queſtion, whether the Galatians were circumciſed or not; whether they depended on their circumciſion and other conformity to ceremonial inſtitutions or not: ſtill Chriſt did profit them; ſtill by him was unconditionally ſecured to them the infinite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of eſcape from the curſe of the law, and of an endleſs life of happineſs and glory in heaven.—</p>
               <p>THIS argument is equally concluſive, whether it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that Chriſt has unconditionally reſcued all men from annihilation or any other puniſhment. If ſalvation be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to all men by Chriſt, then he does profit them, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be circumciſed or depend on their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</p>
               <p>BESIDE the two lights in which the doctrine of annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation hath been ſtated above, there is another in which ſome ſeem to hold that doctrine; it is this, That if after God ſhall have uſed all proper means for the repentance and ſalvation of the wicked, they ſhall ſtill remain impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, he will annihilate them from deſpair of ever bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to good.—Concerning this ſentiment it may be inquired, what then is the curſe of the law? Is it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation? If ſo, then I refer to the arguments already urged in this chapter againſt that idea; viz. That on that ſuppoſition endleſs puniſhment is juſt: That the ſcripture abundantly repreſents the puniſhment of the damned to conſiſt in miſery: That the puniſhment of all who ſuffer the curſe of the law will be equal: That the curſe of the law is the ſame puniſhment which the devils ſuffer, which is not annihilation: That the puniſhment which the finally impenitent ſhall ſuffer, will be ſuch, that in it God will diſplay both his wrath and power, and greater degrees of wrath and power in the caſe of thoſe, with reſpect to whom he exerciſes the greateſt long-ſuffering: which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true, if the curſe of the law be annihilation, as that is not an exertion of power at all. or a diſplay of greater wrath and power in the caſe of one ſinner than of another. If it be ſaid, that the curſe of the law is that diſcipline which the wicked ſhall ſuffer, before they be annihilated, I refer to what has been ſaid, chap. II and III.—If it be granted that the curſe of the law is endleſs miſery; either it muſt be allowed, that endleſs miſery will be ſuffered by ſome men; or that though endleſs miſery be the curſe of the law, Chriſt hath redeemed and will ſave all men from
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:022478_0122_0FB9327F807C34E0"/>
it, by admitting ſome to endleſs happineſs, and by inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on others endleſs annihilation. With reſpect to this laſt ſentiment, I beg leave to refer to the conſiderations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted in this chapter: and that the curſe of the law, or all that puniſhment which the wicked juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, whether it conſiſt in endleſs miſery or any thing elſe, will actually be inflicted, hath been attempted to be proved in chap. III.</p>
               <p>ON the whole; it is left with the candid and judicious to determine, whether annihilation be the curſe of the law: and whether that as the curſe of the law can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with the ſcriptures, on either of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned hypotheſes.—1. That all who die in impenitence, will be annihilated, as the proper and adequate puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their ſins in this life.—2. That annihilation was originally the curſe of the law; but that Chriſt hath reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued all from it.—If it ſhall be found that annihilation in any view of it, is not the curſe of the law; it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, that that curſe conſiſts either in that puniſhment which ſinners actually ſuffer in hell; or in ſome temporary miſery greater than that which they actually ſuffer in hell; or in endleſs miſery. In which of theſe it does conſiſt, ſhall be farther inquired in the next chapter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> The Juſtice of endleſs Puniſhment conſiſting in Miſery.</head>
               <p>ACCORDING to what was propoſed in the cloſe of the laſt chapter, I am to inquire in the firſt place, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the curſe of the law, or the puniſhment which in the divine law is threatened againſt tranſgreſſors, conſiſt in that puniſhment which the wicked will actually ſuffer in hell.— That this cannot be the curſe of the law, on the ſuppoſition that all men are to be ſaved, appears at firſt bluſh from this conſideration, that ſome men will actually ſuffer that puniſhment: and if that puniſhment be the curſe of the law, ſome men will be damned and not ſaved. For ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſts in deliverance from tho curſe of the law. "Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law:" and all who are ſaved, are ſaved by the redemption of
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:022478_0123_0FB93281039B8DB0"/>
Chriſt, which is a redemption from the curſe of the law. But ſince all men are not ſaved from that puniſhment which a great part actually ſuffer in hell; it is abſurd to ſay, that that puniſhment is the curſe of the law from which Chriſt hath redeemed and will ſave all men.</p>
               <p>I MEAN not now to enter into any diſpute concerning the nature of Chriſt's redemption. It is ſufficient for my preſent purpoſe to take for granted no more, than is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all chriſtians, that all who are ſaved, are ſaved ſome how by and through Chriſt. This is abundantly aſſerted in the various works of Dr. C. But neither has he pretended nor will any other advocate for univerſal ſalvation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that the puniſhment which is actually to be ſuffered by a great part of mankind in hell, is the curſe of the law from which Chriſt is to ſave <hi>all men</hi>: becauſe by the very terms a great part of mankind are actually to ſuffer it.</p>
               <p>BESIDE; if that be the curſe of the law; it is all the puniſhment to which the ſinner is juſtly liable. He having ſuffered that, cannot conſiſtently with juſtice be made to ſuffer any further puniſhment; and if after that he be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from further puniſhment, he is exempted from it, not in the way of grace, forgiveneſs or pardon; but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on the footing of juſtice and of his own perſonal right. It is to be noticed however, that the goſpel is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of any ſalvation of ſinners, except in the way of grace and forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>IF the puniſhment actually to be ſuffered in hell be the curſe of the law, then the damned in their deliverance out of hell, and exemption from further puniſhment, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence no ſalvation at all. They are delivered from nothing to which they are or ever were expoſed. We might as well ſay, that the moſt innocent citizen in the ſtate <hi>is ſaved from the gallows,</hi> when he hath neither committed any crime, nor is accuſed of any.—The very idea of ſalvation is deliverance from the curſe of the law. But if the pains of hell for ages of ages be the curſe of the law, they who ſuffer thoſe pains, are not ſaved; they are damned to the higheſt poſſible degree conſiſtent with law and juſtice; which is all the damnation for which any man can argue.</p>
               <p>ON the whole, I conclude, that the idea, that the curſe of the law conſiſts in the puniſhment, which the damned are actually to ſuffer in hell, is totally irreconcileable with the ſalvation of all men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:022478_0124_0FB93283F467BDB0"/>IN the next place we are to inquire, whether the curſe of the law conſiſt in ſome temporary puniſhment, which is of greater duration than that which is ſuppoſed to belong to the puniſhment which the damned ſhall actually ſuffer. If the curſe of the law be a temporary puniſhment of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er duration than that which is actually to be ſuffered by the damned; that more laſting temporary puniſhment is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs threatened in the law. Doubtleſs the curſe of the law is the curſe threatened in law: the very terms imply this. Now, where in all the law, or in all the ſcripture, is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened any puniſhment of greater duration, than that which in the ſacred dialect is ſaid to be <hi>everlaſting, forever, forever and ever,</hi> &amp;c? But all theſe expreſſions are on all hands allowed to be applied in ſcripture to the puniſhment which the damned ſhall actually ſuffer. Unleſs therefore ſome longer puniſhment can be found threatened in ſcripture, than that which is ſaid to be <hi>forever and ever,</hi> &amp;c, it cannot be pretended, that the curſe of the law is a temporary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of greater duration, than that which is actually to be ſuffered by the damned. But no puniſhment of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er duration, whether temporary or endleſs, than that which the damned are conſtantly declared to ſuffer, can be pointed out from any part of ſcripture. Therefore the curſe of the law is not a temporary puniſhment of greater duration, than that which is to be ſuffered by the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>NOW, if this train of reaſoning be juſt, if the curſe of the divine law be neither annihilation, nor (on the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the ſalvation of all men) that miſery which the damned are actually to ſuffer; nor a temporary miſery of greater duration; the conſequence is inevitable, that it is endleſs miſery. No other hypotheſis ſeems to be conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The law certainly threatens ſome puniſhment. This puniſhment muſt conſiſt either in annihilation, or in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. If it conſiſt in ſomething elſe, that ſomething muſt be either temporary or endleſs miſery. If it be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary miſery, it muſt be either a miſery of ſhorter dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than that which is to be ſuffered by the damned; or that very miſery which is to be ſuffered by the damned; or a temporary miſery of longer duration. That the curſe of the law is a miſery of ſhorter duration than that which is to be ſuffered by the damned, no man will pretend; as this would imply that the damned will ſuffer a greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:022478_0125_0FB93285908A96B0"/>
than was ever threatened, and than is juſt. And that the curſe of the law is neither the very miſery to be ſuffered by the damned, nor a temporary miſery of longer duration, I have endeavoured to prove, and ſubmit the proof to the candid and judicious. If the proof ſhall be found to be good, we are driven to the concluſion, that the curſe of the divine law is endleſs miſery.</p>
               <p>IF then it be an eſtabliſhed point, that endleſs miſery is the curſe of the divine law; the inference is immediate and neceſſary, that the endleſs miſery of the ſinner is a juſt puniſhment of his ſin. It is impoſſible that a God of inviolable and infinite juſtice ſhould threaten in his law an unjuſt puniſhment. A law containing ſuch a threatening, is an unjuſt law; and an unjuſt law can never be enacted by a legiſlator of perfect juſtice.—It is in vain to ſay, that God will never execute the law. To make an unjuſt law, is as really irreconcileable with juſtice, as to execute it. What ſhould we think of a human prince who ſhould enact a law, that whoever ſhould walk acroſs his neighbour's ground without his conſent, ſhould die on the gallows. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume no man would pretend, that the forbearance of the prince to execute the law, would ſave his character from abhorrence and contempt.</p>
               <p>AGAIN; If all men ſhall be ſaved, they will be ſaved from ſomething, from ſome puniſhment. That puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be either temporary or endleſs. If it be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, it muſt be either that puniſhment, which is to be endured by the damned, or a longer temporary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But for reaſons already given, it can be neither of theſe. Therefore it muſt be an endleſs puniſhment. But if all men be ſaved from an endleſs puniſhment, they were expoſed to an endleſs puniſhment, and expoſed to it by a divine conſtitution, and therefore an endleſs puniſhment is juſt; otherwiſe it could not have been appointed by God.</p>
               <p>IF all men ſhall be ſaved, they are redeemed by Chriſt, and they are redeemed by him from ſome puniſhment. That puniſhment is either temporary or endleſs. If it be temporary, it is either the puniſhment which the damned ſhall actually ſuffer, or a longer temporary puniſhment. But for reaſons already given it is neither of theſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is an endleſs puniſhment. Therefore they were expoſed to an endleſs puniſhment, and that puniſhment is juſt. Surely no Chriſtian will pretend, that our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:022478_0126_0FB9328C9E897D58"/>
Chriſt came to redeem and ſave us from a puniſhment to which we never were expoſed, and which the very juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of God would never permit him to inflict.</p>
               <p>IF endleſs puniſhment be unjuſt, it ſeems that Chriſt came to ſave mankind from an unjuſt puniſhment; a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, to which they were not juſtly liable, and which could not be inflicted on them conſiſtently with juſtice. But what an idea does this give us of God? It implies, that he had made an unjuſt law, denouncing an unjuſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty; that having made this law, he was determined to execute it, till Chriſt came and prevented him.</p>
               <p>IF all men ſhall be ſaved, and ſhall be ſaved in the way of grace, favour, pardon or forgiveneſs; then it would be juſt, that they ſhould not be ſaved. If their deliverance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply grace and forgiveneſs, then it would be juſt, that they ſhould not be delivered, and that they ſhould ſuffer that puniſhment from which they are delivered. But for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons already given, if all men ſhall be ſaved, they ſhall be ſaved from an endleſs puniſhment. And to be ſaved from an endleſs puniſhment not on the footing of juſtice, but by mere grace and forgiveneſs, implies, that the infliction of endleſs puniſhment would be juſt. Surely to liberate a perſon from an unjuſt puniſhment, is no act of forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>ALL the aſcriptions of praiſe, and all hymns of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving ſung by the ſaved on account of their ſalvation, prove, that it would have been juſt, that they ſhould not be ſaved. If God in delivering all men from endleſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, be worthy of praiſe and thankſgiving, it would have been juſt, if he had not delivered them from it. A mere act of juſtice, which the object of it may demand on the footing of his perſonal right, does not infer, an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to any great praiſe or thankſgiving. No man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf bound very much to praiſe another for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him his due, or for not injuring him, or for not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing him, when he deſerves no puniſhment. But the only puniſhment, from which God delivers all men, on the ſuppoſition, that all are to be ſaved, is an endleſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as was ſhewn before. Therefore, unleſs endleſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment be juſt, there is no foundation for praiſe and thankſgiving for the ſalvation of all men.</p>
               <p>IF endleſs puniſhment be unjuſt, then God was bound in juſtice to ſave all men from it, and could no more fail of granting this ſalvation, than he could deny himſelf: and
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:022478_0127_0FB9328DACE24BA0"/>
he was bound in juſtice to do whatever was neceſſary to that ſalvation, and if that ſalvation could not be diſpenſed, but in conſequence of the incarnation and death of Chriſt; then unleſs God had given his ſon to become incarnate and to die, he would have committed injuſtice. So that on this plan, the very gift of Chriſt, of the goſpel, and of all the means of grace, are mere acts of juſtice, and not of grace or favour: and the revelation of the goſpel or of the ſalvation of all men is no gracious communication, but a communication made entirely on the foundation of juſtice. For ſurely it is but an act of juſtice to tell mankind, if there be any need of telling them, that God will not injure them, and ſo preſerve them from the tormenting fear of injury from the hand of God. To have kept them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the neceſſary means of knowing this, would have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured of cruelty.—Yet according to the ſcriptures the forementioned divine acts and communications are no acts of juſtice, but of free and infinite grace.</p>
               <p>IF endleſs puniſhment be unjuſt, it is hard to imagine of what advantage the mediation and redemption of Chriſt is to all mankind. Dr. C. ſpeaking of his own ſcheme of univerſal ſalvation, ſays,
<q>Nor is there any ſcheme that ſo illuſtriouſly ſets forth the powerful efficacy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive advantage of the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt. If mankind univerſally are the objects of his concern, if he died for them all, if he aſcended up to heaven for them all, if he is there acting on their behalf, and managing all things in the kingdom of grace, with a view to their ſalvation, and will not give up his miniſtry in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, till he has actually accompliſhed this great deſign, and inſtated the whole human kind in eternal glory, what more noble idea can we form of his undertaking for us?</q>
&amp;c. <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 14.</note> What is "the powerful efficacy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive advantage of the mediation of Chriſt," with regard to thoſe, who ſuffer for ages of ages, as Dr. C. allows ſome men do? Is "the powerful efficacy and extenſive advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Chriſt's mediation" "illuſtriouſly ſet forth" in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them from an unjuſt puniſhment? is the idea, that Chriſt came to ſave them from a puniſhment, which they do not deſerve, "the moſt noble idea we can form of his undertaking?" Thoſe who are ſaved by Chriſt, without ſuffering the torments of hell, do indeed derive ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:022478_0128_0FB93290E717C060"/>
from the mediation of Chriſt. But this is no great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er advantage than is derived from Chriſt, according to the ſcheme of thoſe, who believe in endleſs puniſhment. They hold, that all who are preſerved from hell, are preſerved from it by Chriſt. But what advantage do thoſe men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from Chriſt's mediation, who paſs through the torments of hell, and are not ſaved, till they have been puniſhed for ages of ages? To ſay that they are reſcued by Chriſt from endleſs miſery, is either to give up the preſent queſtion, and to allow that endleſs miſery is juſt: or it is to give up the moral rectitude of the divine character, and to hold, that God has threatened, and was about to inflict, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt puniſhment.—To ſay, that the advantage, which they derive from Chriſt, is that they are reſcued from a temporary puniſhment, which is longer than forever and ever, is to ſay, that for which there is no foundation, as no ſuch puniſhment is threatened or mentioned in ſcripture. So that in any caſe, if endleſs puniſhment be unjuſt, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to imagine, of what advantage the mediation and redemption of Chriſt is to all mankind.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>hope</hi> of the goſpel implies that endleſs puniſhment is juſt. On the plan of univerſal ſalvation, all men are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to <hi>hope</hi> that they ſhall be delivered from ſome puniſhment. Dr. C. applies Rom. VIII. 20, to all men, and ſuppoſes that they are all ſubjected to vanity <hi>in hope</hi> of "deliverance from the bondage of corruption," and from "the final conſequences" of it.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 106, 119.</note> That is, all men have a ground to hope, that they ſhall be at laſt delivered from ſin and its puniſhment. This puniſhment as we have ſeen, can be no other than an endleſs puniſhment. But that God encourages us to hope, that we may eſcape endleſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as clearly implies that endleſs puniſhment is juſt, as his encouraging us to hope, that he will never leave us nor forſake us in this life, implies that it would be juſt, if he ſhould leave us. If endleſs puniſhment be not juſt, then God encourages us to hope, that he will not injure us, will not rob us of our rights or tyrannize over us! The very idea of hope in this caſe, implies ſome danger that God will injure us; however that there is a poſſibility, and therefore a foundation to <hi>hope,</hi> that he will not injure us.</p>
               <p>IF endleſs puniſhment be unjuſt, we are as ſure, that it will never be inflicted, as we are of the juſtice of God, or
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:022478_0129_0FB932956408B758"/>
as we are, that the judge of all the earth will do right. But are we ever encouraged in ſcripture barely to <hi>hope,</hi> that the judge of all the earth will do right?—What if a ſubject who has always entirely conformed to the laws of his prince and is conſcious of his own innocence, and alſo knows that his prince is fully informed of it, ſhould ſay, that he <hi>hopes</hi> his prince will not order him to be executed as a felon? This would certainly imply great diffidence in the juſtice of his prince, and would be a high reflection on his character. Much more is it a reflection on the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of God, to expreſs a bare <hi>hope,</hi> that under his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, no man will be puniſhed with an unjuſt puniſhment.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>promiſes</hi> of the goſpel appear to be a further proof of the juſtice of endleſs puniſhment. They are promiſes of deliverance from ſome puniſhment. If there be any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the ſalvation of all men, they are not promiſes that all ſhall wholly eſcape the puniſhment of hell. Dr. C. and others grant, that ſome men will ſuffer that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Nor are they promiſes of eſcape from a longer temporary puniſhment, than that of hell, as there is no mention in all the ſcripture of ſuch a puniſhment. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are promiſes of deliverance from endleſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore endleſs puniſhment is juſt: otherwiſe the promiſes that God will ſave from it, would be abſurd. The very idea, that God promiſes to ſave from endleſs puniſhment, implies that he has a right to inflict it. Do we ever find God promiſing in ſcripture, that he will not injure or tyrannize over his creatures? And are the
<q>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and precious promiſes,</q>
which the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Peter mentions, merely aſſurances that we ſhall not be treated by God unjuſtly? There would be nothing at all precious in ſuch promiſes; becauſe they would give us no greater ſecurity from ſuch injury, than we ſhould have without them. If the bare juſtice of God do not ſecure us from injury at his hands, neither will his veracity.— What ſhould we think of a prince of good reputation for juſtice, if he make proclamation, that he would not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh any of his ſubjects ten times as much as they deſerve; and ſhould call this an exceeding great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? Whatever we might before have thought of him and of his government, we ſhould doubtleſs then think that his ſubjects were not perfectly ſecure in their rights.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="unknown:022478_0130_0FB93298EE0DA088"/>DR. C. allows that it is our duty to pray for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all men. This appears eſpecially in his comment on 1 Tim. II, 4, &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 163.</note> But this proves the juſtice of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhment. If we are to pray for the ſalvation of all men, we are to pray that they may be delivered from the curſe of the law; which, as we have ſeen already, is an endleſs puniſhment. Now, to pray that God would ſave men from endleſs puniſhment certainly implies an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of juſt expoſure to ſuch puniſhment. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would be as much propriety, that the angels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the throne of God, ſhould pray, that they, perfectly guiltleſs as they are, may not be puniſhed with the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell. What if an entirely innocent and moſt du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſubject of ſome earthly prince, and one who is by all acknowledged to be ſuch, ſhould prefer a petition to his prince, that he would not order the petitioner to the ſtake or the gallows?</p>
               <p>HITHERTO the juſtice of endleſs puniſhment has been conſidered on the ground of what I ſuppoſe to be the truth, that it is deſerved by every ſinner, on account of the ſins which he hath committed in this lite only.—There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground, on which it may be ſupported, and which is equally inconſiſtent with that capital argument in favor of the ſalvation of all men, that endleſs puniſhment is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable with juſtice.—Though it were not juſt, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict an endleſs puniſhment for the ſins committed in this life only, which I by no means allow; yet there would be no injuſtice in ſuffering the ſinner to go on in ſin, and to puniſh him continually and without end as he ſins.</p>
               <p>THAT it was no injuſtice in God, to leave man at firſt to fall into ſin, will doubtleſs be granted by all, becauſe it is an evident fact. Now if God may without injury permit a creature to fall into ſin to day, and puniſh him for it, why may he not do the ſame tomorrow, and ſo on through eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day or period of his exiſtence. And if it be juſt to leave a ſinner to endleſs ſin, it is doubtleſs juſt to inflict on him endleſs puniſhment for that endleſs ſin. Therefore the endleſs ſin and puniſhment of a creature is no more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with divine juſtice, than the exiſtence of ſin and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in any inſtance, and for ever ſo ſhort a duration. If it be not conſiſtent with juſtice, that a ſinner be left by God to endleſs impenitence; then the leading of a ſinner
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:022478_0131_0FB9329F687F5328"/>
to repentance is an act of mere juſtice, the payment of a debt, and not an act of grace, which is utterly irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the ſcriptures.—If it be not conſiſtent with juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to leave a ſinner to final impenitence, then God is bound in juſtice, ſome time or other to lead every ſinner to repentance. But when is this time? How long may God, without injury, permit the ſinner to continue impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent? If he may for one day, why not for two? for four? for eight, &amp;c. to eternity?—Though the damned ſhould, by their ſufferings, fully ſatisfy for all their paſt ſins; yet God would be no more obliged in juſtice, to lead them to repentance, or to preſerve them from ſin in future, than he was obliged to preſerve them from ſin at the time they firſt fell into it: and conſequently he would not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in juſtice to releaſe them from puniſhment. I take it to be abundantly conceded by Dr. C. that the damned may juſtly be puniſhed till they repent. Therefore if they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repent they may juſtly be puniſhed without end</p>
               <p>NOW, that our advocate for univerſal ſalvation, may eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh his favorite propoſition, that endleſs puniſhment is not reconcileable with divine juſtice; he muſt ſhow, that it is not conſiſtent with divine juſtice, to leave a ſinner to proceed without end in his own choſen courſe of ſin, and to puniſh him daily for his daily ſins. Till he ſhall have done this, it will be in vain for him to plead, that thoſe who die in impenitence, will all finally be ſaved, becauſe endleſs puniſhment is not reconcileable with the juſtice of God.</p>
               <p>IF after all, any man will inſiſt, that endleſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not reconcileable with divine juſtice? he ought fairly to anſwer the preceding reaſoning, and to ſhow that the curſe of the divine law from which Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us, is either annihilation, or that miſery which the damned are actually to ſuffer; or a longer temporary miſery. He ought to ſhow further, that Chriſt came to deliver all men from ſome other puniſhment, than that which is endleſs; or that it is reconcileable with the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of God to refuſe to releaſe man from an unjuſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, without the mediation of his ſon: that deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from unjuſt puniſhment is an act of free grace, pardon, or forgiveneſs: that deliverance from an unjuſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is a proper ground of extatic and everlaſting praiſe and thankſgiving to God. That the very miſſion of
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:022478_0132_0FB932A06E740760"/>
Chriſt, the inſtitution of the goſpel and of any means ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the deliverance of ſinners from endleſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, can be conſidered as gracious gifts and inſtitutions, on any other ſuppoſition than that endleſs puniſhment is juſt. He ought alſo to ſhow, of what advantage the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Chriſt is to thoſe who ſuffer in hell for ages of ages; and how the <hi>hope</hi> and the <hi>promiſes</hi> of the goſpel, and how <hi>praying</hi> for the ſalvation of all men, can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with the idea, that endleſs puniſhment is unjuſt, and finally, that it is unjuſt, that God ſhould leave a ſinner to perpetual ſin, and to puniſh him perpetually for that ſin.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to be but an act of juſtice to Dr. C. to repeat here, what I noticed before, that he himſelf, whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently or not, does acknowledge the juſtice of endleſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: as in theſe words:
<q>If the next ſtate is a ſtate of puniſhment, not intended for the cure of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients themſelves, but to <hi>ſatisfy the juſtice of God,</hi> and give warning to others, 'tis impoſſible all men ſhould be finally ſaved.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 11.</note> This is a plain declaration, that a ſtate, in which all ſalvation, and all poſſibility of ſalvation, are excluded, no more than ſatisfies juſtice, or is no more than juſt.—The ſame is confeſſed in thoſe many paſſages of this and the other works of Dr. C. wherein he has po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively aſſerted, that man cannot be "juſtified on the foot of mere law," of "rigid law" &amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 34, 36, 43, &amp;c.</note> He would not deny, that the law of God is juſt, perfectly juſt. If therefore we cannot be juſtified on the foot of the divine law, we muſt on that foot be finally condemned, and conſequently muſt be finally condemned on the foot of juſtice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the final or endleſs condemnation of the wicked is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely juſt. The juſt law of God himſelf condemns them: and if that law, "mere law," "rigid law," be executed, they muſt be condemned to an endleſs puniſhment, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be juſtified or ſaved. So long therefore as the divine law is juſt, ſo long, according to the conceſſion of Dr. C. the endleſs condemnation and miſery of the wicked are juſt.—There ſeems to be no way to avoid this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but by holding that the curſe of the law, and the puniſhment which "ſatisfies juſtice," are annihilation, with reſpect to which ſentiment, I muſt refer the reader back to Chap. V. But how inconſiſtent it is, to hold, that endleſs puniſhment, whether conſiſting in annihilation, or
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:022478_0133_0FB932A3DF7C0348"/>
miſery, is no more than ſatisfactory to juſtice; and at the ſame time to hold, that the wicked in temporary pains in hell, ſuffer according to their deſerts, and endure the whole penalty of the law, cannot eſcape the notice of any atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive reader.—Or will it be ſaid, that the Doctor held a <hi>commutation</hi> of puniſhment? that endleſs annihilation is <hi>commuted</hi> for temporary miſery? If ſo, then temporary mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is the curſe of the divine law now inflicted in <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> for endleſs annihilation; and our author was entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken in a doctrine abundantly taught in all his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that, "by law," "mere law," "rigid law," no man can be juſtified or ſaved.</p>
               <p>AS a corollary from the whole of the preceding reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning the juſtice of endleſs puniſhment, may I not ſafely aſſert, what was moſt grievous to Dr. C. and is ſo to all other advocates for univerſal ſalvation; that SIN IS AN INFINITE EVIl? If every ſinner do, on account of ſin, deſerve an endleſs puniſhment, <hi>ſin</hi> is an infinite evil: that is all that is meant by the infinite evil of ſin.—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any man deny the infinite evil of ſin, let him prove, that it does not deſerve an endleſs puniſhment, and let him anſwer the preceding reaſoning to evince the juſtice of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhment.<note n="*" place="bottom">In this chapter it was often more convenient for me, on ſeveral accounts, to uſe the expreſſion <hi>endleſs puniſhment,</hi> than that of <hi>endleſs miſery.</hi> Still the reader will perceive, that the latter is my meaning. The reaſons had been given in the preceding chapter, why the endleſs puniſhment of the damned cannot be annihilation.</note>
               </p>
               <p>PERHAPS ſome may object, that ſuppoſing ſin do deſerve an endleſs puniſhment, when it is not repented of; yet how can it deſerve ſo great a puniſhment, when it is renounced in real repentance.—But if repentance make atonement for ſin; if it ſatisfy the broken law of God; if it repair the damage done to ſociety by ſin; or if it ſo far atone, that the good of the univerſe, comprehending the glory of the deity, though it before required, that ſin ſhould be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with endleſs puniſhment, now requires that it be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a temporary puniſhment only: then as repentance is a ſatisfaction made by the ſinner himſelf, and makes a part of his perſonal character, ſin repented of, does indeed not deſerve endleſs puniſhment, otherwiſe it does. And if repentance do make the ſatisfaction for ſin which has been
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:022478_0134_0FB932A51CA7C8F0"/>
deſcribed, then the ſatisfaction or atonement of Chriſt is in vain, ſince repentance would have anſwered the purpoſe without the death and atonement of Chriſt. There was no need that ſinners be redeemed by Chriſt, or as Dr. C. ſays, that he ſhould be "the perſon <hi>upon whoſe account,</hi>" and that
<q>his obedience and death ſhould be <hi>the ground or reaſon</hi> upon which happineſs ſhould be attainable by any of the race of Adam.</q>
They might have redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, and by repentance have made a full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or atonement for their own ſins, and thus might have been ſaved <hi>on their own account,, and on the ground or reaſon of their repentance.</hi>—But if on the other hand it be granted, that repentance does not make atonement or ſatisfaction for ſin, and it be juſt to puniſh a ſinner without end, provided he do not repent; it is juſt to inflict the ſame puniſhment, though he do repent.</p>
               <p>THIS chapter ſhall be cloſed with a remark on a paſſage before quoted from Dr. C.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 309.</note> in which he ſays, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the <hi>degree</hi> of the pain of the damned will ſcarce be thought worthy to be brought into the account, when the circumſtance of endleſs duration, is annexed to it.— If the different degrees of the miſery of the damned be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of notice, and do not ſufficiently diſtinguiſh them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeveral degrees of demerit; then the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees in the happineſs of the ſaints in heaven do not ſufficiently diſtinguiſh them, according to their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Therefore on the ſame principle we ought to deny the endleſs duration of the happineſs of heaven, as well as of the miſery of hell; and to ſay, that the difference in the degree of happineſs of the bleſſed in heaven, will ſcarce be thought worthy to be brought into the account, when the circumſtance of endleſs duration is annexed to it; that if the happineſs of heaven be of endleſs duration, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of all the inhabitants of that world will be equal, which is inconſiſtent with the declarations of ſcripture, that all ſhall be rewarded according to their works; and that therefore the doctrine of the endleſs happineſs of heaven is not true.—But the falſity of this concluſion is evident to all: and equally falſe is the concluſion from the like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that the puniſhment of the damned is not endleſs.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Containing another view of the queſtion concerning the Juſtice of endleſs Puniſhment.</head>
               <p>IN the preceding chapter, the queſtion concerning the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of endleſs puniſhment was conſidered in the light in which it is ſtated by Dr. C. There is another view of the ſame queſtion, which is not indeed exhibited in his book, but is much talked of by ſome who in general embrace his ſcheme. It is this: Whatever the general good requires, is juſt: Whatever is not ſubſervient to the general good, is unjuſt. Now as the endleſs puniſhment of the wicked is, in their opinion, not ſubſervient but hurtful to the general good, it is, ſay they, unjuſt. The queſtion thus ſtated ſeems to be nothing more than a diſpute concerning the proper meaning of the word juſtice. It reduces all juſtice to the third ſenſe of juſtice as explained above,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 80, &amp;c.</note> and perfectly confounds juſtice with goodneſs as it reſpects the general ſyſtem. Therefore the queſtion which comes up to view, according to the ſenſe of juſtice now propoſed, is the very ſame with this, Whether the endleſs puniſhment of the wicked be conſiſtent with the general good of the univerſe, or with divine goodneſs; which ſhall be conſidered at large in the next chapter, and needs not be anticipated here. However it may be proper to point out the impropriety and abſurd conſequences of this uſe of the word <hi>juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT was doubtleſs ſubſervient to the general good, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was crucified by wicked hands, and therefore in the ſenſe of juſtice now under conſideration, his crucifixion was juſt; they who perpetrated it, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an act of juſtice. Yet will any man pretend, that our bleſſed Lord was not injuriouſly treated by his wicked crucifiers? If they committed no injury to our Lord, wherein did the wickedneſs of this action conſiſt?—The truth is, the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion of Chriſt was no injury to the univerſe, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable benefit: yet it was the higheſt injury that could be done him perſonally.</p>
               <p>EVERY inſtance of murder is doubtleſs made by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling hand of divine providence, ſubſervient to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good and the divine glory. But does a man murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:022478_0136_0FB932A7EFD1B6E8"/>
ſuffer no injury? The ſame may be ſaid of all the aſſaults, thefts, robberies, murders and other crimes that have ever been committed. Though they will in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of all things be overruled to ſubſerve the general good, ſo that the univerſe will finally ſuffer no injury by them; yet very great perſonal injury may be done by them to thoſe who have been robbed, murdered, &amp;c. Theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations may ſhow the neceſſity of diſtinguiſhing between the private rights of individuals, and the rights of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and between private, perſonal injuſtice, and injuſtice to the univerſe. If all the crimes in the world, becauſe they will be finally rendered by the divine hand ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the good of the univerſe, be in every ſenſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely juſt, and the omiſſion of them would be unjuſt; where ſhall any injuſtice be found? No injuſtice is, ever was, or can poſſibly be committed by any being in this, or any other world. No injuſtice can be committed, till ſome thing ſhall be done, which God ſhall not finally render ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his own glory and the good of the intellectual ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>ACCORDING to the principle now under conſideration, it would not be juſt, that any man ſhould eſcape any cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, which he does in fact ſuffer. It was not juſt that Paul ſhould eſcape ſtoning at Lyſtra, or that John ſhould not be baniſhed to the iſle of Patmos: and whenever it is ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the public good, that any criminal, a murderer for inſtance, ſhould be pardoned, or ſhould be ſuffered to paſs with impunity; it is not juſt to puniſh him; he does not deſerve puniſhment: Cain did not deſerve death for the murder of his brother, nor did Joab, during the life of David, deſerve death for the two murders of Abner and Amaſa, both better men than himſelf. And if he did not deſerve death, what did he deſerve? It appears by the hiſtory and by the event, that it was not ſubſervient to the general good, that he ſhould, during the life of David, be puniſhed at all. Therefore on the preſent ſuppoſition, he deſerved, during that period, no puniſhment at all for thoſe murders. If ſo, then during the ſame period, at leaſt, there was no ſin, no moral evil in thoſe murders: for ſin or moral evil always deſerves hatred and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—But afterwards in the reign of Solomon, the general good required Joab to be puniſhed with death. At that time therefore he deſerved death for thoſe murders;
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:022478_0137_0FB932B201B04040"/>
and thoſe ſame actions which for ſeveral years after they were perpetrated, had no moral evil in them, grew, by mere length of time, or change of the circumſtances of the ſtate, to be very great moral evils.—See then to what conſequences the principle now under conſideration will lead us! It muſt therefore be renounced as falſe, or as a great perverſion of language.</p>
               <p>WHEN I aſſert the juſtice of the endleſs puniſhment of the wicked, I mean that it is juſt in the ſame ſenſe, in which it was juſt, that Cain or Joab ſhould be executed as murderers: i. e. it is correſpondent to their perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and characters. If thoſe with whom I am now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, allow that the endleſs puniſhment of the wicked is juſt in this ſenſe, they allow all for which I at preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. If they deny, that it is juſt in this ſenſe, they give up their favorite principle, and diſpute againſt the juſtice of endleſs puniſhment, not merely becauſe it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the general good, but for the ſame reaſons as thoſe for which Dr. C. diſputed againſt it: and they place the queſtion on the ſame footing, on which it has been ſo largely conſidered in the preceding chapters. The execution of Cain as a murderer would have been correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent to his perſonal conduct, and therefore would have been juſt. If the endleſs puniſhment of the wicked be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to be juſt in this ſenſe, it is denied to be juſt, not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it would not be ſubſervient to the good of the univerſe; but becauſe it would not be a puniſhment correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent to their perſonal conduct; inſtead of this, it would exceed the demerit of that conduct, and therefore would rob them of their perſonal rights.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> In which it is inquired, whether endleſs puniſhment be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the divine goodneſs.</head>
               <p>THAT this inquiry is very important, every one muſt be ſenſible, who is in the leaſt acquainted with this controverſy. No topic is ſo much inſiſted on by the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for univerſal ſalvation; on no ſubject do they throw out ſuch abundant and fervent declamation; no argument
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:022478_0138_0FB932B33B5C4DE8"/>
is urged with ſuch an air of triumph. This is their ſtrong hold, in which they feel themſelves perfectly ſecure, and from which they imagine ſuch effectual ſallies may be made, as will drive out of the field all believers in endleſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore this part of our ſubject requires parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and cloſe attention.</p>
               <p>I PROPOSE to begin with ſtating the queſtion,—then to proceed to ſome general obſervations concerning the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs and ſome conceſſions made by Dr. C.— then to conſider Dr. C's arguments from the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;—and in the laſt place, to mention ſome conſiderations to ſhow, that the endleſs puniſhment of ſome of mankind, is not inconſiſtent with the divine goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">I. IT is a matter of great importance, that the queſtion now to be conſidered be clearly ſtated. The queſtion is, Whether it be conſiſtent with the divine goodneſs, that any of mankind be doomed to endleſs puniſhment conſiſting in miſery. This queſtion is not now to be conſidered with any reference to the atonement of Chriſt; or the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in favour of univerſal ſalvation, drawn from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs, does not depend at all on the atonement. To argue that goodneſs requires the ſalvation of all men now ſince Chriſt has made a ſufficient atonement, implies that without the atonement no ſuch argument could be urged. To argue from the atonement is not to argue from goodneſs merely, but from fact, from the goſpel, from particular texts or from the general nature of the goſpel. The argument is this; Chriſt hath made atonement for all, therefore all will be ſaved. But that this argument may carry conviction, it muſt firſt be made evident that the atonement did reſpect all mankind; alſo that it is the intention of God, to apply the virtue of that ſufficient atonement, to the actual ſalvation of all. But theſe things can be proved from the declarations of ſcripture only. Now all Dr. C's arguments from ſcripture ſhall be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their place; but this is not their place.</p>
               <p>THE queſtion, Whether it be conſiſtent with divine goodneſs, that any of mankind be puniſhed without end, means, either, Whether it be conſiſtent with the greateſt poſſible exertion or diſplay of goodneſs in the Deity; or Whether it be conſiſtent with goodneſs in general, ſo that God is in general a good Being, and not <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>malicious,</hi> though he do inflict endleſs puniſhment on ſome men.—
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:022478_0139_0FB932B5F4F8C698"/>
It is not an article of my faith, that in all the works of creation and providence taken together, God diſplays in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed goodneſs in general, but not the greateſt poſſible goodneſs. This diſtinction is made, to accommodate the diſcourſe, if poſſible, to the meaning of Dr. C. As he denies that God has adopted the beſt poſſible plan of the univerſe, it ſeems, that he muſt have diſtinguiſhed in his own mind, between the goodneſs actually exerted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played by the Deity in the preſent ſyſtem, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poſſible diſplay of goodneſs.</p>
               <p>IF the former of theſe be intended by Dr. C. and others, all their ſtrong and frightful declamations on this ſubject, come to this only, that endleſs puniſhment is not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poſſible diſplay of the divine goodneſs; or that the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of the univerſe, if endleſs puniſhment make a part of it, is not the wiſeſt and beſt poſſible. — But this is no more than is holden by Dr. C. and it is preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by other advocates in general for univerſal ſalvation. Dr. C. abundantly holds, as we ſhall ſee preſently, that the preſent ſyſtem of the univerſe, according to his own view of it, without endleſs puniſhment, is not the wiſeſt and beſt poſſible. It is therefore perfect abſurdity in him, to object, on this ground, to endleſs puniſhment.</p>
               <p>BUT it is manifeſt, by the vehement and pathetic excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Dr. C. on this ſubject, that he aimed at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than this. It is manifeſt that he ſuppoſed and meant to repreſent, that if the doctrine of endleſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be true, God is not a good, a benevolent being, but a cruel, malicious one. He ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 8.</note> that the doctrine of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhment
<q>gives occaſion for very unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the Deity:</q>
That in view of that doctrine
<q>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">P, 14.</note> an horror of darkneſs remains, that is ſadly diſtreſſing to many a conſiderate heart.</q>
He quotes<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 356</note> with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation thoſe words from Mr. Whiſton:
<q>If the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doctrine were certainly true, the <hi>juſtice</hi> of God muſt inevitably be given up, and much more his <hi>mercy.</hi>— This doctrine ſuppoſes him,</q>
[God]
<q>to delight in <hi>cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
                  </q>
So that the queſtion agitated by Dr. C. is really, Whether, if God inflict endleſs puniſhment on any ſinner, it be not an act of <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>injuſtice,</hi> as all cruelty is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.—But this is the very queſtion, which has been ſo largely conſidered in ſeveral preceding chapters, and needs not to be reconſidered here. So that Dr. C's argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:022478_0140_0FB932B70D4308E8"/>
from goodneſs are mere arguments from juſtice; and if endleſs puniſhment be reconcileable with divine juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, it is equally reconcileable with divine goodneſs, in the ſenſe in which he argue from divine goodneſs.</p>
               <p>If after all it be inſiſted on, that Dr. C. meant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the queſtion, or that the queſtion ought to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in the firſt ſenſe ſtated above, viz. Whether endleſs puniſhment be conſiſtent with the moſt perfect diſplay of goodneſs; although if the negative of this queſtion were granted, Dr. C. could not conſiſtently thence draw an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in favor of univerſal ſalvation; yet it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to conſider this ſtate of the queſtion, and perhaps ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient obſervations upon it will occur in the ſequel of this chapter.</p>
               <p n="2">II. I AM to make ſome general obſervations concerning the divine goodneſs, and take notice of ſome conceſſions made by Dr. C.</p>
               <p>The goodneſs of God is that glorious attribute, by which he is diſpoſed to communicate happineſs to his creatures. This divine attribute is diſtinguiſhed from the divine juſtice in this manner: the divine juſtice promotes the happineſs of the univerſal ſyſtem, implying the divine glory, by treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perſon ſtrictly according to his own character: the divine goodneſs promotes the ſame important object, by treating a perſon more favorably than is according to his own character or conduct: So that both juſtice and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may and always do, as far as they are exerciſed, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the happineſs of the univerſal ſyſtem, including the glory of the Deity, or the glory of the Deity, including the happineſs of the univerſal ſyſtem. As the glory of God, and the greateſt happineſs of the ſyſtem of the univerſe, and even of the created ſyſtem, mutually imply each other; whenever I mention either of them, I wiſh to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to include in my meaning the other alſo. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative or the exhibited glory of God, is a moſt perfect and moſt happy created ſyſtem; and a moſt perfect and moſt happy created ſyſtem is the exhibited glory of God; or it is the exhibition, the manifeſtation of that glory; as a picture is an exhibition of the man.</p>
               <p>THAT infinite goodneſs is in God, and is eſſential to his nature, is granted on all hands: <hi>God is</hi> LOVE. This at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſeeks the happineſs of creatures, the happineſs of the created ſyſtem in general, and of every individual
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:022478_0141_0FB932B871F039B8"/>
creature in particular, ſo far as the happineſs of that indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual is not inconſiſtent with the happineſs of the ſyſtem, or with happineſs <hi>on the whole.</hi> But if in any caſe, the happineſs of an individual be inconſiſtent with the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſyſtem, or with the happineſs of other indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, ſo that by beſtowing happineſs on the firſt ſuppoſed individual, the quantity of happineſs on the whole ſhall be diminiſhed; in this caſe, goodneſs, the divine goodneſs, which is perfect and infinite, will not conſent to beſtow happineſs on that individual. Indeed to beſtow happineſs in ſuch a caſe would be no inſtance of goodneſs, but of the want of goodneſs. It would argue a diſpoſition not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe happineſs, but to diminiſh and deſtroy it.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE that Dr. C. might prove, that the endleſs puniſhment of any ſinner is inconſiſtent with the goodneſs of God, he ſhould have ſhown, that the ſum total of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs enjoyed in the intellectual ſyſtem will be greater if all be ſaved, than it will be if any ſuffer an endleſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To ſhow that God by his infinite goodneſs will be excited to ſeek and to ſecure the greateſt happineſs of <hi>the ſyſtem,</hi> determines nothing. This is no more than is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the believers in endleſs puniſhment. It is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent therefore to ſpend time on this. But the great queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, Does the greateſt happineſs of the ſyſtem require the final happineſs of every ſinner? If Dr. C, have not ſhown that it does, his argument from divine goodneſs is entirely inconcluſive.</p>
               <p>INSTEAD of ſhowing, that the divine goodneſs or the greateſt happineſs of the general ſyſtem, requires the final happineſs of every individual; Dr. C. has abundantly ſhown the contrary. In his book on the <hi>Benevolence of the Deity,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 56, &amp;c.</note> he expreſſes himſelf thus;
<q>It would be injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Deity to complain of him for want of goodneſs merely becauſe the manifeſtation of it to our particular ſyſtem, conſidered <hi>ſingly</hi> and <hi>apart from the reſt,</hi> is not ſo great as we may imagine it could be.—No more happineſs is required for our ſyſtem, even from <hi>infinitely perfect benevolence,</hi> than is proper for a part of ſome <hi>great whole.</hi>—We ought not to conſider the diſplays of divine benevolence, as they affect individual beings only, but as they relate to the particular <hi>ſyſtem</hi> of which they are parts.—The divine benevolence is to be eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated from its amount to <hi>this whole,</hi> and not its <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:022478_0142_0FB932B9F03AF838"/>
parts</hi> ſeparately conſidered.—The only fair way of judging of the divine benevolence with reſpect to our world, is to conſider it not as diſplayed to <hi>ſeparate individuals,</hi> but to the <hi>whole ſyſtem,</hi> and to theſe as its conſtituent parts.</q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>BY theſe quotations it appears with ſufficient clearneſs, that it was Dr. C's opinion, that there are defects, miſeries and puniſhments of individual creatures, which are conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the good of the ſyſtem, and are therefore conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the divine goodneſs: and that the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs does not ſeek the happineſs of any individual any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than the happineſs of that individual is ſubſervient to the happineſs of the ſyſtem, or to the increaſe of happineſs on the whole. Therefore Dr. C. ſuppoſes the miſeries of men in this life, and even the puniſhments of the future world, are not inconſiſtent with the divine goodneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſubſervient to the good of the ſyſtem.—
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:022478_0143_0FB932BC3847F968"/>
Now the advocates for endleſs puniſhment believe the ſame concerning the endleſs puniſhment of thoſe who die impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent: and for him to ſuppoſe without proof, that this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is not conſiſtent with the greateſt good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the ſyſtem, is but begging the queſtion.</p>
               <p>WHAT is the abſurdity of ſuppoſing, that the endleſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſome ſinners may be ſubſervient to the good of the ſyſtem? Why may not the general good be promoted, as well by endleſs miſery, as by the miſeries of this life? And why may we not be allowed to account for endleſs miſery in the ſame way, that Dr. C. accounts for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this life, or for the temporary miſery which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to be in hell? It is now ſuppoſed to have been proved, that endleſs puniſhment is juſt. If then the general good may be promoted by the tortures of the ſtone endured for a year, by a man who deſerves them, why may not the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good be promoted by the ſame tortures, continued without end, provided the man deſerves ſuch a continuance of them? If we were to judge <hi>a priori,</hi> we ſhould probably decide againſt miſery in either caſe. But fact ſhows that temporary miſeries are conſiſtent with the goodneſs of God, or with the general good: and why may not endleſs miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be ſo too, provided it be juſt?</p>
               <p>IF it be aſſerted, that the endleſs puniſhment of a ſinner who deſerves ſuch puniſhment, is ſo great an evil, that it cannot be compenſated by any good, which can ariſe from it to the ſyſtem; I wiſh to have a reaſon given for this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion. It is granted that the good accruing to the ſyſtem overbalances the temporary miſeries of ſinners both here and hereafter. And is the endleſs miſery of an individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, though juſtly deſerved, ſo great an evil, that it cannot be overbalanced by any endleſs good, which may thence accrue to the ſyſtem? Endleſs miſery is doubtleſs an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite evil: ſo is the endleſs good thence ariſing, an infinite good.</p>
               <p>NOR does it appear, but that all the good ends, which are anſwered by the temporary puniſhment of the damned, may be continued to be anſwered by their continual and endleſs puniſhment, if it be juſt. God may continue to diſplay his juſtice, his holineſs, his hatred of ſin, his love of righteouſneſs, and of the general good, by oppoſing and puniſhing thoſe who are obſtinately ſet in the practice of ſin, and in the oppoſition of righteouſneſs, and of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:022478_0144_0FB932C3DF376CB0"/>
good. In the ſame way he may eſtabliſh his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, manifeſt the evil of ſin, reſtrain others from it, and by a contraſt of the circumſtances of the ſaved and damned, increaſe the gratitude and happineſs of the former, as well as increaſe their happineſs by the view of the divine holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and regard to the general good, manifeſted in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the obſtinate enemies of holineſs and of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good; and by a view of divine grace in their own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the ſalvation of all who ſhall be ſaved. Theſe are the principal public ends to be anſwered by temporary vindictive puniſhment, on ſuppoſition that future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is temporary; and if any other good end to the univerſe ſhall be anſwered by it, in the opinion of thoſe who believe it, let it be mentioned, that by a thorough enquiry we may ſee whether the ſame good end may not be anſwered by continual and endleſs puniſhment.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER queſtion concerning the divine goodneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be conſidered here, is, whether it <hi>ſecure</hi> and <hi>make certain</hi> the final happineſs of every man; or whether it be ſatisfied with this, that opportunity and means are afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every man to obtain happineſs, if he will ſeize the opportunity and uſe the means.—Concerning this alſo, Dr. C. hath ſufficiently expreſſed his ſentiments; as in * the following paſſages;
<q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Benev. of the Deity, p. 60.</note> We muſt not judge of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of the Deity merely from the <hi>actual good</hi> we ſee <hi>produced,</hi> but ſhould likewiſe take into conſideration the <hi>tendency</hi> of thoſe general laws conformably to which it is produced. Becauſe the <hi>tendency</hi> of thoſe laws may be obſtructed, and leſs good <hi>actually take place,</hi> than they were naturally <hi>fitted</hi> to produce. In which caſe, it is no argument of want of goodneſs in the Deity, that no more good was communicated; though it may be of folly in the creatures.</q>

                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Ib. p. 69.</note> It is impoſſible we ſhould judge fairly of the Creator's bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, from a view only of our world, under its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent actual enjoyments. But if we would form right ſentiments of it, we muſt conſider the <hi>tendency</hi> of the divine ſcheme of operation, and what the ſtate of the world would have been, if the rational and moral beings in it had acted up to the laws of their nature and given them full ſcope for the production of good.</q>

                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">p. Ib. 73.</note> All the good ſuitable for ſuch a ſyſtem as this, is apparently
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:022478_0145_0FB932C6617D68F8"/>
the <hi>tendency</hi> of nature and the divine adminiſtration, and it actually prevails ſo far as this tendency is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by creatures tbemſelves,—for which he [God] is not anſwerable.</q>
The Doctor expreſſes himſelf to the ſame purport in many other paſſages of the ſame book.</p>
               <p>IT is manifeſt, that in theſe paſſages, Dr. C. eſteems it a ſufficient vindication of the divine goodneſs, that God hath eſtabliſhed good laws, hath benevolently conſtituted the nature of things and hath given opportunity to men to ſecure to themſelves the enjoyment of good: and that the divine goodneſs does not imply that every individual crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall actually enjoy complete good or happineſs. If theſe things be true, then no argument from the divine goodneſs can prove, that every individual of mankind will be finally happy: the divine goodneſs though complete and infinite does not ſecure <hi>actual happineſs</hi> to every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual: it ſecures the opportunity and means only of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: or it ſecures ſuch a divine ſcheme as has a <hi>tendency</hi> to the happineſs of all, and would actually prevail to the communication of happineſs to all, if it were not perverted by creatures themſelves, for which perverſion God is not anſwerable.</p>
               <p>NOW that ſuch a divine ſcheme as this is actually adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is undoubted truth, and may be granted by every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for endleſs puniſhment. Therefore on the ſame ground on which Dr. C. vindicates the goodneſs of God, from the objections which ariſe from preſent calamities, and from future temporary puniſhment; may the ſame goodneſs be vindicated from the objections which are raiſed from endleſs puniſhment. In the former caſe it is pleaded, that God is infinitely good, though creatures ſuffer cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities here and deſerved puniſhment hereafter, becauſe he has given them <hi>opportunity</hi> to obtain happineſs, and has adopted a ſcheme of operation which has a <hi>tendency</hi> to good. Juſt ſo God is infinitely good, though ſome men ſuffer deſerved endleſs puniſhment; becauſe he has given mankind opportunity to obtain eternal life and ſalvation, and has adopted a ſcheme of providence and of grace, which will actually prevail to the final ſalvation of all, if it be not neglected or perverted by men themſelves; for which neglect or perverſion God is not anſwerable.</p>
               <p>IT is alſo conceded by Dr. C.<note n="*" place="bottom">12 Serm. p. 40.</note> that
<q>none of the ſons of Adam, by the mere exerciſe of their natural powers,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:022478_0146_0FB932C7AB3D03F8"/>
ever yet attained to a perfect knowledge of this rule</q>
[the rule of man's duty, and of God's conduct in rewarding and puniſhing.]
<q>Moſt certainly they are unable, after all their reaſonings, to ſay, what puniſhment as to <hi>kind,</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,</hi> or <hi>duration,</hi> would be their due, in caſe of ſin.</q>
This is plainly to give up all arguments againſt endleſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, drawn from the goodneſs of God, or from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divine perfection. For if
<q>moſt certainly after all our reaſonings</q>
from the divine perfections as well as from other topics of reaſon, we be
<q>unable to ſay what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, as to <hi>kind,</hi> or <hi>degree,</hi> or <hi>duration,</hi> is due in caſe of ſin;</q>
then "<hi>moſt certainly</hi> we are unable to ſay," but that an endleſs puniſhment, and that conſiſting in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry too, is due, and is neceſſary to ſecure and promote the good of the ſyſtem. Therefore to have been conſiſtent, Dr. C. ought never to have pretended, that endleſs miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not reconcileable with divine goodneſs.</p>
               <p>DR. C. further grants, that it may be neceſſary, that the penalty of the divine law be inflicted, and that the inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it may be honorable to God, and uſeful to creatures: yea, he grants, that the full penalty of the law will actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be inflicted on ſome men.
<q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">5 Diſſer. p. 231.</note> Perhaps the reaſons of government might make it fit and proper, and therefore morally neceſſary, that the threatening which God has denounced, ſhould be executed. Would the wiſdom of the ſupreme legiſlator have guarded his prohibition with a penalty it was not <hi>reaſonable</hi> and juſt he ſhould inflict? And might not the infliction of it, when incurred, be of ſervice, ſignal ſervice, to the honor of the divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to ſecure the obedience of the creature in all after times?</q>
—If it be
<q>fit and proper, and morally neceſſary;</q>
if it be
<q>of ſignal ſervice to the honor of the divine authority, and to ſecure the obedience of creatures,</q>
to inflict the penalty of the divine law; doubtleſs the infliction of it is not only conſiſtent with the general good, but ſubſervient to it, and therefore perfectly conſiſtent with the divine goodneſs. It is not "reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble," that God ſhould inflict the penalty of his law, unleſs the infliction be conſiſtent with the general good, and ſo with the divine goodneſs. Therefore the queſtion propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the laſt quotation may with equal truth and force be propoſed a little differently, thus, Would the wiſdom of
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:022478_0147_0FB932C90FF1A270"/>
the ſupreme legiſlator have guarded his prohibition with a penalty, which it was not conſiſtent with the general good of the univerſe, or with the goodneſs of his own nature, that he ſhould in any one inſtance inflict?—Thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be fully granted, that divine goodneſs does not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the infliction of the penalty of the divine law, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it.—Nay, as hath been hinted above, Dr. C. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly aſſerts, that the penalty of the law will be inflicted on ſome men; that on thoſe who paſs through the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell, the divine law will take its courſe, and the threatened penalty will be fully executed.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 336.</note>—Now what the penalty of the divine law is, we have before endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhow. Therefore if our reaſoning on that head be juſt, it follows from that reaſoning and from Dr. C's conceſſions in the preceding quotations taken together, that endleſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is not only reconcileable with divine goodneſs, but is abſolutely required by it. Would divine goodneſs both denounce and actually inflict a penalty, which that goodneſs did not require, and which was not even reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with it?</p>
               <p>DR. C. informs us,<note n="†" place="bottom">5 Diſſ. p. 247.</note> that
<q>Chriſt was ſent into the world, and the great deſign he was ſent upon was to <hi>make way</hi> for the WISE, <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> excrciſe of mercy— towards the ſinful ſons of men.</q>
It ſeems then, that if it had not been for the mediation of Chriſt, there would have been <hi>no way</hi> for the exerciſe of mercy towards men, in a conſiſtency not with juſtice and holineſs only, but with wiſdom? and if not with wiſdom, not with the general good: for wiſdom always dictates that which is for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good. And if it would not have been conſiſtent with the general good, to exerciſe mercy towards ſinners, without the mediation of Chriſt, neither would it have been conſiſtent with the divine goodneſs, for that and that only which is ſubſervient to the general good, is an object to the divine goodneſs. In this ſentiment Dr. C. was very full, as we have already ſeen.—Therefore without the mediation of Chriſt, divine goodneſs required, that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind be left in a ſtate of deſpair under the curſe of the law. And if it have been ſhewn, that this curſe is endleſs miſery, it follows, that divine goodneſs, required that all mankind, if it had not been for the mediation of Chriſt, ſhould ſuffer endleſs miſery.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="143" facs="unknown:022478_0148_0FB932CB356D0C38"/>III. As was propoſed, we now proceed to conſider Dr. C's arguments from the goodneſs of God, to prove the ſalvation of all men.—If ſome of the following quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be found to be rather poſitive aſſertions than argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; I hope the fault will not be imputed to me, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I quote thoſe paſſages which contain as ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from this topic, as any in his book.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 14.</note> IT is high time, that ſome generally received doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines ſhould be renounced, and others embraced in their room that are more honourable to the Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and comfortable to the creatures whom his hands have formed. I doubt not it has been a perplexing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to moſt perſons (I am ſure it has been ſuch to me) how to reconcile the doctrine which dooms ſo great a number of the human race to eternal flames, with the eſſential, abſolutely perfect goodneſs of the Deity.— And perhaps they contain ideas utterly irreconcileable with each other. To be ſure, their conſiſtency has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet been ſo clearly pointed out, but that a horrour of darkneſs ſtill remains that is ſadly diſtreſſing to many a conſiderate tender heart.</q>
—In this paſſage it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that the doctrine of endleſs miſery is not honourable to the Father of Mercies. But what is the proof of this? If there be any, it conſiſts in theſe ſeveral particulars— That this doctrine is uncomfortable to the creatures of God—That it has been a perplexing difficulty to ſome, Dr. C. thinks to moſt, and "is <hi>ſure</hi> it has been ſuch to HIM," to reconcile that doctrine with the goodneſs of God—That <hi>perhaps</hi> they are irreconcileable—That to be ſure (in Dr. C's opinion) they never have been ſo reconciled, but that a horrour of darkneſs remains.</p>
               <p>IF theſe be arguments, they require an anſwer.—The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that the doctrine of endleſs miſery is uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or rather not ſo comfortable to God's creatures, as ſome other doctrines: therefore it is not honourable to the Father of Mercies.—But would Dr. C. dare to ſay, that every doctrine is diſhonourable to God, which is not equally comfortable to ſinful creatures, as ſome other doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines? and that no doctrine is conſiſtent with the divine goodneſs, but thoſe which are in the higheſt degree com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to ſuch creatures? What then will follow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his doctrine of "torment for ages of ages?"—
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:022478_0149_0FB932CD976E2B40"/>
Or would any man chooſe that the compariſon be dropped and that the argument be expreſſed thus:—The doctrine of endleſs miſery is uncomfortable to creatures, therefore it is diſhonourable to God? This ſtill confutes the doctrine of torment for ages of ages. Beſide, if the meaning be, that it is uncomfortable to all creatures, it is a miſtake.— To thoſe who believe it to be a juſt and glorious expreſſion of the divine hatred of ſin, and a neceſſary mean of vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating the juſtice of God, of ſupporting the dignity of his government and of promoting the general good; it is ſo far from being uncomfortable, that it is neceſſary to their comfort; and they rejoice in it for the ſame reaſons, that they rejoice in the advancement of the general good. They rejoice in it on the ſame principles of benevolence and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that Dr. C. rejoiced in the proſpect, that the divine law would have its courſe, and the full threatened penalty be executed on ſome of mankind.</p>
               <p>THE next particular of the above quotation is, that the doctrine of endleſs miſery has been perplexing to ſome, or to moſt men, and to be ſure to Dr. C.—Doubtleſs this is true of many other doctrines, which however have been believed both by Dr. C. and by other Chriſtians: ſuch as the perfect rectitude, goodneſs and impartiality of all the diſpenſations of divine providence: the conſiſtence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the exiſtence of ſin in the world and the infinite wiſdom, power, holineſs and goodneſs of God: the final ſubſerviency of all events to the divine glory and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good of the ſyſtem, &amp;c. Therefore, if the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prove any thing, it proves too much.</p>
               <p>THE third particular is, Perhaps endleſs miſery is not reconcileable with the goodneſs of the Deity.—Anſwer, Perhaps it is reconcileable with that divine attribute.</p>
               <p>THE laſt particular is, To be ſure (in Dr. C's opinion) they never have been ſo reconciled, but that a horrour of darkneſs remains with reſpect to the ſubject.—Anſwer, In the opinion of many other men, they have often been ſo reconciled, that there was no reaſon, why a horrour of darkneſs in view of the ſubject ſhould remain in the mind of any man. They experience no more horrour of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the idea, that God inflicts that endleſs puniſhment which is perfectly juſt, is abſolutely neceſſary to ſatisfy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice, and vindicate the deſpiſed authority, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and grace of God, and is ſubſervient to the glory of
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:022478_0150_0FB932CEF47B0B18"/>
God and the general good; than in the idea of moſt other doctrines of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>BUT let us proceed to another paſſage of Dr. C.—
<q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 321.</note>Multitudes are taken off before they have had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to make themſelves hardened abandoned ſinners: and ſo far as we are able to judge, had they been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in life, they might have been formed to a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temper of mind, by a ſuitable mixture of correction, inſtruction, and the like. And can it be ſuppoſed with reſpect to ſuch, that an infinitely benevolent God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other trial, in order to effect their reformation, will conſign them over to endleſs and irreverſible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Would this be to conduct himſelf like a father on earth? Let the heart of a father ſpeak on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Nay, it does not appear, that any ſinners are ſo incorrigible in wickedneſs, as to be beyond recovery by ſtill further methods within the reach of infinite power: And if the infinitely wiſe God can, in any wiſe methods, recover them, even in any other ſtate of trial, may we not argue from his infinite benevolence, that he will?</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE firſt branch of this argument is, that ſome die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they become incorrigible; therefore the fatherly good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God will give them another trial.—But did Dr. C. know when ſinners become incorrigible, and when not? Does any man know how long a perſon muſt live in ſin, to arrive at that ſtate? If not, what right has any man to ſay, that any ſinners die, before God as perfectly knows them to be incorrigible, as if they had lived in ſin ever ſo long?—Beſide, were ſinners to live in ſin ever ſo long, ſtill this objection might be made; and Dr. C. has in fact made it, not only with regard to thoſe who die premature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with regard to all ſinners. He ſays, "It does not appear, that <hi>any</hi> ſinners are ſo incorrigible, as to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond recovery by ſtill further methods." That is, if it do not appear, that ſinners are in this world beyond recovery by ſtill further methods to be uſed for their recovery, we are to believe from God's infinite benevolence, that thoſe further methods will be uſed for their recovery. But ſhould a ſinner go through the torments of hell, and of ten other ſucceeding ſtates of trial, it is to be preſumed, that Dr. C. would not ſay, but that poſſibly he might be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by ſome further methods within the power of God
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:022478_0151_0FB932D175CF6400"/>
to uſe, if indeed God ſhould Yee cauſe to uſe thoſe further methods. The ground of this argument is, that goodneſs requires, that God uſe means for the recovery of ſinners, as long as it is in the power of God to uſe any further means to that end. But this as much needs to be proved as any one propoſition advanced by Dr. C.</p>
               <p>THE next branch of this argument is, that it would not be acting like a father on earth, if God were to conſign ſinners to endleſs torment.—And is it acting like a father on earth, to doom men to the ſecond death, the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, and there torment them for ages of ages? Let the heart of a father on earth ſpeak and declare whether it would be agreeable to him, to inflict on his children theſe extreme and long continued tortures? or even many of the temporal calamities which God inflicts on mankind; ſuch as poverty, ſhame, a feeble ſickly habit, extreme pain and diſtreſs, loſs of reaſon, and death attended with the moſt afflicting circumſtances? Would a father on earth chooſe to plunge his children in the ocean, and leave them to the mercy of the waves? Would he ſet his houſe on fire, while they were buried in ſoft ſlumbers, and conſume them in the flames?—Such declamatory applications to the paſſions are a two-edged ſword which will wound Dr. C's ſcheme, as certainly as that of his opponents. But this controverſy is not to be ſettled by an application to the paſſions.</p>
               <p>THE laſt part of the above quotation deſtroys the whole. It is this; It does not appear that any ſinners are ſo incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible, as to be beyond recovery by ſtill further methods within the reach of infinite wiſdom. If God have revealed that no ſinners ſhall be recovered after this life, it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a wiſe conſtitution that this life is the only ſtate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. Therefore it is not within the reach of infinite wiſdom, to uſe any further means after this life for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of thoſe who are incorrigible here. So that this whole paragraph is a mere begging of the queſtion: it takes for granted, that this life is not the only ſtate of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, or that the endleſs puniſhment of all who die im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent is not a doctrine of divine revelation.</p>
               <p>DR. C. elſewhere<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 326, 327.</note> argues univerſal ſalvation from this, that God ſpeaks of himſelf,
<q>as the univerſal Father of Men;</q>
and ſays,
<q>fathers on earth chaſtiſe their
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:022478_0152_0FB932D3CED81838"/>
children for their <hi>profit,</hi> but do not puniſh them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no view to their <hi>advantage.</hi>
                  </q>
—But does a father on earth never puniſh an incorrigible child, when it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the good of the reſt of the family? If he did not, but ſuffered him to ruin his whole family, or even one of his other children; would be act the part, or deſerve the name, of a father?
<q>And ſhall we ſay that of our Father in Heaven (who inſtead of being evil, as all earthly fathers are more or leſs, is infinitely good) which we cannot ſuppoſe of any father on earth, till we have firſt diveſted him of the heart of a father?</q>
—The truth is, this and all arguments of the kind take for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what is by no means granted, that the ſalvation of all men, is ſubſervient to the good, not of the perſons ſaved only, but of the univerſal ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>IN various paſſages <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 352, &amp;c.</note> Dr. C. has much to ſay of our <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral notions of God's goodneſs</hi>; particularly, that the natural notions we entertain of the
<q>goodneſs and mercy of God, riſe up in oppoſition to the doctrine of never ending tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</q>
I grant that our natural notions of thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine attributes riſe up in oppoſition to endleſs torments, on the ſuppoſition that they are unjuſt and inconſiſtent with the general good. But on the ſuppoſition that they are both juſt and ſubſervient to the general good, our natural no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions riſe up in favour of them. So that this and ſuch like arguments all depend on taking for granted what is no more granted than the main queſtion.</p>
               <p>NEARLY allied to the argument from the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is that by which Dr. C. attempts to prove univerſal ſalvation from the end of God in creation.
<q>
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 1.</note>As the firſt cauſe of all things is infinitely benevolent, 'tis not eaſy to conceive that he ſhould bring mankind into exiſtence unleſs he intended to make them finally happy.</q>
                  <q>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">P 2, 3.</note> If the only good God knew—that ſome free agents would make themſelves unhappy, notwithſtanding the utmoſt efforts of his wiſdom to prevent it, why did he create them? To give them exiſtence knowing at the ſame time that they would render themſelves finally miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able—is ſcarce reconcileable with ſupremely and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely perfect benevolence.</q>
—This argument, as the preceding, entirely depends on the ſuppoſition that the final happineſs of every individual is neceſſary to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt happineſs of the ſyſtem. Doubtleſs God is abſolutely
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:022478_0153_0FB932D5067820C0"/>
and perfectly benevolent: but ſuch benevolence ſeeks the greateſt happineſs of the ſyſtem, not of any individual, unleſs the happineſs of that individual be conſiſtent with the greateſt happineſs of the ſyſtem. This is the plain dictate not of reaſon only, but of ſcripture, and is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly conceded by Dr. C. as appears by the quotations already made. There is no difficulty therefore in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that however the firſt cauſe of all things is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely benevolent, he ſhould bring mankind into exiſtence, though he never intended to make them all finally happy. He might in perfect conſiſtence with infinite benevolence, bring them into exiſtence, intending that ſome of them ſhould ſuffer that endleſs puniſhment which they ſhould deſerve, and thereby contribute to the greateſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the ſyſtem. And if ſuch a puniſhment be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the greateſt happineſs of the ſyſtem, infinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence not only admits of it, but requires it; nor would God be infinitely benevolent, if he ſhould ſave all men. Therefore this grand argument, on which Dr. C. and other writers in favour of univerſal ſalvation, build ſo much, is a mere begging of the queſtion. Let them ſhow that the greateſt good of the ſyſtem requires the final hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of every individual, and they will indeed have gone far toward the eſtabliſhment of their ſcheme. But until they ſhall have done this, their argument from this topic is utterly inconcluſive. It is no more inconſiſtent with the goodneſs of God, that he ſhould create men with a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and an intention, that they ſhould ſuffer that endleſs puniſhment which they ſhould deſerve, and which is ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the general good; than that he ſhould create them with a foreſight and intention, that they ſhould ſubſerve the ſame important end, by ſuffering the torment of ages of ages, or the pains of the ſtone or the colic; provided theſe temporary pains are not ſubſervient to their perſonal good. And to ſay that temporary pains cannot conſiſtently with the divine goodneſs be inflicted on the ſinner, unleſs they be ſubſervient to the perſonal good of the patient, is to contradict the plain dictates of reaſon, of ſcripture, and of Dr. C. himſelf. But this ſubject has been largely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in Chap. III.</p>
               <p>THESE, I think, are Dr. C's principal arguments from the divine goodneſs, to prove univerſal ſalvation: I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that in his whole book there are none more forcible
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:022478_0154_0FB932D7629856A8"/>
than theſe. His arguments of this kind generally, if not univerſally, depend on taking for granted, what is as much in diſpute as any point in the whole controverſy, that end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhment is not conſiſtent with the greateſt good of the univerſal ſyſtem, or the greateſt general good. If it be true, that any man will be puniſhed without end, no doubt it is ſo ordered, becauſe infinite wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſaw it to be neceſſary to the general good. If it be not true, it is equally certain, that infinite wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſaw endleſs puniſhment to be inconſiſtent with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good. But which of theſe is the truth, is the main queſtion.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. THAT endleſs puniſhment is conſiſtent with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs, not only is implied in various ſentiments and tenets of Dr. C, but appears to be a real and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable truth. To evince this, I ſhall now, as was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, mention ſeveral conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. ALL arguments againſt endleſs puniſhment, drawn from the divine mercy, grace or goodneſs, imply a conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that endleſs puniſhment is <hi>juſt.</hi> Were it not juſt, there would be no occaſion to call in the aid of <hi>goodneſs.</hi> Stern, unrelenting juſtice would afford relief. Nor is there the leaſt goodneſs, as diſtinguiſhed from juſtice, exerciſed by a judge, in delivering a man from an unjuſt puniſhment, attempted to be brought upon him by a falſe accuſer. If therefore the ſalvation of ſinners, and of every ſinner, be an act of goodneſs, mercy or grace, as Dr. C. abundantly declares; then endleſs puniſhment is juſt. And if it be juſt, it appears by Chap. III, that it will be inflicted, and inflicted by God too. Therefore it is conſiſtent with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs.</p>
               <p>It is hoped it has been made manifeſt in Chap. II and III, that the end of future puniſhment is not the perſonal good of the patients, but to ſatisfy juſtice, and ſupport the authority and dignity of the divine law and government; as both Dr. C. and the ſcriptures abundantly hold, that the wicked will be puniſhed to the utmoſt extent of their demerit. Now if the end of future puniſhment, whether temporary or endleſs, be to ſatisfy juſtice, and to ſupport government; then the general good is promoted by the ſatisfaction of juſtice: otherwiſe God would not inflict ſuch puniſhment. And if the proof in Chap. VI, that endleſs puniſhment is juſt, be valid, then juſtice is not ſatisfied
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:022478_0155_0FB932DA9D20BDC8"/>
by any puniſhment ſhort of endleſs. But by Chap. II and III it appears, that all that puniſhment, which the wicked deſerve, will actually be inflicted upon them by God. Therefore endleſs puniſhment is perfectly conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with divine goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the divine law may be in any one inſtance execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted conſiſtently with divine goodneſs, endleſs puniſhment is conſiſtent with the divine goodneſs. But the divine law may, in ſome inſtances, be executed conſiſtent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with divine goodneſs.—I have before endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſhow, that the penalty of the law is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhment. If this be true, then when the law is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, endleſs puniſhment is inflicted. And who will dare to ſay, that God has made a law, which he cannot in any one inſtance execute conſiſtently with his own perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And that if he ſhould execute it in any inſtance, his goodneſs and mercy muſt be inevitably given up? Nay, he delights in <hi>cruelty</hi>? If the law cannot be executed without cruelty, it is a cruel unjuſt law: and to make a cruel and unjuſt law, is as irreconcileable with the moral rectitude of God, as to execute that law. If the infliction of endleſs puniſhment be cruel, the threatening of it alſo is cruel. But this runs into the former queſtion, whether endleſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment be <hi>juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF it be ſaid, though the law is juſt, and the execution of it would not be cruel; yet it cannot be executed conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently with the divine goodneſs, becauſe the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeeks the greateſt poſſible good of the ſyſtem: But the greateſt poſſible good of the ſyſtem requires the final hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of all:—As to this I obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) THAT it is giving up the argument from divine goodneſs in the light, in which Dr. C. has ſtated it. It appears by the quotations already made, that he held end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhment to be ſo inconſiſtent with divine goodneſs, that if that puniſhment be inflicted, it will prove God to be deſtitute of goodneſs, and to <hi>delight in cruelty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2) THAT the queſtion as now ſtated comes to no more than this, Whether endleſs puniſhment be conſiſtent with the greateſt poſſible diſplay of divine goodneſs: For a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, in which there is the greateſt poſſible good, and the greateſt poſſible diſplay of the divine goodneſs, are one and the ſame thing. But if it were granted, that endleſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is, in this ſenſe, inconſiſtent with the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:022478_0156_0FB932DBDE4918F8"/>
it would by no means follow, on Dr. C's principles, that all men will be ſaved. Becauſe it is an eſtabliſhed principle with him, that divine goodneſs is not and cannot be diſplayed, to the higheſt poſſible degree, or ſo but that there is room for higher diſplays and further communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it.
<q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Benev. of the Deity, p. 40.</note> Neither is it to be ſuppoſed, becauſe God is infinitely benevolent, that he has in fact made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite manifeſtation of his goodneſs.—Infinity in bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence knows no bounds, but there is ſtill room for more and higher diſplays of it.—This perfection is ſtrictly ſpeaking, inexhauſtible, not capable of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played to a <hi>ne plus.</hi>
                  </q>
Therefore, it would be abſurd for Dr. C. or any one, who agrees with him in the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment expreſſed in the laſt quotation, to ſtate the argument from divine goodneſs, in the light in which it is exhibited in the objection now under conſideration. This ſtating of the argument runs entirely into the queſtion, whether the preſent ſyſtem of the univerſe be the beſt poſſible; which Dr. C. has ſufficiently anſwered in the negative, in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage laſt quoted, and in many other paſſages of his writings. If it be true, that divine goodneſs does not adopt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the beſt poſſible plan of the univerſe in general: what reaſon have we to think, that it will adopt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the beſt poſſible plan with regard to any part of the divine ſyſtem; for inſtance the future ſtate of thoſe who die in impenitence?</p>
               <p n="3">(3) ON the ſuppoſition, that God does adopt and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the beſt poſſible plan, both with regard to the univerſe in general, and in every particular diſpenſation of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; ſtill we ſhall never be able to determine <hi>a priori,</hi> that the final ſalvation of all men is, in the ſenſe now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, moſt ſubſervient to the general good. It muſt be determined either by the event itſelf, or by revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and whether revelation do aſſure us of the ſalvation of all men, is not the ſubject of inquiry in this chapter, but ſhall be particularly conſidered in its place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IF divine goodneſs without reſpect to the atonement of Chriſt, which is foreign from the ſubject of this chapter, require the ſalvation of all men; it either requires that they be ſaved, whether they repent or not; or it requires, that they be ſaved on the condition of their repentance only. If it require that they be ſaved, whether they repent or
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:022478_0157_0FB932DD55EBBD78"/>
not, it follows, that they have done no damage to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, or have committed no ſin. For the very idea of ſin is a damage to the univerſe, a diſhonor to God, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the creature. Now whenever a damage is done to the univerſe, the good of the univerſe, or which in the preſent argument comes to the ſame thing, the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs requires reparation. But if the good of the univerſe require, that the ſinner be ſaved without even repentance, the good of the univerſe requires no reparation, and if it require no reparation, it has not been impaired, or there has been no damage done to the good of the univerſe: and if no damage have been done to the univerſe, no ſin has been committed. No wonder then, that the divine goodneſs requires the ſalvation of thoſe who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no ſin or no moral evil.</p>
               <p>IF on the other hand it be allowed, that by ſin damage is done to the univerſe, and yet it be holden, that divine goodneſs requires the ſalvation of all men, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their repentance only; it will follow, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance alone makes it conſiſtent with the general good, that the ſinner be ſaved. Repentance then repairs the damage done to the univerſe by ſin; and ſo makes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction or atonement for ſin.—The very eſſence of atonement is ſomething done to repair the damage done by ſin to the univerſe, ſo that the ſinner can be exempted from puniſhment, without any diſadvantage to the univerſe. And as repentance is a perſonal act of the ſinner, he does on this ſuppoſition make atonement for his own ſin by his perſonal virtue. Therefore, if after this he be ſaved from wrath, he is but treated according to his perſonal character, or according to ſtrict juſtice; not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to goodneſs or grace. So that while Dr. C. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes and ſuppoſes himſelf to be arguing from the divine goodneſs, the ſalvation of all men from the wrath to come; his arguments are really drawn from <hi>the juſtice of God only.</hi> They imply either that the ſinner who is by divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be ſaved from the wrath to come, is no ſinner, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no puniſhment, and therefore is incapable of being ſaved from wrath, as he is expoſed to none; or that though he be a ſinner, he has in his own perſon, made full ſatisfaction for his ſin, and therefore merits ſalvation from wrath, and is incapable of it by an act of grace or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="153" facs="unknown:022478_0158_0FB932DEC512CC30"/>4. TO argue the ſalvation of all men from the goodneſs of God, without regard to the atonement of Chriſt; and yet to allow that endleſs puniſhment is juſt, is a direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.—If it be allowed or proved, that endleſs puniſhment is juſt, it follows of courſe that it is conſiſtent with the general good, and which is the ſame thing, with the divine goodneſs, and is even required by divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, on the ſuppoſition on which we now proceed, that no atonement is made for ſin. The very idea of a juſt puniſhment of any crime is a puniſhment which in view of the crime only, is requiſite to repair the damage done to the ſyſtem by that crime. Any further puniſhment than this is unjuſt, and any puniſhment ſhort of this, falls ſhort of the demand of juſtice. At the ſame time that this is demanded by juſtice, it is demanded by the general good too: becauſe by the definition of a juſt puniſhment, it is neceſſary to the general good; neceſſary to ſecure it, or to repair the damage done to it, by the crime puniſhed. So that a juſt puniſhment of any crime is not only conſiſtent with the general good, but is abſolutely required by it, provided other meaſures equivalent to this puniſhment be not taken to repair the damage done by ſin, or, which is the ſame, provided an atonement be not made. And if the endleſs puniſhment of ſin be juſt; it is of courſe, on the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo juſt made, perfectly conſiſtent with the general good of the univerſe, and abſolutely required by it, and equally requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the goodneſs of God. And to ſay that though it be juſt, it is not reconcileable with the divine goodneſs, is the ſame as to ſay, that though it be juſt, it is not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable with juſtice.</p>
               <p>OBJECTION: Divine goodneſs does not admit of the endleſs puniſhment of the apoſtle Paul; yet his endleſs puniſhment would be juſt.—Anſwer: Divine goodneſs, or the general good of the univerſe, conſidering the ſins or the perſonal character of Paul by itſelf, does both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and require his endleſs puniſhment. But conſidering the atonement of Chriſt, which, as I have repeatedly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, comes not into conſideration in the preſent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it does not indeed admit of it.</p>
               <p>I BEG leave to aſk the advocates for univerſal ſalvation, whether if Chriſt had not made atonement, it would have been conſiſtent with the general good of the univerſe, that ſinners be puniſhed without end. If they anſwer in the affirmative, then endleſs puniſhment is in itſelf recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:022478_0159_0FB932E032974370"/>
not with juſtice only, but with goodneſs too, as goodneſs always acquieſces in that which is conſiſtent with the general good. For if only in conſequence of the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, endleſs puniſhment be inconſiſtent with the divine goodneſs, it becomes inconſiſtent with it, not on account of any thing in the endleſs puniſhment of ſin, or in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs ſimply; but wholly on account of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing external to them both: and therefore that external ſomething being left out of the account, there is no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency between the endleſs puniſhment of ſin and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs in themſelves conſidered. But that they are in themſelves inconſiſtent is implied in Dr. C's argument from divine goodneſs; and that they are not in themſelves inconſiſtent is all for which I am now pleading.</p>
               <p>IF the anſwer to the queſtion juſt propoſed be, that it would not be conſiſtent with the general good, that a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be puniſhed without end, even if Chriſt had not made atonement; it follows, that ſuch puniſhment is not juſt; as the very definition of a juſt puniſhment is, one which in view of the ſinner's perſonal character only is neceſſary to the general good.—Or if this be not a proper defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a juſt puniſhment, let a better be given. Any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is juſt, or is deſerved, for no other reaſon, than that the criminal viewed in himſelf owes it to the public, or the general good requires it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. IF divine goodneſs require, that every ſinner be, on on his mere repentance, exempted from puniſhment, it will follow, that ſin is no moral evil.—If divine goodneſs require that every ſinner be, on his mere repentance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from puniſhment, the general good of the univerſe requires the ſame. If the general good do require it, then either the ſinner hath in that action of which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, done nothing by which the general good hath been impaired; or that impairment is repaired by his repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. For if he have impaired the general good, and not afterward repaired it, then by the very terms it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires reparation. And this which the general good in theſe caſes requires of the ſinner for the reparation of the general good, is his puniſhment, and not his exemption from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. But if the ſinner have done nothing which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that reparation be made to the general good, then he hath committed nothing which hath impaired the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good: or, which is the ſame, he hath committed no
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:022478_0160_0FB932E1AC282B30"/>
moral evil. For moral evil is a voluntary act impairing the general good conſiſting in the glory of God and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the created ſyſtem.—Or if it be ſaid, that the repentance of the ſinner repairs the general good, and prevents the ill effects of his ſin; I anſwer, repentance is no puniſhment, nor any reparation of damage to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe by a paſt action. It is a mere ceſſation from ſin and a ſorrow for it. A man who has committed murder, makes by repentance no reparation for the damage which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by done to ſociety or to the univerſe. So that if ever any damage were done to the univerſe by ſin, and if therefore the public good required that reparation be made by the puniſhment of the ſinner, it ſtill requires the ſame, and therefore does not require his exemption from puniſhment. Beſide; the falſe and abſurd conſequences<note n="*" place="bottom">See theſe conſidered at large in Chap. II.</note> neceſſarily following from the principle that the penitent deſerves no puniſhment, which is the ſame with this, that the general good does not require that the penitent, viewed in his own character merely, be puniſhed; plainly point out the falſity and abſurdity of the principle itſelf. Particularly this conſequence, that on that ſuppoſition the penitent never is nor can be forgiven, as he makes by his repentance full ſatisfaction in his own perſon, and thus anſwers the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of juſtice or of the general good.—But if it be true, that repentance does not repair the damage done by ſin to the univerſe; and if as is now aſſerted, the general good do require that the penitent ſinner, without regard to the atonement of Chriſt, be exempted from puniſhment; it required the ſame before he repented; conſequently his ſin never did impair the good of the univerſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is no moral evil.</p>
               <p>OBJECTION 1. The fourth argument ſeems to imply, that ſin conſiſts in damage actually done to the univerſe: whereas there are many ſins, in which no real damage is actually done. As if a man ſtab another with a deſign to murder him, and open an abſceſs, whereby the man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited inſtead of murdered; and in all acts of malice, which are not executed, no damage is actually done.</p>
               <p>ANSW. Taking the word damage in a large ſenſe, to mean, not merely loſs of property, as it is ſometimes taken, but miſery, calamity or natural evil; it may be granted, that ſin does conſiſt in voluntarily doing damage to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. It is a miſery, a calamity, or a natural evil to any
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:022478_0161_0FB932E330FE4068"/>
man, to be the object of the malice of any other perſon, though his malice be never executed. It expoſes him to the execution of that malice: it renders him unſafe: and to be unſafe is a calamity; eſpecially to be the object of the malice of another to ſuch a degree, that the malicious man attempts the life of the object of his malice. In this caſe the man who is the object of malice is very unſafe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.—And if but one perſon be in a calamitous ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo far at leaſt the public good is impaired, or the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is damaged. Beſides, if that one act impairing the public good, be left unpuniſhed, and no proper reſtraint by the puniſhment of the act, be laid upon the man himſelf and upon others, the flood-gate is opened to innumerable more acts of the ſame, or a like kind. This ſurely is a further calamity to the univerſe. So that every ſinful vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, though it fail of its object in the attempt, or though it be not attempted to be executed in overt act, is a real calamity or damage to the univerſe.</p>
               <p>OBJECT. 2. The preceding reaſoning muſt needs be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious, as it implies, that goodneſs or grace is never exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in any caſe, wherein puniſhment is deſerved; that whatever is admitted by juſtice, is required by goodneſs; and that if ſin be a moral evil and deſerve puniſhment, it cannot conſiſtently with the general good be forgiven.</p>
               <p>ANSW. This is not true. The reaſoning above does not imply, but that there may be, conſiſtently with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good, the forgiveneſs of ſome ſinners. Nor does it imply, but that the general good may <hi>require</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſome ſinners; as undoubtedly it does require the forgiveneſs of all who repent and believe in Chriſt, and ſo become intereſted in him according to the Goſpel. Nor does <hi>this reaſoning</hi> imply, but that ſome ſinners may obtain forgiveneſs on ſome other account than the merits of Chriſt: though I believe it may be clearly ſhown from ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that forgiveneſs can be obtained on no other account. But this reaſoning does aſſert, that if all penitents <hi>as ſuch,</hi> or merely becauſe they are penitents, or on account of their own repentance and reformation, be required by divine goodneſs to be exempted from puniſhment; then ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no puniſhment and is no moral evil.</p>
               <p n="6">6. THE voice of reaſon is, that divine goodneſs, or a regard to the general good requires, that ſin be puniſhed according to its demerit, in ſome inſtances at leaſt: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:022478_0162_0FB932E56A765C80"/>
God would not appear to be what he really is, an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to ſin, and greatly diſpleaſed with it.—It is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſtent with divine goodneſs, that ſin exiſts in the world, otherwiſe it would never have exiſted. Now ſince ſin is in the world, if God were never to puniſh it, it would ſeem, that he is no enemy to it. Or if he puniſh it in a far leſs degree than it deſerves, ſtill it would ſeem, that his diſpleaſure at it is far leſs than it is and ought to be. Nor can mere words or verbal declarations of the Deity ſufficiently exhibit his oppoſition to ſin, ſo long as he uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly treats the righteous and the wicked in the ſame manner. His character in view of intelligent creatures will appear to be what it is holden forth to be in his actions, rather than what he in mere words declares it to be. But will any man ſay, that it is conducive to the good order and happineſs of the intellectual ſyſtem, that God ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be no enemy, but rather a friend to ſin?</p>
               <p>OBJECTION. God would ſtill appear to be an enemy to ſin, though he were not to puniſh it: becauſe he takes the moſt effectual meaſures, to extirpate it by leading ſinners to repentance.—Anſw. The extirpation of ſin ſhows no other hatred of it, than a phyſician ſhows to a diſeaſe, which he takes the moſt effectual meaſures to aboliſh, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of health. But theſe meaſures of the phyſician do not ſhow, that he views his patient as blameable. Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is no moral evil, and all the pains of the phyſician to remove ſickneſs, are no teſtimony of his abhorrence of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil. But ſin is a moral evil, and it is ſubſervient to the general good, that the great governor of the univerſe ſhould teſtify his abhorrence of it, as a moral evil, or as juſtly blameable. To this end he muſt do ſomething fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than is done by the phyſician, who heals his patient: he muſt either in the perſon of the ſinner, or in his ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, puniſh ſin, and that according to its demerit; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he will not ſhow himſelf diſpleaſed at it as a moral e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
               <p>HATRED of ſin is as eſſential to the Deity as love of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; and it is as honorable to him and as neceſſary to the general good, that he expreſs the former as the latter. Indeed the latter is no further expreſſed, than the former is expreſſed: and ſo far as the former is doubtful, the latter is doubtful too. The queſtion then comes to this, whether it be conſiſtent with the general good, that God ſhould in
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:022478_0163_0FB932F1D86A6D60"/>
actions, as well as words, expreſs his abhorrence of ſin as blameable, or as a moral evil; and expreſs this abhorrence to a juſt degree. If this be conſiſtent with the general good, it is alſo conſiſtent with the general good, that ſin be puniſhed according to its demerit: and if it deſerve an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhment, it is conſiſtent with the general good and with divine goodneſs, that ſuch a puniſhment be inflicted.</p>
               <p n="7">7. THAT endleſs puniſhment is inconſiſtent with divine goodneſs, and that all men are ſaved by free grace, is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contradiction. To be ſaved is to be delivered from the curſe of the law, which we have before endeavoured to ſhow to be an endleſs puniſhment. But to be ſaved from this by free grace, implies, that the perſon ſo ſaved, deſerves endleſs puniſhment, and that ſuch puniſhment is with reſpect to him juſt. But whatever puniſhment is juſt with reſpect to any man, provided no atonement be made by a ſubſtitute, is neceſſary to the public good; and unleſs it be neceſſary to the public good, it is unjuſt. If it be neceſſary to the public good, the public good requires it: and if the public good require it, divine goodneſs requires it. Therefore to apply this reaſoning to the endleſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the ſinner:—The ſalvation of the ſinner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in deliverance from the curſe of the law: the curſe of the law is endleſs puniſhment; and to be delivered from this by free grace, implies, that the endleſs puniſhment of the ſinner is juſt. If the endleſs puniſhment of the ſinner be juſt, and no atonement be made by a ſubſtitute, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good requires his endleſs puniſhment, and the divine goodneſs of courſe requires it. So that if the ſinner can be ſaved by free grace only, and no atonement be made by a ſubſtitute, the endleſs puniſhment of the ſinner is not at all inconſiſtent with divine goodneſs; and to ſay that it is inconſiſtent with the divine goodneſs, and yet to ſay that all men are ſaved by free grace, and can be ſaved in no other way, implies, as I ſaid, a direct contradiction. It implies, that endleſs puniſhment is juſt, as the deliverance from it is the fruit of grace only: it alſo implies, that it is not juſt, as the public good or the divine goodneſs does not require it, but is inconſiſtent with it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> In which is conſidered Dr. Chauncy's argument from Rom. V, <hi>12,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>HAVING in the preceding chapters conſidered Dr. C's arguments from reaſon and from the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, I proceed now to conſider thoſe which are drawn from particular paſſages of ſcripture. The firſt of thoſe paſſages which demands our attention is Rom. V, 12, &amp;c.
<q>Wherefore, as by one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men; for that all have ſinned. For until the law ſin was in the world; but ſin is not imputed, when there is no law. Nevertheleſs death reigned from Adam to Moſes, even over them that had not ſinned, after the ſimilitude of Adam's tranſgreſſion, who is the figure of him that was to come. But not as the offence, ſo alſo is the free gift. For if through the offence of one, many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many. And not as it was by one that ſinned, ſo is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation; but the free gift is of many offences unto juſtification. For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one, Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men to condemnation: even ſo by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of one, the free gift came upon all men unto juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life. For as by one man's diſobedience many were made ſinners; ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous. Moreover, the law entered that grace might abound: but where ſin abounded, grace did much more abound: That as ſin hath reigned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, even ſo might grace reign through righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs unto eternal life, by Jeſus Chriſt, our Lord.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Doctor's argument from this paſſage depends wholly on the ſuppoſition, that the apoſtle conſiders "Adam and Chriſt as the reſpective oppoſite ſources of death and life to mankind univerſally:" Or that Chriſt is the ſource
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:022478_0165_0FB932F574A6C280"/>
of life and eternal ſalvation to all men without exception, as Adam was the ſource of death to all men without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. The Doctor's reaſons to ſupport this propoſition are,—(1) That in the 15th verſe it is ſaid,
<q>If through the offence of one many be dead, much more hath the grace of God abounded unto many:</q>
and as by <hi>many</hi> in the former part of this verſe is meant all men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he concludes that the ſame word is uſed in the ſame extenſive ſenſe, in the latter part of the verſe: "the antitheſis," he ſays, "will otherwiſe be loſt."— (2) The word <hi>many,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, means <hi>all men,</hi> becauſe the article is prefixed to it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.—(3) That in the 18th verſe it is expreſſly aſſerted,
<q>As by the offence of one, the judgment came upon <hi>all men,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>, unto juſtification of life.</q>
Whence the Doctor concludes, that the words <hi>all men</hi> in both parts of the compariſon, are uſed in the ſame extent.—(4) That the advantage by Chriſt <hi>exceeds, abounds beyond,</hi> the diſadvantage by Adam; but this, unleſs all men be ſaved, would be ſo far from the truth, that the former would
<q>ſink below the latter.</q>
—Let us attend to theſe diſtinctly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THE word <hi>many</hi> in the former part of the 15th and 19th verſes, means <hi>all men</hi>: therefore it means the ſame in the latter part of thoſe verſes:
<q>the antitheſis will otherwiſe be loſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 32, 60, &amp;c.</note>
                  </q>
Now how does the truth of this propoſition appear? It muſt certainly be ſupported by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per proof, to obtain credit. But in the very many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in which the Doctor is pleaſed to repeat this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in his long commentary on Rom. V, 12, &amp;c. I do not find one reaſon offered to prove it, beſide that quoted above, "The antitheſis will otherwiſe be loſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 32, 60, &amp;c.</note>" This therefore is now to be conſidered.—In the rebellion in Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, 1745, large numbers of men were engaged in the rebellion, and were led away by the Pretender. After the Pretender was defeated, large numbers, by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſome particular perſon, we will ſuppoſe, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their allegiance, and took the proper oaths to the King: yet not all who were drawn into the rebellion by the Pretender. Now would there be any improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in ſaying in this caſe, As by the Pretender <hi>many</hi> had
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:022478_0166_0FB932F7A0D59FD8"/>
been drawn into the rebellion, ſo by that other perſon <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> were brought back to their allegiance? The former <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> is allowed to be more extenſive, than the latter; yet there is a manifeſt antitheſis in the propoſition; an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis as manifeſt as there would have been, if the men who returned to their allegiance, had been juſt as numerous as thoſe who engaged in the rebellion, and had been the ſame individuals. Equally manifeſt it is, that though the <hi>many,</hi> who died in Adam, be more numerous than the <hi>many</hi> who are the ſubjects of ſaving grace by Chriſt: yet there is a proper antitheſis in this propoſition,—
<q>If through the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one, many be dead; much more the grace of God by Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many.</q>
               </p>

which the reader may examine for himſelf, and it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, he will find, that in no one of them is a ſtrict uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality clearly intended. If this be ſo, it is by no means evident from the general uſe of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, is uſed in Rom. V. 15. Let it be tranſlated as Dr. C. chooſes to tranſlate it, thus: If through the offence of one, <hi>the many</hi> be dead, much more the grace of God, by one man, Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto <hi>the many.</hi> Nothing appears from the expreſſion, but that the meaning of the apoſtle may be, what it has generally been underſtood to be, that <hi>the many</hi> who were connected with Adam, and whoſe life or death depended on his ſtanding or falling, became dead through his offence: and <hi>the many</hi> who are connected with Chriſt, and with a particular deſign to ſave whom, He died, ſhall be made the ſubjects of the abounding grace of God in their moſt glorious ſalvation.—I ſay, nothing appears, either from the general uſe of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or from the particular uſe of it in this caſe, but that this and this only is the real ſenſe of it, in this inſtance. And for Dr. C. to wiſh his readers, before he has given them a reaſon, to give up this ſenſe in favor of his own, is for him to come to them in the humble character of a ſuppliant, and not in the dignified character of a cogent reaſoner.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IN the 18th verſe, it is expreſſly aſſerted, As by the offence of one, judgment came upon <hi>all men,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to condemnation; even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon <hi>all men,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to juſtification of life: whence Dr, C. concludes, that the words <hi>all men,</hi> in both parts of the compariſon are uſed in the ſame extent; and ſays,
<q>It can be no other than a flat contradiction to the expreſs words of the apoſtle to ſay, that in the latter part of this compariſon not <hi>all men</hi> are meant, but <hi>believers only</hi>; that is, a few of them.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 32.</note> It is indeed a flat contradiction to Dr. C's ſenſe of the apoſtle's words; but that it is a contradiction to the true ſenſe of thoſe words, does not appear. If it ſhould be further granted to be a contradiction to the moſt <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe of thoſe words taken by themſelves, it would not thence follow, that it is a contradiction to the true
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:022478_0168_0FB932FB3A904388"/>
and real ſenſe of the words. The real ſenſe of words in all authors, is in thouſands of inſtances to be known, not from the words themſelves merely, but from their con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nection and other circumſtances.</p>
               <p>THE Dr. rightly aſſerts, that the words <hi>all</hi> men in verſe 18th, mean the ſame with <hi>the many</hi> in verſe 15th. And as it has been ſhown, that there is no evidence given by the Doctor, that <hi>the many,</hi> to whom grace abounds through Chriſt, mean <hi>all</hi> men; ſo all men in the 18th verſe mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by his own conſent, the ſame with <hi>the many</hi> in verſe 15th, muſt, until we have evidence to the contrary, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood with the ſame reſtriction. To carry on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, and maintain the antitheſis, there is no more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of underſtanding the words <hi>all men,</hi> when applied to the ſaved by Chriſt in the 18th verſe, to mean the whole human race; than there is of underſtanding in that extent, <hi>the many</hi> in the latter part of verſe 15th.</p>
               <p>BESIDE; the meaning of thoſe words is abundantly reſtricted by the context: as verſe 17th,
<q>For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign by one, Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
The 18th verſe is an inference drawn from the 17th, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>therefore.</hi> But the 18th verſe would be no juſt inference at all from the 17th, unleſs the words <hi>all men</hi> in the latter part of the 18th verſe be equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted as the words <hi>they which receive abundance of grace,</hi> in the 17th verſe. Let us make trial of underſtanding thoſe phraſes in a ſenſe differently extenſive, thus; For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more true believers in this life, who are the ſubjects of the peculiar and abundant grace of God, ſhall reign in eternal life by one, Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men univerſally to condemnation; even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men univerſally unto juſtification of life, whether in this world they believe or not. The whole force of this reaſoning is more briefly expreſſed thus; Thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in this life, ſhall reign in life eternal: therefore alſo <hi>all</hi> men, whether they believe in this life or not, ſhall in like manner reign in life eternal. But who does not ſee, that this conſequence by no means follows from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="unknown:022478_0169_0FB932FCCA21E710"/>ALTHOUGH Dr. C. ſuppoſes "this <hi>therefore</hi>" [in verſe 18th,] "is the ſame which began the 12th verſe:"— yet he allows,
<q>it will make no eſſential difference in the apoſtle's reaſoning, if we ſhould ſuppoſe, that the 18th and 19th verſes introduced by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, are a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the three foregoing verſes:</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 67.</note> And it is evident by the Doctor's own diſcourſe, that he himſelf was full in the opinion, that the 18th and 19th verſes, are a concluſion from the three preceding verſes, though he was of the opinion that thoſe three verſes, are an
<q>INTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POSED parentheſis.</q>
Let the reader notice the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſage;
<q>The view of the apoſtle in interpoſing theſe verſes</q>
[the 15th, 16th, and 17th,]
<q>was that he might argue from the gift in this abounding ſenſe, when he came to proſecute the compariſon between Adam and Chriſt—And if the gift through Chriſt might be ſuppoſed to abound beyond the lapſe, in the 15th, 16th, and 17th verſes, why not in the 18th and 19th?</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 68</note>
               </p>
               <p>INDEED the Doctor himſelf allows, that the <hi>all</hi> men in the latter part of the 18th verſe, is no more extenſive, than <hi>they which receive abundance of grace</hi> in the 17th verſe. But he ſuppoſes that the latter expreſſion is equally extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the former, and that the former extends to all mankind. I ſay, he <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> this: but his opponents in this controverſy ſuppoſe the contrary; and how does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, but that their ſuppoſition is as good as his? If the Doctor wiſhed that we ſhould give the preference to his ſuppoſition, he ought to have given us ſome reaſon.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor with the help of a "learned friend" has given us a long diſſertation on the 17th verſe, and on the Greek verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with a deſign to prove, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>they who receive,</hi> mean not thoſe who receive the grace of God <hi>actively, voluntarily</hi> and <hi>with a heart to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it</hi>; but thoſe who are the "objects of this grace," "or the perſons upon whom it is beſtowed." But this is altogether immaterial in the preſent diſpute. By the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of grace Dr. C. underſtands <hi>the abounding advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by Chriſt, terminating in a reign in life.</hi>—Now it will be granted on all hands, that they on whom this grace is beſtowed, will be ſaved. Indeed the very expreſſion, <hi>reigning in life,</hi> implies ſalvation. Thoſe therefore on whom this grace is beſtowed, will as certainly and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:022478_0170_0FB932FF0358E730"/>
be ſaved, as thoſe who cheerfully receive and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the grace of God. All the queſtion is, and a very important one it is, whether this abounding grace termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a reign in life, be beſtowed on all men. That it is preached or offered to all men, is granted. But that it is ſo communicated to all, as to ſecure their reign in life, is a different idea, and is the main ſubject of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy.</p>
               <p>SO that all the labours of Dr. C. and his
<q>ingenious friend,</q>
to ſettle the meaning of <hi>receive,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing to eſtabliſh this point, That <hi>all men</hi> in the latter part of verſe 18th, mean the whole human race. So long as the Doctor grants, that the words <hi>all men,</hi> verſe 18th, are not more extenſive than they which receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of grace, verſe 17th; and ſo long as he has not proved, that they which receive abundance of grace, ſo as to reign in eternal life, mean the whole human race; ſo long nothing is done to prove univerſal ſalvation, from the uſe of the words <hi>all men,</hi> verſe 18th. To ſay, that <hi>they which receive abundance of grace</hi> mean all mankind, becauſe that expreſſion is equally extenſive as the words <hi>all men</hi> in the 18th verſe, is a mere begging of the queſtion. It is in the firſt place to ſuppoſe and not to prove, that the words <hi>all men</hi> mean all mankind; and then by them to prove, that alſo <hi>they which receive abundance of grace,</hi> mean all mankind.</p>
               <p>THE univerſal term <hi>all men,</hi> verſe 18th, is by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the chapter limited to thoſe who are juſtified by faith, who have peace with God, and who joy in God, through Chriſt, as having received reconciliation. Dr. C's opinion was, that the 18th verſe is but the full expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſentence left imperfect in the 12th verſe, and that the <hi>therefore</hi> in the beginning of the 18th verſe
<q>is the ſame which began the 12th verſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 67.</note>
                  </q>
The 18th verſe then is an immediate concluſion from the verſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding the 12th, eſpecially from the 11th. Now the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in endleſs puniſhment hold, that in all that part of the chapter, from the beginning to the 12th verſe, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had been ſpeaking of the privileges of believers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not thoſe privileges which belong to all mankind. And to infer from thoſe privileges which are peculiar to believers, that all mankind will be ſaved, is to infer a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:022478_0171_0FB933009E2967B0"/>
which is by no means contained in the premiſes: and ſuch reaſoning ought never to be imputed to any man of Paul's ſound judgment, much leſs to <hi>him,</hi> an inſpired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</p>
               <p>TO illuſtrate this matter, permit me to deſcend to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Verſe 1ſt, believers are ſaid to be juſtified by faith and to have peace with God: verſe 2d, to have acceſs by faith into the grace of the goſpel and to rejoice (or glory) in the hope of the glory of God: verſe 3d, to glory in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations: verſe 5th, to have the love of God ſhed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghoſt: verſe 8th, it is ſaid that God commendeth his love towards believers, in that Chriſt died for <hi>them</hi>: verſe 9th, that believers are juſtified by Chriſt's blood, and ſaved from wrath through him: verſe 10th, that believers are reconciled to God by the death of Chriſt and ſaved by his life: verſe 11th, that believers glory in God through Chriſt, by whom they have received the atonement or reconciliation.—Now what is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence really following from theſe premiſes, aſcribing to believers theſe peculiar and excluſive privileges? Is it that by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt the free gift unto juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of life, is come upon all mankind, believers and unbelievers? By no means: any man, without the aid of inſpiration, would be aſhamed to draw ſuch a conſequence from ſuch premiſes. The only juſt conſequence of theſe premiſes, is that which has been generally taken to be the meaning of the 18th verſe; viz That as by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one, Adam, judgment to condemnation came upon all mankind who were his ſeed; even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one, Jeſus Chriſt, the free gift unto juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of life, came upon all <hi>his</hi> ſeed, who are believers only, and who are the only perſons of whom the apoſtle had been ſpeaking in the premiſes.—May I not now adopt the ſame bold language which Dr. C. often uſes concerning his comments on ſcripture, that no other ſenſe than this, can be put on this 18th verſe without making the apoſtle argue inconcluſively?</p>
               <p>I KNOW very well that the Doctor underſtood differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently the whole paſſage from the beginning of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the 12th verſe. But as his whole argument from Rom. V. 12. to the end, in the preſent view of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on his different conſtruction of verſe 1—12; it is not ſufficient to ſay, that the Doctor <hi>underſtood</hi> that paſſage
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:022478_0172_0FB93301F52C3690"/>
differently, or that it is <hi>capable</hi> of a different conſtruction. It muſt be ſhown that it is not capable of the conſtruction which is given above; and that the Doctor's conſtruction muſt be the true one. Let us therefore attend to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and his reaſons in ſupport of it.</p>
               <p>THE conſtruction is, that the laſt verſe of the preceding chapter, the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, verſes, and the latter part of the 11th verſe of this chapter, are ſpoken of all mankind. The reaſons which he aſſigns for ſuch an underſtanding of thoſe verſes, are</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) THAT in the 6th verſe Chriſt is ſaid to die for <hi>the ungodly.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 35.</note> But if we ſhould aſſert, that by the ungodly here are meant thoſe only, who afterward and during this life become godly or believers, though Chriſt died for them while ungodly or conſidering them as ungodly, the Doctor has given no confutation of ſuch a conſtruction. Therefore he had no right to expect, that it would be reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any one who ſhould chooſe to adopt it.—Or if we allow, that Chriſt did die for all men in this ſenſe, that he died to introduce a diſpenſation of grace which ſhould offer ſalvation to all, and invite all to it, and to uſe Dr. C's own expreſſion, <hi>to put all into ſalvable circumſtances</hi>; nothing will hence fellow favourable to the actual ſalvation of all men, or to the Doctor's argument from Rom. V. 12, &amp;c. It will not follow, that all will accept the invitations to ſalvation and act upon them. Still the <hi>we</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> which occur ſo often from the 1ſt to the 12th verſe, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in verſe 6th, may mean believers only.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.)
<q>IT is a groſs miſtake to think, that the apoſtle in this 9th verſe is ſpeaking of that juſtification he had in the 1ſt verſe connected with faith; and for this deciſive reaſon, becauſe—as ſalvation from wrath is one thing eſſentially included in that juſtification which is the reſult of true faith; it would be ridiculous to argue, <hi>much more</hi> being juſtified, meaning hereby this juſtification, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 37.</note>—But did Dr. C. entertain the opinion, that juſtification and ſalvation are one and the ſame? Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs: he was then juſtified: but he did not then receive complete ſalvation. Believers being in this life juſtified by faith, have peace with God, according to the 1ſt verſe of this chapter, as Dr. C. allows.
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:022478_0173_0FB9330373946FF0"/>
Yet they are not in this life ſaved from wrath in the ſenſe they will be, at the day of judgment. Therefore, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Dr. C. <hi>aſſerts</hi> it, it does not <hi>appear</hi> to be ridiculous to argue, that believers being in this life juſtified by faith in the blood of Chriſt, ſhall at the day of judgment, much more be ſaved from wrath through him. Is it ridiculous to argue, that Abraham being juſtified by faith here, will much more be ſaved from wrath hereafter?</p>

<q>THE particle <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, now, connected with the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication here treated of, is emphatical, making it clear, that the apoſtle is not to be underſtood of juſtification at the great day; but of juſtification that had at that time been completed.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 37.</note>
                  </q>
—No body pretends, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle means a juſtification at the great day. It is allowed on all hands, that he means a juſtification, which had at that preſent time been completed. But what follows hence? Did Dr. C. imagine, that believers are not in a proper ſenſe completely juſtified in this life? And that the juſtification of Abraham, Rahab, &amp;c. was in no proper ſenſe completed before their death, or before the great day? Concerning the former, it is expreſſly ſaid, that he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, and it <hi>was</hi> counted to him for righteouſneſs—that faith <hi>was</hi> reckoned to Abraham for righteouſneſs, &amp;c, and concerning the latter, <hi>was</hi> not Rahab the harlot juſtified, &amp;c? Nor is it material to the preſent purpoſe, whether this juſtification of Rahab mean a juſtification by God, or a manifeſtative juſtification, proving, that ſhe was juſtified in in the ſight of God; becauſe the latter, equally as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, implies that ſhe was then juſtified in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>THAT believers are in this life juſtified in a peculiar ſenſe, is further taught in 1 Cor. VI, 11,
<q>And ſuch were ſome of you: but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye <hi>are juſtified</hi> in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God.</q>
—I preſume it will be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that pardon or forgiveneſs is an eſſential part of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and that when a man is forgiven by God, he is juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by God. But that believers are forgiven in this life, is evident from the following texts, Mat. IX, 2, "Son, thy ſins be forgiven thee." See alſo, Mark, II, 5, and Luke V, 20,—Col. II, 13.
<q>And you being dead in your ſins, and the uncircumciſion of your fleſh, hath
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:022478_0174_0FB93305DC50BBC8"/>
he quickened together with him, <hi>having forgiven</hi> you all treſpaſſes.</q>
1 John II. 12,
<q>I write unto you, little children, becauſe your ſins are forgiven you, for his name's ſake.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But why need I produce proofs of what Dr. C. grants, though it ſeems in his comment on the 9th verſe, he had forgotten it? In his comment on the 1ſt verſe, &amp;c, he ſpeaks of
<q>the juſtified by faith, as glorying in hope of the glory of God—and in their ſufferings— becauſe they knew that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope.</q>
The Doctor, as the apoſtle did before him, evidently conſiders theſe things as taking place in this life. Indeed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary cannot be pretended without the groſſeſt abſurdity. He alſo conſiders theſe views and affections as peculiar to the <hi>juſtified by faith.</hi> Therefore ſome men are completely juſtified by faith in this life: at leaſt ſo completely, as to render the 9th verſe properly applicable to them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his argument from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>now,</hi> that the juſtification ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the 9th verſe, is not peculiar to believers, proves nothing.</p>
               <p>BESIDE, Dr. C. could not, without the moſt glaring abſurdity and inconſiſtency, underſtand this 9th verſe of all mankind: becauſe the perſons here referred to, ſhall be <hi>ſaved from wrath.</hi> But according to the Doctor ſome men will not be ſaved from wrath, they will ſuffer all that wrath to which they are liable on the footing of ſtrict juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: they will ſuffer according to their ſins, according to their crimes, and their deſerts, and ſo that the whole threatened penalty will be executed on them.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) DOCTOR C. argues, that becauſe it is ſaid in verſe 10th, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God; by the <hi>we</hi> here, we muſt underſtand, not believers only, but all mankind: or becauſe, as the Doctor paraphraſes the words, <hi>while</hi> they were enemies, they were reconciled; therefore this reconciliation cannot mean the cordial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of true believers.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 38.</note> The force of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wholly depends on this ſuppoſition, that the perſons here intended, were reconciled, and yet after the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation was effected, they ſtill remained enemies. But what neceſſity of this gloſs of the text? Why may it not mean this merely, that when the perſons here intended
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:022478_0175_0FB9330810F5E758"/>
were going on in their enmity, they were arreſted by the grace of God, reclaimed from their enmity, and reconciled to God? There appears to be nothing abſurd or unuſual in this expreſſion underſtood in this ſenſe. If it ſhould be ſaid, When a ſubject was waging war againſt his ſovereign, and was in actual battle with the troops of his ſovereign, he was reconciled to him; the expreſſion would not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally imply, and no man would underſtand it to mean, that notwithſtanding the reconciliation, he ſtill continued a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and malicious enemy to his ſovereign No man would underſtand the expreſſion in any other ſenſe than this, that in the midſt of the war and battle, he was ſtruck with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of his wickedneſs, and became cordially reconciled to his ſovereign.</p>
               <p>IF the Doctor depended on the original words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to make out that the reconciliation here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended took place, while the perſons ſpoken of remained enemies; he might as concluſively have argued, that the perſon mentioned in Joh. IX, 25, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) had his ſight reſtored to him, while he remained perfectly blind; and that Saul went to Damaſcus, with the expectation of bringing certain perſons to Jeruſalem, who at the ſame time ſhould ſtill remain at Damaſcus, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) Act. XXII, 5.</p>
               <p>AT length we come to the Doctor's expoſition of the 11th verſe, to which his criticiſm, on all the preceding ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes refers. He tells us, The meaning plainly and briefly is,
<q>We believers glory in God of our intereſt, and relation to him, as our covenant God, through Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we were ſo changed in our ſtate, <hi>while ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>—in common with the reſt of mankind, as to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of—final juſtification upon the foot of faith.</q>
On this it may be remarked, That if by
<q>intereſt in and covenant relation to God,</q>
Dr. C. meant any thing different from that ſtate of reconciliation, which is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt, and which is mentioned in the latter part of this verſe, it does not appear, that the text gives him any warrant to inſert that intereſt, &amp;c. in his comment, as a ground of rejoicing or glorying. I appeal to the reader, whether the moſt natural ſenſe of the text be not this, We believers glory in God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as having by Chriſt received reconciliation; or <hi>for this reaſon,</hi> that of God's rich grace through Chriſt, we have
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:022478_0176_0FB93309730B8140"/>
obtained reconciliation with God. Otherwiſe, why is the circumſtance of our receiving the reconciliation by Chriſt mentioned in this connection with our glorying in God? Beſide, to glory in God as our covenant God, and to glory in him on account of our reconciliation with him, is one and the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>THE glorying of which the apoſtle ſpeaks, is through Chriſt; and this implies, that it is on account of ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit or bleſſing received through Chriſt: and what this bleſſing is, which the apoſtle had in view, and which he conſidered as the ground of glorying to believers, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately explains in theſe words, <hi>by whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the reconciliation,</hi> that reconciliation of which he had been ſpeaking in the 10th verſe.—But if the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, which the apoſtle makes, the great ground of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing or glorying to believers, be, as Dr. C. holds, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to believers and unbelievers? then the great ground of glorying to believers is not any bleſſing peculiar to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; but ſomething common to all mankind; and therefore unbelievers have juſt the ſame reaſon to glory in that bleſſing as believers; which is no more credible than the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation, and wants as much proof as that doctrine; and therefore cannot be admitted as any evidence of the truth of that doctrine.</p>
               <p>I BEG the reader's patience, while I make a few other remarks on Dr. C's conſtruction of the paſſage from Rom. IV. 25, to Chap. V. 12; and I wiſh the reader to keep before him the paſſage itſelf, while he follows me in theſe remarks.</p>
               <p>THIS whole paſſage is expreſſed in the firſt perſon, and is manifeſtly one continued diſcourſe. Yet Dr. C. was of the opinion, that in this ſhort paſſage of only twelve ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the perſons, or the <hi>we, us</hi> and <hi>our,</hi> which occur in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every ſentence, are ſhifted no leſs than four times. In the laſt verſe of Chap. IV, it was his opinion, that all men are intended: that from the firſt to the ſixth verſe of Chapter V, only believers are intended: that from the 6th to the 11th verſe all men are intended: that in the former part of the 11th verſe believers only are intended: that in the latter part of the 11th verſe all men are again inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. I beg leave to ſet down this whole paſſage, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Doctor's explanation, together with the text itſelf:—Thus<q>

               <p>BUT this is not all.

Thus the firſt verſe of the fifth Chapter is manifeſtly brought in by the apoſtle, as a conſequence drawn from the laſt verſe of the preceding Chapter. But from the conſideration, that Chriſt died and roſe to put all men into a capacity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining juſtification at the great day, it by no means fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that <hi>believers are now</hi> juſtified by faith, and have peace with God.

The ſame obſervation is equally applicable to the 10th verſe. What was before obſerved concerning the 11th verſe, underſtood in Dr. C's ſenſe, needs not to be repeated.</p>
               <p>BUT what is of chief importance is, that according to the Doctor's conſtruction, there is no argumentative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between the 11th and the 12th, or which is the ſame thing, between the 11th and the 18th verſes. If the Doctor's ſenſe of the 11th and 18th verſes be true, the latter is no juſt conſequence from the former. The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's ſenſe of the 11th verſe is, that all men through Chriſt have received a poſſibility of final ſalvation; and his ſenſe of the 18th verſe is, that all men will actually be ſaved. But if it be ever ſo true, that all men have received a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility or opportunity of final ſalvation, it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that all will actually be ſaved. Yet as the 12th or 18th verſe, (the intermediate verſes being a parentheſis) is a deduction from the 11th, the laſt of the propoſitions juſt expreſſed, ſhould juſtly follow from the other; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the apoſtle argues inconcluſively. And as the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's gloſs of theſe two verſes makes the apoſtle reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluſively, we may be ſure, that he has not given the true ſenſe of them.—But according to the common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of theſe verſes, the reaſoning is clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. For if believers have obtained through Chriſt a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial reconciliation and peace with God, then certainly thoſe ſame believers will, in the ſame way, obtain eternal life and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>THAT the 12th, and therefore the 18th verſe, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from the 11th, is, I think, manifeſt from a careful peruſal of the paſſage, and it is at leaſt implicitly granted by Dr. C. He expreſſly ſays, that the <hi>therefore</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 18th verſe,
<q>is the ſame which began the 12th verſe. The protaſis or firſt part of the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was there entered upon, but left unfiniſhed. 'Tis
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:022478_0180_0FB93319903FF150"/>
here reſumed, I ſay, therefore, as by the offence of one man</q>
&amp;c. <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 67.</note> And his paraphraſe of the 18th verſe is in theſe words:
<q>I ſay, therefore, (to reſume now and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the compariſon I began in the 12th verſe) as it was by the lapſe of the one man, Adam,</q>
&amp;c.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 26.</note> The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor alſo quotes Dr. Doddridge's aſſertion, that
<q>the 12th verſe is an inference from the 11th,</q>
and does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict that aſſertion, though he labours through a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of pages, to affix a different ſenſe from that of Dr. Doddridge, to the 11th verſe, that thus he may evade the conſtruction of the 18th verſe, which Dr. Doddridge had given, and eſtabliſh his own. But all this was needleſs, if indeed the 12th and 18th verſes are not an inference from the 11th.—Nor is there any inconſiſtence in the opinion, that the 18th verſe may be at the ſame time an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from the 11th and from the 15th, 16th and 17th verſes. True and ſufficient premiſes or reaſons of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the 18th verſe, may be contained in the 11th verſe. Thoſe reaſons maybe explained, and even others added in the 15th, 16th and 17th verſes, which fall into a parentheſis; and the 18th verſe may contain an inference juſtly deducible from either, or from both.</p>
               <p>I AM indeed ſenſible, that Dr. C. in his paraphraſe of the 12th verſe, does not conſider it as an inference from the 11th; but the 11th as deducible by way of inference from the 12th, in this manner: Becauſe ſin and death came upon all men by Adam, therefore all men have obtained a poſſibility of ſalvation by Chriſt. His words are,
<q>For this cauſe or reaſon, we have received reconciliation by Jeſus Chriſt, namely, becauſe as ſin entered into the world by the one man, Adam,<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 23.</note>
                  </q>
&amp;c. But this is as ſurpriſing as any part of Dr. C's truly ſurpriſing expoſition of this chapter. In the firſt place, it is a mere conjecture, unſupported by any thing, but pure imagination. In the ſecond place, to apply this paraphraſe to the 18th verſe, which is but the full expreſſion of the 12th, it will ſtand thus: For this cauſe or reaſon all men have received a poſſibility of ſalvation, namely, that as by the offence of one, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came upon all men to condemnation, even ſo, by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſalvation. Or more briefly thus: The reaſon, why
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:022478_0181_0FB9331B96E0F6D0"/>
all men have obtained a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of ſalvation, is, that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is <hi>actually</hi> come upon all men: Or to place the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in its proper arrangement, Salvation is actually come upon all men; therefore all men have received a poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſalvation.—On this reaſoning I need make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.—It is not however probable, that the Doctor was ſenſible, that his paraphraſe of the 12th verſe, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the 18th, would come to this. Nor is the reaſon juſt expreſſed, that which the Doctor believed to be the true one, why we have received the reconciliation. But that which in the Doctor's opinion was the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he expreſſly declares to be,
<q>That it was in ſuch a way, viz. by the offence of one, that judgment came upon all men to condemnation.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 30.</note>
                  </q>
—Who is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for this inconſiſtency, I need not inform the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>BEFORE I diſmiſs this part of Dr. C's book, I cannot but obſerve, that he ſpeaks of a double juſtification,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 38.</note> the one meaning abſolution at the great day; the other mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the advantageous ſtate, or the poſſibility of the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all mankind through Chriſt. It ſeems then that the Doctor had forgotten, that he had but a few pages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made out a threefold juſtification: THe firſt kind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the introduction to a capacity or poſſibility of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through Chriſt: The ſecond in the juſtification of believers, who have peace with God while in this life; ſuch was the juſtification of Abraham: The third in abſolution at the great day.—But when any thing is abundantly multiplied, no wonder if the author himſelf of that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication forgets the number of units contained in his own product.</p>
               <p>DR. C. ſays,<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 32.</note> It can be no other than a flat contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the expreſs words of the Apoſtle himſelf, to ſay that in the latter part of the compariſon in the 18th verſe, the words <hi>all men</hi> are not uſed in the ſame extenſive ſenſe, as in the former part of that verſe. This is indeed a ſtrong, poſitive aſſertion, but where is the reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it? Beſide; he thought it no flat contradiction to the expreſs words of the Apoſtle, to ſay that <hi>we</hi> in the former part of the 11th verſe, is not uſed in the ſame extenſive ſenſe as in the latter part of that verſe: nor any flat contradiction to the words of our Saviour, to ſay, that the word <hi>everlaſting</hi> is not uſed in the ſame extenſive ſenſe in
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:022478_0182_0FB9331DF21384E0"/>
the former part, as in the latter part of Matt. XXV. 46,
<q>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, but the righteous into everlaſting life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT it is time we ſhould proceed to the other argument of Dr. C. to prove that univerſal ſalvation is taught in Rom. V. 12, &amp;c. viz.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THE advantage by Chriſt <hi>exceeds,</hi> abounds beyond, the diſadvantage by Adam. But unleſs all men be ſaved, the former "ſinks below" the latter.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 32 &amp; 81, &amp;c.</note>—It is granted, that the advantage by Chriſt, to thoſe who obtain ſalvation by Chriſt, exceeds, and abounds beyond, the diſadvantage by Adam. But the queſtion is, whether this ſaving ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage extend to all thoſe, to whom the diſadvantage by Adam extended. That it does extend to all the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to whom the diſadvantage by Adam extended, is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by Dr. C. But how does he prove it? By no other arguments than thoſe which we have already particularly conſidered; and whether they be concluſive, is ſubmitted to the reader,—Dr. C. did not imagine, that the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by Chriſt was more extenſive, or extended to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number of perſons, than the diſadvantage by Adam. He believed, that they both extended to all mankind.— Therefore, the ſuper-abounding, the exceſs, or ſurpluſage of the advantage by Chriſt, does not conſiſt in the extent of it, but in ſomething elſe, and that ſomething elſe may exiſt, though the extent as to the number of perſons be the ſame, or even leſs than the extent of the diſadvantage by Adam.</p>
               <p>IF the glory of God, and the happineſs of the created ſyſtem, be more advanced by the ſalvation of a part of the human race, and by the rejection of the reſt, than they would have been, if Adam had never fallen; then ſurely the advantage by Chriſt on the general ſcale, does not "ſink below" the diſadvantage by Adam: and to aſſert, that the divine glory and the happineſs of the created ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem would be moſt advanced by the ſalvation of all men, is to beg material points in queſtion.—But if Dr. C. mean, that if all be not ſaved by Chriſt, then the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by Chriſt to thoſe who ſhall be finally miſerable, "ſinks below" the diſadvantage by Adam to the ſame perſons; I grant it, and apprehend no diſadvantage to my cauſe by the conceſſion. For it is granting no more than
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:022478_0183_0FB9331F40CB0C78"/>
is implied in the very propoſition, which I endeavour to defend, that all men will not be ſaved.</p>
               <p>I HAVE now finiſhed my remarks on Dr. C's argument from Rom. V, 12, &amp;c.—If the reader think I have been prolix in theſe remarks, I hope he will remember how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix the Doctor was in his argument from this paſſage; and I preſume he will not think it unreaſonable to take up nineteen pages in anſwering ſixty-nine.</p>
               <p>IT is now left to the reader to judge, whether it be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that becauſe the word <hi>many</hi> in the former part of the 15th and 19th verſes means <hi>all</hi> men, it means the ſame in the latter part of thoſe verſes:—Whether it be certain, that the word <hi>many</hi> means all men, becauſe the article is joined with it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the many</hi>:—Whether becauſe the words <hi>all</hi> men in the former part of the 18th verſe, mean all mankind, they certainly mean the ſame in the latter part of that verſe:—Whether becauſe the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by Chriſt exceeds the diſadvantage by Adam, it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly follow, that the advantage to every individual man, will exceed the diſadvantage to that man.</p>

               <p>THE text is,
<q>For the earneſt expectation of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture waiteth for the manifeſtation of the ſons of God. For the creature was made ſubject to vanity not willingly, but by reaſon of him who ſubjected the ſame in hope. Becauſe the creature itſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourſelves alſo which have the firſt fruits of the Spirit, even we ourſelves groan with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ourſelves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of our body.</q>
—The words of chief import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance are thoſe of the 21ſt verſe;
<q>The creature itſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God:</q>
which
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:022478_0184_0FB93321A9741368"/>
are ſuppoſed by Dr. C. to hold forth the ſalvation of all men. But the main queſtion here is, what is the meaning of the word <hi>creature.</hi> Dr. C. ſuppoſes it means <hi>the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race.</hi> Others ſuppoſe it means the whole of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation which was made for the ſake of men, and is ſubjected to their uſe.—Beſide the word <hi>creature,</hi> the following words and expreſſions,
<q>manifeſtation of the ſons of God</q>
—"vanity"—"willingly"—
<q>bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</q>
—are all underſtood differently by Dr. C. and by thoſe who believe in endleſs puniſhment. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore attend to them reſpectively.</p>
               <p n="1">I. THE meaning of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>creature</hi> or <hi>creation,</hi> is to be ſought. It may not be impertinent to inform the reader who is unacquainted with the original, that the word tranſlated creature in the 19th, 20th and 21ſt verſes, is the very ſame which in the 22d verſe is tranſlated <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and doubtleſs whatever be the meaning of it, it ought to have been tranſlated uniformly throughout this paſſage.—Dr. C. was of opinion that it means all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind or the rational creation of this world. His reaſons for this opinion are, that
<q>
                     <hi>earneſt expectation, groaning, travailing together in pain,</hi> are more naturally and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly applicable to the rational, than the inanimate</q>
[and brutal] "creation"—
<q>that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the <hi>whole cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> is never uſed (one diſputed text only excepted, Col. I. 15.) to ſignify more than the whole moral cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, or all mankind</q>
—that
<q>it would be highly incongruous, to give this ſtyle</q>
[the whole creation]
<q>to the inferior or leſs valuable part, wholly leaving out the moſt excellent</q>
part, mankind.</p>
               <p n="1">1.
<q>EARNEST <hi>expectation, groaning, travailing together in pain,</hi> are more naturally applicable to the rational, than the inanimate</q>
[and brutal] "creation."<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 98.</note>—If this prove any thing, it will prove too much: it will prove, that when in Pſal. CXIV, it is ſaid
<q>The ſea ſaw it and fled; Jordan was driven back; the mountains ſkipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs;</q>
the meaning is, that <hi>men</hi> ſaw it and fled; that men were driven back; that men ſkipped like rams and like lambs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will prove, that Jer. XLVII. 6,
<q>O thou ſword of the Lord, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyſelf into thy ſcabbard, reſt and be ſtill;</q>
means that <hi>men</hi> ſhould
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:022478_0185_0FB9332301F66930"/>
put up themſelves into a ſcabbard, and there reſt and be ſtill. It will prove that Hoſ. XIII. 14,
<q>I will ranſom them from the power of the grave: I will redeem them from death. O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy deſtruction;</q>
means that God will be the plagues and deſtruction of <hi>men</hi>: and when once it is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, that death and the grave mean men, as men are to be ranſomed from the grave and redeemed from death, it will follow that men are to be ranſomed from themſelves and redeemed from themſelves.—But there is no end to the abſurdities which will follow from this mode of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruing the ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>THE truth is, that the figure of ſpeech, whereby inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate things are repreſented as living, ſenſible and rational perſons, and are addreſſed as ſuch, is very common in ſcripture. Beſide the inſtances already mentioned, I beg leave to refer to the following: Deut. XXXII. 1.
<q>Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will ſpeak; hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.</q>
Pſal. LXV. 12, 13.
<q>The little hills rejoice on every ſide. The paſtures—the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys—ſhout for joy: they alſo ſing.</q>
Iſai. LV. 12.
<q>The mountains and the hills ſhall break forth before you into ſinging, and all the trees of the field ſhall clap their hands.</q>
Hab. II. 11.
<q>For the ſtone ſhall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber ſhall anſwer it.</q>
Pſal. LXXXIX, 12.
<q>Tabor and Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſhall rejoice in thy name.</q>
Pſal. XCVII, 1.
<q>The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of the iſles be glad thereof.</q>
Iſai. XXIV, 4.
<q>The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world monrneth, languiſheth and fadeth away.</q>
See alſo Pſal. XCVIII, 8. Iſai. XVI, 8. XXXV, 1, 2. XLIX, 13. Lev. XVIII, 28, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>NOW rejoicing, ſhouting for joy, ſinging, breaking forth into ſinging, clapping of hands, crying out, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mourning, languiſhing, &amp;c, are certainly in theſe paſſages applied to inanimate creatures. But they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to ſuch creatures, not more naturally and obviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than earneſt expectation, groaning and travailing in pain.</p>
               <p>THOUGH the Doctor thinks theſe expreſſions not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applicable to any other creatures than mankind; yet he himſelf applies them to mankind in no other ſenſe, than
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:022478_0186_0FB933248B209260"/>
that in which they are applicable to the brutal creation. The ſenſe in which he ſuppoſes all mankind <hi>long</hi> and <hi>wait</hi> for the manifeſtation of the ſons of God, is, that they
<q>groan under the afflictions of this world, ſenſible of its imperfections, and conſequently deſire ſomething bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</q>
Now the calamities of the world fall not on the rational part of it only, but on all the animal, ſenſitive parts, and conſequently they, as well as mankind,
<q>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſomething better.</q>
From theſe calamities and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries the animal parts of the world will be delivered, at the manifeſtation of the ſons of God.</p>
               <p>FURTHER, the inanimate parts of the world, once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonified, as they are in innumerable inſtances throughout the ſcriptures, may as properly have the particular perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al affections, actions and ſufferings, of <hi>expectation, waiting, groaning, travailing,</hi> &amp;c. aſcribed to them, as any other perſonal affections, actions or ſufferings.</p>
               <p>IF any ſhould think it impoſſible for brutes and inanimate matter to enjoy the liberty of the children of God, and therefore that it is abſurd to repreſent, that they ſhall be delivered into that liberty: let it be obſerved, that though this would be abſurd, while they are repreſented to be ſtill brutes and inanimate matter; yet as ſoon as they are repreſented to be intelligent beings, the abſurdity ceaſes. There is in this caſe no more abſurdity in repreſenting them, as brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God after the reſurrection, than in repreſenting, that they rejoice in the manifeſtation of the divine perfections and in the prevalence of true religion in this world; as is done in the paſſages before quoted.</p>
               <p>OBJECTION. Though there would be no abſurdity in figuratively repreſenting brutes and inanimate creatures, in this world, as rejoicing in the manifeſtations of divine power, wiſdom and goodneſs, yet there is an abſurdity in the repreſentation, that they ſhall be brought into the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the children of God, after the end of the world; becauſe then they will be annihilated; and to repreſent that after they ſhall be annihilated, they ſtill enjoy glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty, is a groſs inconſiſtency. This is the objection in its full ſtrength.—Let us attend to it.</p>
               <p>IT is not agreed by all writers, that the liberty of the children of God mentioned in the 21ſt verſe, means that liberty and bleſſedneſs which they ſhall enjoy after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:022478_0187_0FB93325EEF3FD30"/>
and general judgment; ſome are of the opinion, that it means that liberty which they ſhall enjoy on earth in the latter days, when Chriſt ſhall reign on earth for a thouſand years.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Guiſe's Paraphraſe in loc. and Hopkins's Inquiry concerning the Future State of the Wicked. P. <hi>101.</hi>
                  </note> If this be the true ſenſe of the apoſtle, the objection vaniſhes at once, as the brutal and inanimate creation will then be in as real exiſtence, as they are now.</p>
               <p>NOR is it agreed among writers, that this world will, after the general judgment be annihilated. It is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of many, and of great authority too, that after a purification by fire, it will be reſtored to a far more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtate, than that in which it is at preſent, and will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the place of the reſidence of holy and happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.—If this be true, the objection again vaniſhes.</p>
               <p>FINALLY, if it be the real truth, that the brutal and material creation will be annihilated, after the general judgment, yet there is no abſurdity in repreſenting, that it ſhall be brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God. Wherein does the liberty of the children of God conſiſt? Doubtleſs in a great meaſure in deliverance from ſin, and from the influence of it in themſelves and others. So the brutal and material creation, even if it be annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, ſhall be delivered from the power, abuſe and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable perverſion of wicked men, to which it had been long ſubjected, and under which it had long groaned. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this creation introduced as a rational perſon, may, without impropriety be repreſented as earneſtly wiſhing for that deliverance. And as the deliverance from ſin in themſelves and from the effects of ſin in others, is at leaſt a great part of the liberty which the children of God ſhall obtain after the general judgment; ſo the aforeſaid deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the creation may not improperly be called a deliverance into the liberty of the children of God, into a ſimilar liberty, a like freedom from the tyranny, abuſes and perverſions of wicked men. Or the ſenſe may be a deliverance <hi>in, at,</hi> or <hi>on occaſion of,</hi> the glorious liberty of the children of God. The prepoſition <hi>us,</hi> is capable of this ſenſe, and then the conſtruction of this paſſage will be, That the creation itſelf will be delivered from the bondage of corruption, at the time, or on occaſion, of the glorious liberty or deliverance of the children of God.</p>

               <p>AS to Mark XVI. 15, it is granted, that in that text <hi>every creature</hi> means <hi>human</hi> creature.—Though Dr. C. ſays, that Col. I. 15, is diſputed; yet he pretends not, that every creature here means mankind merely: nor does it appear, that the text is in this reſpect diſputed. It is indeed diſputed, whether <gap reason="foreign">

It is alſo diſputed, whether Chriſt be ſo the firſt born of all the creation, as to be a creature himſelf; or whether he be the firſt born in this ſenſe only, that he is the heir, the head and Lord of all the creation. <gap reason="foreign">

occurs, is Col. I. 23;
<q>The goſpel, which was preached to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture under heaven.</q>
The Doctor, who was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the original, doubtleſs recollected, or at leaſt, he ought to have examined, and then he would have ſeen, that in the original it is,
<q>
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>every human creature.</hi> The queſtion is whether theſe words ſignify <hi>all mankind</hi>: and the very propoſing of the queſtion, I preſume, ſuggeſts the anſwer. Will any man ſay, that every Chriſtian is required, either by reaſon or revelation, to ſubmit to every individual of the human race, whether man, woman or child; and whether the Chriſtian be a lord or a tenant, a king or a ſubject?— Beſides; allowing that the phraſe as it ſtands, means the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race; the addition of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, would not ſignify the human race; otherwiſe why is it added? If the words in our language, <hi>every creature,</hi> mean always every human creature, it would be needleſs in any caſe to inſert the adjective <hi>human</hi>; and the very inſertion of it would imply, that the writer or ſpeaker was of the opinion, that the bare words <hi>every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> were not certainly limited to human creatures, but would moſt obviouſly be taken in a greater extent.— This text therefore is ſo far from a proof, that

               </p>
               <p>AFTER all, the very drift of the apoſtle ſhows, that in 1 Pet. II. 13, he was ſo far from meaning all mankind by the expreſſion <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that he meant either not one of the human race, or at moſt but very few; that he meant either human laws and

conſtitutions, or human magiſtrates, the king as ſupreme, governors who are ſent by him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>NOW let the reader judge, whether <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
be never uſed in all the New Teſtament to ſignify more or leſs than all mankind; and whether of the four inſtances, in which it occurs, beſide this of Rom. VIII, it do not in every one ſignify either more or leſs than all mankind; excepting Mark XVI, 15. And it is equally againſt Dr. C's argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Rom. VIII, whether it be uſed in other places to ſignify more, or to ſignify leſs than all mankind. If it ſignify more in other places, it may ſignify more in Rom. VIII. If it ſignify leſs in other places, it may ſignify leſs in Rom. VIII: and when the apoſtle ſays,
<q>the earneſt expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſons of God,</q>
he may mean that only believers and true Chriſtians, or the true church in all ages, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from the Apoſtle, and firſt converts, who had the firſt fruits of the Spirit, are thus waiting, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IT is further to be obſerved, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>creature</hi> or <hi>creation,</hi> without <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>IN the Septuagint verſion of the Old Teſtament, <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>BUT it is time we attend to Dr. C's other reaſon for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the <hi>creature</hi> to mean all mankind; or at leaſt to include all mankind, if it mean any thing more. The reaſon is,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That
<q>it would be highly incongruous, to give this ſtyle</q>
[the whole creation]
<q>to the inferior or leſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:022478_0191_0FB93331A700FC40"/>
part, wholly leaving out the moſt excellent</q>
part, mankind.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 98.</note>—But is there more propriety in calling a ſmall part, though it be the moſt excellent part, <hi>the whole creation</hi>; than in calling by far the greater part <hi>the whole creation,</hi> though it be not ſo excellent? The learned men in any nation, are, in ſome reſpects, the moſt excellent part of the nation. But would it be more proper to call them, to the excluſion of all the unlearned the whole nation, than to call all the unlearned, to the excluſion of the few learned, the whole nation? The few truly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and holy perſons who love God ſupremely and their neighbour as themſelves, and who find the ſtrait gate, are undoubtedly the moſt excellent part of any nation. But would it be more proper to call them alone the whole nation, than to call the reſt alone, the whole nation? Thoſe of the apoſtolic age, who had the firſt fruits of the Spirit, were, without doubt the moſt excellent of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. But would it therefore be more proper to call them as diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of men, that whole ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; than to call the reſt of men as diſtinguiſhed from them, that whole generation?—Beſide; propriety or congruity of language depends wholly on uſe. If the words <hi>creature, creation</hi> and <hi>whole creation</hi> be frequently in ſcripture uſed without any reference to mankind; then there is no incongruity in the ſame uſe of the ſame words, in this eighth chapter of Romans: and that this is the uſe, I appeal to the texts before quoted, which are all the texts in which the words here tranſlated <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the <hi>whole creation,</hi> are to be found in all the ſcriptures.</p>
               <p n="2">II. WE are to inquire into the meaning of the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, "manifeſtation of the ſons of God."—Theſe words,
<q>The earneſt expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifeſtation of the ſons of God;</q>
are thus paraphraſed by Dr. C.
<q>The creature, the rational creature, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, waits for the time when it ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, that they are the ſons of God.</q>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 92.</note> He here takes it for granted, that the word <hi>creature</hi> means <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi> Whether this be a ſuppoſition juſtly founded, is now ſubmitted to the reader who has peruſed what has been offered on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="unknown:022478_0192_0FB93334F4E91310"/>BUT even on the ſuppoſition that the <hi>creature</hi> does mean <hi>mankind,</hi> how ſtrange it is that the waiting of this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the manifeſtation of the ſons of God, ſhould mean that this creature is waiting to be <hi>itſelf</hi> manifeſted to be the ſons of God! Would it not be ſtrange arguing, to ſay, that becauſe the Jews waited for the manifeſtation of the Meſſiah, therefore they waited to have it manifeſted, that they were the Meſſiah! or that becauſe Simeon wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the manifeſtation of the conſolation of Iſrael; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he waited to have it made apparent, that he was the conſolation of Iſrael! Yet either of theſe expreſſions as naturally imports the ſenſe which I have now given, as the expreſſion, <hi>the creature waiteth</hi> for the manifeſtation of the ſons of God, imports, that the "creature" or race of creatures. is waiting to have it
<q>revealed that they are the ſons of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. THE meaning of the word "vanity" next requires our attention.—By this word Dr. C. underſtands
<q>
                     <hi>mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and all other unavoidable <hi>unhappineſs</hi> and <hi>imperfection</hi> of this preſent weak, frail, mortal ſtate.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 104.</note> Again, "mankind were ſubjected to vanity or <hi>mortality.</hi>"<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 106.</note>
                  <q>God ſubjected mankind to vanity, i. e. the <hi>infelicities</hi> of this life.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> According to Dr. C. then, the vanity here ſpoken of is a <hi>natural</hi> evil. But it may at leaſt be made a queſtion, whether he be not miſtaken, and whether it be not a <hi>moral</hi> evil. The ſame word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is uſed twice more in the New Teſtament; Eph. IV. 17;
<q>That ye henceforth walk, not as other gentiles walk in the <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of their mind, having the underſtanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God,</q>
 and 2 Pet. II. 18,
<q>For when they ſpeak great ſwelling words of <hi>vanity.</hi>
                  </q>
In theſe two, the only inſtances of its uſe in the New Teſtament, beſide the text under conſideration, it manifeſtly means not a natural but a moral evil, either poſitive wickedneſs or at leaſt a ſinful deficiency. Is not this a ground of preſumption at leaſt, that alſo in Rom. VIII. 20, it means a moral evil?</p>
               <p>IN the ſame ſenſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
the adjective from which <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
is derived, is uſed Jam. I. 26,
<q>This man's religion is vain:</q>
and 1 Pet. I. 18;
<q>Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things—from your <hi>vain</hi> converſation.</q>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
is alſo uſed in the ſame ſenſe, Rom. I. 21;
<q>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:022478_0193_0FB9333674D446D8"/>
                     <hi>vain</hi> in their imaginations and their fooliſh heart was darkened.</q>
                  <hi>Vain</hi> and <hi>vanity</hi> in none of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſignify "mortality" or "infelicity;" but either poſitive ſin or ſinful deficiency.</p>
               <p>BESIDES; the very nature of the caſe ſhows, that vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this inſtance was not uſed by the apoſtle, in Dr. C's ſenſe. According to his ſenſe of <hi>vanity,</hi> the apoſtle under the influence of the Holy Ghoſt, advances this propoſition; The human race was made ſubject to
<q>mortality, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable unhappineſs and imperfection,</q>
not willingly. But who ever ſuppoſed that the human race was made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to theſe things willingly? or that any man, or any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent being, ever choſe to be ſubject to mortality and unhappineſs? This is a propoſition too inſignificant to be advanced by ſo ſenſible and grave a writer as Paul, and under the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt too.—The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſeems to have been aware of this objection to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>vanity,</hi> and therefore ſuppoſes the word <hi>willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> means, not what is naturally underſtood by it, <hi>a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary conſent of the heart</hi>; but that it means,
<q>through ſome fault,</q>
"by a criminal choice." Therefore</p>
               <p n="4">IV. WE are to inquire into the meaning of the word <hi>willingly.</hi>—Is it not at firſt bluſh a little extraordinary, that willingneſs muſt certainly mean a fault, a criminal choice? Suppoſe an hiſtorian ſhould ſay, that <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> and others who were executed at the reſtoration of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, were executed not <hi>willingly</hi>; muſt we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him to mean, that they were not executed in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of any fault of their own?—The original word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
is uſed once more only in all the New Teſtament, I Cor. IX. 17, "If I do this thing" (i. e. preach the goſpel)
<q>
                     <hi>willingly,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, I have a reward: but if <hi>againſt my will,</hi>

                     </gap>, a diſpenſation of the goſpel is committed unto me.</q>
According to Dr. C's conſtruction of <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly</hi> in Rom. VIII, the meaning of the apoſtle is, If I preach the goſpel "through ſome fault of my own," or "by my own criminal choice," I have a reward; but if I do it without any fault or criminal choice of my own, a diſpenſation of the goſpel is committed unto me.</p>
               <p>

                  </gap>, and of the ſame ſignification, is in the New Teſtament uſed in Philem. 14, only;
<q>That thy benefit ſhould not be of neceſſity, but <hi>willingly:</hi>
                  </q>
which I preſume even Dr. C. would not expound thus;
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:022478_0194_0FB93337F5B874E8"/>
That thy benefit ſhould not be of neceſſity, but through ſome fault of thine own.—The adverb, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is uſed twice in the New Teſtament, Heb. X. 26;
<q>If we ſin <hi>willfully,</hi> after we have received the knowledge of the truth:</q>
and 1 Pet. V. 2,
<q>Taking the overſight thereof, not by conſtraint but <hi>willingly.</hi>
                  </q>
To the firſt of theſe the Doctor in a quotation from <hi>Taylor,</hi> refers, as an authority, to confirm his ſenſe of <hi>willingly</hi> in Rom. VIII. But ſurely both he and Taylor made this reference with little conſideration; for according to them the ſenſe of the verſe in Hebrews is this; If after we have received the knowledge of the truth, we ſin
<q>through our own fault,</q>
or "by our own criminal choice." Did Dr. C. or Dr. T. indeed believe, that we ever ſin without any fault of our own, or without our own criminal choice? —It is plain, that the meaning of Heb. X. 26, is what is well expreſſed in the tranſlation; If we ſin <hi>wilfully,</hi> not through ſome inattention, but pertinaciouſly, after we know the truth, know our duty and the proper motives to it; there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin.</p>
               <p>THUS the conſtruction, which Dr. C. gives of <hi>willingly,</hi> as meaning, "through our own fault," or
<q>by our own criminal choice,</q>
appears to be wholly unſupported by any authority; to be a mere invention to help over the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of the ſuppoſition, that the inſpired apoſtle ſhould advance ſo trifling a propoſition as this; that mankind do not chooſe miſery: and alſo appears to be attended with many abſurdities.</p>
               <p>THE error of that conſtruction further appears from this, that if what comes upon us not through our own fault, be properly expreſſed by ſaying, that we are ſubjected to it, <hi>not willingly</hi>; then what does come upon us through our own fault, may be properly expreſſed, by ſaying, it comes upon us <hi>willingly.</hi> At this rate the inhabitants of the old world were drowned <hi>willingly</hi>: Sodom and Gomorrah were burnt up <hi>willingly</hi>: Pharaoh was firſt plagued, and then deſtroyed in the Red Sea <hi>willingly</hi>: Korah, Dathan and Abiram were ſwallowed up in the earth <hi>willingly</hi>: Thoſe whom Dr. C ſuppoſes to be puniſhed in hell for ages of ages, are puniſhed <hi>willingly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NEITHER is it true, in Dr. C's ſenſe, that mankind are made ſubject to vanity, <hi>not willingly</hi>: i. e.
<q>Not through any fault of theirs;</q>
                  <q>not by their own criminal

—By <hi>vanity</hi> he underſtands "mortality," "and the infelicities of this vain mortal life," There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to him, men are not made ſubject to morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the infelicities of this life, through any fault of their own. And if ſo, then death and the various infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of life are not any evidence, that the ſubjects of death and thoſe infelicities are themſelves ſinners, or the objects of God's diſpleaſure. But this is contrary to the whole current of ſcriptural repreſentations; particularly to Pſ. XC. 3, &amp;c.
<q>Thou turneſt man to deſtruction, and ſayeſt, Return ye children of men.—Thou carrieſt them away, as with a flood; they are as a ſleep. In the morning they are like graſs, which groweth up; in the evening it is cut down and withereth. For they are conſumed <hi>by thine anger,</hi> and by thy <hi>wrath</hi> they are troubled. Thou haſt ſet our <hi>iniquities</hi> before thee, our ſecret <hi>ſins</hi> in the light of thy countenance. For our days are paſſed away in thy <hi>wrath</hi>: we ſpend our days as a tale that is told. The days of our years are threeſcore years and ten; and if by reaſon of ſtrength they be fourſcore years, yet is their ſtrength labour and ſorrow: for it is ſoon cut off, and we fly away. Who knoweth the power of thine <hi>anger,</hi> according to thy fear, ſo is thy <hi>wrath.</hi> So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts to wiſdom.</q>
                  <q>How plain and full is this teſtimony, that the general morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mankind is an evidence of God's <hi>anger for the ſin</hi> of thoſe, who are the ſubjects of ſuch a diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</q>

               <p>BUT if mortality and the calamities of life be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God's anger at the ſin of thoſe, who ſuffer death and thoſe calamities; then it is not true, that men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral are ſubjected to death and thoſe calamities, without any fault of their own; but the truth is, that they are ſubjected to them on account of their own ſin, as this is the very cauſe of the divine anger, of which calamity and death are the effects and tokens.</p>

So that according to this, the ſenſe of the apoſtle will be, That the human race was put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſentence of mortality, without any fault of their own; yet this ſentence was never to be executed, but on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their own fault. And the conſideration that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are put under the ſentence of mortality, without any fault of their own, is a ground of hope, that they will be delivered from that ſentence of mortality.

                  </gap>
means, as Dr. C. ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 105.</note> by or through him, who ſubjected it; implies this further abſurdity, that the act, by which the creature was made ſubject to vanity, was by him who ſubjected it; or that act was really the act of him whoſe act it was; that he who ſubjected the creature to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, really did ſubject it to vanity.—But who will dare to impute ſuch identical propoſitions to the inſpired apoſtle?</p>
               <p n="5">V. WE at length come to conſider Dr. C's ſenſe of the phraſe <hi>bondage of corruption.</hi>—This according to him is
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:022478_0197_0FB9333E275D0AA8"/>
ſynonymous with <hi>vanity</hi>: Therefore the ſame obſervations for ſubſtance, which were made concerning his ſenſe of <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> are applicable to his ſenſe of <hi>the bondage of corruption.</hi> But a few things in particular are worthy of remark. Dr. C. ſays, that in conſequence of the ſubjection of man
<q>to a frail, mortal, corruptible condition—he is upon the foot of <hi>mere law,</hi> and without the ſuppoſition of <hi>grace</hi> or <hi>goſpel,</hi> in bondage to bodily or animal appetites and inclinations.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 109.</note>
                  </q>
It ſeems then, that ſince all chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed nations are under not <hi>mere law,</hi> but <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>goſpel,</hi> they are not in bondage to bodily or animal appetites and inclinations, and doubtleſs for the ſame reaſon, are not in bondage to any principle of depravity. But is this indeed ſo, that men under <hi>mere law</hi> are ſo depraved, as to be in bondage to animal appetites; but as ſoon as they are placed under the goſpel, in the mere external diſpenſation of it, they are no longer the ſubjects of any depravity? It ſeems then, that the natural depravity of men depends on their mere external circumſtances; that while they are without the goſpel their hearts are in bondage to animal appetites: but as ſoon as they are placed under the goſpel, however they diſregard it, they are free from that bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. But all thoſe nations, to whom Chriſtianity is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, are under the goſpel; therefore they are already free from bondage to animal appetites; and it is abſurd for them to <hi>hope,</hi> that they <hi>ſhall</hi> be delivered from this part of the bondage of corruption.</p>
               <p>BESIDE; Dr. C. ſays, that
<q>both theſe ſenſes of bondage</q>
[i. e. bondage to death and bondage to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal apetites]
<q>are certainly included in that vanity the creature is ſubjected to.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> Then by the creature Dr. C. muſt mean, not the whole moral creation, or all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind including thoſe nations and individuals to whom the goſpel is made known: becauſe they are not under <hi>mere law,</hi> and therefore according to him are not ſubjected to that part of vanity which conſiſts in bondage to animal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites. Yet he abundantly holds, that all men are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to <hi>vanity,</hi> which certainly includes, according to him, bondage to animal appetites.</p>
               <p>ACCORDING to Dr. C. vanity includes bondage to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily or animal appetites. Yet mankind are ſubjected to vanity not through any fault or crime of their own. But
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:022478_0198_0FB9334076B591C8"/>
is it not a fault or crime in any man, to be governed by his bodily appetites, or to be in bondage to them? With what truth or conſiſtency then could he hold, that men are ſubjected to vanity not through any fault or crime of their own, and that therefore their ſubjection to vanity is a ground of hope of deliverance from it; when the very ſtate of ſubjection to vanity is a very great fault or crime? Can a fault or crime be a ground of hope of impunity, or of the divine favour?</p>
               <p>BUT perhaps it may be pleaded, that though the <hi>ſtate</hi> of ſubjection, or the being ſubject to vanity, implies a fault; yet the <hi>act of ſubjecting,</hi> or the act by which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were ſubjected, to vanity, is not through, or on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any previous fault of mankind in general; and this is the ground of hope that they ſhall be delivered. If this be the meaning of Dr. C. it comes to this. That becauſe mankind are, in conſequence of Adam's ſin, not their own perſonal ſin, ſubjected by God to frailty, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, bodily appetites and ſin; therefore they do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be left without hope of deliverance: the divine perfections do not admit of it: it would not be juſt: at leaſt it would be a hard caſe. Otherwiſe where is the ground of hope of deliverance? No promiſe is pleaded as the ground of this hope. The only pretended ground of hope in this argument is, that mankind were ſubjected to vanity, not through any fault of their own: as in the following paſſage;
<q>For if mankind were ſubjected to a ſtate of ſuffering, not through any wilful diſobedience which they themſelves had been perſonally guilty of, it is congruous to reaſon to think, that they ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to it not finally—but with room for hope that they ſhould be delivered from it: and was it not for this hope, it cannot be ſuppoſed—it would be a reflection on the—benevolence of the Deity to ſuppoſe, that they would have been ſubjected to it.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 102.</note> But if this ſubjection to vanity by God be perfectly juſt, what right have we to expect, that God will deliver <hi>all</hi> men from the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it? Have we a right, without a divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to expect, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> God will ſuffer none of the ſinful race of men, to bear the conſequences of a juſt and wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution? And would it be a reflection on the Deity, not to expect this?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="unknown:022478_0199_0FB92ECDABCE9980"/>SO that this whole argument of Dr. C. implies that God in ſubjecting mankind, on account of Adam's ſin, "to a ſtate of ſuffering," made an unjuſt conſtitution. Yet Dr. C. himſelf abundantly holds, that this is a real conſtitution of God.</p>
               <p>AT the ſame time, it is implied in all this, that if man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had been thus ſubjected to vanity, in conſequence of their own perſonal ſin; they might juſtly have been left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope. Thus it is really granted by Dr. C. after all his labour to prove the contrary, that the perſonal ſins of men, deſerve a hopeleſs ſtate of ſuffering. And the whole queſtion in the preſent view of it, comes to this, Whether the perſonal actual ſins of mankind, under the preſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine conſtitution, be real ſins, and deſerve the puniſhment juſtly due to ſin: or whether theſe ſins be not excuſable, becauſe they are the eſtabliſhed conſequence of Adam's tranſgreſſion, and not the conſequence of their own volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary act. Or in other words, whether the moral evil of any action conſiſt in the nature of the action itſelf, or in its cauſe or antecedents. Of this queſtion I ſhould be very willing to enter into the diſcuſſion, were it neceſſary: but as it has been ſo particularly conſidered by another author, I beg leave to refer to him.<note n="*" place="bottom">Preſident <hi>Edwards's</hi> Enquiry into Freedom of Will throughout; particularly Part IV. Sect. I.</note> I beg the reader's patience however, while I make only one or two brief obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>IF the preſent actions of mankind be excuſable, becauſe they are the conſequence of Adam's tranſgreſſion and not of their own previous ſinful actions or volitions, in the firſt inſtance; it will follow that there is no ſin or moral evil in the world, nor ever has been. All the preſent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, if they be excuſable, are no moral evil. The ſame is true of all the actions of men ever ſince the fall of Adam. And even Adam's tranſgreſſion itſelf is no moral evil; for this did not take place in conſequence of any previous criminal choice or action; becauſe by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that tranſgreſſion was the firſt ſin committed by man. Whatever tranſgreſſion he firſt committed, is the very tranſgreſſion of which we are ſpeaking: and it is abſurd to talk of a ſin previous to the firſt ſin.</p>
               <p>CONCERNING Dr. C's idea, that mankind are ſubjected to mortality, infirmity, and the influence of bodily appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:022478_0200_0FB92ED0AF039948"/>
on account of Adam's ſin only, without any regard to their perſonal ſins; and that this ſubjection was the cauſe and occaſion of all the actual tranſgreſſions and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral calamities of the poſterity of Adam; it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT for reaſons already given,<note n="*" place="bottom">See page 190.</note> it appears not to be true, that mortality and the calamities of life are brought on men on account of Adam's ſin merely, without regard to the perſonal demerit of thoſe who ſuffer them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THAT the human race was indeed, in the ſentence of God on Adam, ſubjected to infirmity and mortality: but it was no more ſubjected to theſe, than it was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity and ſin. At leaſt to aſſert the contrary would be to beg an important point in diſpute: and to be ſure, Dr. C. could not with any conſiſtency aſſert the contrary. He holds throughout this, and all his other works, that the human race is ſubjected to infirmity on account of Adam's ſin, and the Doctor's idea of this infirmity amounts to a proper moral depravity of nature. All that is meant, or that needs to be meant, by the moral depravity natural to mankind, in this fallen ſtate, ſo far as that depravity is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from <hi>actual</hi> ſin, is ſomething in our nature, which uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally leads to actual ſin. Whether this ſomething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt primarily in the body and bodily appetites, or primarily in the ſoul, is perfectly immaterial, ſo long as it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing ſource of actual ſin, as Dr. C. manifeſtly conſiders it.<note n="†" place="bottom">See page 45, &amp;c.</note> In his <hi>Five Diſſertations</hi> he is very explicit and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in this matter. His words are,
<q>In conſequence of the operation of appetites and inclinations ſeated in our mortal bodies, we <hi>certainly ſhall,</hi> without the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of grace—do that—the doing of which will deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate us the <hi>captives of ſin</hi> and the <hi>ſervants of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> and in many other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages to the ſame effect.—So that Dr. C. really, though it ſeems undeſignedly, held, that moral depravity of nature comes upon all mankind, on account of Adam's ſin: and his favourite conſtruction of Rom. V. 12;
<q>And ſo death paſſed upon all men, <hi>for that</hi>
                  </q>
(or as he will have it, <hi>whereupon, in conſequence of which</hi>) "all have ſinned;"
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:022478_0201_0FB92ED22A958128"/>
comes to this only; that on account of Adam's ſin, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſentence was denounced on the whole human race, dooming it to a ſtate of moral depravity; in conſequence of which moral depravity all men commit actual ſin. What then has the Doctor gained by the conſtruction of this paſſage, which he has laboured ſo hardly in this and his other works to eſtabliſh; and in which he claims to be an original; and which perhaps is the only particular in his whole book, with reſpect to which he has a right to ſet up this claim? It is alſo curious to ſee a gentleman of Dr. C's abilities, both oppoſing and defending with all his might, the native moral depravity of human nature!</p>
               <p>REASONS have been already given, why <hi>willingly</hi> ought to be underſtood not to mean <hi>through the fault of a perſon</hi>; but in its original proper ſenſe, <hi>with the conſent of a perſon.</hi> If thoſe reaſons be ſufficient, there is a further difficulty in Dr. C's conſtruction of this paſſage, eſpecially of the 20th verſe. According to his conſtruction of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> the apoſtle declares, that mankind are ſubject to their bodily appetites, and ſo to ſin, not willingly, not with their own conſent. But is it poſſible, that men ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to bodily appetites, and ſhould commit actual, perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſin, without their own conſent?—If, to evade this obſervation, it be ſaid, that they are however by the act of God, without any previous conſent of their own, ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to frailty, mortality, bodily appetites, and ſo to ſin; this would be mere trifling. Who ever imagined, that God firſt waited for the conſent of mankind, and having obtained their conſent, eſtabliſhed the conſtitution, by which they became mortal, frail, ſubject to the influence of their bodily appetites and ſo to ſin?</p>
               <p>AFTER all, Dr. C's expoſition of this paragraph in Rom. VIII, is by no means, even on his own principles, a proof of univerſal ſalvation. His tranſlation of thoſe moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant words in the 20th and 21ſt verſes, is this,
<q>The creature was ſubjected to vanity, not willingly; but by the judicial ſentence of him, who ſubjected it, <hi>in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a previous hope,</hi> that even this very creature ſhould be delivered from its ſlavery of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</q>
So that the utmoſt, which this paſſage teaches, according to his own account, is, that mankind may now <hi>hope,</hi> that they ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:022478_0202_0FB92ED5A4F0E8C0"/>
glorious liberty of the children of God. But what if there be a foundation to <hi>hope</hi> that this will be the caſe? Does it thence follow, that this hope will certainly be fulfilled? In conſequence of the death of Chriſt and the proclamation of the goſpel, there is a door of hope ſet open to all men. But does it hence follow, that all men will certainly enter in at this door, and ſecure the bleſſings for which there is a foundation to hope? D. C. would doubtleſs grant, that there is a door of <hi>hope</hi> opened to mankind in general, that they may be ſaved immediately after death. Yet he would not pretend, that this hope is realized. God delivered the Iſraelites out of Egypt in ſuch a manner, as gave <hi>hope</hi> that even that generation would enter the promiſed land. Yet this hope was not fulfilled.—Therefore, though it ſhould be granted, that God hath ſubjected mankind to vanity <hi>in hope,</hi> that they ſhall be delivered from it, into the glorious liberty of the children of God, it would by no means follow, that all men will be ſaved: and Dr. C. is entirely miſtaken, when he ſays,
<q>Mankind univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is expreſſly made, in the 21ſt verſe, the ſubject of this glorious immortality.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 102.</note> No ſuch thing is expreſſly ſaid, and in theſe words he contradicts his own paraphraſe of that verſe, in which he pretends no more, than that there is a foundation for <hi>hope,</hi> that mankind ſhall attain to a glorious immortality.</p>
               <p>IN the preceding remarks on Dr. C's conſtruction of this paſſage, the ſenſe, which I ſuppoſe to be the true one, hath been ſufficiently expreſſed. Yet it may be proper here briefly to repeat it.—The earneſt expectation of the creation waiteth for the manifeſtation of the ſons of God. For the creation is ſubject to that uſe to which it is applied by ſinful men, which, as to the end of its exiſtence, the divine glory, is in its own natural tendency, vain and unprofitable, and in many reſpects poſitively ſinful; I ſay, to this it is ſubject not voluntarily, but on account of him, for the ſake of his glory, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
governing the accuſative) or for the accompliſhment of the myſterious, but wiſe and glorious purpoſes of him, who ſubjected the ſame in hope, that this ſame creation ſhall be delivered from this unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and ſinful uſe, which may juſtly be conſidered as a ſtate of bondage to it, into a liberty, in ſeveral important reſpects, ſimilar to that of the children of God; or at
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:022478_0203_0FB92ED6B10DD0C8"/>
leaſt ſhall be delivered at the time, when the children of God ſhall be admitted to the enjoyment of their moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty. For we know, that the whole creation groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and travaileth in pain together until now, by reaſon of that vile abuſe and perverſion, which is made of it by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, and through deſire of that deliverance juſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and in due time to be granted it.</p>
               <p>BESIDE the obſervations on particular parts of Dr. C's conſtruction of Rom. VIII. ſome more general remarks occur.—One is, that his conſtruction implies, that the divine law is unjuſt, and cannot be executed conſiſtently with juſtice. He ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 109.</note> that man on the foot of <hi>mere law,</hi> without grace, is in bondage to bodily appetites: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on the foot of mere law, without grace, there is no hope for him. And he ſpeaks<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 122.</note> of the caſe of mankind as remedileſs, without the grace manifeſted in Jeſus Chriſt. Yet in the ſame page he ſays,
<q>It is the thought, that mankind were ſubjected to ſuffering, not remedileſſly, but with an intention of mercy,</q>
and
<q>it is this thought only, that can reconcile the unavoidable ſufferings of the race of men, as occaſioned by the lapſe of Adam, with the perfections of God.</q>
So that God made a law, which could not be executed, conſiſtently with his perfections, and he was obligated in juſtice to ſhew mercy through Chriſt, to mankind. By mere law men were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs, and if they had been ſuffered to remain in that remedileſs ſtate, as they would have remained in it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt and the goſpel, ſuch a diſpenſation could not have been reconciled with the perfections of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the divine law cannot be reconciled with juſtice, or with the perfections of God.</p>
               <p>ACCORDING to Dr. C. vanity included in it <hi>bondage</hi> to bodily appetites, as well as <hi>bondage</hi> to death.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 109.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as God could not conſiſtently with his perfections, ſubject mankind to vanity, without an intention of mercy;<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 122.</note> and as it would be a reflection on the Deity, to ſuppoſe, that he has ſubjected mankind to vanity, without hope of deliverance:<note n="‖‖" place="bottom">P. 103.</note> therefore on theſe principles, God could not conſiſtently with his perfections and character, avoid giving mankind a ground of hope of deliverance from ſin, or he could not withhold the grace of the goſpel: but he was obliged in juſtice to his own character, to deliver men
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:022478_0204_0FB92EDC27F83D20"/>
from both ſin and the ſufferings of this life, and it may be preſumed, that Dr. C. would have conſented to add, and from the ſufferings of hell too. Where then is the grace of the goſpel, and of the gift of Chriſt? In the gift of Chriſt, in the inſtitution of the goſpel, and in every thing pertaining to it, ſo far as was neceſſary to our deliverance from ſin and puniſhment, God has done no more than was neceſſary to ſave his own character from reflections and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
               <p>IT may be further remarked, that Dr. C.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 103.</note> argues, that becauſe men are ſubjected to a ſtate of ſuffering, not through their own perſonal diſobedience;
<q>it is congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to reaſon to think, that they ſhould be ſubjected to it, not <hi>finally.</hi>
                  </q>
But why does he ſay, "not finally"? He might with the ſame ſtrength of argument have ſaid, <hi>not at all.</hi> The calamities of this life, with temporal death, are inflicted on mankind, either as a puniſhment, or as ſovereign and wiſe diſpenſations of Providence. If they be inflicted as a puniſhment, without any ſin, by which the ſubjects deſerve them, they are as real an injury as endleſs miſery would be, if it were inflicted as a puniſhment, in like manner without any ſin, by which it ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And if God do indeed injure his creatures in a leſs degree, he is an injurious being: and what ſecurity have we concerning ſuch a being, that he will not injure them in the higheſt poſſible degree?—So that if God be a juſt being, as it is agreed on all hands, that he is, it is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly "congruous to reaſon to think," that he would not ſubject his creatures to a temporary ſtate of ſuffering, as a puniſhment, without any ſin, by which they deſerved it, as that he would not ſubject them to a ſtate of final ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>IF it be ſaid, that death and the calamities of life are not a puniſhment of mankind, but mere ſovereign, wiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of providence; this ſuppoſition opens a door for endleſs miſery. For how do we know, that the ſame ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign wiſdom, which is now ſuppoſed to inflict tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evils on mankind, may not alſo ſee fit to inflict on them endleſs evils?</p>
               <p>ACCORDING to Dr. C. men are by a divine conſtitution ſubjected to vanity including mortality, infelicity and bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to bodily appetites. But why was this conſtitution
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:022478_0205_0FB92EDE3341FE78"/>
made? Was it made for the greater happineſs of every individual, or of the ſyſtem, or of both? Which ever of theſe anſwers be given, it will follow, that evil, both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and moral is ſubſervient to good; and is introduced, if not in the firſt inſtance of Adam's tranſgreſſion, yet in every other inſtance, by the poſitive deſign and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God. Evil therefore both natural and moral, makes a part of the ſcheme of God, takes place by his conſtitution, and is ſubject to his controul? What then becomes of the ſcheme of ſelf-determining power, for which Dr. C. is ſo zealous an advocate? And here how juſtly may many paſſages in Dr. C's writings be retorted? Particularly the following;
<q>If men's volitions and their conſequent effects, are the reſult of invariable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in virtue of ſome <hi>exterior cauſes</hi> ſo inviolably connected, as that they will and muſt come to paſs, the author of this connection, which according to this plan is God, is the only efficient and real author of whatever has been, or ſhall hereafter be brought into event; not excluding any of the moſt complicated vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies that have been, or may be perpetrated by any of the ſons of Adam. Is this a ſcheme of thoughts fit to be embraced by intelligent creatures?</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Benevolence of the Deity, P. 136.</note>
               </p>
               <p>BESIDE, if this conſtitution were made for the greater happineſs of every individual, then every individual is more happy than he would have been, if he had not been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to vanity; and then there is no ſuch thing as puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the ſubjection to vanity, or in any of its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; nor any foundation, with a view to the private intereſt of any man, to regret any of the evils of this life, or of that which is to come.</p>
               <p>IT does not however appear to be fact, that every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual is in this life rendered more happy, by the evils which he ſuffers here: and to ſay that he will be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them more happy on the whole hereafter, neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be fact, nor to be capable of proof. How will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man prove, that the Sodomites will on the whole be more happy, than Enoch and Elijah, who never taſted death?</p>
               <p>IF all men be ſubjected to vanity, to promote not their perſonal good, but the good of the ſyſtem, and the good of individuals be given up to this end; why may we not
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:022478_0206_0FB92EE3A865FEC8"/>
in the ſame way account for endleſs puniſhment?—If it be not conſiſtent with the divine perfections to ſubject men to ſuffering, unleſs it iſſue in their perſonal good; then it is not conſiſtent with the divine perfections to puniſh at all, either in this world, or the future.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE firſt of thoſe texts is:
<q>For it pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that in him all fullneſs ſhould dwell. And having made peace by the blood of the croſs, by him to reconcile all things unto himſelf: by him, I ſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</q>
—Dr. C's ſenſe of this paſſage is this:
<q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 127.</note>It pleaſed the Father—by Jeſus Chriſt—to change back all things to himſelf—to change the ſtate of this lower world, of the men and of the things, whether they be on earth, or in the aerial heaven, that encompaſſes it.</q>
It was his opinion, that to reconcile all theſe things, is to rechange their ſtate, or bring them back to that ſtate they were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 129.</note> With reference to mankind, he ſays,<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 132.</note>
                  <q>By Chriſt their ſtate was changed back, they were abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought back to the condition they would have been in, had it not been for the lapſe; what I mean is, that they were abſolutely and unconditionally put into ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circumſtances.</q>
—But what follows from all this; One would think Dr. C. had forgotten himſelf. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all this were granted, would it follow, that all men will be ſaved? That becauſe they are in ſalvable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, therefore their actual ſalvation will be effected? No, no more than from the original ſtate of Adam, it followed that he would never fall. He was indued with a power to ſtand: he was in ſuch circumſtances, that he might have continued in his original innocence. Yet he fell. So, though it be granted, that all men are by Chriſt put into ſalvable circumſtances, yet through their obſtinate impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and unbelief they may fail of this great ſalvation.—
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:022478_0207_0FB92EE5EF3B4F00"/>
Doubtleſs Dr. C. believed, that by Chriſt the ſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is ſo changed, that they are all ſalvable, or may be ſaved, immediately after the end of this world. But this notwithſtanding, he believed alſo, that a great part of mankind would die impenitent, and that none of <hi>them</hi> would be ſaved within a thouſand years of the end of this world, and ſome of them not till after ages of ages.</p>
               <p>BUT in aid of his argument from this paſſage, the Doctor brings in again, Rom. V. 10.
<q>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his ſon; <hi>much more</hi> being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved, by his life.</q>
I have formerly remarked on the Doctor's uſe of this paſſage; and need not repeat thoſe remarks. It may be obſerved, however, that the manner of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this paſſage to ſtrengthen his argument from Col. I. 20, really implies, that this laſt text taken by itſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains no argument at all, and therefore ought never to have been introduced as a proof. Whatever force there is in it, to prove univerſal ſalvation, depends entirely, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Dr. C's ſtating of the matter, on Rom. V. 10, which has been conſidered already.—So that if his ſenſe of Col. I. 20, be true, it does nothing towards proving the ſalvation of all men.</p>
               <p>I DO not however mean to ſuggeſt, that Dr. C's ſenſe is, in my opinion, the true one. It is impoſſible, that all things ſhould be brought back, in all reſpects, to their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſtate. All mankind cannot now live in the garden of Eden. It cannot be again fact, that all the knowledge of God poſſeſſed by men, ſhould be ſuch as is derived from either the works of creation and providence, or from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate intercourſe of God and angels with men. Nor can it be ever again true, that God is propitious to men immediately, without a mediator. In theſe, and perhaps many other reſpects, mankind cannot be changed back to their original ſtate. But if once the advocates for univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſalvation admit of limitations, and ſay, that all things will however be brought to their original ſtate in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, the believers in endleſs puniſhment too muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to apply their limitations; and they will allow, that as the original ſtate was a ſtate of order, regularity and due ſubordination, wherein every perſon and thing were in their proper places; ſo in this ſenſe all things will final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:022478_0208_0FB92EE7423746A8"/>
be brought back to their original ſtate, and order will be again reſtored to the univerſe.</p>
               <p>NOR does the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
ſignify in general to change any thing back to its former ſtate. For inſtance, if two men had been long and habitual enemies to each other; and if having for a while become friends, they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their former enmity; I believe no critic in the Greek language would think this return to their enmity, would be properly expreſſed by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>reconcile.</hi> When the Jews were brought home from the Babyloniſh captivity, they were changed back to their former ſtate. But is this change ever expreſſed by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>reconcile</hi>?</p>
               <p>THIS verb is never uſed in the New Teſtament, but to ſignify a change, whereby thoſe who were at enmity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come friends. This obſervation is true of all thoſe words of the ſame derivation, on which Dr, C. criticiſes ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly from page 128, to 142. It is therefore not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to <hi>all</hi> the things on this earth, and in the aerial hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, unleſs it be by the figure <hi>proſopopoeia.</hi> By that figure indeed every thing animate and inanimate may be ſaid to be alienated from man, in conſequence of his ſin; and to be reconciled to him in conſequence of the blood of the croſs, and of the return of man to God through Chriſt. But if this were the idea of Dr. C. he ſhould have given up his objection to the ſenſe of Rom. VIII. 19, &amp;c, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the believers in endleſs puniſhment; and at the ſame time he would have virtually given up his own ſenſe of that paſſage.</p>
               <p>IT is ſtrange, that Dr. C. as well as the tranſlators of the bible, ſhould render the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now it ſeems very odd, that in this multiplied uſe of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
in its various caſes, one inſtance only ſhould be ſelected from the reſt, and rendered <hi>himſelf,</hi> meaning the Father, and in all the other inſtances it ſhould be referred to Chriſt. No perſon without prepoſſeſſion, conſtruing this paſſage, would render it in that manner. It is altogether unnatural to ſuppoſe, but that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
refers to the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in all theſe inſtances, and ought to be rendered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>IT is further to be obſerved concerning <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that in all inſtances in which they occur in
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:022478_0209_0FB92EE8AAAE1620"/>
the New Teſtament, in the Septuagint and in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha, the perſon to whom the ſubject of the propoſition is ſaid to be reconciled, is never once expreſſed in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſative caſe governed by the prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; but is always expreſſed in the dative caſe. Hence it may be inferred that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
in Col. I. 20, does not mean the perſon to whom all things in heaven and earth are reconciled: but that it means, that all things in heaven and earth are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to each other, into him: i. e. ſo as to be brought into Chriſt, to be united under him as their head, and be intereſted in the common advantages and bleſſings of his glorious kingdom.</p>
               <p>TO <hi>be in Chriſt</hi> is a common phraſe of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to expreſs ſubjection to Chriſt, and an intereſt in the bleſſings of his kingdom; and <hi>to be reconciled into Chriſt,</hi> may mean to become united to him by faith, to become ſubject to him in obedience, and to be intereſted in all the bleſſings of his kingdom.<note n="*" place="bottom">Whether this criticiſm on the words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, be juſt or not, it affects not the main queſtion of the ſalvation of all men.</note>
               </p>
               <p>BY ſin angels and men, Jews and Gentiles, became alienated from each other; and men in general, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy of ſelf-love, became virtually enemies to each other. Now it pleaſed the Father to reconcile by Jeſus Chriſt, angels and men, Jews and Gentiles to each other, and to diffuſe by his grace a ſpirit of benevolence among them, whereby they ſhould love their neighbour as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And as to the univerſal term <hi>all things,</hi> we cannot take it in its literal and utmoſt extent, unleſs by the figure before mentioned, which Dr. C. cannot admit, without giving up what he moſt earneſtly contends for, in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on Rom. VIII. 19, &amp;c. But if we once admit a limitation of that univerſal term, every one muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to propoſe his own limitation, and ſome doubtleſs will inſiſt, that it extends to angels and to believers only from among men: as it is ſaid, that <hi>all</hi> Judea, and <hi>all</hi> the region round about Jordan, were batized by John: <hi>all</hi> men counted John that he was a prophet: <hi>all</hi> men came to Chriſt, John III. 26.</p>
               <p>BUT if we ſhould allow, that <hi>all</hi> things in heaven and earth include all mankind; ſtill even in this extent it is
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:022478_0210_0FB92EEE62D21BB8"/>
true, that it pleaſed the Father to reconcile all things; but in ſuch a ſenſe, as not to imply the ſalvation of all men. This is true in the ſame ſenſe, in which God hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of the wicked, Ezek. XXXIII. 11; or in the death of him that dieth, Chap. XVIII. 32; in the ſame ſenſe in which God was unwilling to give up Eph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raim, Hoſ. XI. 8; and in the ſame ſenſe in which Chriſt was unwilling to give up the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, and would have gathered them together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings; though they would not.— The deſtruction of the ſinner is not in itſelf agreeable to God; as the puniſhment of a child is not in itſelf agreeable to a good parent. Yet as a good parent may, to ſecure the general good of his family, puniſh a diſobedient child; ſo God, to ſecure the general good of his kingdom, may puniſh a rebellious creature. As the good parent who, to prevent that puniſhment to which his diſobedient and apoſtate child muſt, going on in his diſobedience, be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, uſes all proper means to reclaim him; may be ſaid to be pleaſed with the idea of his impunity; ſo the Deity who uſes all proper means to reclaim all mankind, and to reconcile them to one another, may be ſaid to be well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the idea of this reconciliation, or to chooſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile all men to one another, and to bring them into Chriſt. In itſelf it is the object of his choice and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency.—In this ſenſe it pleaſed the Father to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile all things: it was what pleaſed him.</p>
               <p>ON the whole it appears, that if Dr. C's ſenſe of this paſſage be the true one, it affords no proof at all of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſalvation;—That his conſtruction of it is far leſs favourable to that doctrine, than that which ſeems to be holden forth by our tranſlation;—That if this laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction be adopted, ſtill it would be no real proof of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſalvation, for two reaſons; (1) That the univerſal term muſt be limited, and therefore may be ſo limited as to comprehend angels and believers only of all nations. (2) That even if the univerſal term be extended to all mankind, ſtill the text is capable of a conſtruction both rational and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogous to other paſſages of ſcripture, which yet does by no means imply univerſal ſalvation. And the ſequel of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le's diſcourſe favours this laſt conſtruction, implying, that it pleaſed the father, or was in itſelf pleaſing to the father, to reconcile all men, <hi>on the terms of the goſpel,</hi> and not <hi>abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="unknown:022478_0211_0FB92EF0EFE5F298"/>
as Dr. C. ſuppoſes. The ſequel is,
<q>And you that were ſometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled—to preſent you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his ſight: if ye continue in the faith grounded and ſettled, and be not moved away from the hope of the goſpel.</q>
—Will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man pretend, but that this implies, that if they did not continue in the faith, they would not be preſented unblam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the ſight of God?—But this is far from the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which teaches, that all mankind, whether believers or unbelievers, whether they continue in the faith or not, ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>BEFORE I quit this part of the Doctor's book, I ſhall add one remark more. In his comment on this, Col. I. 20, and on Rom, V. 10, he takes great pains to make out a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reconciliation to be taught by the apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  <q>The one, he ſays, means that change of ſtate all men are abſolutely brought into by the death of Chriſt; and is oppoſed to the condemnation through the lapſe of the one man Adam. The other is that change of ſtate, which is connected with an actual meetneſs for, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent intereſt in, eternal life.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 135.</note>
                  </q>
But theſe two reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations are really but one; for the definition which the Doctor himſelf gives of the latter, perfectly agrees with the former. He abundantly holds, that
<q>that change of ſtate, into which all men are brought by the death of Chriſt,</q>
                  <q>is connected with an actual meetneſs for, and preſent intereſt in, eternal life;</q>
and his whole ſcheme implies this: otherwiſe there is no certainty, that all men will be ſaved, in conſequence of the death of Chriſt. The Doctor himſelf, in the very next ſentence to that juſt quoted, allows, that the former reconciliation is <hi>connected</hi> in the ſcheme of God, with the latter, and <hi>will finally iſſue in it.</hi> Now, if his firſt kind of reconciliation be connected with that kind, which is connected with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual meetneſs for, and preſent intereſt in, eternal life: then that firſt kind of reconciliation is itſelf connected with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual meetneſs for, and preſent intereſt in, eternal life. If Jacob be connected with Iſaac, and Iſaac be connected with Abraham, then Jacob too is connected with Abraham.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="unknown:022478_0212_0FB92EF26B4F0558"/>LET us now attend to the Doctor's argument from Eph. I. 10:
<q>That in the diſpenſation of the fullneſs of times, he might gather together in one, all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.</q>
—On this text the Doctor ſays,
<q>By means of the lapſe, and what has been conſequent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, all things in heaven and on earth, were got into a broken, diſjointed, diſorderly ſtate; and the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God to reduce them from their preſent ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, diſorderly ſtate, into one duly-ſubjected and well ſubordinated whole, may very fitly be ſignified by the phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to gather together in one all things. And this I take to be the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended here.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 144.</note> But what is this to the purpoſe of the ſalvation of all men? It is granted on all hands, that by the lapſe, all things relating to men, got into a broken, disjointed, diſorderly ſtate; and that it is the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God to reduce them from their preſent ſeparated, diſorderly ſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into one duly-ſubjected, well ſubordinated whole, under Chriſt as their head; and that this is the thing intended by the apoſtle in this paſſage. But if the Doctor ſuppoſed, that this implied the repentance and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all men, it was but a mere ſuppoſition without proof.</p>
               <p>SUPPOSE a rebellion be excited in the kingdom of a moſt wiſe and good prince, and this rebellion extend far and wide, ſo as to throw the whole kingdom into confuſion. At length the king's ſon, at the head of his armies, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues the rebels, pardons the generality, ſentences the leaders, ſome to the gallows, others to perpetual impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and thus reſtores peace, tranquility, good order and government. Is not a well ſubjected and duly ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinated ſtate of things in that kingdom now reſtored and eſtabliſhed, although thoſe rebels who are confined in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſtill retain their rebellious tempers, and are not in a ſtate of happineſs?</p>
               <p>NOR does Dr. C. pretend to point out how a well ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinated ſtate of things proves the ſalvation of all men; unleſs it be in the following and other paſſages not more concluſive:
<q>If God created all men—by Jeſus Chriſt, we may eaſily collect hence, how he comes to be their common Father—and if they are his children, how fit, proper and reaſonable it is, that they ſhould be fellow
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:022478_0213_0FB92EF5E66A0BA0"/>
heirs to, and joint partakers in, that happy ſtate, which he has propoſed ſhall take place,</q>
&amp;c.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 160.</note> It ſeems then that Eph. I. 10, proves that all men will be ſaved, not by any thing contained in the text itſelf, but becauſe all men are the creatures of God. The argument is this: All men are the creatures of God, therefore that well ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and duly ſubordinated ſtate of things, which is to be effected by Jeſus Chriſt, implies the ſalvation of all men. It ſeems then that that well ſubjected and duly ſubordinated ſtate of things, does not of itſelf imply the final ſalvation of all men, and therefore this text is introduced with no force of argument. Dr. C. might have argued juſt as forcibly thus, All men are the creatures of God, therefore all men will be ſaved. But as to this argument it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely different from Eph. I. 10, and hath been already conſidered.</p>
               <p>WE are, in the laſt place, to attend to Dr. C's argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from 1 Tim. II. 4;
<q>Who will have all men to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</q>
— The queſtions concerning the meaning of this text, are, as Dr. C. juſtly obſerves, two; (1) Who are meant by all men; whether all men individually, or generically. (2) Is there a certain connection between God's willing, that all men ſhould be ſaved, and their actual ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. WHO are meant by <hi>all</hi> men, whether all men indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually, or generically.—Dr. C. gives two reaſons, why this expreſſion ſhould be underſtood of all men individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
               <p n="1">(1)
<q>That God's willingneſs that all men ſhould be ſaved, is brought in as an argument to enforce the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of praying for all men,</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 164.</note> mentioned in the firſt and ſecond verſes. The Doctor takes for granted, that it is our duty to pray for all men individually; and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that all men individually are thoſe, whom God wills ſhould be ſaved. But it is by no means true, that we are to pray for all men without exception. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle John expreſſly mentions a ſin unto death, and for thoſe who commit that ſin we are not to pray; 1 John V. 16, 17. Our bleſſed Saviour not only did not in fact pray for the world, but openly and in the moſt ſolemn manner avowed the omiſſion; John XVII. 9. And the prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was forbidden by God, to pray for the
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:022478_0214_0FB92EF704AE1308"/>
Jews, for their good; Jer. XIV. 11. So that when the apoſtle in the firſt verſe of the context now under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, exhorts to pray for all men, we muſt of neceſſity, as we would not ſet the ſcripture at variance with itſelf, underſtand him to mean not all individuals without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>BESIDE, if it were our duty to pray for all individuals, it may not have been the deſign of the apoſtle in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to inculcate this duty. The Jewiſh converts to chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity were full of prejudices againſt the Gentiles, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, againſt the Gentile kings, and thoſe, under whoſe authority they were; and who, in their opinion, had no right to exerciſe authority over their nation. Therefore with the utmoſt propriety does the apoſtle give the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation contained in the firſt and ſecond verſes of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, though he meant no more, than that Chriſtians ſhould pray for the Gentiles of every nation, as well as for the Jews, and eſpecially for kings and rulers among the Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) THE other reaſon given by Dr. C. why <hi>all men</hi> ſhould be underſtood of all men <hi>individually,</hi> is the reaſon given, why God deſires the ſalvation of all men, viz. that there is one God, and one mediator between God and men. "This," he ſays, "is a reaſon, which extends to all men" individually, "without limitation." Very true; and it is a reaſon, which extends to all men generically too: and therefore is a very good reaſon, why we ſhould pray for the ſalvation of men of all nations; nor is there any thing in this reaſon, which proves, that the apoſtle meant, that all men individually would be ſaved.</p>
               <p>AS to Dr. C's reaſoning in the following paſſage;<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 164.</note>
                  <q>God is as truly the God of one man, as of another; and there is therefore the ſame reaſon to think, that he ſhould be deſirous of the ſalvation of every man, as of any man;</q>
it is by no means allowed to be concluſive. It depends on this poſtulate, which is a begging of the queſtion: That God cannot give exiſtence and other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefits to a man, and not ſave him. I might with the ſame force argue thus; God is as truly the God of one man, as of another; therefore there is the ſame reaſon to think, that he ſhould be deſirous of the temporal proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of every man, as of ſome men. It is no more grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:022478_0215_0FB92EFB77D26F90"/>
and therefore ought no more to be aſſerted, without proof, that ſalvation is connected with this circumſtance, that God is a God to every man, in the ſenſe in which it is granted, that he is a God to every man, than that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proſperity is connected with that circumſtance.</p>
               <p>FURTHER, that all men individually are intended, Dr. C. argues from this, that the apoſtle ſays,
<q>There is one mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</q>
The Doctor ſays, that the man Jeſus mediates between God and men univerſally. If by the mediation of Jeſus, the Doctor meant ſuch a mediation as will certainly iſſue in the ſalvation of all men; this again is a mere humble beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the queſtion. But if he meant a mediation of the following deſcription, that Chriſt hath made atonement ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for all men; is now offering the virtue of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement to all men; and is uſing a variety of means to perſuade all men to accept and truſt in that atonement, and to return to God, ſeeking his favor and eternal life, for the ſake of Chriſt alone; it follows not at all from ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Chriſt, that all individuals will be ſaved. It no more follows, than from the facts, that God led the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites out of Egypt by the hand of a mediator; that he gave them opportunity to enter the land of promiſe; and that that mediator was the mediator of that whole gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration individually; it followed, that that whole generation individually, would certainly enter the land of promiſe.</p>
               <p>DR. C. ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 165.</note>
                  <q>No good reaſon can be aſſigned, why the man, Chriſt Jeſus, ſhould mediate between God and <hi>ſome men only, to the excluſion of others.</hi>
                  </q>
Can a good reaſon be aſſigned, why Chriſt leads to repentance in this life, ſome men only, to the excluſion or dereliction of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? When ſuch a reaſon ſhall be aſſigned, doubtleſs we ſhall be ſupplied with a reaſon, why Chriſt ſhould effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſavingly mediate in behalf of ſome men only.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THE other queſtion concerning the meaning of this text, which alſo Dr. C. notices,<note n="†" place="bottom">166</note> is, Whether there be a certain connection between God's willing in the ſenſe of this text, that all men ſhould be ſaved, and their actual ſalvation.—Dr. C. grants that men as free agents have <hi>power</hi> to oppoſe thoſe means which God uſes with them for their ſalvation; and yet holds that God has a power to
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:022478_0216_0FB92EFCF7666750"/>
counteract, in a moral way, this oppoſition of men.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 166, 167.</note> Of this and other remarkable things in Dr. C. on the ſubject of <hi>free agency,</hi> particular notice will be taken hereafter. —In the mean time it may be obſerved, that it appears from various paſſages of ſcripture, that God is frequently ſaid to <hi>will</hi> things which do not in fact come into exiſtence, or with reſpect to which his will is not efficacious: as in the following paſſages: Matt. XXIII. 37.
<q>O Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the prophets and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee; how often <hi>would I,</hi>

Deut. V. 28, 29;

               </p>
               <p>NOW what right had Dr. C. to ſuppoſe, that the <hi>will of God</hi> in 1 Tim. II. 4, is not uſed in the ſame ſenſe as in the paſſages juſt quoted? And if it be uſed in the ſame ſenſe, there is no more abſurdity in ſuppoſing that the will of God ſhould be reſiſted in the one caſe, than in the other: no more abſurdity in the ſuppoſition, that God ſhould will the ſalvation of all men, and yet all ſhould not be ſaved: than that he ſhould will to gather together the inhabitants of
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:022478_0217_0FB92F00E0F55508"/>
Jeruſalem, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings; and yet th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> they ſhould not be thus gathered.</p>
               <p>BESIDE the texts quoted above, I may further refer to Ezek. XVIII. 32;
<q>I have no pleaſure in the death of him that dieth, ſaith the Lord God.</q>
Yet his death did, by the words of this text, take place in fact. So that here is a moſt plain inſtance of an event which takes place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in ſome ſenſe, to the pleaſure or will of God.— Dr. C's reaſoning is this; Whatever God wills, will come to paſs. God wills the ſalvation of all men; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this will come to paſs. To apply this reaſoning to the text laſt quoted, it will ſtand thus; Whatever God wills, comes to paſs. But God wills the continued life of him that dieth; therefore it comes to paſs, that he who dieth, does not die.</p>
               <p>THE truth is, God wills the ſalvation of all men, in the ſame ſenſe that he wills the immediate repentance and ſanctification of all men; or as he wills them to be as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, in this life, as their heavenly Father is perfect. He now commands all men every where to repent, to believe the goſpel and to comply with the neceſſary conditions of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and complying with thoſe conditions, they ſhall be ſaved immediately after the preſent ſtate.—So that God's willing that all men ſhould be ſaved, no more proves that all men will be ſaved, than his willing that all men ſhould immediately repent, proves, that all will immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; or than his willing that all men ſhould be perfect in this world, and comply with his law as perfectly as the angels do in heaven, proves that theſe things will actually take place in this world.</p>
               <p>IT is preſumed, that Dr. C. would not have denied, that it is the will of God in ſome ſenſe, and that a proper ſenſe too, that all men be brought to repentance in this ſtate, and that they be ſaved immediately after this ſtate. Yet God does not <hi>efficaciouſly</hi> will either of theſe things. —Was it not in a proper ſenſe the will of God, that our firſt parents ſhould retain their original innocence, and not by their apoſtacy deluge the world in ſin and miſery? I preſume this will not be denied. It was his will, if it was his command. But if it was the will of God, that Adam ſhould ſtand and not fall; the will of God in this caſe was not efficacious. And if it was not efficacious to prevent the entrance of ſin into the world, how can we know, that
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:022478_0218_0FB92F02C08EB728"/>
it will be efficacious to extirpate it out of the world, or from among the human race? If God was not in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe willing that ſin and miſery ſhould enter and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominate in the world; then it ſeems, that infinite power and wiſdom were in this inſtance baffled. And if theſe divine perfections have been baffled once, they may be baffled a ſecond time, and notwithſtanding all their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, ſin and miſery may continue without end, in ſome of the human race. If on the other hand, although God commanded and in a proper ſenſe willed, that man ſhould ſtand: ſtill in another ſenſe he conſented, or willed, that he ſhould fall: in the ſame ſenſe God may conſent, that ſome men ſhall be the ſubjects of ſin and miſery to an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs duration.</p>
               <p>DR. C.
<q>readily owns, that men, as free agents, have the power of <hi>reſiſting</hi> and <hi>oppoſing</hi> thoſe means, which God from his deſire of their ſalvation, may ſee fit to uſe with them.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 166.</note> "Yet it appears" to him
<q>a groſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on that being, who is infinitely perfect, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him unable finally to <hi>counteract,</hi> and in a moral way too, the weakneſs, ſolly and obſtinacy of ſuch poor inferior creatures, as men are.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 167.</note>
                  </q>
How theſe two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which in the Doctor's book occur within a page, can be reconciled with each other; how man can have a power to reſiſt all the means which God uſes to effect his ſalvation, and at the ſame time God can have a power to counteract, in a moral way, this obſtinate reſiſtance of man, muſt certainly be ſet down among <hi>the things hard to be underſtood</hi> in Dr. C.</p>
               <p>BUT perhaps the word <hi>finally</hi> in the ſecond quotation is emphatical, and Dr. C's meaning is, that though the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of reſiſting in man cannot conſiſtently with free agency be counteracted even by God, at <hi>once,</hi> or in a <hi>ſhort time</hi>; yet it may be counteracted in a very long time. This how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will not agree with Dr. C's own language. He ſays,<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 166.</note>
                  <q>The power in men of reſiſting the means, which God from deſire of their ſalvation ſees fit to uſe with them, ought not to be overruled, nor indeed can be in conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with moral agency.</q>
Now to counteract or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule in a long time this power of reſiſting, is as really to overrule it, as to overrule it in a ſhort time. But accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Dr. C. it cannot be overruled in conſiſtency with
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:022478_0219_0FB92F045CFD8628"/>
moral agency. It ſeems then, that if the damned ſhall be finally brought to repentance by God counteracting their obſtinacy, they are ſtripped of their moral agency.</p>
               <p>OR if it be pleaded, that this counteracting is not an <hi>effectual</hi> overruling; but ſuch an influence of means and motives, as is conſiſtent with moral agency: ſtill this gives no ſatisfaction. Is it ſuch a counteracting, as will <hi>certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and "<hi>inſallibly</hi>" be followed by the repentance and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſinner? This is holden by Dr. C.<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 167.</note> If this be ſo, what moral power of ſtill reſiſting has the ſinner at the time of his repentance? And if he have at that time no moral power of further reſiſtance, then this power is overruled <hi>effectually,</hi> and of courſe, according to Dr. C's ſcheme, the ſinner is deprived of his moral agency.</p>
               <p>IF on the other hand it be ſaid, that the counteracting be not ſuch as will certainly and "infallibly" be followed by the repentance of the ſinner; then there is no certainty that the ſinner will ever under the moſt powerful means which God ſhall uſe with him, be brought to repentance and be ſaved. Thus the certainty of univerſal ſalvation at once comes to nothing. There is no certainty, no ground of aſſurance, that all will be ſaved; and all the truth is, that God will uſe means with ſinners hereafter, as he does in this ſtate, to prepare them for ſalvation; but as in this ſtate, ſo in the future, ſinners may, or may not, comply with thoſe means.</p>
               <p>TO Dr. C.
<q>it appeared a groſs reflection on that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who is infinitely perfect, to ſuppoſe him unable <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> to counteract, and in a moral way too, the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of men.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 167.</note> But is it no reflection on God, to ſuppoſe him not to have been able in a moral way, to prevent the entrance of ſin into the world? Is it no reflection on him to ſuppoſe, that he is not able in a moral way to counteract the obſtinacy of men in this life? Is it no reflection to ſuppoſe, that he is not able, by the powerful means uſed in hell, to counteract it, in a ſingle inſtance, for the ſpace of a thouſand years?<note n="†" place="bottom">See p. 402, 403.</note> How long muſt God be unable to counteract human obſtinacy, before the imputation of ſuch inability becomes a reflection on him? How long may he conſiſtently with his perfections be unable to counteract that obſtinacy? and what duration of that inability may be imputed to him, without a reflection on him, and what
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:022478_0220_0FB92F0634DDEF80"/>
duration of it cannot be imputed to him without a reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If it be no reflection on God, to ſay, that he is unable to counteract that obſtinacy within a thouſand years; is it a reflection to ſay, that he is unable to counteract it in two thouſand, in ten thouſand, or in an hundred thouſand years? If not, why does it become a reflection to ſay, that he is unable <hi>finally</hi> to counteract it?—Let any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in Dr. C's ſcheme anſwer theſe queſtions.</p>
               <p>DOCTOR C's reaſoning in the following paſſage, is worthy of notice; <note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 168.</note>
                  <q>If God deſires the ſalvation of all, and Chriſt died that this deſire of God might be complied with, is it credible that a ſmall portion of men only ſhould be ſaved in event?</q>
—This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning may be retorted thus: If God deſires that all men be ſaved immediately after this life, and Chriſt died that this deſire might be complied with; is it credible, that a ſmall portion of men only ſhould be then ſaved?</p>
               <p>THE advocates for univerſal ſalvation, one and all, bring in the text now under conſideration,
<q>Who will have all men to be ſaved,</q>
as a proof of their doctrine. Therefore I wiſh to aſk them, from what they believe all men are, according to theſe words, to be ſaved? From an endleſs puniſhment? Then they were by a divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution expoſed to an endleſs puniſhment; then an endleſs puniſhment is juſt; then ſin deſerves an endleſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; then ſin is an infinite evil; which to them is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely horrible doctrine. But let them, if they can, avoid it, once allowing that all men are to be ſaved from an endleſs puniſhment. Or are all men, according to theſe words, to be ſaved from a temporary puniſhment? What temporary puniſhment? Not that which is to continue for ages of ages: ſome will ſuffer that. Not from a longer temporary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; becauſe none ſuch is threatened; and ſinners are not expoſed to a puniſhment greater than that which is threatened in the divine law.—On the whole, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to univerſaliſm, theſe words mean, that all men ſhall be ſaved indeed, but ſhall be ſaved from—NOTHING.</p>

An enemy may be overpowered, taken, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and put entirely under the power, or under the feet of the conqueror; and yet not be put to death or annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. When it is ſaid Chriſt's <hi>enemies ſhall be made his footſtool,</hi> Pſal. CX. 1, Heb. X. 13; No one will pretend, that this means either a cordial ſubmiſſion to Chriſt, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation. When the captains of Iſrael put their feet on the necks of the Canaanitiſh kings, Joſh. X. 24, as this was no token of cordial ſubmiſſion or reconciliation; ſo it is certain, that thoſe kings were not then annihilated. The ſame idea is naturally ſuggeſted by that expreſſion, <hi>Put under his feet.</hi> Not any of theſe phraſes is allowed to be uſed in ſcripture, to expreſs either a cordial ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or annihilation. Sin is ſuch an enemy, as never can in its nature be reduced to a cordial ſubmiſſion to Chriſt. Nor needs it to be annihilated, to anſwer the expreſſion of being put under the feet of Chriſt: Nor indeed does that expreſſion naturally ſuggeſt the idea of annihilation; but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, if not neceſſarily implies the contrary. An enemy may be under the feet of his conqueror before he is anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated, but after he is annihilated, he is neither under his feet, nor in any other place. To be under the feet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore implies exiſtence: and ſin may properly be ſaid to be put under the feet of Chriſt, when it is ſo reſtrained and exemplarily puniſhed, that on the whole no diſhonour is done by it to Chriſt, or to the Deity; no evil reſults from
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:022478_0222_0FB92F0B60B7DAC0"/>
it to the univerſe, or to any of Chriſt's real followers: but on the other hand it is made, contrary to its own ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, the inſtrument of promoting the glory of God and of the Saviour, and of increaſing the happineſs of his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal kingdom, and of all his true ſubjects.</p>
               <p>DR. C. makes a diſtinction between God's government of <hi>power</hi> and his <hi>moral</hi> government: by which it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that he meant to ſhow, that ſin cannot be brought into ſubjection to Chriſt, but by the willing ſubmiſſion of the ſinner.
<q>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 179.</note>Men by ſinning oppoſe the government of God; not his government of <hi>power</hi>; for this ever was, and ever will, and ever muſt be, ſubmitted to; but his <hi>moral</hi> government which he exerciſes over intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and free agents. Here is room for oppoſition. Men may reſiſt that will of God, which requires their obedience,</q>
&amp;c. It may be preſumed, that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage now quoted was entirely out of the Doctor's mind, when he wrote the following;
<q>'Tis readily acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the glory of Chriſt's <hi>power,</hi> as head of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, will be <hi>illuſtriouſly diſplayed,</hi> if <hi>by force only</hi> he finally ſubdues obſtinate ſinners.</q>
By this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that it was Dr. C's opinion, that men do oppoſe the <hi>power</hi> of Chriſt, and the power Chriſt <hi>as the head of the government of God</hi> too; and that his power may be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtriouſly diſplayed, if it be employed to ſubdue <hi>by force</hi> their obſtinate oppoſition. But to ſay, that power and force are employed to ſubdue obſtinate oppoſition, and yet that this oppoſition is no oppoſition to that power and force, is as abſurd, as to ſay, that a prince exerts his power and force to ſubdue the oppoſition of an army of rebels, and yet that thoſe rebels do not at all oppoſe his power; or it is as abſurd as to ſay, that oppoſition can be ſubdued where there is no oppoſition.</p>
               <p>IT is by no means clear what Dr. C. meant by God's government of <hi>power,</hi> as oppoſed to his <hi>moral</hi> government. Can there be any government without power? It is plain by the laſt quotation, that Dr. C. did not imagine, that God's moral government is without either <hi>power</hi> or <hi>force,</hi> and that both power and force may be employed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due ſinners, who as ſinners are ſubjects of God's moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment only.—But let the Doctor have meant by this diſtinction what he will, it is by no means true, that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:022478_0223_0FB92F0CB94ADAD8"/>
are always ſo far reſtrained and ſubjected by God's moral government, that in the preſent ſtate of things, and if all things were to remain as they now are, no diſhonour would be done to God, no injury to his kingdom, to his choſen people, or to the intellectual ſyſtem. There is room therefore for ſin and ſinners, in this ſenſe, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and reſtrained by the government of God. When
<q>the wrath of men ſhall praiſe God, and the remainder of wrath ſhall be reſtrained,</q>
then will ſinners be brought to that ſubjection to Chriſt, of which I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But Dr. C. would not pretend, that in this ſenſe, ſinners <hi>ever</hi> have been, <hi>ever</hi> will be, and ever <hi>muſt</hi> be ſubject to God.—In one word, to be ſubjected to Chriſt is to be made either actively or paſſively ſubſervient to his purpoſes and to his glory.</p>
               <p>WHEN the enemies of a prince are overcome, and in chains and priſons are reſtrained from interrupting the peace and happineſs of his faithful ſubjects; then they are put under his feet and are ſubjected to him, and all their "rule, authority and power, are put down or aboliſhed." So when all the enemies of Chriſt, all "obſtinate ſinners" ſhall be, to uſe Dr. C's own words,
<q>by force finally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,</q>
ſhut up in priſon, bound with chains, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from doing the leaſt miſchief to the diſciples and kingdom of Chriſt; then thoſe enemies will be put under the feet of Chriſt; then
<q>an end will be put to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin;</q>
then the works of the devil will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; then the ſerpents head will be bruiſed, and the devil's kingdom will be overthrown, as really and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as the power of a rebel can be overthrown by an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire conqueſt of him and his adherents, by his perpetual impriſonment and other proper puniſhment according to the laws of the kingdom, though he and ſome of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans be permitted to live, and though they retain a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ſpirit.—The verb <gap reason="foreign">

in Rom. VIII. 20, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, as Dr. C. holds, an involuntary ſubjection. It may therefore mean the ſame in Heb. II. 8, and 1 Cor. XV. 27, &amp;c,</p>
               <p>DOCTOR C. inſiſts on the words in 1 John, III. 8,
<q>For this purpoſe was the Son of God manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil.</q>
By the works of the devil, he underſtands <hi>all ſin:</hi> by deſtroying he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands an entire abolition. On the other hand, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:022478_0224_0FB92F0FAA93AC68"/>
the works of the devil, ſome underſtand a perfect defeat of every attempt in oppoſition to the peace, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and glory of God's kingdom:
<q>The devil will be moſt effectually ſubdued, his works will be deſtroyed and his head bruiſed in the higheſt ſenſe and degree, when he ſhall be perfectly defeated and diſappointed in all his deſigns, and every thing he has attempted againſt Chriſt and his intereſt, ſhall be turned againſt himſelf, to anſwer thoſe ends which he conſtantly ſought to defeat by all his attempts; and Chriſt ſhall be more honoured, and his kingdom more happy and glorious forever, than it could have been, if Satan had never oppoſed him, or ſeduced and deſtroyed any of mankind.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Hopkins's Inquiry into the Future State.</note>—As the text now under conſideration is capable of the ſenſe juſt given; until it ſhall be proved, that the Doctor's is the true ſenſe, it proves nothing to his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>DOCTOR C. grants,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 224.</note> That by deſtruction the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures mean the miſery and puniſhment of ſinners. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſinners are in the ſenſe and language of ſcripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, when they are ſent to the place of reſtraint, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment and miſery prepared for them. And as ſinners will be deſtroyed without <hi>annihilation,</hi> ſo may <hi>ſin</hi> and the works of the devil.</p>
               <p>THAT God has always power to ſubdue or to ſubject to himſelf his enemies, is one thing: actually to ſubject them, by reſtraining them from doing any damage to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or his ſubjects, is another. In the preſent ſtate, the enemies of Chriſt tempt his ſubjects, obſtruct his cauſe, and do many things, which if they were to remain as they now are, would be an everlaſting diſhonour to Chriſt. But they ſhall be made his footſtool, they ſhall no more do any of thoſe things.</p>
               <p>WHEN Chriſt puts his enemies under his feet, he treads them down in his anger and tramples them in his fury, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to Iſai. LXIII. 3. But this ſurely is not to bring them to a cordial reconciliation.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE, as Pſal. VIII. 5, 6; Heb. II. 6—9, are fairly capable of a conſtruction entirely different from that on which Dr. C's whole argument from them depends; they prove nothing to his purpoſe: eſpecially as they are not naturally capable of his conſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="unknown:022478_0225_0FB92F15F50DD920"/>WE are now to attend to Phil. II. 9, 10, 11;
<q>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue ſhould confeſs, that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</q>
—The queſtion concerning this text is the ſame as that concerning the text laſt under conſideration; What are we to underſtand by that ſubjection, to which Chriſt in conſequence of his exaltation, was to reduce mankind? Is it a free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſubjection in all men? Or in ſome men a ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which they ſhall be reduced by the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt, in oppoſition to their own inclinations? Dr. C. aſſerts that the former is the moſt plain and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſenſe, and that the latter is evidently too low and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained an interpretation. But poſitive aſſertions prove nothing.</p>
               <p>AS to the Doctor's <hi>reaſons</hi> to prove that the ſubjection in queſtion is a free and voluntary one, they are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; That Chriſt is now endeavouring to reduce man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to a voluntary ſubjection to himſelf<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 190.</note>—That though Chriſt do not in this ſtate, prevail on all men voluntarily to ſubject themſelves to him, yet he may prevail on them in the next ſtate.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 191.</note>—That if Chriſt was exalted for this end, that every knee ſhould bow to him, &amp;c. he will fail of his end unleſs all men be reduced to a voluntary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 192.</note>—That the genuflection in this Phil. II, 10, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently means a voluntary act<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>—That a compelled ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is a poor, low kind of ſubjection in compariſon with that which is voluntary; therefore the reward of Chriſt's humiliation, unleſs it imply an univerſal voluntary ſubjection of mankind, is low and ſmall in compariſon with what it would have been, had it implied a voluntary ſubjection.<note n="‖‖" place="bottom">P. 192, 193.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt is now endeavouring to bring all men to a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſubjection to himſelf; and theſe endeavours will ſooner or later be ſucceſsful: therefore Phil. II. 9, &amp;c. means a voluntary ſubjection.—Anſwer: Chriſt is now in no other ſenſe endeavouring to bring all to a voluntary ſubjection, than in the days of his incarnation he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to gather the inhabitants of Jeruſalem together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings: or tha<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

always has endeavoured to prevent the death of him that dieth. But as thoſe endeavours have not been efficacious; ſo his endeavours to bring all men to a voluntary ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may not be. Therefore this argument proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though Chriſt do not in this ſtate prevail on all men voluntarily to ſubject themſelves to him; yet he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on them in the next ſtate: therefore in the next ſtate all <hi>will in fact</hi> be brought to a voluntary ſubjection: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Phil. II. 9, &amp;c. means voluntary ſubjection.—An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: It does not follow from the <hi>power</hi> of Chriſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all men to a voluntary ſubjection, that he <hi>will in fact,</hi> reduce them to that ſubjection.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Chriſt were exalted for this end, that every knee ſhould bow to him, &amp;c. he will fail of the end of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, unleſs all be reduced to a voluntary ſubjection. —Anſwer: The conſequence by no means follows from the antecedent. For though it be allowed that Chriſt was exalted for the end, that every knee ſhould bow to him; yet it is not allowed that this bowing of the knee is a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſubjection. So that Chriſt may obtain the whole end of his exaltation, without effecting a voluntary ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all men. This argument takes for granted, that the bowing of the knee mentioned in Phil. II. 10, is a voluntary ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The genuflection in Phil. II. 10, evidently means a voluntary act.—Anſwer: It does not evidently mean a voluntary act.—A mere contradiction is a ſufficient anſwer to a mere aſſertion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A compelled ſubjection is a poor, low kind of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in compariſon with that which is voluntary. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reward of Chriſt's humiliation, unleſs it imply a voluntary ſubjection of all mankind, is low and ſmall in compariſon with what it would have been, had it implied a voluntary ſubjection. Therefore it does imply a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſubjection; therefore a voluntary ſubjection is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Phil. II. 10.</p>
               <p>ANSWER: We are very improper perſons to determine <hi>a priori</hi> what is the proper reward of Chriſt, or what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is the greateſt, and moſt honourable to Chriſt. Some may imagine it would be moſt honourable to Chriſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all men to a voluntary ſubmiſſion in this life; as in that caſe they would be ſaved from <hi>all</hi> future puniſhment;
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:022478_0227_0FB92F196B29BA78"/>
and thus might the grace, power and wiſdom of Chriſt in their opinion be more glorified. Hence they might ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue juſt as forcibly as Dr. C. does in the other caſe, That undoubtedly Chriſt will in this life reduce all men to a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſubjection to himſelf. On the ſame principle it might alſo have been proved, before the fact ſhewed the contrary, that all men would be reduced to a voluntary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Chriſt, in a very ſhort time, long before the time of their ordinary departure out of life. On the ſame principle too it might have been proved, that God would never permit ſin and miſery to enter the world.—Thus it appears, that Dr. C's argument, if it prove any thing, proves too much, therefore proves nothing.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor was not inſenſible, that the ſame words are quoted by the Apoſtle Paul, and applied to the general judgment; at which time Dr. C. does not pretend, that all men will be voluntarily ſubject to Chriſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 196.</note> See Rom. XIV. 10, 11, 12.
<q>For we ſhall all ſtand before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt. For it is written, as I live, ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall confeſs to God. So then every one of us ſhall give account of himſelf to God.</q>
Therefore we have clear evidence, that theſe words do ſometimes mean that ſubjection which is not voluntary. And that in Phil. II. 10, they mean a voluntary ſubjection and that only, we muſt have good evidence, before we are obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. The utmoſt evidence which Dr. C. gives us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting that matter, I have exhibited above; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſufficiency of it, the reader will judge.</p>
               <p>DOCTOR C. acknowledges,<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> that the words are perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently applied by the Apoſtle, to that ſubjection which ſhall take place as to all, at the general judgment: but ſays that his thus applying them is no argument that they mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more. To which it may be anſwered, that it is an argument that they mean nothing more in Phil. II. 10, unleſs good reaſon can be given to ſhow, that in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage they do mean more: and whether the reaſons which Dr. C. gives, be good and ſatisfactory, is ſubmitted as before.</p>
               <p>WE come at length to the conſideration of that paſſage of ſcripture, which Dr. C.
<q>conſiders as <hi>deciſive of itſelf,</hi> were there no other text in the Bible of the like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</q>
                  <pb n="223" facs="unknown:022478_0228_0FB92F1DE09BB3B8"/>
It is 1 Cor. XV. 24—29;
<q>Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the father; when he ſhall have put down all rule, and all authority and power. For he muſt reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he ſaith all things are put under him, it is manifeſt, that he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted which did put all things under him. And when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall the ſon alſo himſelf be ſubject unto him, that put all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, that God may be all in all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Doctor prefaces his criticiſm on this text, with ſome obſervations on the previous context, which demand our firſt attention.—He quotes the 21ſt and 22d verſes;
<q>For ſince by man came death, by man came alſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive:</q>
and adds,
<q>It is with me beyond all controverſy evident, that the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is ſpeaking here, not of a partial, but univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, not of the reſurrection of the righteous on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but of the whole race of Adam.—The ſame all who ſuffer death through Adam, ſhall through Chriſt be made alive. The compariſon between the damage by Adam and the advantage by Chriſt, lies in this very thing.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 201.</note>
                  </q>
Here we have the Doctor's opinion, and his reaſon for it. His opinion is, that in the 22d verſe the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle is ſpeaking of all mankind: his reaſon for this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, that otherwiſe there would be no proper compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Adam and Chriſt. But the truth of this obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is by no means conceded. The reader may have ſeen my ideas of this caſe in the remarks made above, on Rom. V. 12, &amp;c.—If an army under one general be all killed or taken, and afterwards the ſurviving part of the ſame army, now liberated, and under the command of another general, return every one in ſafety from a dangerous bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; it may be juſtly ſaid, As under the former general all the army was killed or taken, ſo under the latter ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral all the army returned from the battle in ſafety. There would in this caſe be a true and proper compariſon. Yet the very ſame all would not be intended in both parts of the compariſon. Dr. C's reaſon therefore is not ſufficient
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:022478_0229_0FB92F1EAFB27AD0"/>
to ſupport his conſtruction. There is a proper compariſon of Adam and Chriſt, if the apoſtle ſay, and intended to ſay, As in Adam all his ſeed die, even ſo in Chriſt all his ſeed ſhall be made alive.</p>
               <p>IT is indeed a truth granted on all hands, that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind will be raiſed at the laſt day; but it does not hence follow, that the apoſtle in this verſe is ſpeaking of ſuch an univerſal reſurrection.</p>
               <p>BESIDE, if it ſhould be granted, that the 22d verſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the reſurrection of all men, it would not follow, that all will be ſaved. For Dr. C. grants, that had the apoſtle
<q>no where elſe opened his mind more fully and particularly upon this matter, the utmoſt we could have argued from his words, would have been, that as all men die in Adam, ſo in Chriſt they ſhould all be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from this death, by a reſurrection to life.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 201.</note>
                  </q>
How then does this text prove univerſal ſalvation? And eſpecially how is this verſe, or even the whole paſſage
<q>of itſelf <hi>deciſive</hi>?</q>
Although Dr. C. in page 197, declares his opinion, that this paſſage is
<q>deciſive of itſelf, was there no other text in all the Bible of the like import;</q>
yet he himſelf in page 207, gives it up as deciſive, in the following words;
<q>This parentheſis, comprehended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the 24th and 29th verſes, was purpoſely interpoſed to bring us to a pauſe—and give us opportunity— to reflect upon—the truths—here revealed; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing them in their juſt tendency, neceſſary connection and final reſult: In the doing of which, we ſhould <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually continue</hi> the diſcourſe, and finiſh it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the wicked, as the apoſtle had done—with reſpect to the righteous.</q>
Thus it appears by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Dr. C. that this portion of ſcripture does not contain any thing plain, or poſitive concerning the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe who die in wickedneſs; but to inveſtigate that which to him was ſo important and favourite a doctrine, we muſt <hi>virtually</hi> continue and finiſh the diſcourſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. How then is this paſſage deciſive of itſelf? Unleſs we virtually continue and finiſh the diſcourſe ourſelves with reſpect to the wicked, as the apoſtle had done with reſpect to the righteous, we ſhall never, even in Dr. C's opinion come to the ſame concluſion concerning the wicked, to which the apoſtle came concerning the righteous, that they ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="unknown:022478_0230_0FB92F202B4BE0A8"/>THE chief thing, which Dr. C. endeavours by this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to prove, with a final view to the eſtabliſhment of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal ſalvation, is, that the mediatory ſcheme will not be finiſhed at the ſecond coming of Chriſt; but a great deal will then remain to be done before the plan of God, for the accompliſhment of which the mediatory kingdom is entruſted to the ſon, ſhall be completed.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 208.</note> By the
"fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing," "the completing," &amp;c, of "the mediatory ſcheme,"
the mediatorial kingdom, &amp;c, Dr. C. muſt have meant the finiſhing of the work of ſalvation, or of delivering ſinners from ſin and miſery: otherwiſe he meant nothing to the purpoſe of proving the ſalvation of all men. What if the mediatorial kingdom be not finiſhed at Chriſt's ſecond coming? Yet if after that period, Chriſt will never more deliver any of mankind from ſin and from wrath; thoſe who ſhall at that time remain in ſin, and under the wrath of God, will never be ſaved.</p>
               <p>THAT in the ſenſe now explained, the mediatorial ſcheme will not be finiſhed at the ſecond coming of Chriſt, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a point in diſpute, and the Doctor's proofs of this point are to be candidly weighed. They are theſe two—(1) This paſſage of ſcripture teaches, that an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſubjection to Chriſt is to be effected before the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the mediatory ſcheme; but this univerſal ſubjection to Chriſt is not effected at the ſecond coming of Chriſt.— (2) The reward of the good and faithful ſubjects of Chriſt is to be beſtowed on them in the kingdom of Chriſt, and therefore Chriſt's kingdom will not be at an end, till after they ſhall have enjoyed that reward for ſome time at leaſt. —I think theſe two are all the reaſons which Dr. C. has given to ſupport the propoſition in queſtion. He has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed divided his long and complicated diſcourſe on the text now before us, into five heads: but for what reaſon is not manifeſt.</p>
               <p n="1">I. IT was the opinion of Dr. C. that 1 Cor. XV. 24-29, teaches us, that an univerſal ſubjection to Chriſt is to be effected before the finiſhing of the mediatorial ſcheme, which is not effected at Chriſt's ſecond coming.—By ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Chriſt Dr. C. meant with reſpect to intelligent creatures, a cordial, willing ſubjection. By ſubjection to Chriſt, with reſpect to ſin and death the firſt and ſecond, he ſeems to have meant <hi>abolition.</hi> But though it is agreed
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:022478_0231_0FB92F236D94BF38"/>
on all hands, that there will be an univerſal ſubjection to Chriſt effected, before the finiſhing of the mediatorial ſcheme; yet it is not agreed that this ſubjection, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to all intelligent creatures, will be a willing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection or ſubmiſſion. Concerning this particular, ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations have been made in the former part of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. That the text now under conſideration does teach a willing ſubjection, muſt be ſhown, or the text will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be to the purpoſe.—Now to ſhow, that all intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent creatures will be cordially ſubjected to Chriſt, and will be ſaved, the Doctor inſiſts, that both ſin and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death will be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT ſin will be deſtroyed. With reference to thoſe words, "he muſt reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet"—"All things ſhall be ſubdued unto him"—The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor aſks, "Is <hi>ſin</hi> an <hi>enemy</hi>?"—Suppoſing it is an enemy, what follows? Not what the Doctor aſſerts, "Then it will be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi>" meaning aboliſhed, extirpated by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal obedience and virtue. For the apoſtle does not ſay, that all enemies ſhall be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> aboliſhed, extirpated or annihilated: but that all enemies ſhall be <hi>ſubdued</hi> and <hi>put under Chriſt's feet.</hi> So that the true and only conſequence from the ſuppoſition, that ſin is an enemy, is, that it ſhall be ſubdued, reſtrained and put under Chriſt's feet; which may be done in a ſenſe true, proper, and as Dr. C. grants,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 193.</note> glorious to Chriſt, without the abolition of it.</p>
               <p>INDEED the apoſtle ſays, that
<q>the laſt enemy, death, ſhall be deſtroyed;</q>
which by no means implies, that all other enemies ſhall be deſtroyed. It may mean, what our tranſlators evidently underſtood by it, that the laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which we ſhall have of the deſtruction of any enemy, will be in the deſtruction of death.—The words literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and according to the order of the original, are thus tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; the laſt enemy is deſtroyed death; and they may mean, and may very properly be rendered thus, Death is deſtroyed the laſt enemy. Now ſuppoſe an hiſtorian, in the account of a battle, ſhould ſay, The general was killed the laſt enemy: muſt we neceſſarily underſtand him to mean, that all the enemies of the whole army were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the general was killed after all the reſt? Might not his words be juſtly taken in this ſenſe, that the general was the laſt enemy who fell, and many others might eſcape?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="unknown:022478_0232_0FB92F268E665B08"/>OR death may by the apoſtle be called the laſt enemy proverbially and with reſpect to this life only; as it is now ſometimes called the laſt debt due to nature. Since the expreſſion,
<q>the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death,</q>
is capable of this ſenſe; and ſince it does not appear, that it implies, that all other enemies will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: therefore it is no proof of univerſal ſalvation; as both ſin and miſery may ſtill be allowed to be enemies, and yet may be in exiſtence, after the deſtruction of death.</p>
               <p>BUT it may be aſſerted in a true and proper ſenſe, that ſin, in the damned, is not an enemy. It does no damage to Chriſt, to his kingdom, or to the peace and happineſs of his ſubjects. It is to be ſure, an enemy in no other ſenſe, than the damned themſelves are enemies: and if from that expreſſion,
<q>the laſt enemy that is <hi>deſtroyed, aboliſhed,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is death,</q>
it follow, that all Chriſt's enemies will be aboliſhed or annihilated; it will alſo follow, that all the damned will be annihilated. So that if this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument prove any thing, it proves too much; ſo much that it entirely overthrows univerſal ſalvation.</p>
               <p>BUT ſin in the damned, and the damned themſelves, inſtead of doing any damage to Chriſt or his ſubjects, will be the means of increaſing the glory of the former and the happineſs of the latter, to eternity.</p>
               <p>IT is obſervable, that the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
is never in all the New Teſtament, applied to expreſs the deſtruction of all wicked men, of the enemies of God in general, or of all ſin. Therefore as neither ſin itſelf, nor all the enemies of God, are ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to be <hi>aboliſhed,</hi> we have no right, even on the ſuppoſition that ſin is an enemy in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſe, to ſay that it will be <hi>aboliſhed,</hi> or extirpated from the univerſe.—The peculiar phraſeology of the paſſage now under conſideration, is worthy of particular notice. In the 24th verſe it is ſaid, that Chriſt will
<q>
                     <hi>aboliſh,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, all rule and all authority and power.</q>
But he is ſaid to put all his enemies under his feet, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, verſe 25th, and to put all things under his feet, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, verſe 27th. Although there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the <hi>rule,</hi> and all the <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of Chriſt's enemies ſhall be aboliſhed, and the apoſtle is careful to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of that; yet he is equally careful to inform us, that his enemies themſelves ſhall be only <hi>ſubjected</hi> to him,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:022478_0233_0FB92F29E4BCFFB0"/>
and put under his feet; as it ſeems, deſignedly ſhifting the phraſeology and avoiding the application of the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
to them. What right then have we to apply it to them? Is not the application of words to perſons or things, to which the apoſtle deſignedly did not apply them, a groſs perverſion of ſcripture?</p>
               <p>DOCTOR C's argument that ſin will be deſtroyed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends wholly on this general propoſition, That all Chriſt's enemies will be deſtroyed. Now the word deſtroyed in this caſe, doubtleſs means either <hi>abolition,</hi> or <hi>reſtraint</hi> and <hi>puniſhment.</hi> If it mean <hi>abolition, extirpation, annihilation</hi>; then as was before obſerved, all the enemies of Chriſt will be annihilated, and the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation falls to the ground at once. If it mean <hi>reſtraint, puniſhment, preventing from doing miſchief,</hi> &amp;c, then ſin may be ſaid to be deſtroyed, and yet have an endleſs exiſtence in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
               <p>IF then theſe words,
<q>The laſt enemy death ſhall be deſtroyed,</q>
do certainly imply, that all Chriſt's ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhall be deſtroyed? and if it be alſo certain, that ſin <hi>in the damned</hi> is, in every proper ſenſe, an enemy, thoſe words are equally inconſiſtent with Dr. C's ſcheme, as with the oppoſite. They either imply an univerſal annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of all Chriſt's enemies; and ſo are equally inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with univerſal ſalvation, as with endleſs torment; or they are not at all inconſiſtent with it, and therefore are no argument againſt it. If they imply an univerſal anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation of the enemies of Chriſt, as they are equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Dr. C's ſcheme, as againſt the oppoſite; it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns him, as his opponents, to provide an anſwer to them, and it is abſurd in him to object them to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of his opponents.</p>
               <p>THE ſum of what has been ſaid on this head of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſin is (1) That it does not appear, that ſin in the damned is properly an enemy to Chriſt and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; as it does no harm to that kingdom. (2) If it be determined that ſin in the damned is an enemy to Chriſt, it will not follow, that it will be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> meaning by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction <hi>annihilation</hi> or <hi>abolition</hi>; becauſe it is no where ſaid, that all Chriſt's enemies will be deſtroyed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. —Or even if this were aſſerted concerning all Chriſt's enemies, and the verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
were applied to them all, it would not certainly determine, that they will all be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated,
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:022478_0234_0FB92F2AACB962F8"/>
as that verb is capable of another ſenſe, and is doubtleſs uſed in another ſenſe, Heb. II. 14;
<q>That through death he might <hi>deſtroy,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, him that had the power of death, that is the devil.</q>
Dr. C. did not believe, that the devil will be annihilated. Therefore if that verb were applied to all Chriſt's enemies, and ſin in the damned were allowed to be an enemy to Chriſt; ſtill it might mean ſomething elſe beſide annihilation: nay, it muſt neceſſarily mean ſomething elſe, or it would equally diſprove univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſalvation, as endleſs miſery.</p>
               <p>IN Dr. C's diſcourſe on this ſubject, it is implied, that when a ſinner is brought to repentance and cordial recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation to Chriſt, he is <hi>deſtroyed.</hi> His words are,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 214, 215.</note>
                  <q>Chriſt ſhall continue veſted with regal power, till he has brought all enemies into <hi>ſubjection</hi> to him—Chriſt will continue head of the kingdom of God—till he has actually <hi>ſubdued</hi> all enemies—Is ſin an enemy?— then it ſhall be <hi>deſtroyed</hi>—for Chriſt muſt <hi>deſtroy</hi> all enemies.</q>
By theſe ſeveral expreſſions it appears, that it was Dr. C's opinion, that all Chriſt's enemies will be <hi>ſubjected</hi> to him, that they all will be <hi>ſubdued</hi> under him, and that they will all be <hi>deſtroyed</hi> by him. Now it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly evident, that by <hi>ſubjection, ſubduing,</hi> &amp;c, when applied to thoſe, who die in impenitence, Dr. C. meant a cordial reconciliation to Chriſt: and he by no means held, that theſe enemies thus reconciled, will be deſtroyed by annihilation. It follows therefore, that as all Chriſt's enemies are to be deſtroyed, to be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> and to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to Chriſt in true repentance,</hi> are, according to Dr. C. one and the ſame thing. Therefore, when Paul was converted, he was <hi>deſtroyed</hi>; and as he will eternally be the ſubject of repentance, he will ſuffer an eternal deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The puniſhment of God's enemies is, that they ſhall be deſtroyed; they ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. But what puniſhment are everlaſting repentance and complacency in God? they are among the greateſt bleſſings which Deity himſelf can confer on a creature. Endleſs deſtruction and endleſs ſalvation are throughout the ſcriptures oppoſed to each other. But according to Dr. C's ſcheme, they perfectly harmonize and mutually imply each other.—Now whether this ſcheme harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize with the ſcriptures is ſubmitted to the reader.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="unknown:022478_0235_0FB92F2F52AFC870"/>WHETHER this ſcheme harmonize with the ſcriptures or not,, it does not harmonize with other parts of Dr. C's book. He ſays,<note n="**" place="bottom">P. 224.</note> that by the deſtruction of the wicked, mentioned in 2 Theſ. I. 9, and in various other texts,
<q>we are very obviouſly led to underſtand <hi>miſery.</hi>
                  </q>
Surely convrerſion from ſin to holineſs, and eſpecially the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holineſs of the ſaints in heaven, is not <hi>miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DR. C. holds, that all enemies will be ſubdued and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to Chriſt, and that ſin will be ſubjected to him, when it is aboliſhed or annihilated. But if ſin be ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt, when it is annihilated, then the ſinner would be ſubjected to Chriſt were he annihilated. But this kind of ſubjection is no more a cordial ſubjection, than that which is effected by mere power, and which conſiſts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint and puniſhment.—Beſide, according to Dr. C. there are two ways of ſubjecting to Chriſt intended in this paſſage; one is by cordial reconciliation, the other is by annihilation. This then will keep in countenance the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents of Dr. C. who believe, that there are two ways of ſubjecting to Chriſt; one by cordial reconciliation, which reſpects the elect only; the other by reſtraint and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which reſpects the reprobate.</p>
               <p>ON the whole, whether this paſſage be ſufficient to prove an univerſal abolition of ſin, is now left to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the reader.</p>
               <p n="2">2. DOCTOR C. was of the opinion, that 1 Cor. XV. 24—29, teaches, that before the finiſhing of the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial ſcheme, the <hi>ſecond death</hi> will be deſtroyed.—He ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 210.</note>
                  <q>The ſecond death may with as much propriety be called an enemy, as the firſt death.—Let any ſenſe be aſſigned, in which the firſt death can be properly ſpoken of as an enemy, and it will at once be eaſy to make it appear, that the ſecond death is, in the ſame ſenſe, as truly an enemy, and much more ſo.</q>
—
<q>Is<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 215.</note> death, the ſecond death, an enemy? Then this ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhall be deſtroyed; for Chriſt muſt deſtroy <hi>all</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</q>
This is the Doctor's argument; in anſwer to which two obſervations may be made—That the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death is not an enemy, in the ſenſe which the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's argument implies—That if it were in every ſenſe an enemy, it would not follow, that it ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, i. e. <hi>aboliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="unknown:022478_0236_0FB92F33E3F69E88"/>THE reader hath ſeen the obſervations made above, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſin as an enemy and concerning the deſtruction of ſin: ſimilar obſervations may be made concerning the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) THE ſecond death is not an enemy in the ſenſe which Dr. C's argument implies and requires.—If the Doctor meant, that the ſecond death is an enemy to thoſe who are the ſubjects of it, as it deſtroys their happineſs and prevents their admiſſion to a glorious immortality; this is granted. But it is not granted, that therefore it will be deſtroyed: and for the Doctor to take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that therefore it will be deſtroyed, is the ſame thing as to take for granted that all mankind will finally be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a glorious immortality, which is the grand ſubject of the preſent controverſy.—But if the Doctor meant, that the ſecond death is an enemy to Chriſt, as it prevents the brighteſt diſplay of his glory, the greateſt proſperity of his kingdom, and the greateſt happineſs of his ſubjects; in this ſenſe it is denied to be an enemy.—This is a ſenſe in which the firſt death is an enemy, and notwithſtanding what Dr. C. ſays, it does not ſeem
<q>eaſy to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the ſecond death is, in the ſame ſenſe, as truly an enemy.</q>
The firſt death, while it continues, prevents the brighteſt diſplay of the glory of Chriſt, the greateſt proſperity of his kingdom, and the greateſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his ſubjects: if it ſhould continue, it would be inconſiſtent with the promiſes of Chriſt, with the complete ſalvation of the elect, and would defeat the goſpel. Now to make it appear, that in this ſenſe the ſecond death is an enemy, it may be preſumed, is not a more eaſy talk, than to prove the ſalvation of all men.—The ſecond death is no more an enemy to Chriſt, to his kingdom, or to his faithful ſubjects, than the execution of ſome moſt attro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ungrateful rebels, whoſe lives cannot be ſpared conſiſtently with the glory of their king, the proſperity of his kingdom, or the happineſs of his faithful ſubjects; is an enemy to the king, to his kingdom, or to his faithful ſubjects.</p>
               <p>DOCTOR C. further urges, that
<q>the ſecond death is the laſt enemy, and the only one that is ſo.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 210.</note> If it be no enemy, it is neither the <hi>laſt</hi> nor the <hi>firſt</hi> enemy. Therefore, "it ſeems" <hi>not</hi>
                  <q>reaſonable, when the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:022478_0237_0FB92F352F731458"/>
ſays, <hi>the laſt enemy which is death, ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> to underſtand him to mean by <hi>death,</hi> the <hi>ſecond death.</hi>
                  </q>
The firſt death is in the ſenſe before given, the laſt enemy; the laſt who prevents the complete diſplay of Chriſt's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the laſt who prevents the perfection of his kingdom, the laſt who has power to hurt the ſaints. After the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of this death, they immediately receive the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſons. Although the devils and thoſe who have been perſecutors in this world, will ſtill be in exiſtence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deſtruction of the firſt death, they will no more have it in their power to diſhonour Chriſt, or to interrupt the happineſs of his ſubjects, than if they were annihilated.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) IF the ſecond death were in every ſenſe an enemy, it would not follow, that it ſhall be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> meaning <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</hi> All the enemies of God or of Chriſt, are no where ſaid to be <hi>aboliſhed</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, meaning <hi>annihilation.</hi> To be <hi>ſubdued, ſubjected, put under feet,</hi> is by no means the ſame as to be <hi>annihilated.</hi> If therefore the ſecond death be ever ſo truly and properly an enemy, the utmoſt that would thence follow, is, that it would be ſo reſtrained and ſubjected to Chriſt, as to be prevented from doing miſchief, and to be made an inſtrument of promoting the glory of God, and the happineſs of his kingdom. In this ſenſe it may be granted, that the ſecond death will be deſtroyed; yet the ſalvation of all men would no more be implied in the conceſſion, than it is implied in the deſtruction of the devil, mentioned, Heb. II. 14, that he will be annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Nor can we hold, that all Chriſt's enemies will be <hi>deſtroyed</hi> in the ſenſe now oppoſed, without holding the annihilation of the wicked, and giving up univerſal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>DR. C. endeavours to make out, that if death, the laſt enemy, do mean temporal death, ſtill the deſtruction of this death implies univerſal ſalvation.
<q>Simple reſtoration to life, ſays he,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 211, &amp;c.</note>
is not the thing the ſcripture means by death deſtroyed. To be ſure the apoſtle Paul had quite another notion of it.—What is the idea he leads us to entertain of it? Plainly not a bare return to life, but ſuch an one as is connected with a glorious immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</q>
That in this chapter the apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch a return to life, as is connected with a glorious immortality, is granted; becauſe in this chapter he is ſpeaking of the
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:022478_0238_0FB92F3731622E70"/>
reſurrection of the ſaints only. The Doctor indeed tells us, that it was <hi>with him</hi>
                  <q>beyond all controverſy evident, that the apoſtle is ſpeaking here, not of a partial, but univerſal reſurrection.</q>
To others however it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all controverſy evident, that the apoſtle is ſpeaking here of the reſurrection of the righteous only. Even the Doctor acknowledges, that after the 28th verſe the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<q>confines his diſcourſe to the righteous, without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing of the wicked.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 207.</note>
                  </q>
Now this affords ſome ground of preſumption at leaſt, that in the former part of the chapter too, he confines his diſcourſe to the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the righteous. Nor has Dr. C. given any reaſon, beſide that which has been already examined, viz. That the compariſon between the damage by Adam, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by Chriſt, lies in this very thing, that the ſame <hi>all men</hi> are meant in both parts of that expreſſion,
<q>as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</q>
So that Dr. C's argument,<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 211.</note> that from the reſurrection of all mankind, it follows, that all will be ſaved, depends on principles, which are neither granted nor proved, and therefore is utterly inconcluſive.</p>
               <p>HE further ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 210, 211.</note>
                  <q>This <hi>ſecond</hi> death, ſtrictly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking, is THE LAST ENEMY, and THE ONLY ONE, that is ſo.</q>
Then ſurely there will not be a <hi>third,</hi> a <hi>fourth</hi> death, &amp;c, &amp;c, for ages of ages. Yet this is taught in other parts of his book; as in the following paſſage, <note n="**" place="bottom">P. 309, 310.</note>
                  <q>They may all—be doomed—to a ſtate of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, which ſhall laſt for an age: In which ſtate <hi>ſome</hi> —may be wrought upon to ſubmit themſelves to God —Others may <hi>die</hi> in this ſtate ſtupid—And thoſe who thus died in their obſtinacy may again—be put into a place of ſuffering for another age; in which <hi>ſome</hi> may be reduced—and others ſtand it out ſtill. Theſe others may. in yet another form of exiſtence, be ſent into a place of diſcipline for another age; and ſo on, till there has been torment for ages of ages.</q>
Here the Doctor diſtinctly mentions three future ſtates of ſuffering, and ſuppoſes there may be others continued in ſucceſſion for ages of ages, which are ſo many diſtinct deaths, as really as the firſt ſtate of ſuffering after this life, is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death, with reſpect to temporal death. What right then had the doctor to ſay, and with what conſiſtency could
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:022478_0239_0FB92F3837BF5108"/>
he ſay, that the <hi>ſecond death</hi> is the <hi>laſt</hi> enemy, and the <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one</hi> that is ſo?</p>
               <p n="2">II. THE other argument of Dr. C. is, that the reward of the good and faithful ſubjects of Chriſt is to be beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them in the kingdom of Chriſt; and therefore Chriſt's kingdom will not be at an end, till after they ſhall have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed that reward for ſome time at leaſt; and therefore will not be at an end, at the ſecond coming of Chriſt, or immediately after the general judgment."<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 222, 223.</note>—This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wholly depends on the ſuppoſition, that at the time at which the work of ſalvation ſhall be completed by Chriſt he will entirely abdicate all government of ſuperintenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy over thoſe who ſhall be ſaved by him. If otherwiſe; if he ſhall ſtill retain a ſuperintendency over thoſe who ſhall be ſaved by him; if he ſhall ſtill be their immediate head or ruler, and the ſource of their happineſs; though he ſhall not be the ſupreme ruler of the univerſe, nor even of the redeemed; but in this reſpect he ſhall reſign the kingdom to the Father: he may be ſaid yet to have a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to ſit on his throne; and to reign, &amp;c. Before the reſignation of the mediatorial kingdom, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>all things</hi> is in the hands of Chriſt, being delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Father to this government. Or as Dr. C. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it,
<q>he will be head over all; he will govern all; he will be all unto all.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 217.</note> Chriſt during that period acts as the ſupreme head of the univerſe. But when he ſhall have reſigned the mediatorial kingdom, the Father will act as ſupreme head. Still Chriſt may, under the Father, be the head and governor of his redeemed and ſaved peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Father will be ſupreme ruler, and Chriſt with his Church united to him, and dependent on him, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefits of his government. This does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but that Chriſt himſelf, in ſubordination to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will have a government over his ſaints.</p>
               <p>NOR does it imply, but that the ſon as one with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as being in the Father, and the Father in him, ſhall reign after the reſignation of the delegated ſovereignty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all things. It may be preſumed, that no man will ſay, that the Father does not reign now while the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of univerſal government is in the hands of the Son. If he did not now reign, there would be no propriety in ſpeaking as the ſcripture often does,
<q>of him that ſitteth
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:022478_0240_0FB92F3EB34F9308"/>
on the throne, and the Lamb;</q>
nor any propriety in the promiſe, Joh. XV. 16;
<q>That whatſoever ye ſhall aſk of the <hi>Father</hi> in my name, he may give it you;</q>
nor in thoſe words of James, Chap. I. 17;
<q>Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the <hi>Father</hi> of lights.</q>
But I need not add texts, to prove this.—For the ſame reaſon therefore that the Father now reigns in and with the Son; ſo after the reſignation of the general delegated adminiſtration, the Son will ſtill reign in and with the Father. Now the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is conducted in the name and by the immediate agency of the Son: then it will be conducted in the name and by the immediate agency of the Father. Yet as now the Father reigns in and with the Son; ſo then will the Son reign in and with the Father. Chriſt now reigns with ſupreme ſovereignty by delegation from the Father. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reſignation of this ſovereignty, he will ſtill reign over the ſaints by delegation from the Father, but with dominion, which ſhall be ſubordinate to that of the Father. He will alſo at the ſame time reign in and with the Father, in the exerciſe of a dominion, which ſhall not be delegated, but which is eſſential to him as a divine perſon, and one with the Father; as the Father, by virtue of his divinity, now neceſſarily reigns in and with the Son.—So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chriſt ſhall immediately after the general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, reſign the ſupreme delegated ſovereignty, which he now poſſeſſes; ſtill he will reign in theſe two reſpects, by a delegated ſubordinate authority over his ſaints; and by an undelegated, eſſential authority, which by virtue of his divinity, he poſſeſſes neceſſarily with the Father.</p>
               <p>BUT whether the true idea of Chriſt's delivering up the kingdom to the Father, concerning which Divines have repeatedly differed, have been now preciſely exhibited or not; ſtill the ſcriptures neceſſitate us to believe, that in ſome ſenſe Chriſt will reign to an abſolute eternity. Heb. I. 8;
<q>Unto the Son, he ſaith, Thy throne, O God, is <hi>forever and ever.</hi>
                  </q>
Rev. XXII. 5; "They" [the ſaints] "ſhall reign <hi>forever and ever.</hi>" 1 Pet. V. 4;
<q>When the chief ſhepherd ſhall appear, ye ſhall receive a crown of glory that <hi>fadeth not away.</hi>
                  </q>
1 Cor. IX. 25; "We do it to obtain an <hi>incorruptible crown.</hi>" Heb. XII. 28;

                  </q>
Both theſe laſt texts are quoted by Dr. C.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 267.</note> to prove that the righteous ſhall live and be happy without end: and they equally prove that they ſhall <hi>reign without end.</hi>—But the ſaints are to ſit down with Chriſt on his throne and reign with him: and it is abſurd to imagine, that <hi>they</hi> are to reign after the ceſſation of his reign; that they are to wear crowns which are incorruptible and fade not away; but that his crown is corruptible and fadeth away. Beſide; the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which the apoſtles and primitive chriſtians received, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Heb. XII. 28, was not the kingdom of the Father, as diſtinguiſhed from that of the Son, but was the kingdom of the Son, which he himſelf had then lately ſet up. <hi>This</hi> kingdom is ſaid to be incapable of being ſhaken or diſſolved; and therefore is endleſs, as Dr. C. himſelf believed: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it was abſurd for him to quote that text to prove, that the righteous will live and be happy without end.—Dan. VII. 14. "HIS" [the Son of man's]
<q>dominion is an <hi>everlaſting</hi> dominion, which <hi>ſhall not paſs away,</hi> and his kingdom that which <hi>ſhall not be deſtroyed.</hi>

<q>He ſhall reign over the houſe of Jacob <hi>forever,</hi> and of his kingdom there <hi>ſhall be no end.</hi>
                  </q>
—More determinate language could not be uſed, to expreſs the endleſs continuance of Chriſt's kingdom.</p>
               <p>IT is therefore granted, that the kingdom of Chriſt will continue, after the general judgment, and even without end. Yet it does not thence follow, that he will not at that time have finiſhed the mediatorial work, or rather the work of ſaving ſinners. I make this diſtinction, becauſe though Chriſt will at the general judgment, have finiſhed the work of ſaving ſinners from wrath; yet he will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end be the mediator between the Father and the ſaints, and will be the medium of all divine communications to them, whether of knowledge, of happineſs or of honour. It by no means follows from the circumſtance, that Chriſt will, after the general judgment, retain a kingly power and dominion, that he will exert that power in delivering ſinners from ſin and miſery.</p>
               <p>THE whole of Dr. C's diſcourſe on this ſubject implies, that the kingdom of the Father, in which he ſhall be all in all, will not begin immediately after the general judgment. But how can this be reconciled with Matt. XIII. 40—44;
<q>
                     <pb n="237" facs="unknown:022478_0242_0FB92F42B437A148"/>As therefore the tares are gathered and burnt in the fire; ſo ſhall it be <hi>in the end of this world.</hi> The Son of Man ſhall ſend forth his angels, and they ſhall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them that do ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; and ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire; there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth. <hi>Then,</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>at that very time,</hi> ſhall the righteous ſhine forth as the ſun <hi>in the kingdom of their</hi> FATHER.</q>
This ſingle text proves that the kingdom becomes the Father's immediately after the end of this world, and therefore entirely overthrows all Dr. C's labour to prove, that the kingdom does not become the Father's till ages of ages after the end of this world; and equally overthrows his great labour to fix a conſtruction on 1 Cor. XV. 24, conſiſtent with his ſcheme.</p>
               <p>BESIDE; the Doctor's conſtruction of the laſt paſſage mentioned ſeems to be abſurd in itſelf. For he
<q>connects the end,</q>
as to the time of it,
<q>with Chriſt's delivery of the kingdom to the Father.</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 198.</note> And by the <hi>end</hi> he in the ſame page explains himſelf to mean the
<q>ſhutting up of the ſcene of providence with reſpect to the ſons of Adam:</q>
which is and can be no other than the end of Chriſt's mediatorial kingdom. According to Dr. C. therefore, the apoſtle, under the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, gravely tells us, that the end of Chriſt's kingdom will be, when he ſhall deliver up his kingdom to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: or the end of it ſhall be at the very time, at which the end of it ſhall be! But what is this, but the moſt childiſh tautology! Who ever imagined, that Chriſt would ſtill retain his kingdom, after he ſhould have delivered it up? Surely that ſcheme muſt be in diſtreſs indeed, which requires ſuch conſtruction as this to be put on the ſacred ſcripture!</p>
               <p>DOCTOR C. ſays,
<q>The reward promiſed, under the adminiſtration of Chriſt's kingdom, <hi>in this preſent ſtate,</hi> in order to perſuade men to become his good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubjects, is not the final happineſs God intends to beſtow upon them; but the happineſs of that ſtate which intervenes between the reſurrection and God's being all in all.</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 222.</note> But all the promiſes of the Bible are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>in this preſent ſtate</hi>; therefore there are no promiſes in all the Bible of <hi>final</hi> happineſs. How then does Dr.
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:022478_0243_0FB92F4433013C58"/>
C. know that <hi>all</hi> men, or even <hi>any</hi> man will be finally happy? This is at once giving up his favourite doctrine, to eſtabliſh which he wrote his whole book.</p>
               <p>DOCTOR C. calls out,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 225.</note>
                  <q>What a poor, low, lean idea the common explanation of this text gives us of the final effects of Chriſt's reign—in compariſon with that, the above interpretation lets us into!</q>
Such excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations occur in almoſt every argument of his book. I obſerve therefore concerning them once for all, that they ſeem better ſuited to work on the paſſions and imagination, than on the reaſon; that at leaſt they are attempts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what is moſt for the general good and the glory of the Deity, not from revelation or from fact; but <hi>a priori,</hi> by our own imagination concerning what is beſt and moſt eligible. Now that we are in this way utterly incapable of determining what is moſt eligible, and moſt for the divine glory, in a thouſand inſtances; every man of reflection muſt grant.</p>
               <p>I HAVE now finiſhed my remarks on Dr. C's "deciſive" argument from 1 Cor. XV. 24, &amp;c. Whether it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed "deciſive;" whether it be "unanſwerably ſtong,"<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 211.</note> is ſubmitted to the reader.</p>
               <p>WE are next to conſider the Doctor's argument from Rev. V. 13;
<q>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them, heard I, ſaying, Bleſſing and honour, and glory and power be unto him, that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever.</q>
—The main queſtion concerning theſe words is, whether they
<q>look forward to a completion of the ſcheme of God,</q>
and aſſert a fact which is not to take place, till that ſcheme ſhall be completed. This is Dr. C's idea: he ſays, they
<q>they evidently look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the completion of that ſcheme;</q>
he ſays it merely; he gives no reaſon to <hi>prove</hi> it. The context gives no ſuggeſtions of ſuch an idea. It may be preſumed, that Dr. C. himſelf did not imagine, that the ſong of the four beaſts and four and twenty elders, contained in verſe 9th, &amp;c. looked forward to the completion of the ſcheme of God. It was evidently ſung on occaſion of the Lamb's taking the book ſealed with ſeven ſeals, and before any of theſe ſeals were opened. Nor is there the leaſt hint, but that what is deſcribed in the 13th verſe, took place
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:022478_0244_0FB92F4645B9F910"/>
on the ſame occaſion: but the narration naturally implies that it did then take place. The 14th verſe confirms the conſtruction now given.
<q>And the four beaſts ſaid, Amen. And the four and twenty elders fell down and worſhipped him that liveth forever and ever.</q>
Theſe words are evidently a part of the ſong mentioned in the 9th verſe, as it was ſung by the ſame four beaſts and four and twenty elders. Whereas according to Dr. C's conſtruction of the 13th verſe, they are either a ſong which is to be ſung after the completion of the ſcheme of God; or though they are a part of the ſong mentioned in the 9th verſe, the apoſtle's account of that ſong is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by inſerting in the midſt of it, a ſong to be ſung by all mankind, after the completion of the ſcheme of God. —To aſſert therefore, that the fact of the 13th verſe did not take place on the occaſion of the lamb's taking the book; but is to take place ages of ages after the end of this world; and to ſupport this aſſertion by no proof or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is to act an unreaſonable part: eſpecially conſidering the context and the difficulties attending that conſtruction.</p>
               <p>THESE words appear to contain a figurative repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all creatures joining in joy and praiſe to the Father and the lamb on occaſion of Chriſt's taking and being about to open the ſeals of the book ſealed with the ſeven ſeals; the book of providence toward the church. That ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations are common in ſcripture, we have already ſeen, while we were conſidering Rom. VIII, 19, &amp;c. Therefore no argument in favor of univerſal ſalvation is afforded by this paſſage.</p>
               <p>DR. C. mentions ſeveral other texts as favouring his ſcheme; but ſays himſelf, that he does not
<q>depend on them as proofs,</q>
or as "concluſive in themſelves." We need not therefore ſpend time to remark upon them. The reader of himſelf will eaſily conceive from the anſwers given to thoſe on which he does depend as concluſive, what anſwers would be given to the reſt.</p>
               <p>TOWARD the cloſe of that part of his book, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the direct evidence of univerſal ſalvation, Dr. C. comes down wonderfully, ſeems to relent, and to be ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the reſult of his own reaſoning. He owns, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, he may be miſtaken; that concerning the ſtate which he ſuppoſes will ſucceed the next ſtate, neither the prophets, Jeſus Chriſt, nor the apoſtles, have ſpoken in
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:022478_0245_0FB92F472F2A1CA8"/>
plain and explicit language, leaving no room for doubt.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 252, 253.</note> How theſe mild conceſſions are reconcileable with his many previous declarations, that his arguments are at leaſt in his opinion, "<hi>evident,</hi>" "<hi>deciſive,</hi>" "<hi>unanſwerably ſtrong</hi>;" that it is "<hi>poſitively</hi> affirmed" (in Rom. VIII. 19, &amp;c.) "that they—ſhall be inſtated in immortal glory;" that "it is <hi>abſolutely</hi> declared in this paſſage of ſcripture," (Rom. V. 12, &amp;c,) "that they" (mankind univerſally) "ſhall be made righteous," &amp;c, &amp;c. remains to be point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> In which Dr. C's ſcheme is conſidered, with a reference to his ideas of human liberty and moral agency.</head>
               <p>IT is an eſſential part of the ſyſtem of Dr. C. and of the generality of the advocates for univerſal ſalvation, that all fixed certainty of any actions of men, whether exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or internal, is inconſiſtent with liberty and moral agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in thoſe actions.—That this is really a tenet of the Doctor may appear from the following quotations.</p>
               <p>HE ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">Benev. of the Deity, P. <hi>219.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <q>Such exertions of the Deity, as ſhall be <hi>certainly effectual</hi> to reſtrain them</q>
[free agents]
<q>from perverting their faculties, look like a <hi>moral impoſſibility,</hi> or a method of conducting towards free agents, which is unfit, in the reaſon of things, as not being ſuited to the nature of ſuch kind of beings.</q>
He conſiders it as<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> "<hi>inconſiſtent with the powers beſtowed</hi>" on free agents, if
<q>by any extrinſic power, their faculties are unavoidably put into exerciſe <hi>in one certain</hi> way only.</q>
He aſks,
<q>If motives ſhould in all caſes be ſet in ſuch a ſtrong and powerful light, as that no wrong choice could be made— how could ſuch a method of operation <hi>conſiſt with the proper powers</hi> of free agents? It does not appear to the human mind, a thing fit, that they</q>
[free agents]
<q>ſhould be thus irreſiſtibly guided by any <hi>extrinſic</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, though it were even divine.</q>
And much more to the ſame effect is to be found in various parts of
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:022478_0246_0FB92F48B8038DC8"/>
our author's writings. Indeed it is indiſputably his ſcheme of liberty and moral agency, that if any power or cauſe extrinſic to the will itſelf, ſhould either <hi>certainly</hi> and <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually</hi> reſtrain free agents from perverting their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſin and vice; or <hi>certainly</hi> and <hi>effectually</hi> influence them to exerciſe their faculties in repentance and virtue, or in any one way; it would be entirely inconſiſtent with liberty and moral agency.</p>
               <p>THAT Doctor C. alſo held, that the future repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and ſalvation of all men, is certain, and that this certainty is cauſed and eſtabliſhed by a cauſe extrinſic to the will of all men, is evident in the following paſſages out of many,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 244.</note>

He ſpeaks<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 231.</note> of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as "<hi>infallibly</hi> ſelected for ſalvation."—In theſe paſſages it is manifeſt, that Dr. C. held, not only <hi>an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute infallible certainty</hi> of the ſalvation of ſome, yea of all men; but that this certainty is eſtabliſhed by God, and is the effect of his determination, and alſo, that all men will finally be brought to repentance, to
<q>the moral tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Abraham,</q>
                  <q>to a moral ſubjection to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God:</q>
and that they ſhall be
<q>
                     <hi>made</hi> righteous,</q>
and "<hi>formed into</hi> righteous perſons:" all which expreſſions imply a cauſe extrinſic to the will of man, which cauſe effectually and certainly operates to lead him to repentance, or to an
<q>exerciſe in one certain way only.</q>
How theſe things can be reconciled with
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:022478_0247_0FB92F4F77AA6D60"/>
the Doctor's avowed principles of liberty and moral agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is hard to be conceived.</p>
               <p>NOR was it through inattention, that the Doctor held an extrinſic cauſe certainly operating on the minds of men. It is a doctrine eſſential and important in his ſcheme, that all the damned will be finally and certainly brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and brought to repentance by the torments of hell too. Are not thoſe torments a cauſe extrinſic to the human will? If that cauſe be certainly effectual to lead the damned to repentance, what, on the Doctor's plan, becomes of their moral agency? If that cauſe be not certainly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to lead them all to repentance; it is not certain that all men will be ſaved—So that on the plan of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's book, either his grand doctrine of the final certain ſalvation of all men, by a diſciplinary puniſhment, muſt be given up, or it muſt be ſuppoſed, that all who are in that way ſaved, are diveſted of their moral agency and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to mere machines.</p>
               <p>INDEED if the ſalvation of all men be certain, and it be certain that all men will repent; it is by ſome cauſe or other <hi>made certain.</hi> That which is now a certain futurity, was a certain futurity from the beginning; yea from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. As it is now a certain futurity, that Chriſt will come to judgment, ſo it was certain from the beginning. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it be now a certain futurity, that all men will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be ſaved, it was a certain futurity from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; and that certainty was eſtabliſhed by ſome cauſe: and that cauſe muſt have been extrinſic to the wills of men; becauſe both the certainty and the cauſe of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted before the exiſtence of men or their wills.—So that if it be a real and certain truth, that all men will be ſaved, to prove which, Dr. C. wrote his whole book, it is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certain on his plan, that all men are diveſted of their moral agency.</p>
               <p>SHOULD it be ſtill pleaded, that this certainty of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all men, is not effected by any cauſe extrinſic to the wills of thoſe, who are to be ſaved, but by their wills themſelves; the abſurdity of this ſuppoſition muſt be gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to every man on the ſlighteſt reflection. A great part of thoſe who are to be ſaved, are not as yet in exiſtence: and it will not be pretended that their wills can have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an effect, or eſtabliſhed a certainty, before they exiſt. And doubtleſs Dr. C. and other univerſaliſts would
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:022478_0248_0FB92F5100C76EB0"/>
allow, that the ſalvation of thoſe who are in exiſtence, was as certain before their exiſtence, as the ſalvation of thoſe is, who are in future to come into exiſtence. But that certainty could not, for the reaſon already mentioned, be the effect of any exertion of their own wills.</p>
               <p>BESIDE; if it were not for this abſurdity, a certainty eſtabliſhed by the will of man with reſpect to the will it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as effectually binds that will, and is equally inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with its liberty, as if that certainty were eſtabliſhed by any other cauſe. Suppoſe the will of any man ſhall eſtabliſh in itſelf a <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>unfailing</hi> bias to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar action or ſeries of actions; it cannot be pretended that this fixed bias already eſtabliſhed, is any more conſiſtent with liberty and moral agency, in the man in whom the bias exiſts, than if it had been eſtabliſhed by any other cauſe. If a man were to cut off his own leg, though he might be more blamable for the act of cutting it off, than he would be for the ſame act performed by another; yet the effect, as to his ſubſequent inability to walk, would be the very ſame.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE whatever be the cauſe of the certainty and fixed futurity of the repentance and ſalvation of all men; the doctrine of the certain ſalvation of all men, is on Dr. C's plan of liberty, wholly inconſiſtent with human liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and implies that all men are, and ever have been, mere machines.</p>
               <p>IN vain does Dr. C. endeavour to relieve this difficulty, by obſerving in various paſſages, as in one of the quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions above, That this repentance is brought about
<q>in a moral way, ſuch an one as is adjuſted to moral agents.</q>
For he has told us that ſuch exertions of the Deity, as ſhall be <hi>certainly effectual</hi> to reſtrain free agents from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting their faculties, and ſuch an influence of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic power, motives or whatever, as ſhall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unavoidably put their faculties into exerciſe in one way only, are not adjuſted to moral agents; but are inconſiſtent with their proper powers. Therefore, according to the Doctor, it is not in the power of the Deity himſelf, certainly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly to lead all men, in a moral way, to repentance. It is a direct contradiction. And though he obſerves,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 167.</note> That that being who is infinitely perfect will be able, in a moral way, finally to counteract human obſtinacy; he is utterly
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:022478_0249_0FB92F52ADDA9620"/>
miſtaken, if there be any truth in his idea of liberty. If God were to overcome human obſtinacy, an extrinſic cauſe would effectually and certainly incline the human faculties to an exerciſe in one way; winch the Doctor ſays is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with moral agency.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor tells us,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 344, 345.</note> that to
<q>repreſent hell to the view of ſinners in ſuch a ſtriking light, as that they ſhould be irreſiſtibly ſtopped in their wicked purſuits, would not comport with their free agency.</q>
Yet he ſuppoſes, that to be in hell, and to feel its torments ſo ſtrikingly as to be <hi>certainly and infallibly</hi> ſtopped in wicked purſuits, and thus to be brought to repentance, is to be brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in a moral way, entirely comporting with free agency.</p>
               <p>UPON Dr. C's plan of liberty, there not only is not, and cannot be, any certainty, that <hi>all</hi> men will be ſaved; but there is not, and cannot be, any certainty that <hi>any one</hi> man will be ſaved. The Divine Being himſelf cannot make it certain, without deſtroying moral agency. Not any of the promiſes of the goſpel give us aſſurance of the ſalvation of any man: nor is it in the power of God to give a promiſe of ſalvation which ſhall inſure the event, ſo long as men remain moral agents. Therefore it was to no purpoſe that Dr. C. quoted ſo many promiſes and ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural declarations to prove the ſalvation of all men.</p>
               <p>ON the ſame hypotheſis concerning liberty, even though all men were delivered from hell and admitted to heaven, there would be no certainty that they would continue there. They would be conſtantly liable to ſin anew, and bring on themſelves a ſecond damnation. To deny this, would be, to allow that their faculties might conſiſtently with moral agency, be <hi>certainly</hi> and <hi>fixedly</hi> inclined to "exerciſe themſelves in one way only."</p>
               <p>THAT the inhabitants of heaven are liable to ſin and damnation, is actually allowed by honeſt Biſhop Newton.
<q>This life is indeed a ſtate of trial,<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Newton's works, vol. VI. p. <hi>361.</hi>
                     </note> but not a trial to fix our fate forever, without any poſſibility of changing for better or for worſe, in the world to come. For if the righteous can be but righteous, and the wicked can be but wicked, and cannot act otherwiſe; there is an utter end of all freedom of will and morality of action.
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:022478_0250_0FB92F546AA6CAF0"/>
Their virtue ceaſes to be virtue, and their ſin is no longer ſin.</q>
—
<q>The ſcripture <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 362.</note>aſſures us, that in the next life men will be made (Luke XX. 36.) equal unto the angels; but angels, we know, have apoſtatized and and fallen; and why may not men, even when made equal unto the angels?—If righteouſneſs <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 360.</note> ſhould degenerate and become wickedneſs; or if wickedneſs ſhould amend and become righteouſneſs; the tables would then be turned, and with the change of their nature, their ſtate and condition would be changed too.</q>
How then is it certain that all men will be finally holy and happy? It neither is, nor can poſſibly be certain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe certainty in this caſe would imply that
<q>the righteous can be but righteous;</q>
and ſo
<q>there would be an utter end of all freedom of will and morality of action.</q>
               </p>
               <p>WHAT then becomes of the boaſted evidence of the final ſalvation of all men? There is no certain evidence of it. There is not, nor can be, on this ſcheme of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, any certain evidence but that all men will finally apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatize, and of courſe be doomed to miſery correſpondent to their wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>IT is true, the Biſhop abundantly contradicts this ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning liberty, and holds that the damned muſt repent, and cannot but repent, as in the following paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
<q>It is <hi>impoſſible</hi> for any creature to live in eternal torments—If nothing elſe yet his own ſenſations and feelings <hi>muſt</hi> bring him one time or other, to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of his ſin and of his duty.</q>

               <p>FROM the ſame hypotheſis it follows that God himſelf does not and cannot poſſibly govern mankind with certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that there is no foundation to pray for any event which depends on the volitions of our own minds, or thoſe of other men; that there is no ground for confidence in the divine providence; and that it is impoſſible that any future free actions of men, or any events depending on thoſe actions, ſhould be certainly foretold, or even fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known by God himſelf; becauſe what is abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, cannot be certainly known, and what is certainly known is certainly fixed and determined. But it is not conſiſtent with my deſign to enlarge on the endleſs abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of this ſcheme of human liberty, abſurdities from which, though long ſince pointed out to belong to that ſcheme, the ableſt advocates for it, have not been able, and it is preſumed never will be able, to clear it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> A reply to Dr. C's anſwers to the arguments in favour of endleſs puniſhment, drawn from thoſe texts, which declare the puniſhment of the damned to be <hi>everlaſting, forever, forever and ever,</hi> and the fire of hell to be unquenchable,</head>
               <p>DOCTOR C. ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 258.</note> that the miſery of the damned is ſaid to be <hi>eternal</hi> or <hi>everlaſting,</hi> in five texts only in all the New Teſtament. Whatever was intended by this ambiguous propoſition, the fact doubtleſs is, that many of his readers have been groſſly deceived by it, as they have been led to believe, that the doctrine of endleſs puniſhment is apparently taught, in no more than five texts in all the New Teſtament; or that no more than five texts can be produced, the words of which ſeem to import an endleſs puniſhment. Whereas, all that Dr. C. or any man can pretend is, that the puniſhment of the damned is in five
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:022478_0252_0FB92F59A63F07E8"/>
texts only, in the New Teſtament, aſſerted to be <hi>eternal,</hi> by the uſe of the adjective <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, commonly tranſlated <hi>eternal</hi> or <hi>everlaſting.</hi> It cannot be pretended, but that the texts in which the puniſhment of the damned is in ſome manner or other declared to be eternal, and in words as determinate, as the adjective, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, eternal, far exceed the number <hi>five.</hi> The five texts now referred to, do not compriſe any of thoſe, in which the damned are ſaid to be puniſhed forever, forever and ever; to be puniſhed by a worm that dieth not, and a fire that is not quenched; to be confined by an impaſſable gulf; to be ſhut out from the kingdom of heaven; not to ſee life, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>NOW what follows from this circumſtance, that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the damned is in five texts only, in the New-Teſtament, declared to be eternal, by the application of the Greek adjective, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>? It may ſtill be declared to be eternal, by other words equally determinate, in above five hundred texts.</p>
               <p>OR if there were no other texts, expreſſing in other words, endleſs puniſhment; are not five divine aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of any truth, ſufficient to bind our faith? If five be not ſufficient for this end, neither are five thouſand.</p>
               <p>BESIDES; all that Dr C. ſays on this head, may be juſtly retorted: and if his obſervations in page 259, 260, be of any force to ſhow, that the doctrine of endleſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is not caught in the ſcriptures; juſt as forcibly may it be proved, that the damned will not be puniſhed for an age. Suppoſing, as Dr. C. does, that the words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. do not mean an endleſs duration, but the duration of <hi>an age</hi>; I might ſay,
<q>The miſery of the wicked is ſaid to be <hi>for an age,</hi> in only five texts, in all in all the New Teſtament: Upon which I cannot help making a pauſe to expreſs my ſurprize to find the ſacred writers ſo very ſparing in the uſe of this word <hi>age,</hi> as referring to future torments. It is uſed but three times by Matthew; but once by Mark; but once by Paul; and not once by the other writers of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. All which is very extraordinary, if it be a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſtianity, that the wicked are to be puniſhed <hi>for an age.</hi>—And the omiſſions of the ſacred writers upon this head, are a ſtrong preſumptive argument, that they know nothing of this doctrine, which has been ſo vehemently pleaded for in theſe latter days,</q>
by Dr.
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:022478_0253_0FB92F5BD2553108"/>
C. and ſome others. Therefore, whenever it ſhall be proved, that notwithſtanding the rare uſe of the word <hi>age,</hi> with a reference to the puniſhment of the wicked, that puniſhment will really laſt <hi>for an age;</hi> it is preſumed, that it can be proved from the ſame topics, that it will laſt <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end.</hi>—If a word, ſignifying an age, applied five times to future puniſhment, prove that puniſhment to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for an age; why will not a word ſignifying an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs duration, applied five times to that puniſhment, prove it to be without end? Nothing therefore can be concluded from the number of times, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>eternal,</hi> is applied to future puniſhment. The whole queſtion, in this ſtate of it, depends on the proper meaning of the word; not at all on the frequency of its uſe.</p>
               <p>DR. C. ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 260.</note>
                  <q>That <gap reason="foreign">

and that
<q>from this remark it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the preceding evidence in favour of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſalvation, remains ſtrong and valid.</q>
It is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that if thoſe words <hi>may</hi> ſignify, and all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, do <hi>as probably</hi> ſignify, a limited, as an unlimited duration, when applied to the puniſhment of the wicked; nothing either for or againſt endleſs puniſhment, can be concluded from the uſe of thoſe words. It is alſo, on the ſame ſuppoſitions, acknowledged, that by that application of thoſe words, the evidence which Dr. C. has exhibited in favour of the ſalvation of all men, is not at all impaired. But it is not granted, that thoſe words, when applied to the puniſhment of the wicked, do as probably ſignify a limited as unlimited duration. Nor is it granted that Dr. C's evidence of univerſal ſalvation is valid. Though we ſhould grant that it remains unimpaired by the words <gap reason="foreign">

i. e. If it may poſſibly ſignify a period of time

only, it is abſolutely certain, that when it is applied to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puniſhment, it does ſignify a period of time only. The inconcluſiveneſs of ſuch argumentation muſt be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to every reader. In the ſame manner it is eaſy to prove,
<q>that there is not the ſhadow of an interference between the connection of <gap reason="foreign">

with the life and happineſs of the righteous, and their final damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 261.</note> ſays,
<q>Theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
are evidently more looſe and general in their meaning, than the Engliſh words <hi>eternity, everlaſting</hi>—If it were not ſo, how comes it to paſs, that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
will not always bear being tranſlated eternity, everlaſting?</q>
By the ſame argument it may be proved, that the words <hi>eternity</hi> and <hi>everlaſting</hi> in our language, are more looſe and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in their meaning, than the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. We frequently ſay, ſuch a man is an everlaſting talker, or he talks eternally; he is eternally ſlandering and quarrelling with his neighbours. But according to Dr. C's ſenſe of the Greek words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Engliſh phraſes juſt mentioned cannot be properly tranſlated, by the uſe of thoſe Greek words. The Doctor ſays, they properly mean the duration of an age. But when it is ſaid, a man talks eternally, the meaning is not, that he talks <hi>for an age.</hi>—The truth is, there are idioms in all languages, which will not bear a literal tranſlation into any other language.—The circumſtance that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, will not always bear to be rendered <hi>eternity</hi> and <hi>eternal,</hi> no more proves, that they do not properly ſignify the ſame with our words <hi>eternity</hi> and <hi>eternal,</hi> than the circumſtance that they will not always bear to be rendered <hi>an age,</hi> and <hi>during an age,</hi> proves that they do not properly ſignify the duration of an age. It is ſaid, Rom. XVI. 26.
<q>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the commandment of the <hi>everlaſting God,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>;</q>
but no man would render this, according to the commandment of the God <hi>who lives for an age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Doctor thinks that
<q>before <hi>eternal times</hi> is an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in Engliſh,</q>
and hence infers, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Tit. I. 2, means a limited duration. It is preſumed, that the Doctor would not have objected to the propriety of expreſſing a proper eternity, by ſaying, <hi>From eternity, from everlaſting, from eternal ages.</hi> Yet in reality there
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:022478_0255_0FB92F5E69DD4130"/>
is as great an impropriety in theſe expreſſions, as in that which the Doctor pronounces an impropriety. Underſtood ſtrictly and literally they imply, that there is a point at which eternity began, and <hi>from eternity</hi> is from that point. The very uſe of the prepoſition <hi>from</hi> implies this. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that the computation is made <hi>from</hi> ſomething, at which eternity began. This ſomething muſt ſtrictly be ſome time, or ſome point in endleſs duration. So that <hi>from eternity</hi> taken ſtrictly, is as real and as great an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety as <hi>before eternity or before eternal times.</hi> The ſame is obſervable of <hi>to eternity.</hi> Yet <hi>from eternity</hi> and <hi>to eternity,</hi> are in fact uſed among us to expreſs an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute eternity: and how does it appear abſurd, that the apoſtle ſhould expreſs the ſame idea by a phraſe, in which no greater impropriety is naturally implied, and which may as well, and in the ſame way, as the phraſes <hi>from eternity</hi> and <hi>to eternity,</hi> be made properly to ſignify an abſolute e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity? The impropriety ſuppoſed to be in the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Before eternal times,</hi> is, that it implies a beginning to eternity. The ſame is implied in the expreſſion <hi>from eternity:</hi> and in the phraſe <hi>to eternity</hi> it is implied that there is an end to eternity. But I mean not to inſiſt on this: I do but juſt mention it, to ſhow, that Dr. C's moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite proof, that <gap reason="foreign">

—The literal conſtruction of Philem. 15, 16, is,
<q>That thou mighteſt receive him eternal, no longer as a ſervant, but above a ſervant, a brother;</q>
or more briefly thus;
<q>That thou mighteſt receive him as an eternal brother.</q>
That Oneſimus was, in the endleſs ſenſe, become an eternal brother to Philemon, and that as ſuch he ought to be received by Philemon, cannot be diſputed, provided they both were, as the apoſtle ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them to be, real Chriſtians.—The final judgment intended in Heb. VI. 2, may with the ſame propriety be called an <hi>endleſs</hi> judgment, becauſe it refers to an endleſs duration to follow; as it may be called the judgment <hi>of an age</hi> or <hi>diſpenſation,</hi> becauſe it refers to an age or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation which ſhall then have been paſt.—As to the fire ſuffered by the Sodomites, if the text mean the fire of hell, then Jude 7, is to be added to the five texts, in which it is acknowledged <gap reason="foreign">

refers to future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If it mean the fire in which they and their city were conſumed in this world, it can be called eternal, or <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, with reſpect to the effect only: and to ſay that this effect is to laſt for a limited time only, is the ſame as to ſay, that the Sodomites are finally to be ſaved; which is to beg the grand queſtion.</p>
               <p>AS to 2 Tim. I. 9, and Tit. I. 2, without inſiſting on what has been obſerved in page 249, 250, if it ſhould be granted, that in theſe two inſtances <gap reason="foreign">

is uſed in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited ſenſe, I conceive no injury would reſult to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine for which I plead. It will not be diſputed that the words <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>everlaſting</hi> in our language, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed in a limited ſenſe: and perhaps no book written in the Engliſh language, eſpecially written by ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent authors, and at ſuch diſtant times, as the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, can be found, in which the word <hi>eternal</hi> is uſed ſeventy times, and not twice at leaſt in the limited ſenſe.</p>
               <p>AS the proper meaning of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
is ſo much inſiſted on by Dr. C. and as he triumphs in the idea, that it is almoſt perpetually, by the ſacred writers, uſed in the limited ſenſe, I muſt beg the patience of the reader,
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:022478_0259_0FB92F6B706BF348"/>
while I deſcend to the conſideration of the particular texts, in which it occurs. In forty-four of the forementioned ſixty-ſix texts, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
is applied to the future life of the righteous, and therefore is uſed in the endleſs ſenſe. If this be not allowed, it will follow, that there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, no ſecurity of an endleſs life to the righteous, or to any of mankind, and of courſe univerſal ſalvation muſt be given up; as ſhall be more particularly ſhown preſently. In Luke XVI. 9, it is applied to the celeſtial habitations of the righteous: in 2 Cor. IV. 17, to the future glory of the righteous: in 2 Cor. V. 1, to their houſe in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: in 2 Theſſ. II. 16, to their conſolation: in 2 Tim. II. 10, to their future glory: in Heb. V. 9. to their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: in Heb. IX. 15, to their future inheritance. That in theſe ſeven inſtances it is uſed in the endleſs ſenſe, will doubtleſs be granted, by all thoſe who allow this to be the ſenſe of it in the preceding forty-four. In Feb. IX. 12, it is applied to the redemption of Chriſt: in Heb. XIII. 20, to the covenant of grace: in Rev. XIV. 6, to the goſpel. That in theſe three inſtances, it is uſed in the endleſs ſenſe, it is preſumed, there can be no diſpute among Chriſtians. The ſenſe is ſtill more determinate, when it is applied to the Deity or his perfections, as it is to God himſelf, in Rom. XVI. 9: to the divine power, in 2 Tim. VI, 16: to the divine glory, in 1 Pet. V. 10: to the Holy Ghoſt, in Heb. <hi>IX.</hi> 14—In 2 Cor. <hi>IV.</hi> 18, it is applied to things unſeen, as oppoſed to things ſeen: and to ſuppoſe, that in this inſtance it means the duration of an age or diſpenſation only, would deſtroy all oppoſition between things ſeen and things unſeen; becauſe many of the former continue for an nge or diſpenſation, as well as the latter. The bare writing of this paſſage, ſo as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a limited duration, ſufficiently confutes that ſenſe: thus,
<q>The things which are ſeen, are temporal; but the things which are unſeen, continue for an age or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.</q>
—In 2 Pet. I. 11, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, is applied to the kingdom of Chriſt. I am aware, that the believers in Dr. C's book, will hold, that in this inſtance, it is uſed in the limited ſenſe, becauſe according to that book, the kingdom of Chriſt is of mere temporary continuance. To aſſert this however is a mere begging of a queſtion in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. That this kingdom is not of mere temporary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,

               <p>DR. C.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 272.</note> thinks
<q>it is evident from the very texts that are brought to prove the ſtrict eternity of hell-tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they contain no ſuch doctrine.</q>
This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is ſupported by the following conſiderations—That in two texts the word <hi>everlaſting</hi> is applied to the fire of hell, not to the puniſhment or miſery of the wicked— That fire in its own nature tends to an end, and will by
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:022478_0261_0FB92F6EEB7FAA78"/>
the laws of nature neceſſarily in time come to an end— That fire powerfully tends to bring on a diſſolution of thoſe bodies that are caſt into it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT the word <hi>everlaſting</hi> is applied, in two texts, to the <hi>fire,</hi> not to the <hi>puniſhment,</hi> of hell; hence the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor infers, in words which he quotes with approbation from <hi>Nichol Scot,</hi> that though
<q>the fire be without end, it will not follow, that every individual ſubject, which is caſt into it, muſt be ſo too.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 272.</note> Did the Doctor then believe, that ſome of the ſubjects of hell-fire will not exiſt without end, but will be annihilated? This is to give up the ſalvation of all men.—Beſides; that the fire of hell will be kept up without end, and therefore eternal ages after all the ſubjects ſhall be either annihilated or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of it, is a mere conjecture, unſupported by any evidence from ſcripture or reaſon. As well might the Doctor have ſaid, The ſaints will indeed be received to everlaſting habitations; the <hi>habitations</hi> will be ſtrictly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end; but the <hi>ſaints</hi> will, after a while, be all either annihilated or ſent to hell.—What if the word everlaſting be in <hi>two</hi> inſtances applied to the <hi>fire</hi> of hell? In other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it is applied to the <hi>puniſhment,</hi> to the <hi>deſtruction,</hi> to the <hi>ſmoke of the torment,</hi> and to the <hi>torment</hi> itſelf of the damned, Rev.

<q>ſhall be <hi>tormented,</hi> day and night, forever and ever.</q>
And if, when applied to the <hi>fire,</hi> it prove that to be without end, doubtleſs when applied to the <hi>puniſhment,</hi> to the <hi>deſtruction,</hi> to the <hi>torment,</hi> it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually proves them to be without end.</p>

                  <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 273.</note>—This, like many other of Dr. C's argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if it prove any thing, proves too much, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore really proves nothing. It depends on this very falſe principle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that whatever, according to the laws of nature, eſtabliſhed in this world, would, without an immediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine interpoſition, come to an end, will certainly come to an end in the future world. Now according to this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, all the bodies of both ſinners and ſaints, in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture world, as well as this, will be diſſolved. Nay, as their ſouls too are conſtantly upholden in exiſtence by the agency of God, and would in their own nature immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ceaſe to exiſt, were it not for that continued agency;
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:022478_0262_0FB92F7073DA5290"/>
it follows, according to the principle now under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that all the ſouls of both ſinners and ſaints will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually come to an end, in the future world. But as this conſequence will be rejected, and as it will be granted, that the ſouls of all men will, by the agency of God, be upholden without end; ſo the ſame agency will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to continue the fire of hell without end; and that whether it be material fire or not. If it be not material fire, it does not, in its own nature, more tend to an end, than the ſouls of men, or the faculties of thoſe ſouls. If it be material fire, ſtill it may, as was juſt now obſerved, be perpetuated to an abſolute eternity.</p>
               <p>IF this argument from the tendency of fire to an end, be of any force, it will overthrow Dr. C's ſcheme, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the contrary. For it is equally the tendency of all the fire, of which we have any experience, to come to an end, in a ſhort time, as to come to an end at all. No fire in this world will, without new ſupplies of fuel, laſt for ages of ages, or even for one age. But with a proper ſupply of fuel, any fire may be kept up without end. If therefore we are to conclude, that the fire of hell will come to an end, becauſe the fire of which we have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, will without a new and conſtant ſupply of fuel, come to an end; we are alſo to conclude, that the fire of hell will come to an end, before the expiration of one age. —Indeed God can make the fire of hell laſt for an age: and he can with equal eaſe make it laſt without end. Nay, he can make our common fire laſt without end. The ſame power which ſhall make our bodies immortal, can make our common fire ſtrictly eternal. To this end the nature of that fire needs no greater alteration, than the nature of our bodies needs, to render them immortal.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor informs<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 274.</note> us, that he
<q>ſees not but an age, diſpenſation or period, for the continuance of this fire, will very well anſwer the full import of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>everlaſting</hi>; eſpecially, if we ſuppoſe this age to laſt till the fire has accompliſhed the end, for which it was enkindled.</q>
—But it is not allowed by the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents of the Doctor, that the fire will ever have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed the end, for which it was enkindled: and to argue on that ſuppoſition, is to take for granted, what is as much in diſpute, as any ſubject of this whole controverſy.—He
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:022478_0263_0FB92F71F3FDF3A8"/>
adds, The words concerning Sodom and Gomorrah,
<q>They are ſet forth for an example, ſuffering the vengeance of eternal fire,</q>
                  <q>import no more than this, that this fire laſted till it had accompliſhed the deſign of heaven, in the deſtruction of thoſe cities, for a ſtanding exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the divine <hi>vengeance</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Let it be remembered, that Dr. C. is a bitter enemy to <hi>vindictive</hi> puniſhment.</note> to after ages.</q>
And the fire of hell is
<q>doubtleſs called everlaſting for the like reaſon.</q>
According to this then, the word <hi>everlaſting,</hi> &amp;c, applied to future puniſhment, gives no evidence, that that puniſhment is to laſt longer, than the time, during which the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were in conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or longer than one day: and the flood of Noah, as it laſted till it had accompliſhed the deſign of heaven in the deſtruction of the old world, for a ſtanding public ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the divine vengeance to after ages, was an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal flood: The deaths of Korah, Dathan and Abiram, of Nadab and Abihu, of Zimri and Coſbi, &amp;c, &amp;c, were for the ſame reaſons <hi>eternal deaths.</hi>—But how is this ſenſe of everlaſting conſiſtent with that for which Dr. C. abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contends, that it ſignifies the duration of an age? And if "the fire of hell be doubtleſs called everlaſting," in the former ſenſe, how does it appear, that it ever is, or that it can conſiſtently be, called everlaſting in the latter ſenſe?</p>
               <p n="3">3.
<q>Fire powerfully tends to bring on a ſolution of continuity, in thoſe bodies, that are caſt into it;</q>
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the puniſhment of hell is not endleſs.<note n="**" place="bottom">P. 276.</note> So fire tends to bring on a diſſolution of the human body in a very ſhort time, in one hour, or in a much ſhorter time: therefore the puniſhment of hell will not laſt for ages of ages, or for one age, or even for one day. This argument is juſt as concluſive, as that now quoted from Dr. C. He who can make an human body endure the fire of hell for an age, can make it endure the ſame fire, for an endleſs ſucceſſion of ages. Therefore though fire does powerfully tend to bring on a diſſolution of thoſe bodies, which are caſt into it, it by no means thence follows, either that ſuch diſſolution will be effected in the wicked; or that their torment will ever come to an end.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="unknown:022478_0264_0FB92F73E92635D0"/>The Doctor proceeds<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 277.</note> to argue, that future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will not be endleſs, becauſe
<q>the wicked are not ſaid <hi>to live always in torment without dying</hi>; or that their bodies ſhall be immortal, or incorruptible, or indiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but that they ſhall reap corruption, be deſtroyed, periſh, undergo death.</q>
On this paſſage it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked,</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT by <hi>dying, corruption, deſtruction, periſhing, the ſecond death,</hi> he evidently means ſomething different from torment; as he ſets thoſe terms in oppoſition to torment or miſery. Yet he tells us in the very ſame page, that
<q>the ſecond death, which wicked men ſhall paſs through, and their being caſt into the lake of fire, mean—one and the ſame thing.</q>
In other parts of his book, he declares, that everlaſting deſtruction evidently means <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 224.</note>—that

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 337.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. IF by <hi>death, deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c, Dr. C. mean any thing different from the torment of the damned, it ſeems he muſt mean, either annihilation, or a diſſolution of the connection of the ſouls and bodies of the damned, and their tranſition from the ſtate, in which they are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after this life, to the next ſucceeding ſtate. If he mean the former, it is indeed oppoſed to their endleſs miſery, and equally oppoſed to their final ſalvation. If he mean a tranſition of the damned to ſome other ſtate, this is no proof againſt endleſs miſery; becauſe the Doctor himſelf ſuppoſes, that the damned, or ſome of them at leaſt, will paſs through ſeveral ſucceeding ſtates of miſery. And let them paſs through ever ſo many ſucceeding ſtates, there is no evidence ariſing from this bare tranſition, that they will ever be ſaved. So that let the Doctor mean, in this caſe, what he will, by <hi>death, deſtruction,</hi> &amp;c, thoſe words are either not at all oppoſed to the endleſs miſery of the wicked, or they are equally oppoſed to their endleſs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Whether they do mean annihilation or not, has been already conſidered in Chap. V. The truth undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly is, what Dr. C. himſelf abundantly holds, though
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:022478_0265_0FB92F74E9C45A30"/>
in writing this paſſage, he ſeems to have forgotten it; that the death, deſtruction, corruption, ſecond death of the damned, is their miſery or torment, the ſmoke of which ſhall aſcend forever and ever, and in which in Rev. XX. 10, they are expreſſly ſaid to be tormented forever and ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IF the expreſs words
<q>The wicked ſhall <hi>always live in torment, without dying,</hi>
                  </q>
be not written in ſcripture, yet it is there written, that
<q>they ſhall go into everlaſting puniſhment;</q>
that
<q>the ſmoke of their torment ſhall aſcend forever and ever,</q>
                  <q>that they ſhall be <hi>tormented</hi> forever and ever,</q>
&amp;c. In Rev. XX. 10, it is ſaid,
<q>The devil that deceived them, was caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, where the beaſt and the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet are, and <hi>they ſhall be tormented</hi> day and night for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever;</q>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the plural number. Now ſo long as a perſon is tormented, he lives in torment without dying: and to be tormented forever and ever, is to live always in torment without dying. What right then had Dr. C. to ſay, that the wicked are not ſaid to live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in torment without dying? And if the very words juſt quoted from Dr. C. had been inſerted in the ſacred volume, they might have been explained away as eaſily as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions juſt now quoted from ſcripture, and as the many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declarations of endleſs torment which are there to be found. It might have been ſaid, The wicked, while ſuch, ſhall indeed always live in torment; but no ſooner ſhall they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and become righteous, than they ſhall be delivered from their torment, into endleſs bliſs. The righteous are no more in the very words ſaid to be immortal in happineſs, than the wicked are ſaid to be immortal in miſery; and ſhall we therefore deny, that they are to be immortal in happineſs? If it had been ſaid, that the wicked ſhall be incorruptible or indiſſoluble in miſery, it might have been pleaded, with as much plauſibility, as attends many of Dr. C's pleas, that this meant, that while they are in miſery, they are incorruptible, &amp;c, not that they ſhall without end remain in miſery.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor tells us,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 279.</note> that
<q>the texts which join <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>everlaſting,</hi> with the miſery of the wicked, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few in compariſon with thoſe, which join with it a diſſolution, deſtruction, or death.</q>
That this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:022478_0266_0FB92F78DE392308"/>
may be at all to the purpoſe, it ought to be ſhown— 1. That deſtruction, death, &amp;c, as applied in ſcripture to the damned, are inconſiſtent with their endleſs miſery, and are not at the ſame time, equally inconſiſtent with their final ſalvation.—2. That whenever there is a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconſiſtency between ſeveral paſſages of ſcripture, and to relieve the difficulty, we are neceſſitated to underſtand ſome of them in a figurative ſenſe; we are to determine, that the truth is according to the literal tenor of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number, and that the minority, as in popular aſſemblies, is always to give way to the majority, and complaiſantly ſubmit to a figurative conſtruction.</p>
               <p>A VIEW has now been taken of Dr. C's arguments to prove, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>eternity</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>eternal,</hi> do not in the ſacred writings properly mean an endleſs duration. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the validity of thoſe arguments, it is the province of the reader to judge.</p>
               <p>WE are next to attend to the Doctor's anſwer to the argument drawn from the circumſtance, that the ſame word in ſcripture is uſed to expreſs the duration of the miſery of the wicked, as is uſed to expreſs the duration of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the righteous, and that in the ſame text; as Mat. XXV. 46; "Theſe ſhall go away into eternal puniſhment, but the righteous into eternal life."</p>
               <p>THE Doctor's firſt anſwer to this argument is, that the ſtate next ſucceeding the preſent, is not final, either with reſpect to the wicked or the righteous: and therefore the word <hi>eternal,</hi> even when applied to the life of the righteous, means not an endleſs duration.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 282.</note> For this hypotheſis he gives no new reaſons, but refers us to what he had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which we have already conſidered,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 234, &amp;c.</note> and the ſum of which is, that Chriſt's kingdom is not to continue without end, but is at laſt to be delivered up to the Father; that the reward promiſed in ſcripture to the righteous is to be beſtowed upon them in this kingdom of Chriſt; that that reward therefore cannot be without end.—In oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this, it has been ſhown, that the ſcriptures abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly aſſure us, that the kingdom of Chriſt is to be without end; and that whatever is ſaid in ſcripture concerning Chriſt's reſignation of the kingdom to the Father, muſt be underſtood in a conſiſtency with the endleſs duration of Chriſt's kingdom: and an attempt was made, to ſhow in what ſenſe of reſigning the kingdom, a conſiſtency can be preſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="unknown:022478_0267_0FB92F7AF0F07CF8"/>FURTHER; the idea now advanced by Dr. C. cannot be admitted, in a conſiſtency either with the ſcriptures, nor with Dr. C. himſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not with the ſcriptures. For if Mat. XXV. 46, and the many other texts, which promiſe <hi>eternal</hi> life to the righteous, do not promiſe them an endleſs life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, there is no promiſe of ſuch happineſs to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in all the ſcripture: and with at leaſt as much plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, as the Doctor evades the force of Mat. XXV. 46; may the force of any text be evaded, which can be brought to prove the endleſs life of the righteous. Let us conſider thoſe, which the Doctor ſuppoſes <hi>determine</hi> the future life and happineſs of the righteous to be endleſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 286.</note> Luke XX. 36; "Neither can they die any more." This may be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded two ways; it may be ſaid to mean no more, than that they ſhall not die during the continuance of Chriſt's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and the original happily favours this conſtruction. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Neither can they die <hi>as yet</hi>; their death will be deferred till the end of Chriſt's kingdom.— It may alſo be evaded thus, If they cannot <hi>die</hi> any more they may <hi>live in miſery.</hi>—1 Cor. IX. 25;
<q>But we an incorruptible crown.</q>
True, the <hi>crown</hi> may be incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible indeed! but the poſſeſſor may be very corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: as Dr. C. ſuppoſes the <hi>fire</hi> of hell may be endleſs, though the wicked ſhall all be delivered out of it in time. —And when the bodies of the ſaints are ſaid to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>incorruptible,</hi> to put on <hi>incorruption, immortality,</hi> &amp;c, this may mean indeed, that they ſhall exiſt and live, but not that they ſhall be happy without end.—
<q>We receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a kingdom, which cannot be moved,</q>
Heb. XII. 28; the <hi>kingdom</hi> may indeed be immovable; yet a great part of the <hi>ſubjects</hi> may be removed.—1 Pet. I. 4;
<q>He hath begotten us—to an inheritance incorruptible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and that fadeth not away.</q>
All this may be true concerning the <hi>inheritance,</hi> yet all the heirs from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, of that inheritance, may be removed from the poſſeſſion of it, and in that ſenſe, may fade away.—Rev. II. 11;
<q>He that overcometh, ſhall not be hurt of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death.</q>
He may however be hurt of the third, fourth or fifth death.—Chap. XXI. 4;
<q>God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there ſhall be no more death.</q>
Here alſo I avail myſelf of the original:
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:022478_0268_0FB92F7C78396EC0"/>
it may be literally rendered,
<q>The death ſhall not be <hi>as yet.</hi>
                  </q>

IV. 17, means no more, than that the ſaints, while they are in heaven, ſhall be uninterruptedly with Chriſt; as John XII. 8, means, that while we are in the world, we uninterruptedly have the poor with us.</p>
               <p>THUS by admitting Dr. C's ſenſe of Mat. XXV. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>6, we eraſe from the ſcriptures every promiſe of endleſs life and happineſs to the righteous, and overthrow the goſpel.— Indeed Dr. C. expreſſly holds, that there is no promiſe in the goſpel of endleſs happineſs to any man; how conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently with himſelf, the reader will judge. <note n="§" place="bottom">P. 222.</note>
                  <q>The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward promiſed, under the adminiſtration of Chriſt's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in the preſent ſtate, in order to perſuade men to become his good and faithful ſubjects, is not the final happineſs God intends to beſtow upon them; but the happineſs of that ſtate, which intervenes between the reſurrection and God's being all in all.</q>
Yet<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 286, &amp;c.</note> he quotes the texts remarked on in the laſt paragraph, and ſays they <hi>determine,</hi> that the happineſs of the righteous is to be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: and were not thoſe texts ſuppoſed by Dr. C. to be promiſes, given under the adminiſtration of Chriſt's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in this preſent ſtate, in order to perſuade men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his good and faithful ſubjects?</p>
               <p n="2">2. NOR is Dr. C's conſtruction of Matt. XXV. 46, any more conſiſtent with his own ſcheme, than it is with the Bible. His whole ſcheme ſuppoſes, that all men will be finally happy: and he believed that the doctrine of final happineſs is taught in ſcripture. He profeſſes to ground his whole book immediately on ſcripture. But if there be no promiſe in ſcripture, of endleſs happineſs, as is implied in his conſtruction of Matt. XXV. 46; and as he expreſſly holds, in page 222; his whole ſcheme falls to the ground.</p>
               <p>THAT Dr. C. does in other parts of his book, hold that there are promiſes of endleſs happineſs, does not relieve the matter. To be inconſiſtent and to contradict one's ſelf, clears up no difficulty. Who is anſwerable for that incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:022478_0269_0FB92F7E193D8470"/>
I need not inform the reader. It is manifeſt, the Doctor was driven into this inconſiſtence, by the preſſure of the argument from Matt. XXV. 46, That the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked is of the ſame duration with the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the righteous, becauſe in the very ſame ſentence it is ſaid, The wicked ſhall go away into everlaſting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and the righteous into everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>IF there be no promiſe in ſcripture, of final happineſs, then all thoſe texts from which the Doctor argues univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſalvation, are altogether impertinent, and prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe for which they are brought. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is an aſſurance of the beſtowment of ſome future good. If therefore, Rom. V. 12, &amp;c, Chap. VIII. 19, &amp;c, 1 Cor. XV. 24, &amp;c, &amp;c, be no promiſes of endleſs happineſs, they afford no aſſurance nor evidence, that all will be finally ſaved.</p>
               <p>IN the ſame manner in which Dr. C. reſtricts Matt. XXV. 46, to a limited duration, may every text from which he argues univerſal ſalvation, be reſtricted. If the life promiſed in the laſt quoted text, be a limited life; a life to be enjoyed before the kingdom is delivered up to the Father; what reaſon can be given why, in Rom. V. 18, "The free gift came upon all men to juſtification of <hi>life,</hi>" the life promiſed is not the ſame, and of the ſame limited duration?—If life for a limited duration only be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in Matt. XXV. 46; then the deſtruction of death for a limited duration only, is of courſe all that is promiſed in the ſame text. And if the deſtruction of death for a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited duration only be all that is promiſed in Matt. XXV. 46; how does it appear, that a deſtruction of death for any more than a limited duration, is promiſed in 1 Cor. XV. 26, "the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death?" —And how ſtrange is it, that Dr. C. ſhould from Rom. VIII. 21,
<q>The creature ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God,</q>
argue the certain ſalvation of all men, when he himſelf holds, that the glorious liberty promiſed the children of God, does not mean final ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor's ſecond anſwer to the argument from Matt. XXV. 46, is founded on the ſuppoſition, that the next is the final ſtate with reſpect to both the righteous and the<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 282.</note>

                  <q>If—the wicked are ſent to hell as ſo many abſolute incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, the ſecond death ought to be conſidered as that which will put an end to their exiſtence, both in ſoul and body.</q>
Thus this ſecond anſwer of Dr. C, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depends on the ſuppoſition, that the wicked are to be annihilated; and to evade the argument from Mat. XXV. 46, to prove endleſs puniſhment, he is neceſſitated to adopt the ſcheme of annihilation, and thus to give up his whole ſyſtem of univerſal ſalvation.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor gives us three reaſons to ſhow, that even on the ſuppoſition, that the next is the final ſtate, it will not follow, from the endleſs happineſs of the righteous, that the wicked will ſuffer endleſs miſery. The firſt reaſon is, That the word <hi>everlaſting,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, when applied to the righteous, is moſtly joined with the word <hi>life</hi>: whereas this word, when applied to the wicked, is never connected with their <hi>life,</hi> but always with the <hi>fire,</hi> or with their <hi>damnation, puniſhment</hi> or <hi>deſtruction.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 284.</note>—Now this obſervation is wholly impertinent, on any other ſuppoſition, than that the wicked are to be annihilated: for Dr. C. himſelf makes this obſervation, ſuppoſing that the next ſtate of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will be final. And if it be final, the wicked muſt be without end in that ſtate, which is allowed by all to be a ſtate of miſery; or they muſt not exiſt at all.—Thus ſtill the Doctor is obliged to give up his favourite ſcheme of the ſalvation of all men.</p>
               <p>HIS ſecond reaſon is, that it perfectly falls in with our natural notions of the infinite benevolence of the Deity, that he ſhould reward the righteous with endleſs life; but not that he ſhould puniſh the wicked with endleſs miſery.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 285.</note> But our notions of the benevolence of the Deity, are to be conformed to divine revelation; and only when they are conformed to that ſtandard, are they right. And to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the endleſs miſery of thoſe, who live and die in wickedneſs, is not agreeable to ſcriptural repreſentations of the benevolence of the Deity, is a mere begging of the
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:022478_0271_0FB92F82789B3218"/>
queſtion.—This ſubject has already been largely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in Chap. VIII.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor's laſt reaſon is,
<q>That we are naturally and obviouſly led to interpret <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>everlaſting,</hi> when joined with the happineſs of the righteous, in the endleſs ſenſe, from other texts which determine this to be its meaning.</q>
—"This" adds the Doctor,
<q>I call a deciſive anſwer to this branch of the objection, upon ſuppoſition, that the next is the final ſtate of man.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 287, 288.</note> Now all thoſe his determinate texts have been already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in page 262,  and in view of the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there made, the reader will judge, whether thoſe texts do any more deciſively, than the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> prove the future happineſs of the righteous, to be without end.</p>
               <p>TO confirm his conſtruction of Matt. XXV. 46, Dr. C. mentions two texts in which he ſuppoſes the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>everlaſting,</hi> is in the ſame ſentence uſed both in the limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and endleſs ſenſe. One is Rom. XVI. 25, 26;
<q>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the myſtery which was kept ſecret [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] <hi>ſince the world began</hi>—but is now made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt—according to the commandment [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] of the everlaſting God.</q>
Concerning this text it was before obſerved, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
is perfectly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the endleſs ſenſe. The myſtery was kept ſecret from all eternity, or during the eternal ages which prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded creation; or through the eternity <hi>a parte ante,</hi> as ſome call it. So that this text anſwers not the Doctor's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.—The other text produced by the Doctor, is Tit. I. 2,
<q>In hope [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, promiſed [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] before the world began.</q>
On this text, it has been obſerved,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 249.</note> that there is no abſolute certainty, that it means a limited duration. But ſuppoſing that this indeed is an inſtance to the Doctor's purpoſe: when it ſhall be made as evident from the very nature of the caſe, or from any other ſource of evidence, that the wicked cannot be puniſhed without end, as it is, that God could not give a promiſe before eternity; doubtleſs we ſhall all give up the Doctrine of endleſs puniſhment.</p>
               <p>AT length we come to the Doctor's criticiſm on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion <hi>forever and ever.</hi>—He ſeems to ſuppoſe, that
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:022478_0272_0FB92F8A02389A80"/>
expreſſion in ſcripture does not refer to the future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the wicked, but only of
<q>the worſhippers of the beaſt,</q>
and to a certain "rabble rout of men," as he calls them. Be this as it may, it equally overthrows the Doctor's ſcheme, as if it ever ſo confeſſedly referred to the puniſhment of <hi>all</hi> the wicked.—But on the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that <hi>forever and ever</hi> refers to the puniſhment of the wicked in common, the Doctor thinks that that

                  </gap>, in the New Teſtament, was traced, both in the ſingular and plural, and it was found, that it is much more frequently uſed in the endleſs, than in the limited ſenſe. If the uſe of the ſingular number only be traced, in even this number it is ſtill moſt frequently uſed in the endleſs ſenſe, as the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reader may ſee, by examining the texts, in which it is uſed in the Greek Teſtament, all which have been already noted. Dr. C's aſſertion therefore, that it almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually ſignifies a limited duration, is a <hi>mere</hi> aſſertion, and ſtands for nothing until it ſhall be proved: and to make a mere aſſertion a ground of an important conſequence, is not warrantable by the laws of reaſoning and philoſophy.</p>
               <p>BUT if the aſſertion were ever ſo true, the conſequence, which Dr. C. thence draws, would by no means follow.— If <gap reason="foreign">

ſignifies a limited duration. Language is not made meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſically by philoſophers, but by the vulgar, without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical reaſoning: and the meaning of particular phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is wholly determined by uſe, not by metaphyſical rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning on the natural force of the words.

to mean generally or univerſally an endleſs duration, this is enough to ſettle the preſent queſtion, let <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
is no abſurd or unintelligible mode of expreſſing an endleſs du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. If <gap reason="foreign">

We have no idea of eternity, but as an endleſs ſucceſſion of ages. Therefore, that age, thoſe ages, or that duration, which comprehends all thoſe ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ages, is a proper eternity. The Doctor undertakes to reaſon metaphyſically on this ſubject,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 297, 298.</note> and obſerves, that
<q>a duration for eternities of eternities, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uncouth mode of expreſſion.</q>

Though the Doctor endeavours to prove,
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:022478_0274_0FB92F8FFB705EA0"/>
that in theſe texts a limited duration muſt be intended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in 1 Cor. XV. 28, Chriſt is repreſented as delivering up his kingdom to the Father; yet it is at leaſt as clearly proved by Luke I. 33, "Of his kingdom there is no end," and the other texts before quoted,<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 235, &amp;c.</note> that the texts now in queſtion are to be taken in the endleſs ſenſe.—Beſides, how does it appear, that Pſal. CXLV. 13, refers to the kingdom of Chriſt, as diſtinguiſhed from the kingdom of the Father? And the kingdom of the Father Dr. C. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, is without end.</p>
               <p>THERE are other texts, in which <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
ſeems beyond diſpute to be uſed in the endleſs ſenſe; as Pſal. LXXVII. 7.

The latter expreſſion explains the former to mean an endleſs duration. The next verſes further confirm this idea.—Dan. IV. 34;

The contrary appears even from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances quoted by Dr. C. to prove that they are uſed in the limited ſenſe; as Pſal. CXIX. 44,
<q>So ſhall I keep thy law continually forever and ever.</q>
Pſal. CXLV. 2, "I will praiſe thy name forever and ever." To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that theſe texts contain no more, than a profeſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the pſalmiſt, to obey and to praiſe God, as long as he ſhould live in this world, is as arbitrary a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as to ſuppoſe, that when the ſcriptures ſpeak of God as living forever and ever, they mean no more, than that God will live as long as men live in this world.</p>
               <p>Anſwer 2. BUT if thoſe phraſes in the Septuagint did ever ſo certainly mean a limited duration, it would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that alſo the very different phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
in the New Teſtament, means a limited duration. The truth is, this laſt phraſe is not to be found in the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint, though it frequently occurs in the New Teſtament.
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:022478_0276_0FB92F93B386CBC0"/>
Be it ſo therefore, that thoſe phraſes in the Septuagint, mean a limited duration; is it not very ſingular argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, thence to infer, that a very different phraſe found in the New Teſtament, means a limited duration too? This is juſt as if Dr. C. had argued, that becauſe the word <hi>lion</hi> in the Septuagint means a four-footed beaſt, therefore the word <hi>man</hi> in the New Teſtament means a four-footed beaſt too.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor<note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 303.</note> holds, that
<q>it is of no ſignificancy, that this phraſe is ſometimes applied to God:</q>
becauſe, if from this application merely, we argue the abſolute e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of God; we may argue the abſolute eternity of the land of Canaan, and of the ſucceſſive generations of men, from the application to them, of the ſame or an equivalent phraſe.—But the ſame phraſe is never applied, either to the land of Canaan, or to the ſucceſſive generations of men: and whatever other phraſe is applied to them, is by that very application proved not to be equivalent: Becauſe we have no other poſſible way to know, that any phraſe is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, than by its application to thoſe ſubjects alone, which are of equal duration with thoſe, to which alone the phraſe in queſtion is applied.—The Doctor proceeds;
<q>Reaſon aſſures us, that the duration of God will have no end</q>
—for this cauſe,
<q>not from the force of this phraſe, we interpret it when applied to God, as mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a duration without end.</q>
But is not the eternity of God revealed in ſcripture, as well as known by reaſon? If ſo, where and in what words is it expreſſed? Let any more determinate expreſſion of it be pointed out in the ſcriptures. If the divine eternity be clearly revealed in ſcripture, and this phraſe be as determinately expreſſive of it, as any in the bible, doubtleſs it determines the future puniſhment of the wicked alſo, to be without end, becauſe it is repeatedly applied to that.</p>
               <p>FINALLY, the Doctor obſerves,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 304.</note>
                  <q>That it is as certain, that the phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued <hi>for ages of ages,</hi> as that the wicked in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ſtate, will not be incorruptible, but ſhall die a ſecond time.</q>
That the wicked ſhall reap corruption, and ſhall ſuffer the ſecond death, is not in the leaſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their endleſs miſery, unleſs corruption and the ſecond death mean either annihilation or final happineſs. If
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:022478_0277_0FB92F952B6B6310"/>
they mean the ſame with the deſtruction of the wicked, they mean miſery, as Doctor C. himſelf allows; <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 224.</note> and no man will ſay, that the declarations of ſcripture, that the wicked ſhall reap <hi>miſery,</hi> or ſuffer miſery, are a proof, that that miſery is not endleſs. Or if corruption and the ſecond death mean a tranſition from the reſurrection ſtate, to the next ſucceeding ſtate, if any ſuch there be, ſtill that ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate, or the final ſtate of the wicked, may be a ſtate of miſery. But if corruption and the ſecond death mean annihilation, they overthrow the ſalvation of all men. Is it not therefore ſurprizing, that Dr. C. ſhould over and over again, inſiſt on an argument, as fully demonſtrative of his ſcheme, which argument either wholly overthrows his ſcheme, or is utterly impertinent to the ſubject?</p>
               <p>ON the whole, it is left with the reader to determine, whether the reaſons offered by Dr. C. prove, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
means a limited duration.— That the reader may judge concerning the true force of that expreſſion, every place, in which it is uſed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired writers, is noted in the margin.<note n="§" place="bottom">Gal. I. 5. Phil. IV. 20. 1 Tim. I. 17. 2 Tim. IV. 18. Heb. XIII. 21. 1 Pet. IV. 11. V. 11. Rev. I. 6, 18. IV. 9, 10. V. 13, 14. VII. 12. X. 6. XI. 15. XIV. 11. XV. 7. XLX. 3. XX. 10. XXII. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>NEXT occurs Dr. C's anſwer to the argument from Mark IX. 43;
<q>The fire that never ſhall be quenched; where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</q>
—The Doctor's anſwer conſiſts of theſe particulars— That the <hi>fire</hi> of hell may never be quenched; yet the wicked may not live in it endleſſly<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 311.</note>—That <hi>in hell,</hi> or while the wicked are in the next ſtate of exiſtence, their worm indeed ſhall not die, and their fire ſhall not be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but their torment ſhall be continued during their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence in that ſtate.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>—As to the firſt obſervation, That the fire of hell may never be quenched, though the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be delivered out of it in time, by either ſalvation or annihilation; it has been obſerved to be a mere wild conjecture, and probably would never have been thought of, had not the ſcheme been in diſtreſs, and muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:022478_0278_0FB92F975B0EBE18"/>
by ſome means of other. Other remarks have been made on this conjecture, to which I refer the reader. —Nor does the latter obſervation, eſpecially as connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the former, appear to be more rational or perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. According to theſe two obſervations, the ſenſe of Mark IX. 43, 44, is merely this; It is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go into the fire which never ſhall be quenched, though thou mayeſt ſoon be delivered out of it; and in which while thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueſt, thy torments will not ceaſe. But where is the evidence of the truth of this propoſition? How does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be better for a man to cut off his right hand, and be forever after maimed, than to go into a fire which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed endleſs, and in which while he continues, he will be uneaſy, and even feel torment; though he may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it two minutes or two ſeconds? Who would not chooſe to ſuffer even a very painful torment, for a few ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, or minutes, rather than to loſe an hand or an eye? Thus the ſenſe which Dr. C. puts on Mark IX. 43, &amp;c. utterly fruſtrates the manifeſt deſign of our Lord, which was in that paſſage to exhibit a moſt powerful motive to the greateſt ſelf-denial. But according to the Doctor's conſtruction, the paſſage contains no powerful motive to ſelf-denial, or any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides; is it not flat and inſipid, to tell a man, that he ſhall go into a fire which never ſhall be quenched, though he may be immediately taken out again?—Yet this is the ſenſe which Dr. C. puts on thoſe words of our Saviour! But how is it to the purpoſe? or how does it concern any man, if he be not in the fire of hell, that that fire ſhall never be quenched?—Suppoſe a man is to be burnt at the ſtake. It would be a matter of indifference to him, whether the fire, in which he ſhould be put to death, be continued burning for five hundred years, after his death, or be extinguiſhed immediately: and to tell him by way of threatening, that that fire ſhall be kept up five hundred years after his death; or to threaten a criminal who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to be executed on the gallows, that the gallows on which he ſhall die, ſhall ſtand a thouſand years after his execution; would be perfect impertinence.</p>
               <p>DOCTOR C. ſeems to inſiſt much on this, That in Mark IX. 43, &amp;c, a reference is had to the puniſhment of thoſe whoſe bodies were either burnt in the valley of Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom,
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:022478_0279_0FB92F987293C100"/>
or permitted to lie upon the ground, to be fed upon by worms. But it does not thence follow, as Dr. C. ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that as the fire of the valley of Hinnom went out, when the bodies were conſumed, and the worm died, when the bodies were eaten up; ſo the fire and worm of hell ſhall ceaſe. The ſenſe may be, that as thoſe bodies in the valley Hinnom, were conſumed by fire and worms, which after a while ceaſed; ſo the wicked in hell ſhall be tormented by fire and worms, which ſhall not ceaſe.— Indeed this is expreſſly aſſerted: and as Mr. Hopkins juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves.
<q>It cannot be granted, that our Saviour, by thoſe words,</q>
                  <q>Where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched,</q>
means a worm that <hi>dieth,</hi>
                  <q>and a fire that <hi>is quenched</hi> very ſoon. For this would be to ſuppoſe, he <hi>means</hi> directly contrary to what he <hi>ſays.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Future ſtate of thoſe who die in their ſins.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THE Doctor argues againſt endleſs puniſhment from the ſmallneſs of the number of thoſe who are ſaved in the next ſtate.<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 322.</note> That "only a few of mankind" ſhould be ſaved finally, and "the greater part eternally periſh" he thinks not reconcileable with the great mercy of the Chriſtian diſpenſation; or with the glad tidings of great joy, and the divine good will celebrated at the birth of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. This argument is built on the ſuppoſition, that it would not be diſhonorary to Chriſt, that a minority of mankind be loſt. But this would be equally inconſiſtent with Dr. C's ſcheme, as that a majority be loſt. This argument, as it grants that ſome will not be ſaved, gives up the grand queſtion, and diſputes concerning the number only, which is to be ſaved. But this is no ſubject of diſpute in this controverſy.</p>
               <p>IS it then no inſtance of great and glorious mercy, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a ſcheme, by which ſalvation may be offered to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature; By which whoſoever will, may take the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life freely, and no man ſhall periſh, but in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his own voluntary rejection of that inſtitution? Is not the certain information of this inſtitution indeed glad tidings of great joy to all people? Is not the inſtitution a clear proof of the abundant good will of God to men, even though ſinners, through their voluntary oppoſition, obtain no good by it? It certainly is, if we may believe Dr. C. for it is a maxim with him,
<q>that we muſt not judge of
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:022478_0280_0FB92F9C326E2030"/>
the divine goodneſs, by the <hi>actual good,</hi> which we ſee <hi>produced,</hi> but muſt take into view the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the divine adminiſtration,</q>
&amp;c, ſee the quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made page 139.</p>
               <p>THE Doctor ſays,
<q>It is incredible, that God ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute his Son the Saviour of men, and the <hi>bulk</hi> of them be finally damned.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 323.</note> But why is it incredible? Is it not an undertaking worthy of Chriſt, in a way moſt hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary to God, to open a door of mercy and ſalvation to all mankind, though by the wicked and ungrateful rejection of Chriſt by the majority, a minority only will actually be ſaved? If it be not credible, that God ſhould conſtitute his ſon the ſaviour of men, and "the <hi>bulk</hi>" of them be final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly damned, is it credible, that Chriſt ſhould be conſtituted the ſaviour, and a bare majority of mankind be ſaved? If not, how large muſt the majority be?</p>
               <p>AS to the obſervation,
<q>That it is a groſs reflection on the ſaviour, whoſe proper buſineſs it is, to deſtroy the works of the devil, and reſcue mankind out of his hands; to ſuppoſe, that the devil ſhould finally get the better of Chriſt, by effecting the everlaſting damnation of the greater part of men;</q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> there are ſome particulars in it, which want explanation. Firſt; what is meant by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the works of the devil? If this mean to aboliſh all ſin, and all the miſery conſequent on ſin to any of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race; it is not granted, that this is <hi>the proper buſineſs</hi> of our Saviour, nor is this the proper meaning of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal in 1 Joh. III. 8, the text to which Dr. C. refers. The verb is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>diſſolve, take to pieces,</hi> and thus prevent the ill effect of the works of the devil. But if deſtroying the works of the devil mean, to defeat and to prevent the ill conſequences of thoſe works, ſo that no final damage ſhall thence ariſe to the intereſt of God's kingdom, or of the univerſe; it is granted, that this is the proper buſineſs of Chriſt. But it is not granted, but that this maybe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, without the ſalvation of all men.—Again, what is meant by "the devil's getting the better of Chriſt?" This doubtleſs means, that he defeats Chriſt more or leſs, as to ſome object of his mediatorial undertaking. But Dr. C. has no more made it appear, that the final ſalvation of only a part, and a ſmall part of the human race, implies
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:022478_0281_0FB92FA05DC667F0"/>
ſuch a defeat; or that it was not the original intention of Chriſt to ſave a ſmall part only; than he has made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that it was the intention of Chriſt to ſave all men.</p>
               <p>Dr. C. ſeems not to have reflected, while he was urging this argument, that it equally militates againſt his own laſt reſort, annihilation. For if an
<q>end be put to the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, both in ſoul and body,</q>
of all who die impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as the Doctor allows will be the caſe, if univerſal ſalvation be not true;<note n="§" place="bottom">P. 282.</note> then on his principles, the devil will not be vanquiſhed by Chriſt; the works of the devil will not be deſtroyed, but
<q>he will get the better of Chriſt, by effecting the everlaſting deſtruction of the greater part of thoſe whom Chriſt came from heaven to ſave.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 324.</note> —So that when this objection ſhall be anſwered, ſo far as it lies againſt Dr. C's laſt reſort, doubtleſs an anſwer will be ſupplied to thoſe who believe in endleſs miſery.</p>
               <p>After all, it is not an article of my faith, that only a ſmall part of the human race will be finally ſaved. But my faith in this particular is not built on abſtract reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from the divine goodneſs and the miſſion of Chriſt. That divine goodneſs which ſuffered <hi>all</hi> the apoſtate angels to periſh finally, might have ſuffered all, or a greater part of the apoſtate race of men, to periſh in like manner. My faith is built on ſeveral repreſentations and prophecies of ſcripture, particularly concerning the millennium, and the general and long prevalence of virtue and piety in that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. Therefore in this view, the foundation of the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the ſmallneſs of the number ſaved, is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> In which are conſidered <hi>Dr: C's</hi> anſwers to the arguments drawn from what is ſaid concerning <hi>Judas,</hi> Mark XIV. <hi>21</hi>;—from the unpardonable ſin;—and from the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation to licentiouſneſs.</head>
               <p>THE Doctor anſwers to the argument from Mark XIV. 21,
<q>Wo to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. Good were it for that man, if he had never been born;</q>
That perhaps it may be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial expreſſion, not literally true;<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 329.</note>—That if the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſenſe were the moſt reaſonable, conſidering this text by itſelf; yet conſidering the many paſſages brought by Dr. C. which declare the final ſalvation of all men, we muſt not underſtand this paſſage in the literal ſenſe, as in that caſe we ſhall ſet the ſcripture at variance with itſelf;<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 330.</note> —That the real meaning of this paſſage may be propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as if our Lord had ſaid,
<q>The man who ſhall betray me ſhall practically declare, that in his apprehenſion, it were good had he not been brought into being.</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 331.</note>— As to the firſt of theſe anſwers, it is a mere unſupported conjecture, and therefore is to be ſet down for nothing.— As to the ſecond, it is not allowed that the Doctor has produced any one paſſage of ſcripture which declares the final ſalvation of all men: but this in view of what has been ſaid on the paſſages produced by the Doctor, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the reader.—As the Doctor contends that this paſſage cannot be underſtood in the literal ſenſe, without ſetting the ſcripture at variance with itſelf; ſo it is contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the advocates for endleſs puniſhment, that it can be underſtood in the literal ſenſe, without ſetting the ſcripture at variance with itſelf in the leaſt degree; and that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral tenor of the ſcripture points out the literal ſenſe to be the true ſenſe.—As to Dr. C's third anſwer, it is, in the firſt place, a mere unſupported conjecture: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it may be noticed, that it is manifeſt, that the text
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:022478_0283_0FB92FA3701236A0"/>
pronounces the proper wo or curſe, which ſhould fall on the man who ſhould betray our Lord.
<q>The Son of Man indeed goeth, as it is written of him; but wo to that man, by whom the Son of Man is betrayed: good were it for that man, if he had never been born.</q>
— But according to Dr. C. all the curſe which this text de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces, is ſuch a wearineſs of life and impatience of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, as has ſometimes befallen even true ſaints; as in the inſtance of Job. And is it credible that this was the proper and full curſe of betraying the Lord of life and glory? Or that if this be but a very ſmall part of the curſe of that abominable wickedneſs, our Lord would have mentioned it in ſuch a manner, as naturally to communicate the idea, that it is the proper and full curſe of it?</p>
               <p>AFTER all the ingenuity of Dr. C. and other univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaliſts, in torturing this paſſage to a meaning conſiſtent with their ſcheme; it remains a plain, direct, and poſitive teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt it.</p>
               <p>NEXT follows Dr. C's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anſwer to the argument from what is ſaid concerning the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, Matt. XII. 32;
<q>Whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</q>
Mark III. 29;
<q>He that ſhall blaſpheme againſt the Holy Ghoſt hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forgiveneſs, but is in danger of eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
Luke XII. 10,
<q>Unto him that blaſphemeth againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE Doctor's firſt anſwer to this argument is taken from <hi>Grotius</hi>—he tells us that <hi>Grotius</hi>
                  <q>looks upon the words as an Hebraiſm intended to ſignify, <hi>not ſo much</hi> the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donableneſs of ſome ſins, and the unpardonableneſs of others; as the greater difficulty of obtaining pardon for blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, than for any other blaſphemy.</q>
It is wholy immaterial whether the words were intended to ſignify <hi>not ſo much</hi> the unpardonableneſs of ſome ſins. If they were intended to ſignify <hi>at all</hi> the unpardonableneſs of ſome ſins, that is ſufficient for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe. So that both Dr. C. and his favourite author <hi>Grotius,</hi> virtually concede all that is demanded in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>CONCERNING this conſtruction of <hi>Grotius,</hi> which is but a mere conjecture, brought in to help over an argument
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:022478_0284_0FB92FA4F74830F0"/>
which crouds hardly on Dr. C's ſcheme; the Doctor ſays,
<q>Whoever goes about to prove, that there is no truth in it, will perhaps find, that he has undertaken a very hard taſk.</q>
The ſame may be ſaid of any man, who ſhould undertake to prove, that there are not a dozen pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary planets belonging to the ſolar ſyſtem; or who ſhould undertake to diſprove any one of a thouſand other conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>AFTER all, the Doctor does not depend much on this conſtruction of <hi>Grotius,</hi> and proceeds to give us his own ſenſe of the paſſages above quoted; which is, That it is indeed true, that
<q>the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt is abſolutely unpardonable;</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 334.</note> that the divine law ſhall take its courſe on thoſe who are guilty of that blaſphemy, and no intervening pardon will prevent the full execution of the threatened penalty on them; and forgiveneſs ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and literally ſpeaking will not be granted to them;<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 336.</note> yet that they will be finally ſaved, and admitted to heaven, after they ſhall have ſuffered the full penalty threatened in the law.—On this idea of Dr. C. ſome remarks have been already made in Chapter I. Nor can it eſcape the notice of the attentive reader, that it implies, that ſome men are ſaved, not only without forgiveneſs; without the exerciſe of divine grace, in the ſcriptural ſenſe of grace; without any aid from the merit or atonement of Chriſt; and therefore not
<q>on the account, on the ground, or for the reaſon of Chriſt's obedience and death;</q>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 20.</note> but wholly on the footing of the law. But the idea that any of mankind are to be ſaved without forgiveneſs, is wholly foreign from the ſcriptures, nor can it be pointed out to be contained in any part of ſcripture. Every chapter of the goſpel is inconſiſtent with it; to refer to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular texts would be endleſs and needleſs.—And what divine grace is there exerciſed in the ſalvation of one, who has by ſuffering the whole threatened penalty of the law, made full ſatisfaction for his own ſins?— There is manifeſtly no more <hi>grace</hi> in ſaving ſuch a man, than there is in ſaving one who has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinned. Nor is he who has ſuffered the full penalty of the law, ſaved on account of the death or obedience of Chriſt. On the account of Chriſt's obedience or death he is releaſed from no puniſhment: and to ſuppoſe, that God

has not goodneſs enough, without an atonement, to take a creature to heaven, who in the eye of the law is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly innocent, is a ſuppoſition utterly inconſiſtent with the divine goodneſs.—Laſtly, he who is ſaved in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuffering the whole penalty threatened in the law, is ſaved on the foot of law. Yet it is utterly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly denied by Dr. C. to be poſſible, that any ſinner ſhould be ſaved on the foot of law.</p>
               <p>IN view of theſe obſervations, the reader will judge, whether Dr. C's conſtruction of the paſſages, which ſpeak of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, be admiſſible: and whether thoſe paſſages and the argument deduced from them, do not remain in full force againſt univerſal ſalvation.</p>
               <p>WE come at length to Dr. C's anſwer to the laſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe in the oppoſite ſcheme which he conſiders, which is drawn from the tendency of Dr. C's ſyſtem to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs and vice.</p>
               <p>ON this the Doctor obſerves;
<q>To diſprove the final ſalvation of all men, it muſt be plainly ſhown, that this doctrine does naturally and directly tend to encourage men in vitious practice.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 341.</note>
                  </q>
In this it is implicitly grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation do indeed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and directly tend to encourage men to perſiſt in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious practice, it is not true. On this we may join iſſue with him. That that doctrine does comparatively encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage men to perſiſt in vice, will appear perhaps from the following conſiderations.—It will not be denied that if there were no puniſhment threatened to the wicked, it would naturally and directly encourage them to perſiſt in vice. This is granted by Dr. C.—
<q>Had we attempted<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 342.</note> to introduce mankind univerſally into a ſtate of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, upon their leaving this world, whatever their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conduct had been in it, the argument,</q>
that Dr. C's ſcheme tends to licentiouſneſs,
<q>would then have held ſtrong.</q>
But if the argument holds ſtrong, provided there be no future puniſhment, it holds proportionably, if that puniſhment be very ſmall and far leſs than is deſerved by the wicked; and eſpecially if at the ſame time that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment be ſuited to their perſonal good. Now that the future puniſhment of the wicked is, on Dr. C's ſcheme, very ſmall, compared with what it is on the oppoſite ſcheme, is manifeſt at firſt ſight; it is infinitely leſs. And that it
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:022478_0286_0FB92FA80780E600"/>
is far leſs, nay infinitely leſs than the wicked deſerve, is manifeſt by what Doctor C. as well as his oponents, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that all who are ſaved, are ſaved by <hi>unbounded grace.</hi> Therefore, if the damned be finally ſaved, as they are ſaved by unbounded grace, they are puniſhed infinitely leſs than they deſerve. Alſo, that according to Dr. C's ſcheme, the wicked are to be puniſhed with a diſciplinary puniſhment ſuited to the good of the ſubjects, is manifeſt from his whole book.—Now that this puniſhment of the wicked does comparatively encourage vice, may be illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by an example. It is generally agreed that murder deſerves death. But ſuppoſe a law ſhould be made, by which no murderer ſhould be puniſhed with death, or with any other puniſhment to be continued longer, than till he ſhould repent. Would not ſuch a law as this, compared with the law as it now ſtands, naturally and directly tend to encourage murder? I need not make the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>DOCTOR C. ſeems to think that his doctrine of future puniſhment even more powerfully reſtrains from ſin, than the doctrine of endleſs puniſhment, becauſe his doctrine is more credible to men in general. But are we to inquire what is moſt likely or moſt eaſy to be believed by men in general, to determine what is moſt likely to reſtrain from ſin or to be the real truth of God? Then certainly the doctrines of the divine character and miſſion of Chriſt, of his miracles, reſurrection, aſcenſion, &amp;c, &amp;c, in ſhort the doctrines of chriſtianity in general, are not ſo likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain men from ſin as the doctrines of mere natural reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Or if it be ſaid that thoſe doctrines are capable of ſuch proof, as will ſatisfy and convince all candid inquirers; the ſame is ſaid of the doctrine of endleſs puniſhment.</p>
               <p>I HAVE now finiſhed my reply to Dr. C's anſwers to the arguments in favour of endleſs puniſhment; and having before conſidered his arguments in favour of his own ſcheme; I ſhall proceed to ſome arguments in confirmation of the doctrine of endleſs puniſhment.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> In which ſome direct arguments are propoſed, to prove the endleſs puniſhment of the wicked.</head>
               <p>I AM ſenſible that my book is already protracted to a conſiderable length. Therefore to relieve the patience of the reader, I ſhall endeavour to crowd this part into as narrow a compaſs as poſſible. Indeed if the anſwers already given to the objections to endleſs puniſhment, be ſufficient, the leſs needs be ſaid in way of direct proof.</p>
               <p>THE various texts always brought in diſcourſes on this ſubject, come now with full force; in proof of this doctrine. As Matt. XVIII. 8;
<q>It is better for thee to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet, to be caſt into <hi>everlaſting fire.</hi>
                  </q>
Chap. XXV. 41;
<q>Then ſhall he ſay unto them on the left hand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</q>
Verſe 46th;
<q>Theſe ſhall go away into <hi>everlaſthing puniſhment.</hi>
                  </q>
2 Theſſ. I. 9;
<q>Who ſhall be puniſhed with <hi>everlaſting</hi> deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the preſence of the Lord and the glory of his power.</q>
2 Pet. II. 17;
<q>To whom the miſt of darkneſs is reſerved <hi>forever.</hi>
                  </q>
Jude 13:
<q>To whom is reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs <hi>forever.</hi>
                  </q>
Rev. XIV. 10, 11;
<q>And he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone, in the preſence of the holy angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb: And the ſmoke of their torment aſcendeth up <hi>forever and ever.</hi>
                  </q>
Chap. XIX. 3;
<q>And again they ſaid, Alleluia: and her ſmoke roſe up <hi>forever and ever.</hi>

<q>And the devil that deceived them, was caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, where the beaſt and the falſe prophet are, and [they] ſhall be tormented day and night, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>THE evations of theſe texts have been particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and it is hoped, ſufficiently anſwered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="unknown:022478_0288_0FB92FAB1CC24630"/>THE Greek words uſed in theſe texts are, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. From an inſpection of every text in which theſe words and phraſes are uſed in the New Teſtament, it has been found, with regard to the firſt, that quite contrary to Dr. C's account, it
<q>is almoſt perpetually,</q>
i. e. in the proportion of 66 to 2, uſed in the endleſs ſenſe; ſetting aſide the places in which it is applied to the puniſhment of the wicked. With regard to the other two phraſes, it has been found, that they are without exception uſed in the endleſs ſenſe. Nor does the Greek language furniſh any word more determinately expreſſive of endleſs duration: and notwithſtanding what Dr. C. ſays to the contrary, it appears that they do as properly and determinately expreſs an endleſs duration, as the Engliſh words <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>eternity.</hi> If therefore theſe words be explained away to mean a mere temporary dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is impoſſible that any words be uſed, which would not ſuffer the ſame treatment from the ſame hands.</p>
               <p>THE texts concerning the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſtill remain a clear proof of endleſs puniſhment. They are Matt. XII. 31, 32;
<q>The blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, ſhall not be forgiven unto men—Whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this world neither in the world to come.</q>
Mark III. 29:
<q>He that ſhall blaſpheme againſt the Holy Ghoſt, hath never forgiveneſs; but is in danger of eternal damnation.</q>
Luke XII. 10; Unto him that
<q>blaſphemeth againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</q>
               </p>
               <p>SO long as the goſpel rejects every idea of the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men without forgiveneſs, ſo long will theſe texts confute the ſalvation of all men.</p>
               <p>TO theſe I may add the following texts; 1 John V. 16;
<q>If any man ſee his brother ſin a ſin which is not unto death, he ſhall aſk, and he ſhall give him life, for them that ſin not unto death. There is a ſin <hi>unto death. I do not ſay that he ſhall pray for it.</hi>
                  </q>
So that we are not to pray for thoſe who ſin unto death. Why not? evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently becauſe their ſalvation is impoſſible. If their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be poſſible, I preſume no ſufficient reaſon can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, why we ſhould not pray for it. If it ſhould be ſaid that we are not to pray that the ſalvation of ſuch ſhould be immediately accompliſhed, but that it may be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:022478_0289_0FB92FB5670B1248"/>
in due time: the anſwer is at hand, that we are not at liberty to pray that any man may be ſaved <hi>out of</hi> due time; and in this ſenſe we are prohibited to pray for the ſalvation of any man.</p>
               <p>Heb. VI. 4—6;
<q>For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightened, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come; if they ſhall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance.</q>
Since it is impoſſible to renew ſuch to repentance, it is according to Dr. C. as well as the ſcipture, impoſſible that they be ſaved. Of like import is Chapter X. 26, 27;
<q>For if we ſin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, which ſhall devour the adverſaries.</q>
If there remain <hi>no more or no longer</hi> a ſacrifice for ſins; then neither will the man whoſe character is here deſcribed, be able by his own ſufferings to make a ſacrifice of ſatisfaction for his ſins, nor will the ſacrifice of Chriſt be longer of any avail to him. And if the judgment and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the adverſaries, remain for him; he muſt ſuffer them without a poſſibility of eſcape, either by the ſacrifice of Chriſt or in conſequence of his own ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>THE wo denounced by Chriſt on Judas alſo ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a demonſtrative proof of endleſs puniſhment. Matt. XXVI. 24, and Mark XIV. 21;
<q>Wo to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed: good were it for that man if he had never been born.</q>
Let Judas ſuffer a temporary miſery of ever ſo great duration, it muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely leſs than an endleſs duration of happineſs. So that if Judas were finally to enjoy endleſs happineſs, he would be an infinite gainer by his exiſtence, let the duration of his previous miſery be what it might. It was therefore on the ſuppoſition of his final ſalvation, not only good, but infinitely good, that he had been born: which is a direct contradiction to the declaration of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>IN connection with this paſſage, I ſhall introduce the following; Luke VI. 24;
<q>Wo unto you that are rich: for ye have received your <hi>conſolation.</hi>
                  </q>
On the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the ſalvation of all men, the rich do by no means
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:022478_0290_0FB92FBEB5B3ECC0"/>
receive in this life their conſolation; but they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive infinitely the greateſt conſolation in the future life.— Pſalm XVII. 14;
<q>From men of the world, who have their <hi>portion</hi> in this life;</q>
Plainly implying that they are to have no portion in the future life. Luke XVI. 25;
<q>Son, remember that thou in thy life time receivedſt thy good things,</q>
If all ſhall be ſaved, the rich and the men of the world in no other ſenſe have their portion in this life, than the reſt of men.—They have ſome good things in this world, but infinitely the greateſt part of their happineſs is to be enjoyed in the world to come, and what they enjoy here, is nothing in compariſon with what they are to enjoy hereafter. More than this, cannot be ſaid of any man.</p>
               <p>MARK IX. 43—49;
<q>If thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee, to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go into hell, into the fire that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall be quenched: where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet, to be caſt into hell, into the fire that never ſhall be quenched; where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God, with one eye, than having two eyes, to be caſt into hell-fire: where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</q>
Mat. III. 12;
<q>Whoſe fan is in his hand, and he ſhall thoroughly purge his floor; and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with <hi>unquenchable fire.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>John III. 36.
<q>He that believeth on the Son, hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life: and he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</q>
If all are to be ſaved, then all will ſee life and enjoy it. Should it be ſaid, that the meaning of this text is barely, that he that believeth not, ſhall not ſee life, while he remains an unbeliever; it may be obſerved, that this ſenſe of the text will admit the idea, that unbelievers may all become believers, at death, or at ſome future time in life; as it holds forth no more, than that a man while an unbeliever, ſhall not be admitted to life; and ſays nothing but that all unbelievers may become believers in this life, or at death; and therefore may attain to life and ſalvation in heaven,
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:022478_0291_0FB92FC1A19F8758"/>
juſt as ſoon as thoſe, who are now believers. But can any man bring himſelf to believe, that this text was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to teach us, but that unbelievers will attain to the life and ſalvation of heaven as ſoon as believers? If that be the true ſenſe, this text teaches us no more concerning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, than is true concerning all ſaints in this ſtate of imperfection. It may on this ſuppoſition be ſaid, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual truth, and in the ſame ſenſe, that no imperfect ſaint ſhall ſee life, as that no unbeliever ſhall ſee life. It is plain, that this text was meant to exhibit ſome privilege on the believer above the unbeliever. But if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, now under conſideration, be the true one, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal ſalvation be true, what is that privilege? The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever has the promiſe of an endleſs life; ſo has the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in common with all mankind. The believer cannot perhaps be admitted to the inheritance of that promiſe, within leſs than ten or twenty years. Within the ſame time the unbeliever may be admitted to the ſame inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whether he be admitted to it at death, or in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ſome diſcipline in hell, by which he is led to repentance and faith. The believer has the preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of anticipating his future happineſs; there is on the plan of univerſal ſalvation, abundant foundation for the ſame anticipation to the unbeliever. It is true, the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is not yet prepared for the poſſeſſion of heavenly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: neither is the believer during his preſent imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>LUKE XVI. 26;
<q>And beſides all this, between us and you, there is a great gulf fixed: ſo that they which would paſs from hence to you, cannot; neither can they paſs to us, that would come from thence.</q>
Mat. VI. 15;
<q>If ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes.</q>
Chap. XXIII. 34, 35;
<q>And his Lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he ſhould pay all that was due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. So likewiſe ſhall my heavenly Father do alſo unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their treſpaſſes.</q>
Heb. VI. 8;
<q>That which beareth thorns and briers, is <hi>rejected,</hi> and is nigh unto <hi>curſing</hi>; whoſe <hi>end</hi> is to be burned.</q>
—How is the end of any man to be burned, if all ſhall finally be ſaved? Luke XIV. 24;
<q>For I ſay unto you, that none of thoſe men who were bidden, ſhall taſte of my ſupper.</q>
Chap. XIII.
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:022478_0292_0FB92FC2FB02CFC0"/>
25, 26, 27;
<q>When once the maſter of the houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the door, and ye begin to ſtand without, and to knock at the door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and he ſhall anſwer and ſay unto you, I know you not, whence you are—I tell you, I know you not, whence you are, depart from me, all ye workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</q>
—Rev. XXII. 11, 12;
<q>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill: and he that is righteous, let him be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtill: and he that is holy, let him be holy ſtill. And behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give to every man according as his work ſhall be.</q>
— Theſe laſt words, with verſe 10th, determine this text to refer to the general judgment.—The words of the tenth verſe are,
<q>Seal not the ſayings of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand.</q>
But a period ages of ages after the general judgment cannot be ſaid to come quickly, and to be at hand.</p>
               <p>IF to theſe texts it ſhould be ſaid, that they mean no more, than that they cannot <hi>as yet</hi> be ſaved, though they will be ſaved in proper time; I anſwer, (1) That there is no appearance in the texts themſelves, of ſuch a ſenſe; (2) That if that were the true ſenſe, they would mean no more, than might be ſaid, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> of all real ſaints, who are not about to die immediately; (3) That that ſenſe would imply, either that the future puniſhment of the wicked is a mere wholeſome diſcipline, or that thoſe who die impenitent do not deſerve endleſs puniſhment. If they paſs the great gulf as ſoon as they repent, their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is a mere wholeſome diſcipline: but that it is not a mere wholeſome diſcipline, I have endeavoured to ſhow in Chap. II. and III. If they ſuffer the full puniſhment, which they deſerve, and then come out, they are ſaved without forgiveneſs, and they never deſerved an endleſs puniſhment, the contrary to which I have endeavoured to prove in Chap. VI. To thoſe chapters I beg leave to refer the reader, for what might be ſaid here in further anſwer to this objection.—If becauſe the damned cannot paſs the great gulf at preſent, it be ſaid, There is a great gulf fixed, ſo that they cannot paſs thence to heaven, then becauſe a ſaint is not about to die at preſent, it might with propriety be ſaid, there is a great gulf fixed between him and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo that he cannot paſs it.—If thoſe ſcriptural ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:022478_0293_0FB92FC5F5307480"/>
"Let him be unjuſt ſtill,"—
<q>Great gulf fixed, ſo that they cannot paſs,</q>
—"Depart, I know you not," "Shall not taſte of my ſupper,"—&amp;c, mean no more, than that they ſhall remain unjuſt &amp;c, for the preſent: why may not the following expreſſions—
<q>Shall not come into condemnation,</q>
—"Are juſtified from all things,"—
<q>Is paſſed from death unto life</q>
—&amp;c, mean no more, than that the ſaints ſhall not come into condemnation for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or for ſome time to come?—Are for the preſent juſtified from all things? Is for the preſent paſſed from death unto life?</p>
               <p>REV. III. 5;
<q>He that overcometh, the ſame ſhall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not <hi>blot out his name out of the book of life</hi>; but I will <hi>confeſs his name</hi> before my Father, and before his angels.</q>
Does not this text plainly hold forth, that the names of all who do not overcome, ſhall be blotted out of the book of life; and that Chriſt will not confeſs their names before the Father, and before his angels? Chap. XIII, 8;
<q>And all that dwell upon the earth ſhall worſhip him, <hi>whoſe names are written in the book of life of the Lamb,</hi> ſlain from the foundation of the world.</q>
Chap. XXI. 27;
<q>And there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie; but they which are <hi>written in the Lamb's book of life.</hi>
                  </q>
Pſal. LXIX. 27, 28;
<q>Add iniquity to their iniquity, and let them not come into thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Let them <hi>be blotted out of the book of the living,</hi> and <hi>not be written with the righteous.</hi>
                  </q>
Now will any be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, whoſe names are not written in the Lamb's book of life? In the quotation from Rev. XXI. 27, it is expreſſly aſſerted, that no one who defileth, worketh abomination, or maketh a lie, ſhall enter the heavenly city; but they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who are written in the Lamb's book of life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not only will not all men be ſaved, as ſome will be excluded the heavenly city; but ſome men have not their names written in the Lamb's book of life, and this is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence, that all will not be ſaved.</p>
               <p>IT is ſaid, that
<q>ſinners ſhall not ſtand in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the righteous,</q>
(Pſal. 1. 5,) and the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the parables of our Lord, is, that after the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral judgment, the tares and chaff ſhall be no more mixed with the wheat; nor the good with the bad fiſh. Nor
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:022478_0294_0FB92FC77A24BC30"/>
is there any intimation that the tares or the chaff will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wheat, or the bad putrid fiſh become good; but the contrary is plainly implied in the parables themſelves. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the judgment is ſaid to be <hi>eternal,</hi>

This text which has been often quoted as a proof of univerſal ſalvation, is, I conceive, a clear proof of the contrary. The heaven will receive and retain our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, until the time ſhall come
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:022478_0295_0FB92FCA9731CE20"/>

                  </gap>, ſhall be reſtored, which things doubtleſs comprehend all things which ever ſhall be reſtored. But our Lord Jeſus Chriſt will not be retained in heaven longer than till the general judgment. After that time therefore, nothing will be reſtored. But it is granted on all hands, that after that time the wicked will be in miſery. Therefore they ſhall never be recovered from that miſery.</p>
               <p>2 Pet. III. 9;
<q>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſe (as ſome men count ſlackneſs) but is long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to us ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance,</q>
alſo hath been quoted to prove univerſal ſalvation. It is however im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to that purpoſe, but upon the ſuppoſition that the word <hi>periſh</hi> means <hi>endleſs perdition.</hi> Not even any univerſaliſt will ſay, that God is unwilling that thoſe who die in impenitence ſhould periſh <hi>for a while,</hi> until they are brought to repentance, or until they ſhall have ſuffered the juſt puniſhment of their ſins. But if <hi>periſh</hi> in this paſſage mean endleſs perdition, it doubtleſs means the ſame in all thoſe texts in which the wicked are poſitively ſaid to periſh, as 1. Cor. I. 18,

<q>I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine.</q>
But are any to be ſaved, for whom our Lord does not make interceſſion? Heb. XII. 15;

                  </q>
If all men are to be ſaved, the hope and expectation of the wicked are not cut off, do not periſh, in any other ſenſe than that in which the hope and expectation of the righteous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and are cut off. The wicked may expect to obtain hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs before they are ſufficiently diſciplined, or before a certain period. So may the righteous expect to make their tranſition to heaven before it will come. This expectation of both will be cut off. But the expectation which the wicked have of final happineſs, will never according to Dr. C's ſyſtem, be cut off. Nor, according to the ſame ſyſtem, can it be true, that the wicked ſhall be deſtroyed <hi>without remedy.</hi>—Prov. XIV. 32;
<q>the wicked is driven away in his wickedneſs; but the righteous hath hope in his death.</q>
But according to the univerſal ſyſtem, the wicked hath in his death as real and well founded a hope as the hope of the righteous. Job XI. 20, "Their hope ſhall be as the giving up of the ghoſt." Chap. XXVII. 8;

—2 Cor. XI. 15;
<q>Whoſe <hi>end</hi> is according to their works.</q>
This is ſaid of the miniſters of ſatan, whoſe works are certainly evil. Their end therefore being according to their works muſt be evil too. How then can they be FINALLY ſaved? If it ſhould be ſaid, that theſe texts do not mean the <hi>laſt</hi> end of the wicked; this would be a mere aſſertion. As well might we ſay that Rom. VI. 22;
<q>Ye have your fruit unto holineſs and the end everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life,</q>
means not the laſt end of the righteous.</p>
               <p>THE ſcripture repreſents, that at the end of this world, all things are brought to <hi>an end.</hi> 1 Pet. IV. 7; "But the end of all things is <hi>at hand,</hi>" <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Surely this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mean that the end of all things will take place after
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:022478_0297_0FB92FCF85E68368"/>
                  <hi>ages of ages</hi> to ſucceed the end of this world. A period ſo diſtant is never in ſcripture ſaid to be <hi>at hand</hi>; nor could this with propriety, be ſaid of ſuch a period.— Matt. XXIV. 14;
<q>This goſpel of the kingdom ſhall be preached in all the world, for a witneſs to all nations: and <hi>then,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, ſhall the end come.</q>
—But when all things ſhall have come to their <hi>end,</hi> they will be in a fixed, unalterable ſtate, and after that, there can be no paſſing from hell to heaven. Nor can there be any ſuch paſſing after Chriſt ſhall have delivered up the kingdom to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To this Dr. C. agrees. But I have already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven my reaſons for believing that Chriſt will deliver up the kingdom to the Father, at the end of this world; and for believing that 1 Cor. XV. 24, muſt be underſtood in this ſenſe, and that according to Dr. C's explanation of that text, it cannot be reconciled with Matt. XIII. 40—44, and other paſſages of ſcripture.</p>
               <p>2 COR. VI. 2;
<q>Behold <hi>now</hi> is the accepted time; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, <hi>now</hi> is the day of ſalvation.</q>
Heb. III. 7;
<q>
                     <hi>To day,</hi> if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</q>
But if the greater part of mankind ſhall be ſaved out of hell, and the means of repentance in hell be far more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to the end, than the beſt means uſed in this world, it ſhould have been ſaid, In the future ſtate is the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time, and in hell will be the day of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>2 COR. IV. 18;
<q>The things which are ſeen, are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral; but the things which are not ſeen, are <hi>eternal.</hi>
                  </q>
If all the unſeen things of the future ſtate be eternal, the puniſhment of the damned is eternal. And eternal, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, muſt in this inſtance mean endleſs: otherwiſe all oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with regard to duration, between things ſeen, and things unſeen, is loſt; and things unſeen are as truly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, as things ſeen. At moſt, on Dr. C's principle of conſtruing ſcripture; the apoſtle's propoſition comes to this merely: The things which are ſeen, are temporal, but the things which are unſeen are to continue for an age. But this is true of many preſent ſeen things.</p>
               <p>THE promiſes of the goſpel in general afford an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in favour of endleſs puniſhment.—Rev. II. 11;
<q>He that overcometh, ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death.</q>
I preſume all will grant, that this promiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that all who do not overcome, ſhall be hurt of the ſecond death. Therefore, by parity of reaſon, when it is
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:022478_0298_0FB92FD0A1FD7E08"/>
promiſed in the ſame chapter,
<q>To him that overcometh, I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midſt of the paradiſe of God;</q>
it implies, that thoſe who do not overcome, ſhall never eat of that tree,
<q>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white ſtone,</q>
&amp;c, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that he who does not overcome, ſhall never eat of the hidden manna, ſhall never receive the white ſtone, &amp;c.
<q>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he ſhall go no more out,</q>
implies, that he who does not overcome, ſhall not be a pillar in the temple of God.
<q>To him that overcometh, will I grant to ſit with me in my throne,</q>
implies, that he who does not overcome, ſhall never ſit in Chriſt's throne. Theſe I give as a ſpecimen only of the promiſes, and of the argument which they afford.</p>
               <p>FINALLY, if all ſhall be ſaved, why have not Chriſt, and thoſe who wrote by the inſpiration of his ſpirit, been explicit in the matter? Why have they uſed ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which in the literal ſenſe aſſert the contrary doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine? and which apparently obſcure the truth, and blind the eyes of the readers of the New Teſtament? Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if, as Dr. C. holds, univerſal ſalvation be ſo glorious to God, the main ſubject of the goſpel, and ſo neceſſary to vindicate the divine character? Surely this of all doctrines ought to have been indiſputably revealed, and not one hint given to the contrary.</p>
               <p>BESIDES theſe arguments drawn directly from texts of ſcripture; I ſhall mention one drawn from the general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the goſpel, or from the particular doctrines of the goſpel, acknowledged by both parties in this controverſy.</p>
               <p>THOSE who die impenitent, deſerve an endleſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The proof of this hath been attempted, Chap. VI. It is briefly this: If endleſs puniſhment be not the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty threatened in the law, and juſtly deſerved by the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, no account can poſſibly be given of the penalty of the law. It cannot be the temporary puniſhment actually ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the damned; becauſe then the damned would be finally ſaved without forgiveneſs. It cannot be a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary puniſhment of leſs duration, than that which is ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the damned; becauſe on that ſuppoſition the damned are puniſhed more than they deſerve. It cannot be a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary puniſhment of longer duration, than that which the ſcriptures abundantly declare the damned ſhall ſuffer; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:022478_0299_0FB92C5313DF76A0"/>
no ſuch puniſhment is threatened in the law, or in any part of ſcripture. It muſt therefore be an endleſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.—This endleſs puniſhment threatened in the law, is not annihilation, but endleſs miſery; becauſe if it were annihilation, none of the damned, on ſuppoſition, that they are all finally ſaved, will be puniſhed with the curſe of the law, or which is the ſame, with the puniſhment which they juſtly deſerve. But both the ſcripture and Dr. C. abundantly hold, that the damned will be puniſhed as much as they deſerve, as hath been ſhewn Chap. III. But for the full proof, that the puniſhment of hell is not annihilation, I muſt refer the reader to Chap. V. If the endleſs puniſhment threatened in the law, and deſerved by the wicked, be not annihilation, it muſt be endleſs miſery. But whatever puniſhment the wicked juſtly deſerve, they will in fact ſuffer; they will have to pay the uttermoſt farthing; they will ſuffer judgment without mercy. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they will ſuffer not only an endleſs puniſhment, but an endleſs miſery, or torment.</p>
               <p>THE ſame argument is a little differently ſtated thus; Dr. C. allows, that if the puniſhment of the damned be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſatisfy juſtice, it is impoſſible all men ſhould be ſaved.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 11.</note> He alſo holds abundantly, that it is impoſſible, that any ſinner ſhould be juſtified or ſaved
"on the foot of law."
He equally holds this with regard to the moral law, "the law written in men's hearts,"
"the natural law,"
and the law is promulged in the goſpel by Jeſus "Chriſt and his apoſtles," as with regard to the
"Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic law."
<note n="†" place="bottom">See 12 ſerm. P. 4, &amp;c.</note> He alſo holds, that
<q>the law of God is a perfect rule of righteouſneſs.</q>
Now if it be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any ſinner be juſtified by the moral law, then eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſinner is, and muſt be condemned by it, and from that condemnation he can never be acquitted by the law. If it be impoſſible that any ſinner be ſaved by that law, then on the footing of that law, every ſinner muſt be excluded from ſalvation.</p>
               <p>BUT this law is "a perfect rule of righteouſneſs." Therefore perfect righteouſneſs, or ſtrict diſtributive juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, will never admit of the ſalvation of any ſinner; but every ſinner juſtly deſerves to be endleſsly excluded from ſalvation.—Again, a puniſhment which ſatisfies juſtice, is one which is perfectly juſt and deſerved by the ſinner.
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:022478_0300_0FB92C53F6D2DDC8"/>
Therefore, if the ſinner be puniſhed according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, he can never be ſaved.—But both the ſcriptures and Dr. C. hold, that the damned will be puniſhed according to their deſerts; therefore they will never be ſaved.</p>

            <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>I HAVE now finiſhed a work which has been attended with conſiderable labour to me, and with ſome to the reader who has peruſed the whole. I am ſenſible that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſial writers often miſunderſtand each other, and therefore often ſpend their own time and labour, and the time of their readers for nought. I have been aware of the danger of this, and have endeavoured to my utmoſt to avoid it: how ſucceſsfully, muſt be ſubmitted. I have often wiſhed for an opportunity of converſation with ſome ſenſible and thorough believer in Dr. C's ſcheme, that I might obtain explanation of ſome things, to me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable. But I have not been favoured with ſuch an opportunity. I have endeavoured to meet the Doctor's chief arguments, and not to carp at particulars which are of no importance to the ſcheme, and have not deſignedly ſhunned any argument which appeared to me to be import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and not implied in other arguments particularly noticed. I hope that whoever ſhall undertake the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of what is now offered to the public, will treat it with the ſame candour. In a work of this length, and on a ſubject of ſuch intricacy, it would be ſtrange indeed if there were not ſome ſlips which would give advantage to an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt; yet thoſe ſlips may not affect the main queſtion. If any man ſhall write to point out ſuch errata, it will hardly be worth while for me to trouble either myſelf or the world with a reply. But if any gentleman will can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly point out the fallacy of the main arguments, on which I have reſted what I fully believe to be truth; however I may be affected by it, I doubt not but that the public will have the candour ingenuouſly to acknowledge it. If on the contrary his reply ſhall conſiſt chiefly of declamation and warm addreſſes to the paſſions and imaginations of
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:022478_0301_0FB92C5634FA87D0"/>
mankind, pathetical and frightful repreſentations of the torments of the damned, interlarded with ſarcaſtic fleers and other eſſays at wit; I doubt not the ſame candid pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic will properly notice it, and draw an inference not very favourable to the cauſe which is to be ſupported by ſuch auxillaries. Such artifices are unworthy of theologians, philoſophers and any inquirers after truth.—I hope whoever undertakes a reply, will tell us what puniſhment ſin juſtly deſerves; what is the penalty of the moral law; or that curſe of the law from which Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. C. explains Gal.

               </note> I hope he will further inform us whether all men ſhall be ſaved in the way of forgiveneſs. If they be, he will reconcile that mode of the ſalvation of all men with thoſe declarations of ſcripture which aſſert, that the wicked ſhall be puniſhed according to their works, ſhall have judgment without mercy, and ſhall pay the uttermoſt farthing. If it ſhall be his opinion, that the damned will be puniſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their demerits, and then be ſaved without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, it is to be hoped he will reconcile this idea with the whole New Teſtament, which every where repreſents, that all who are ſaved, are ſaved in the way of forgiveneſs.

            <p>I HAVE no apprehenſion, that the doctrine of endleſs puniſhment will ſuffer at all by a thorough diſcuſſion. In the courſe of the diſquiſition many may be perverted to fatal error; yet the final reſult will be the more clear elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidation of the truth. However
<q>many may run to and fro, yet knowledge ſhall be increaſed.</q>
            </p>

queſtion, ſhall be in doubt on which ſide the truth lies; it will certainly be moſt prudent and ſafe for him to act as he would, if he fully believed endleſs puniſhment; it will be moſt prudent and ſafe for him to yield a cordial compliance with the goſpel, in repentance, faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Then he will be ſafe on either ſuppoſition. But if he truſt to the flattering doctrine, that all are finally to be ſaved, and in this preſumption ſhall neglect the goſpel, its invitations and requirements; and it ſhall finally prove, that that doctrine is a mere imagination of men; alas! he is loſt; irrecoverably loſt: while thoſe who receive the goſpel with "the obedience of faith," ſhall through the blood of atonement,
<q>have right to the tree of life, and ſhall enter in through the gates into the City.</q>

               <q>It is evident then and undeniable, that every man ſhall receive his own reward or puniſhment, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</q>

               <q>It muſt be then admitted, that God hath threatened everlaſting miſery to the wicked, as plainly and poſitively as he hath promiſed everlaſting happineſs to the righteous. He hath fairly ſet before us life and death, bleſſing and curſing, eternal happineſs as well as everlaſting miſery, the one to balance the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

rather than bleſſing, and voluntarily incur everlaſting miſery, when they might as eaſily attain eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whom have they to complain of, or whom can they arraign of unequal proceeding but themſelves? (Ezek. XVIII. 29.) Are not my ways equal? Are not your ways unequal, ſaith the Lord? You cannot then complain of injuſtice, for the rewards and puniſhments are equal: and it was really neceſſary, that theſe rewards and puniſhments ſhould be everlaſting.</q>

<q>thing leſs than everlaſting rewards and puniſhments be ſufficient to encourage the good, to deter the bad, and ſecure obedience to the divine commands?<note n="†" place="bottom">P: 357.</note>—How then can you complain, that God is an arbitrary gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and annexeth greater penalties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to his laws than are neceſſary.—You cannot then complain, that the ſanction of eternal penalties is unreaſonable, for you ſee plainly, that it is no more than is abſolutely neceſſary. But poſſibly you may think, though it may be neceſſary in the government of this world for ſuch things to be denounced by God, and believed by man, yet there may not be the like neceſſity for inflicting them in the world to come: God is not obliged to execute his threatenings, as he is to make good his promiſes. But why is he not obliged to perform the one as well as the other? His threatenings are never, like thoſe of men, made raſhly, never founded in paſſion or caprice, that it ſhould be better not to execute, than execute them. —If God will not execute as well as threaten, why doth he threaten at all?—Is it not more ſuitable to the character of a God of truth, and becoming the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and ſincerity of a divine revelation, to declare the truth, and nothing but the truth, and leave it to work upon men as it can, rather than denounce in the moſt ſolemn manner what was never intended, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall come to paſs, and ſo endeavour to alarm them with falſe fears, and to work upon them with falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, which have nothing to anſwer them?</q>

            </p>
            <p>ON theſe quotations it may be remarked, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop plainly held, that endleſs miſery is threatened; for
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:022478_0305_0FB92C60C4470820"/>
he always uſes the word <hi>everlaſting</hi> in the endleſs ſenſe, and believed this to be the ſcriptural ſenſe of it, when applied to future puniſhment.<note n="*" place="bottom">See P. 355.</note> He alſo rejected the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of annihilation.<note n="†" place="bottom">See P. 349.</note> Now then his opinion was either, that endleſs miſery is unconditionally threatened to all who die impenitent; or that it is threatened to them on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their continued impenitence in the future world. If it be threatened unconditionally, it follows, (1) That endleſs miſery is the juſt puniſhment of the ſins committed in this life. For who will pretend, that God hath made a law, which contains an unjuſt penalty? This would be equally inconſiſtent with the divine moral rectitude, as to make a law containing unjuſt or unreaſonable precepts; or to execute the unjuſt penalty. But if this were the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Biſhop, to be conſiſtent he muſt have given up the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation, to eſtabliſh which he wrote his Diſſertation. For he not only declares in the paſſages already quoted, that
<q>God muſt be juſt as well as merciful, and can never exerciſe one of his attributes ſo as to interfere with another;</q>
and
<q>that his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings are never like thoſe of men, made raſhly, never founded in paſſion or caprice, that it ſhould be better not to execute, than execute them;</q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 358.</note> but <note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 382.</note>according to Mat. V. 26, and XVIII. 34, he acknowledges, that the damned ſhall pay the uttermoſt farthing, and all that is due.—(2) It will follow, that ſin is an <hi>infinite evil.</hi> Certainly that moral evil which deſerves an infinite natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil to be inflicted by way of puniſhment, is an infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ill-deſerving moral evil; this is plain by the very terms: and a moral evil, which is infinitely ill-deſerving, is all that is meant by the infinite evil of ſin. Yet this ſentiment he reprobates in the ſtrongeſt terms.</p>
            <p>BUT if thoſe who die impenitent be threatened with endleſs miſery, <hi>on condition of their continued impenitence only</hi>; then a mere ſalutary diſcipline is all the puniſhment which any ſinner deſerves according to ſtrict juſtice. The law is the rule of righteouſneſs; the penalty of that is adequate to the demand of juſtice; and if the penalty of that be an endleſs puniſhment unleſs the ſinner ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, the penalty in reality is ſo much puniſhment only as ſhall lead the ſinner to repentance; and this ſalutary and

neceſſary diſcipline is the whole penalty or curſe of the law.</p>
            <p>THAT this was really the opinion of the Biſhop may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the following expreſſions:
<q>If God will not execute as well as threaten, why doth he threaten at all? It muſt be ſaid, to reclaim a ſinner; and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that if the ſinner be reclaimed, the end is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the threatening is voided of courſe.</q>

<q>This I conceive to be the true notion of the eternity of rewards and puniſhments.

            <p>
               <pb n="302" facs="unknown:022478_0307_0FB92C6473212068"/>THE Biſhop argues univerſal ſalvation in this manner,
<q>He would have all men to be ſaved; and whence then ariſeth the obſtruction to his good will and pleaſure, or how cometh it to paſs, that his gracious purpoſes are ever defeated?</q>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 367.</note>—So it may be ſaid,
<q>God is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance, and <hi>now</hi> commandeth all men every where to repent.</q>

Whence then ariſeth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to his good will and pleaſure, or how cometh it to paſs that his gracious purpoſes are defeated?</p>
            <p>"NOTHING," ſays the Biſhop,
<q>is more contrariant to the divine nature and attributes, than for God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow exiſtence on any beings, whoſe deſtiny he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knows muſt terminate in wretchedneſs without recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> The truth of this propoſition depends on the following principle, That it is not, nor can be, in any caſe, conſiſtent with the general good implying the glory of God, that a ſinner ſhould be miſerable without end. For if God foreſee that the endleſs miſery of a man will be ſubſervient to the general good; there is nothing contrariant to the divine nature, to beſtow exiſtence upon him, though he foreknow that he will ſin, that he will deſerve endleſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and that his deſtiny will terminate in wretchedneſs without recovery.</p>
            <p>WE find that there are in fact temporary miſeries in the world. On what principle can theſe be reconciled with the divine attributes? If it be anſwered, on the ſole prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that they will iſſue in the perſonal good of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients; the reply is, (1.) That this will be fact wants proof. It is by no means evident, that God aims at the perſonal good of every individual in all his diſpenſations, however diſtreſſing; it is not evident that the inhabitants of the old world, of Sodom and Gomorrah, &amp;c. are more happy in the whole of their exiſtence, than if they had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and died like other men.—(2.) Eſpecially it is not evident, that all the ſin and wickedneſs which any man commits will finally make him a more happy man, than he would have been, if he had committed no ſin. If God may without a view to promote the perſonal good of a man, permit him to fall into ſin, why may he not without a view
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:022478_0308_0FB92C65F1F43928"/>
to the ſame object, puniſh him for that ſin? To ſay that God could not conſiſtently with the moral agency of the man, prevent his falling into ſin, will infer that God cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently with the moral agency of the man, certainly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly lead him to repentance.—(3.) The principle now under conſideration implies that there is not now nor ever has been in the univerſe, any thing which on the whole is a real evil to any man conſidered in his individual capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: that no man ever was or ever will be the ſubject of any curſe, or any calamity which any man, with a view to his own happineſs only, ſhould wiſh to avoid.</p>
            <p>OR if temporary calamities be reconciled with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine attributes on this principle, that they are ſubſervient to the general good; on the ſame principle we reconcile with the divine attributes, the endleſs miſery of the damned.—This whole argument depends on the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that the final miſery of any ſinner cannot <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the general good. To take this for granted is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.</p>
            <p>AS we have ſeen, it is a fundamental principle with the Biſhop, that ſuch a puniſhment as is ſufficient to lead a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to repentance, is all which is threatened in ſcripture. This then is the penalty or curſe of the divine law: this is the utmoſt which ſtrict juſtice will admit: and he on this ſuppoſition juſtly aſſerts,
<q>that ſome time or other ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction may be made, the debt of ſin may be discharged, and the ſinner himſelf releaſed out of priſon.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 382.</note> —This is utterly inconſiſtent with the ſalvation of the damned in the way of forgiveneſs. Yet his texts to prove univerſal ſalvation, imply ſalvation in the way of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs only. After quoting Exod. XXXIV. 6, 7;
<q>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſin,</q>
he adds,
<q>But how can ſuch attributes conſiſt with a ſyſtem of irrevocable vengeance for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, tranſgreſſions never to be forgiven,</q>
&amp;c? To which I anſwer, They can juſt as well conſiſt with ſuch a ſyſtem, as with Biſhop Newton's ſyſtem, which implies that the damned ſuffer all that they deſerve; for what is this but irrevocable vengeance to the higheſt decree? And ſurely the tranſgreſſions of thoſe who ſuffer ſuch a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are never forgiven.</p>

               <pb n="304" facs="unknown:022478_0309_0FB92C6781FD3B48"/>IT is abſurd therefore for him to argue from grace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, the divine readineſs to forgive, &amp;c.

               <hi>II. A few remarks on</hi> James Relly's <hi>Treatiſe on Union.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE ſeems to hold, that all mankind were from eternity ſo united to Chriſt, that he and they make properly one whole or complex perſon. But it is extremely difficult to determine with preciſion what his ideas were. I ſhall therefore make ſeveral quotations from him, and ſubjoin ſuch remarks as appear pertinent.
<q>It doth not appear how God—could puniſh ſin upon Chriſt, without the concurrence of righteouſneſs and truth: nor can this concurrence be proved, without union between Chriſt and thoſe, for whom he endured the croſs—becauſe contrary to truth, which declareth, that every man ſhall die for <hi>his own</hi> ſin.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 3.</note>—
<q>Such an union between Chriſt and his church, as gives him the right of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and brings him under that character, which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to puniſhment, is abſolutely neceſſary.</q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>—
<q>Without the conſideration of union, where is the juſtice of charging the black rebellion and crying guilt of man, upon the pure and ſpotleſs head of Jeſus.</q>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 4.</note>
               <q>Sin is—a crime—only atoned for—by the death, yea, the <hi>eternal</hi> death of the ſinner: which juſtice muſt inflict before it can be properly ſatisfied; nor can it poſſibly admit of a ſurety here; becauſe it can only puniſh him, whom it firſt finds guilty; and not by reckoning him, to be what he is not, according to human quibbles, but
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:022478_0311_0FB92C6A6F8ED1E8"/>
according to, artleſs, reaſonable, divine equity; which can only declare ſuch guilty, on whom the fault is found, and can only find the fault on ſuch who have committed it. We only committed the fault; upon us only can it be found. Therefore, without ſuch an union between Chriſt and us, as expoſes us in his perſon, to judgment and condemnation, the harmony of the divine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doth not appear in the things which he ſuffered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe contrary to truth and juſtice.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 4.</note> He largely illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates this union between Chriſt and his church, by the union between the head and members in the natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and adds,
<q>The union and harmony of the body renders it equitable to puniſh and chaſtiſe the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in one member, for its offence in another. Becauſe if one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it. As the union of the body makes it equitable to puniſh the head, for the offence of the other members; with like equity do the members participate with the head, in all its honors and glory. Thus the crowning of the head, crowns the whole man, and every member partakes of the honor.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE quotations may ſerve to give an idea of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between Chriſt and mankind, for which Mr. Relly pleads. I now proceed to the following remarks.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT appears by the foregoing quotations, that Relly held ſuch an union between Chriſt and his church, that he upon the ground of juſtice became liable to puniſhment on account of their ſins. Otherwiſe the ſufferings of Chriſt were both unjuſt and contrary to truth: unjuſt, as he did not deſerve them, contrary to truth as the divine declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is "The ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die."—But if this be true, if Chriſt was liable to puniſhment on the ground of juſtice, diſtributive juſtice; then Chriſt deſerved death as much as the ſinner. In his ſufferings the Father did but treat him according to his own character and conduct: he did but cauſe him to eat the fruit of his own ways and to be filled with his own devices: and no more thanks or praiſe are due to Chriſt on account of his ſufferings, than are due to the damned ſinner, on account of his enduring the pains of hell.—Beſide; how contrary is this to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! That declares, that
<q>Chriſt ſuffered the <hi>juſt</hi> for the unjuſt;</q>
that
<q>he was holy, harmleſs, undefiled,
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:022478_0312_0FB92C6BECD96E18"/>
and ſeparate from ſinners;</q>
That
<q>he did no ſin, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was guile found in his mouth.</q>
—Now if Chriſt was a "character obnoxious to puniſhment" on the foot of diſtributive juſtice, he was very far from being <hi>juſt,</hi> and from being <hi>holy, harmleſs, undefiled</hi>; he <hi>did ſin,</hi> and <hi>guile was found</hi> in his mouth. Indeed this is no more than Rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerts in the above quotations, when he ſays,
<q>that juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice can only puniſh him whom it finds guilty; not by reckoning him what he is not, but according to artleſs divine equity, which can only find the fault on ſuch as have committed it.</q>
Therefore, according to this, Chriſt as one with ſinners, committed the fault, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſervedly ſuffered for it.</p>
            <p>IF it ſhould be granted, that Chriſt did not himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the fault or ſin, for which he ſuffered, but that by a wiſe, ſovereign, divine conſtitution, to which he himſelf fully conſented, he ſuffered for the ſins of others; this would be to give up all, and to acknowledge, that Chriſt did not ſuffer for ſin on the footing of diſtributive juſtice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT appears by the ſame quotations, that Relly was not of the opinion, that Chriſt ſuffered in conſequence of the imputation of ſin to him, or becauſe he was the ſurety of his church: but on the ground of his proper union with men. This appears by theſe words:
<q>Sin is a crime only atoned for by death, which juſtice muſt inflict; nor can it poſſibly admit of a <hi>ſurety</hi> here: becauſe it can only puniſh him whom it firſt finds guilty: and not by reckoning him to be what he is not.</q>
Yet he holds<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 41.</note> that Chriſt ſuffered on the ſole ground of <hi>imputation.</hi> His words are,
<q>The doctrine of union, which repreſents Jeſus ſuffering under the character of the ſinner, doth not ſuppoſe him ſuch in his own particular perſon; nay ſtrongly witneſſeth the contrary, and reſpects him only thus by ſuch an <hi>imputation</hi> as is juſt and true.</q>
—If then the ſufferings of Chriſt do not ſuppoſe him to be a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner "in his own particular perſon;" how can this be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with what is quoted above from page 3d, in which he argues, that unleſs Chriſt be one with thoſe for whom he died, his ſufferings cannot be reconciled with the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which declares that every man ſhall die for <hi>his own</hi> ſin? Or with what is quoted from page 4th which declares,
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:022478_0313_0FB92C731B879798"/>
that juſtice does not admit of a <hi>ſurety,</hi> or of reckoning Chriſt to be what he is not?</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT further appears by the ſame quotations, that Relly conſiders Chriſt and mankind, as one, in the ſame ſenſe that the head and members in the natural body are one. If this be ſo, then we are no more indebted to Chriſt for our redemption, than a man's hands are indebted to his head for inventing means for his livelihood; or his head is indebted to his hands for applying thoſe means.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IT alſo appears, that on this plan Chriſt is now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and will without end ſuffer, an <hi>eternal death.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the quotation from page 4th,
<q>Sin is a crime only atoned for by the death, yea the <hi>eternal death</hi> of the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>; which juſtice muſt inflict, before it can be properly ſatisfied: nor can it poſſibly admit of a <hi>ſurety</hi> here; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it can only puniſh him whom it firſt finds guilty; and not by reckoning him to be what he is not, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to human quibbles, but according to divine equity, which can only declare ſuch guilty on whom the fault is found, and can only find the fault on ſuch who have committed it.</q>
Theſe expreſſions manifeſtly declare, (1) That Chriſt is a ſinner, and committed the ſin or fault for which he ſuffered, and that not by <hi>imputation</hi> and as the <hi>ſurety</hi> of his people, but really and literally.—(2) That ſin can be atoned for by the ſuffering of <hi>eternal death</hi> only. This and this only will properly ſatisfy juſtice.—(3) That therefore, as Chriſt is the propitiation for our ſins, he is now, and will without end, be ſuffering <hi>eternal death.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THIS author is a Swiſs, who was a clergyman in his own country; but falling into univerſaliſm, was cenſured and depoſed.—After this he went to London, where he publiſhed the book which is now the ſubject of remark. It firſt appeared in French, and was publiſhed in Engliſh in 1788.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="309" facs="unknown:022478_0314_0FB92C7679C70BD0"/>IF I miſtake not, the fundamental principles of this book are theſe two,—That the ſinner on the footing of ſtrict juſtice, deſerves no other puniſhment, than that which is neceſſary to lead him to repentance and prepare him for happineſs—That the happineſs of every individual crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is neceſſary to the greateſt happineſs of the general ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>IN page 24th, of the preceding work, a quotation or two was made to ſhow, that the firſt of the two propoſitions now mentioned, is a principle of this author. To thoſe quotations a great part of his book may be added to ſhow the ſame; but I ſhall add the following ſentences only.—
<q>The Deity being infinitely juſt, will inflict on the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed juſt and equitable puniſhments; puniſhments exactly proportioned both in degree and duration, to the nature and extent of their crimes.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 91.</note>—
<q>The ſecond rule which divine juſtice follows in the diſpenſation of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, is, to employ rigour only ſo much, and ſo long, as ſhall be neceſſary to the deſtruction of ſin, and the converſion of the ſinner.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 102.</note>—
<q>The third rule of divine juſtice in the diſpenſations of ſufferings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informs us, when the Supreme Being ceaſes puniſhment;</q>
i. e. when the ſinner repents.<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 110.</note>—
<q>We have eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a principle whence to form conſiſtent ideas of the <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>ſeverity</hi> of God, who puniſhes the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he might bleſs them in turning them every one from their iniquities</q>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">P. 137.</note>—Infinite juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapts
<q>with the moſt perfect and minute detail, the reſpective ſuitableneſs of his dealing to our <hi>moral ſtate,</hi> and conſequently to <hi>our wants,</hi> throughout the whole of our exiſtence.</q>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">P. 76.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ON theſe quotations it may be remarked,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT according to this plan, the moſt <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous juſtice, divine</hi> juſtice, <hi>infinite</hi> juſtice, admits that a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be made to ſuffer till he repents, and no further. Such a puniſhment as this, is
<q>exactly proportioned both in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and duration, to the nature and extent of the crimes</q>
of the ſinner. This then is the utmoſt which the divine law will admit: this is the true <hi>curſe</hi> of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law; even that curſe from which Chriſt hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="310" facs="unknown:022478_0315_0FB92C77EFDF3020"/>2. THIS puniſhment inflicted on any ſinner, utterly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all pardon, forgiveneſs and mercy. How is he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, who ſuffers to the utmoſt extent of juſtice? How is any ſparing mercy exerciſed toward him, on whom the curſe of the law is fully executed?—Yet M. Petitpier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re conſtantly holds, that the ſalvation of ſinners is effected in the way of <hi>mercy, pardon</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſs.</hi> Thus, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the divine goodneſs, he ſays,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 6.</note>
               <q>Are men miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? It is termed that <hi>infinite compaſſion</hi> he has for their wretchedneſs.—But when by a ſincere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance they turn from their iniquity, then it is his <hi>clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> his <hi>pardon,</hi> his <hi>mercy,</hi> and his <hi>grace,</hi> that is extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them.</q>
—
<q>How ſtriking, how awful, and at the ſame time how <hi>merciful,</hi> are the repreſentations of future torments!</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 109.</note>—
<q>He will conſtantly <hi>pardon,</hi> and receive into favour the ſincerely penitent offender. Repentance appeaſes divine anger and diſarms its juſtice, becauſe it accompliſhes the end infinite goodneſs has in view, even when arrayed in the awful majeſty of <hi>aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtice</hi>; which was ſevere, becauſe the moral ſtate of the ſinner required ſuch diſcipline; and which when that ſtate is reverſed by converſion—will have nothing to beſtow ſuitable to it, but the delightful manifeſtations of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſs.</hi>
               </q>
It ſeems then, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is <hi>juſtice ſatisfied</hi> by the repentance of the ſinner; but <hi>juſtice,</hi> even <hi>the awful majeſty of avenging juſtice,</hi> will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſs.</hi> But how forgiveneſs can be an act of <hi>juſtice,</hi> and eſpecially an act of <hi>avenging</hi> juſtice, remains to be explained.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE puniſhment now under conſideration, is utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with redemption by Chriſt. How are they redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or delivered from the curſe of the law, who in their own perſons ſuffer that curſe? And if Chriſt ſhould deliver them from it, he would deprive them of an ineſtimable benefit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IF
<q>
                  <hi>infinite juſtice</hi> adapts with the moſt perfect and minute detail, the reſpective ſuitableneſs of his dealings to our moral ſtate, and conſequently to our wants, throughout the whole of our exiſtence;</q>
then what is <hi>goodneſs</hi>? and how is it diſtinguiſhed from juſtice? What more kind and favorable than this can goodneſs, the divine goodneſs, infinite and incomprehenſible goodneſs, do for us? According to this definition of <hi>infinite juſtice,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:022478_0316_0FB92C796F871958"/>
promiſes and ſcheme of the goſpel, nay the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable gift of Chriſt himſelf, are mere communications of juſtice, and not of goodneſs and grace: and according to the ſame definition there never has been, and never can be, any benefit granted by the Deity to any of his creatures, which is any more than a fruit of mere juſtice, and which may be withholden conſiſtently with juſtice: and all that God ever has done, and ever will or can do, for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his creatures, is barely ſufficient to ſave his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter from a well grounded charge of injuſtice.</p>
            <p>BUT I mean not to dwell on this ſubject: I do but hint theſe particular's. It would be an infinite labour to point out the endleſs abſurdities of this ſcheme of juſtice and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. I have conſidered the point more largely in Chap. II, to which I beg leave to refer the reader.</p>
            <p>THE other fundamental principle of this book is, That the happineſs of every individual creature is neceſſary to the greateſt happineſs of the ſyſtem. This idea is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in various paſſages, particularly in the following,
<q>It is impoſſible the Divine Being ſhould ever diſpenſe any evil in this world, or in the world to come; which is not even to the individuals an actual exerciſe of perfect goodneſs.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 220.</note>
            </p>
            <p>AND that this is neceſſarily implied in the ſcheme of this author, and of all others who argue univerſal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the divine perfections, without reſpect to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, muſt be manifeſt upon the ſlighteſt reflection. Goodneſs will always ſeek the greateſt good or happineſs of intelligent beings. And that the happineſs of the ſyſtem is a greater good than the happineſs of any individual or individuals of that ſyſtem, is a ſelf evident propoſition. Therefore goodneſs will never ſeek the happineſs of any individuals, ſo as to diminiſh the happineſs of the ſyſtem: for this would be not to ſeek the advancement of happineſs on the whole, but the diminution of it. If therefore the divine goodneſs ſeeks the final happineſs of every intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent creature, it muſt be becauſe the happineſs of every creature promotes and is neceſſary to ſecure the greateſt happineſs of the ſyſtem. If it be not neceſſary to the greateſt happineſs of the ſyſtem, it is no object to goodneſs.</p>
            <p>CONCERNING this principle the following ſtrictures are ſuggeſted:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="312" facs="unknown:022478_0317_0FB92C7BC5C36338"/>1. THE truth of it is by no means evident.—Indeed M <hi>Petitpierre</hi> ſuppoſes the abſurdity of the contrary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to be exceedingly clear, and therefore indulges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the following ardent effuſion:
<q>Can we ſuppoſe that intelligent creatures capable by their nature of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and felicity, would be unable to attain to this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deſtination, unleſs at the ſame time a number of intelligent beings exiſted in eternal miſery? Among creatures of the ſame nature, thence capable of the ſame happineſs; muſt a part be made happy at the expence of a conſiderable portion devoted to endleſs miſery and deſpair? Cannot a Being infinitely perfect and happy communicate beatitude to his intelligent offspring, on other and more favourable terms? Can he not be to ſome the inexhauſtible ſource of happineſs; unleſs he is to others the never-failing ſource of miſery? But let us ceaſe to heap contradiction on contradiction, horror up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on horror, and end this diſagreeable diſcuſſion.</q>
— M. P—rre did not reflect, that if this paſſage contain any argument, it is equally forcible againſt the evils which <hi>in fact</hi> take place in this world, as againſt the puniſhments of the future: and that the paſſage may be retorted thus; Can we ſuppoſe that intelligent creatures capable by nature of peace, liberty, and all the enjoyments of human ſociety, would be unable to attain to this excellent deſtination, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs at the ſame time a number of intelligent beings were rendered miſerable by fines, confiſcations, ignominy, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, chains, ſtripes and the gallows? Among creatures of the ſame nature, thence capable of the ſame happineſs; muſt a part be made ſafe and happy at the expence of a conſiderable portion devoted to miſery and deſpair, in the ways juſt mentioned? Cannot a being infinitely perfect and happy communicate beatitude to his intelligent off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring on other and more favourable terms? Can he not be to ſome the ſource of peace, ſafety, liberty and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; unleſs he be to others the ſource of miſery? But let us ceaſe to heap contradiction on contradiction, horror upon horror, and end this diſagreeable diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>TO ſay that God can convert the wicked, and without endleſs impriſonment and puniſhment, prevent the miſchief which they would do to the ſyſtem, affords no ſatisfaction. So God can convert the wicked in this world, and prevent all the miſchief which they do here. The queſtion is not,
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:022478_0318_0FB92C7D2EB4B210"/>
what God has power to do, but what he will in fact do; and what he may ſee fit to permit others to do.</p>
            <p>M. P—rre proceeds to argue againſt the poſſibility, that the miſery of ſome intelligent creatures ſhould be neceſſary to the happineſs of the reſt, and urges that inſtead of this, it would ſubvert their happineſs; becauſe the inhabitants of heaven are ſo full of benevolence and compaſſion, that they cannot be happy, while numbers of their fellow creatures are miſerable; and eſpecially becauſe it muſt be ſtill more painful to them, to know that the eternal ſufferings of thoſe their fellow creatures, were neceſſary to their own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 215, &amp;c.</note>—But theſe obſervations are no more reconcileable with fact and with experience, than thoſe which I juſt now quoted from the ſame author. Are the beſt of men in this world, ſo compaſſionate, that they cannot be happy ſo long as thieves and robbers are confined in work-houſes and priſons, and murderers die on gibbets? And do they diſdain to enjoy their lives, their liberty, their peace and their property, unleſs they can be ſecured in the poſſeſſion of them, on terms leſs ignominious and painful to ſome of their fellow creatures?</p>
            <p>SUCH are the arguments by which M. P—rre endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prove, that the miſery of ſome men cannot be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the greateſt good of the ſyſtem. If theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be not convincing, it is in vain to expect convincing evidence of the propoſition now under conſideration, from M. P—rre.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE reader has doutleſs taken notice that the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition now under conſideration implies, not only that end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs miſery, but any temporary calamity cannot be inflicted on an individual, conſiſtently with the good of the whole, unleſs that temporary calamity be ſubſervient to his perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al good. Obſerve the words quoted above,
<q>It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible the Divine Being ſhould ever diſpenſe any evil <hi>in this world</hi> or in the world to come, which is not even <hi>to the individuals,</hi> an act of perfect goodneſs.</q>
—Then all evils and calamities which have ever exiſted, or do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, or ever will exiſt, in this world, as well as the future, are no real evils, no <hi>curſe</hi> to the patients themſelves; but they are all ſo many benefits and <hi>bleſſings</hi> to them. The deſtruction of the old world, of Sodom, &amp;c, were real bleſſings to the patients perſonally. But how does this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear?
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:022478_0319_0FB92C7EB88BB928"/>
They certainly did not in this world operate for the good of the patients; and how does it appear, that they will operate for their good in the future world? To aſſert this without aſſigning a reaſon, is impertinent.—Beſide; on this hypotheſis, there is no ſuch thing as any <hi>curſe</hi> either in this world or the future; and there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>curſe</hi> and a <hi>bleſſing.</hi> What then ſhall we make of the ſcriptures, which ſpeak abundantly of curſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſtinguiſh between curſes and bleſſings?</p>
            <p n="3">3. THIS, which I have called the ſecond fundamental principle of this author, is in reality not diſtinct from the firſt.—If the good or happineſs of the ſyſtem require the happineſs of every individual, it ſurely cannot require the miſery of any individual: and if it do not require his miſery, it is not conſiſtent with juſtice, that he ſhould be made miſerable by puniſhment; or it is not conſiſtent with juſtice that he be puniſhed any further than is ſubſervient to his own perſonal happineſs.—No puniſhment is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with juſtice, which in view of the criminal alone, without reſpect to a ſubſtitute, or an atonement, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good does not require.</p>
            <p>SO that the whole ſyſtem of this author depends on this ſingle principle, That it is not conſiſtent with juſtice, to puniſh a ſinner any further, than is ſubſervient to his own perſonal good: and this principle, as I have endeavoured to ſhow in Chap. II, and VIII, really comes to this, <hi>Whether ſin be a moral evil.</hi> Moral evil is in its own nature odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and juſtly the object of divine diſapprobation, and of the manifeſtation of diſapprobation, whether ſuch manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of diſapprobation be ſubſervient to the perſonal good of the ſinner or not. But the manifeſtation of divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation is puniſhment. Therefore moral evil may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be puniſhed, whether ſuch puniſhment be ſubſervient to the perſonal good of the ſinner or not. But as ſin accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the principle now under conſideration, cannot be juſtly puniſhed any further than is ſubſervient to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal good of the ſinner, of courſe it is no moral evil.</p>
            <p>AGAIN; moral evil in its own nature impairs the good of the moral ſyſtem. Therefore God as a friend to that ſyſtem, muſt neceſſarily, and may juſtly diſapprove it, and manifeſt his diſapprobation, though it may not tend to the perſonal good of the ſinner. But this manifeſtation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſapprobation is puniſhment, and juſt puniſhment.
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:022478_0320_0FB92C86B2C256C8"/>
But ſin, according to the principle now under conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cannot juſtly be thus puniſhed. Therefore ſin is not, according to this principle, a moral evil.</p>
            <p>IF therefore M. P—rre believe, that ſin is a moral evil, and in its own nature deſerves the divine abhorrence, he muſt, to be conſiſtent, give up his whole ſyſtem of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſalvation.</p>
            <p>AS the book now before us is a later publication than Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>'s; and as the Doctor's book, which at its firſt appearance was ſo highly extolled for deep learning and demonſtrative reaſoning, did not convert the world; the zealots for univerſaliſm have been laviſh of their encomiums on this work of Petitpierre, and as it ſeems, have great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from it. However, it requires no ſpirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy to foreſee, that this book will not effect more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous converſions, than that of Dr. C. The author has a good talent at <hi>declamation</hi>; and thoſe who are already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of the truth of his ſyſtem, may be much comforted by his pathetic repreſentations of the divine goodneſs and univerſal happineſs. But thoſe who are doubtful, and wiſh to ſee a conſiſtent ſyſtem eſtabliſhed on the broad ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of reaſon and revelation, will doubtleſs find themſelves neceſſitated to proſecute their inquiries further, than M. <hi>Petitpierre</hi> will lead them.</p>
