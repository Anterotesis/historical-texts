            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was the Earnest desire of some who heard these <hi>SERMONS</hi> Preached, and thought they were Edifyed by them, that caused me to consent to their being sent to the Press. One who has the Pen of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If God will graciously fulfill His blessed Promise, Psal. <hi>92.14. They shall still bring forth fruit in Old Age,</hi> Let His Name alone have all the Glory. I have reason to expect that every Sermon I Preach will be my L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>DOCT. I. <hi>That Men may enjoy the outward Calls of the Gospel, and be in some measure wrought on thereby, yet not be effectually and savingly Called.</hi>

                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002147_0004_0FBC21D058F75B80"/>PROP. I. <hi>That Men may be outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Called, yet not inwardly &amp; savingly.</hi> This is evident, in that the call of the Gospel is Universal, where-ever it is Preached, Mar. 16.15. <hi>Go</hi> says Christ, <hi>into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature,</hi> that is to say, to every reasonable Creature, to every Man and Woman, without excepting any, be they high or low, rich or poor, old or young, let them have the Grace of the Gospel offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, Christ offered to them. Rev. 22.17. <hi>Come whosoever will, and let him take the water of life freely.</hi> Christ who is the water of life, is compared to a Fountain <hi>set open,</hi> Zech. 13.1. Christ is that Fountain set open, that whosoever will may come, the vilest Sinners may come to it, and if they will come and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Christ they shall be cleansed and saved. Where-ever the Gospel comes, God commands every Man that hears it to repent. Act. 17.30. <hi>Now God commandeth all men every
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002147_0004_0FBC21D058F75B80"/>
where to repent.</hi> All Men are Sinners, and God in the Gospel calls upon them to repent, and If they do so, the Gospel Promises their Sins shall be forgiven them. Also the Gospel commands Men to believe as well as to repent, 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>This is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son Iesus Christ.</hi> Thus it is an universal offer, yet all Men that have it set before them do not accept the offer. So it is said here, when they were invited to come to Christ, <hi>they made light of it.</hi> Some that have the Word of God dispenced to them, they despise it, and the despensers of it. So did the Jews of old, 2 Chron. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.16. <hi>They mocked the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssengers of God,</hi> and despised His words, and mis-used His Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against His People, till there was no remedy. So did they deal with the Holy Apostles, nay with Christ Himself; when Christ Himself Preached to them there
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002147_0005_0FBC21D12D4D36B8"/>
were those that derided Him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.14. Christ preach'd an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sermon, but it is said the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasees who were covetous derided Him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There are some that the Call of the Gospel has made some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression on them, yet they have not been effectually and savingly wrought upon thereby.</hi> In the Parable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sower, there are four sorts of Ground spoken of, but only one of them did bring forth fruit, all the other had some effects wro't upon them, only one brought forth fruit. So of those that hear the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel there are but few that bring forth the fruits of Faith, of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Holiness.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Word of God does sometimes cause knowledge &amp; illumination in the minds of Men, yet no thorow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version. Balaam</hi> had the knowledge of the most High, and saw visions of God. Some have had great il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations on their minds through

But a Man may be of the Visible Church yet not be of the invisible Church. By the Invisible Church we understand the Elect of God who are effectually called, or true Believers on the Lord Jesus Christ; all who are of the Visible Church are not such, which will appear from several Things, which are Demonstrations of the Truth before us.</p>

Jer. 9.25, 26. <hi>I will punish the circumcised with the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, Edom, Amon, and Moab, are uncircumcised in flesh, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.</hi> Baptism that succeeds Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, the Jews had indeed a <hi>Typical Baptism</hi> when they pass'd out of the Land of Egypt, 1 Cor. 10.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

so; and it is said that Christ Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized more Disciples than John, in the Fourth Chapter of Johns Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, yet there were great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of those that did partake of that Seal of the Covenant which were those God did not approve of. The other Seal of the Covenant is that of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi>; Men may have that given to them yet not be of the Lord's Chosen, as in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, there was one came to the Marriage Feast, and had not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e many of the Visible Church of which this cannot be said, therefore they are a state of Hypocrisy. This is a weighty Truth, therefore I shall enlarge upon it, And enquire first, how does it appear there are Hypocrites in the Visible Church of God. 2. Whence doth it come to pass?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How does it appear, there are Hypocrites in the Visible Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. 1. <hi>The Scriptures plainly intimate this Truth unto us.</hi> 2 Tim. 2.20. <hi>In a great house there are vessels
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002147_0020_0FBC21EAADB50108"/>
not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth, Vessels to honour, and vessels to dishonour</hi>; what is that great house, It is the Visible Church of God, therein, are not only Vessels of Gold, sincere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Religion are those Vessels of Gold, Vessels of Honour, such as honour God and will be honoured by Him, but there are also Vessels of dishonour, that will be Subjects of Everlasting contempt in another World, yet some such have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Church of God. John Baptist said, Mat. 3.11, 12. <hi>I indeed baptize you with water,</hi> intimating, that was all he could do, and that many he Baptized had no more than the external Baptism, <hi>but he that cometh after me, is mightier than I, he shall Baptize you with the Holy Ghost, whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat unto the garner, but he will burn up the chaff with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable fire.</hi> In the Lord's Floor
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002147_0021_0FBC21EDCE1EF998"/>
there is not only Wheat, but also Chaff; as for the Wheat they are sincere Professors of Religion, the Lord will in His time gather them into His Garner. What is that Garner? It is Heaven. As for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>se that are <hi>Hypocrites</hi> they are <hi>Chaff,</hi> and that chaff must be burn'd with unquenchable Fire. Several of the Parables uttered by our Lord Jesus Christ the design of them is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate this holy Truth to us, as this wherein is my Text. The Marriage Supper intimates when the Gentiles should be called there should be Hypocrites as well as Godly Persons. And in the Parable of the Drag &amp; Net, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.47. The Kingdom of Heaven is like a Net cast into the Sea, and Fishes are taken in it <hi>both good and bad,</hi> that is to so say, in the Visible Church there would be not only such as were sincere, but such as were no better than Hypocrites. The Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Ten Virgins intimates
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002147_0021_0FBC21EDCE1EF998"/>
this to us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto Ten Virgins whereof Five were Wise, and Five were Foolish; as for the Wise, they had Oyl in their Lamps, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Truth before us has been confirmed in all Ages of the World.</hi> Ever since their was a Church on Earth there has been Hypocrites as well as Sincere Professors therein, as now, when the Church was in Families a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WE proceed to the Third Doctrine that has been mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Lord's Chosen are but Few.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For clearing the Truth Two Things are to be attended. First, To show how this is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that the Lord's Chosen are but few. Secondly, To mention some Things which are Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Truth before us. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How is this to be understood, that the Lord's Chosen are but few.</hi> For Answer, It is to be understood not in an absolute but in a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative sense, for it is a Truth that the Lord has chosen many, many Hundreds, many Thousands, many Ten Thousands, to be the Objects of His Love, and of His Salvation. Our Saviour Christ when He did

institute that Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, He declared that His Blood was <hi>shed for many,</hi> Mat. 26.28. therefore the Lord's Chosen are many. It is said of Abraham, that his Children should be as the Stars of Heaven that could not be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, which is to be understood es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially concerning his spiritual Children, namely Believers, who are said to be his Children, He is said to be the Father of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The like promise is made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning David, <hi>Ier.</hi> 33.22. that God would multiply his Seed, that they should be even as the Stars of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>David</hi> there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, so that Believers shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>comparative sense,</hi> that the Lord's Chosen are but few, namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Compared with the rest of the World, so they are but Few. Rom. 11.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>7. <hi>The Election hath obtained, and the rest were blinded.</hi> The whole World is divided into <hi>the Election,</hi> and <hi>the rest.</hi> Now the Election are but few compared with the rest of the World, therefore they are said to be but a <hi>Remnant,</hi> ver. 5. <hi>A rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant according to Election.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They are but Few compared with those that have the Gospel offered unto them, that have the Call of the Gospel, the Word of God vouchsafed to them, few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with them that enjoy the Means of Grace; thus has it been all along in all Ages of the World, it was thus in the Old World, there were many had the Word of God dispensed to them, who yet were not of the Lord's Chosen; thus for the Sinners of the Old World, it is said of them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. that Christ
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:002147_0037_0FBC2208EBAF0390"/>
did Preach to them, <hi>the Spirits that are in prison,</hi> that is to say, the damned Souls of the Sinners of the Old World: There was a time Christ Preached to them by His Holy Spirit in the Ministry of <hi>Noah</hi> who was a Preacher of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; they had the Word of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vouchsafed to them, they were called upon to repent and turn to God, yet they did it not. Thus it was in <hi>Moses's</hi> time, for Moses Preached not the Law only but the Gospel also, he Preached the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace among that People, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10. he said to them, <hi>Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God, that thou shouldest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Covenant with the Lord thy God:</hi> yet many of them that did enter into the Lord's Covenant were not the Lord's peculiar Chosen ones that shall inherit Eternal Life. Thus it was in the days of the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Prophets Preached the Word of God to all the Children
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:002147_0038_0FBC220A1DFFCB58"/>
of Israel, to the whole Nation of Israel, yet they were not many of them Chosen, Jer. 6.30. <hi>Reprobate silver shall men call them because the Lord hath rejcted them.</hi> Thus it was in the days of the Apostles, they Preached the Gospel to the Jewish N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ion, yet they made light of it, did not accept it. Thus it was when our Saviour Himself appeared in the World, He Preached the Gospel to many who were not the Lord's Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sen, but did reject and refuse the Grace which was offered to them by Christ. Joh. 8.47. <hi>You hear not my words</hi> says Christ, <hi>because ye are not of God,</hi> he that is of God heareth God's words. Christ said to them, ye believe not because <hi>ye are not of my Sheep.</hi> Christ Preach'd the Word to them, they had the best Means ever People in this World had, for all that they were not Sheep, they were not the Lord's Chosen. So we see the Lord's Chosen are but few comparatively, compared
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:002147_0038_0FBC220A1DFFCB58"/>
with the rest of the World, and compared with those that have the outward Means of Grace vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to them; <hi>Who has believed our report,</hi> says the Prophet. There are but few true Believers, so but few Chosen among those that have the report of the Gospel brought unto them. But how does this appear?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We shall mention some Demonstrations of it.</p>
               <p>Demon. 1. <hi>It is evident in that those that enjoy the Means of Grace are but few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:002147_0039_0FBC220CEF6E1700"/>2. <hi>The Scripture does plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate this Truth.</hi> In the Scripture there are two ways spoken of, and every Man that hears me this day, nay every Man in the whole World at this day, is in one of those two ways, either in the broad way, or the narrow way, there is a broad way, there are great multitudes going in that way, that way leads to destruction; as for the narrow way there are but few in that, <hi>Few there be that find it.</hi> Therefore also does the Scripture say, Luk. 12.32. that the Lord's Chosen are <hi>a little Flock, Fear not little Flock, it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom</hi>; that is to say, you are Chosen of God, Ah but you are a Little Flock. The Original Word is <hi>Micron Poimnion, A Little, Little Flock indeed</hi>; so are the Lord's Chosen. The Israelitish Nation was a Type of the Elect of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they called by the name of Israel, Gal. 6.16. <hi>Peace be upon the

The Lord did not choose you because ye were more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than any people, <hi>for ye were the fewest of all people</hi>; so they were a Type of the Lord's Chosen in that respect.</p>
               <p>Demon. 3. <hi>Such Things are to be affirmed of the Lord's Chosen as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said of many.</hi> First, it is said of those that are the Lord's Chosen that they are or shall be Believers on the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Pet. 2.7. <hi>Unto you that believe he is precious.</hi> ver. 9. <hi>Ye are a chosen generation.</hi> They that are the Chosen Generation are or shall be Believers on the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Scripture speaks of <hi>the faith of God's Elect,</hi> Tit. 1.1. So that the Elect of God either have or shall have Faith.

Ephraim was a Type of the Lord's Chosen, and the Lord says, Jer. 31.18. <hi>I have heard Ephraim bem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hos. 14.8. <hi>Ephraim shall say, what have I to do any more with Idols,</hi> no more, never any thing more to

do with Idols; so they that are the Lord's Chosen shall be true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, this is true but of a few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively; look over the World there are but few such to be found, it is, as was in <hi>Ieremiahs</hi> time, I hearkened and heard, <hi>no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented saying, what have I done</hi>; no man, that is very few comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thirdly, <hi>As for the Lord's Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen they shall be holy.</hi> Eph. 1.4. He hath chosen us that we should be holy. If the Lord has chosen, there will certainly holiness follow. Heb. 3.1. <hi>Holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling</hi>; they that are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Heavenly Calling, are Holy Brethren; there are but few comparatively<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are holy ones.

<pb n="80" facs="unknown:002147_0042_0FBC221111C20D10"/>
we must conclude the Lord's Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen are but few. The World ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally is an ungodly World, as the Old World is styled <hi>the World of the ungodly</hi>: and truly the same Epithet belongs to it still as to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity of it. 2 Cor. 4.4. <hi>The God of this World hath blinded the minds of them which believe not.</hi> Who is the God of this World? The Devil the destroyer of Souls is the God of this World. Then we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude there are but few that are the Lord's Chosen.

There Names are written in the Lambs Book of Life; they then shall have Life given to them: Those God has chosen he has a Book of Life and every one of their Names are written there, therefore they shall have Eternal Life given to them. 2 Thes. 2.13. <hi>God hath from the beginning chosen you to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, through sanctification of the

Certainly there are but a few<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that will enter into the Gate of Life, of Salvation. We see from these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars the Doctrine clear'd. For the Improvement of it.</p>
               <p>USE. I. We may here see the Erroneousness of several Opinions that some have taken up: As now that opposition of <hi>Universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> that Christ has died to save all Men whatsoever, if that were true, my Doctrine would not be true, that few are Chosen, for Christ's Redemption, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of God run Parallel, Christ died to redeem only those, and all those God has given to Him, and they are the Objects of His special Love. Christ says, Joh. 15.13. <hi>Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend.</hi> Those Christ has laid down his life for, are the objects of His special peculiar love. Can any one think that <hi>Christ</hi> loved <hi>Iudas</hi> as much as

                  </gap>e imagined. Gal. 2.21. says the Apostle, <hi>If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain,</hi> which may not be imagined. Thus if Christ dyed for all Men, for those whom the Lord has not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, then He died in vain for a very great part of the World, but we must not imagine this. We find in Scripture Christ would not so much as Pray for the Reprobate World. Joh. 17.9. <hi>I pray for them which thou hast given me,</hi> says Christ, <hi>I pray not for the world</hi>: But has Christ died for that World, which He would not so much as once Pray and plead with God for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of?

foolish fashion, if many take it up, others take it up, and think they do well, Why? every Body does it; But what says the Scripture, Exod. 23.2. <hi>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil,</hi> What though a multitude practise it, if the thing is evil it may not be followed, the Scripture says, <hi>Conform not your selves to this world,</hi> but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.

Christ therefore said to His Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>What do ye more than others?</hi> It is said to the Church of Sardis, Rev. 3.4. <hi>Thou hast a few names which have not defiled their garments.</hi> Well then, Christians should be and do even as a few, and not
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:002147_0046_0FBC22186531B698"/>
follow a multitude. We find the Eminent Servants of God have been singular. <hi>Noah</hi> in his time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.1. God says to him, <hi>I have seen thee righteous before me in this Generation.</hi> He differed from the whole Generation he lived in, he served God faithfully, did as but few did, so God did for him as He did but for few. The Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> was a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Man, 1 Kin. 19.10. says he, <hi>The children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine Altars, they have worshipped Baal, and I only am left.</hi> Indeed there were seven thousand which he did not know of, Godly ones, that had not bowed their knee to Baal; but that was but a very small number comparatively among that People, who could loose Five Hundred Thousands in one Battel. <hi>Lot,</hi> he also was a singular Man, he was vexed with the ungodly conversation of the wicked. It was
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:002147_0047_0FBC2219F16D2708"/>
a fore grief and trouble to him, there was not such a Man as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Zech. 3.8. The Lord said unto him, <hi>Thou and thy Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows are Men wondred at.</hi> What were they wondred at for? For their Piety, for their Courage and Zeal, that they would venture to build the Temple of God, when all the World was set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. Then it becomes Christians not to follow the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, but to be and do as but very few in the World do.</p>
               <p>USE. III. <hi>If there be but few that are the Lord's Chosen, they that are of those few what cause have they to be thankful, to be blessing and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God.</hi> If we see marks and signs of Election in others, we
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:002147_0047_0FBC2219F16D2708"/>
ought to bless God for them, as the Apostle did for his Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, 1 Thes. 1.2, 4. <hi>We give thanks to God for you, knowing Brethren your Election of God.</hi> They knew it only by a judgment of charity, they saw that in them that was a sign of their being God's Chosen. Much more they that have a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of infallability concerning their own being the Chosen of God, ought to be exceedingly thankful, in that this Choice proceeds purely from the Grace of God. Deut. 7.8. <hi>God has loved you, because he l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ved you</hi>: so he chooses them, because he chooses them, without any work of theirs, without regard to any desert of theirs, He chooses them from His Sovereign Grace, therefore they ought to be the more thankful. As for the Elect of God themselves, they are by Nature no better than the vilest Reprobates that lives on the face of the Earth, they are
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:002147_0048_0FBC221B5CE09018"/>
                  <hi>Children of Wrath</hi> even as others, they are guilty of Adam's Sin, guilty of Original Sin, they bring Original Sin into the World with them, and they are guilty of Actual Sins, <hi>We were sometimes disobedient,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>even as others.</hi> It may be more guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, guilty of many more Actual Sins than others. Some of them have been so; as now, <hi>Paul</hi> what a Sinner had he been, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses that he had been the chief of Sinners, he persecuted the Saints of God, he consented to the Blood of the Martyr <hi>Stephen,</hi> and when God bid <hi>Ananias</hi> go to him and comfort him when in the pangs of the New Birth, says <hi>Ananias, Lord, I have heard of this man how much evil he hath done to thy Saints at Ierusalem,</hi> but the Lord said to him, go thy way for he is <hi>a chosen Vessel</hi> unto me. It is then from Grace that God is pleased to choose any of the
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:002147_0048_0FBC221B5CE09018"/>
Children of Men: Then they that are Chosen ought to bless God. There is no cause of it but the free Sovereign Grace of God. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Christ is the cause of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the meritorious cause, but we cannot say Christ Himself is the cause of Election, for Christ Himself is an Elect Vessel, the Head of the Elect World. So then there is no cause of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection but only the free love of God, who <hi>will be gracious because he will be gracious, and will shew mercy to whom he will shew mercy.</hi> Therefore the Elect of God ought to be exceeding thankful unto Him. If there is Election most certainly Salvation will follow, no Elect Soul shall ever miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is said of some they shall deceive <hi>if it were possible, the very Elect,</hi> but that is impossible that an Elect Vessel should be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so as to become an Apostate from God, though others may
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:002147_0049_0FBC221EC010C4F8"/>
that have made a great Profession, and the People they lived among did think surely they were Good Men, they may fall away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Apostates, but those that belong to Election it is impossible any such should miscarry as to their Eternal Salvation, this you ought to be thankful for; Yes, you will say, <hi>If we knew we were of that Number.</hi> The Scripture tells you how you may know it, it is known by one thing, and but by one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> your Effectual Calling. 2 Pet. 1.10. <hi>Give diligence to make your calling and election sure.</hi> Would you be sure of your Election, then make sure you are Effectually Called, and my Life for thine, thou shalt go to Heaven when thou diest; make sure of true Faith in Christ. Says Christ, <hi>My Sheep,</hi> that is to say, the Lord's Chosen, <hi>they hear my voice and follow me,</hi> Joh. 10.17. Shepherds among us they drive
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:002147_0049_0FBC221EC010C4F8"/>
their Sheep before them, but it was not so in the Eastern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their Sheep followed them, they knew the Voice of their Shepherds and followed them. Do you hear the Voice of Christ and follow Him? Do you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lamb whithersoever He goes? Then you may be sure of it, you are Christ's Sheep, that Christ has died for you, that you are of the Chosen of God. Then there is another Use, I am loth to mention it, it is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful one, but I must do it, God has commanded me to do it, and that I should this Day do it, in this Congregation.</p>
               <p>USE. IV. <hi>Hence then it is certain that the greatest part of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men will perish Eternally.</hi> And how dismal is that to think of, yet so it is. I remember I have heard of a Man that was possest of a Devil, and he uttered
