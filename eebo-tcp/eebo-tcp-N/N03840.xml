      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

from the Press in its own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
against the <hi>Character</hi> or
Account given of it by Mr.
<hi>Whitefield,</hi> (in his last <hi>Continuation of his
Iournal,</hi> commencing <hi>Iune 25th, 1740, p.</hi>
12.) in these Words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In the Morning (<hi>Sunday</hi> July 13th)
I went to Church, and heard the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary</hi>
preach. But had some INFERNAL
SPIRIT been sent to draw <hi>my Picture,</hi>
I think it scarcely possible he could paint
me in more horrid Colours. I think if
ever, then was the Time that all Manner
of Evil was spoke against me falsely for
<hi>Christ</hi>'s Sake. The <hi>Commissary</hi> seem'd
to ransack Church History for Instances
of <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> and abused Grace; HE
DREW A PARALLEL between me, and
all the <hi>Oliverians, Ranters, Quakers,
French Prophets,</hi> 'till he came down to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004721_0004_0000000000000000"/>
a Family of the <hi>Dutarts,</hi> who lived
(not many Years ago) in <hi>South-Carolina,</hi>
and were guilty of the most notorious
<hi>Incests</hi> and <hi>Murders.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In these Words, I say, (and 'tis a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
not prefaced with, <hi>the Meekness and
Gentleness of</hi> CHRIST) Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> has
censured the following Discourse; but with
what <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Iustice</hi> I shall leave the
<hi>Reader</hi> to judge, after assuring him, that
as it now appears from the <hi>Press,</hi> it is a
<hi>full</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> Copy of what was delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the <hi>Pulpit.</hi> Some few Sentences
indeed are here and there interspersed by
Way of <hi>Enlargement,</hi> under the <hi>second</hi> and
<hi>third</hi> Heads, but nothing <hi>omitted;</hi> but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>first</hi> Head, treated of in the <hi>last</hi>
Place, and on which the Censure falls, there
is neither <hi>Addition, Omission,</hi> or <hi>Alteration</hi>
of so much as a <hi>single</hi> Word throughout the
Whole; excepting only the Names of the
<hi>Dutartre</hi>'s Family added, and the <hi>Date</hi>
of their Trial.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reader</hi> will easily observe, that the
plain and professed Scope of the <hi>censured</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004721_0005_0000000000000000"/>
Part of the Discourse was, to call my
<hi>Hearers</hi> to their Guard, against that <hi>Bane</hi>
of true Religion, <hi>Enthusiasm;</hi> by pointing
out, and cautioning them against the <hi>first</hi>
Causes, Springs, and beginnings of it, and also
by shewing in <hi>various</hi> Instances, the horrible
<hi>Excesses,</hi> both in <hi>Theory</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> to
which such Beginnings <hi>may grow.</hi> And
thus agreeably had Mr. <hi>Whitefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ld</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
it; nay, and moreover added, that
probably the Discourse was occasioned by,
and levelled against <hi>himself,</hi> as an upstart
<hi>Enthusiast,</hi> just entered on the <hi>Race,</hi> scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
about some <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>fanatick</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and run into some <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
Practices, <hi>Disturbance</hi> of the Church's
Peace, <hi>Disobedience</hi> to Superiours, <hi>Slander</hi>
and <hi>Abuse,</hi> thus levelled, I say, against
<hi>himself,</hi> and cautioning my <hi>Hearers</hi> against
such <hi>Beginnings,</hi> as of no small Danger, to
what <hi>Excess</hi> of Error and Immorality they
might grow: Such Representation I should
have taken <hi>no</hi> Exception to. But instead
of this, to represent it as he has done; as
containing not only <q>as horrid a <hi>Picture</hi>
of him as the <hi>Devil</hi> himself could have
<hi>painted,</hi> but also a <hi>Parallel</hi> actually
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004721_0006_0000000000000000"/>
                  <hi>drawn</hi> 'twixt him and all the <hi>Oliveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
&amp;c.</hi> down to the <hi>Dutarts,</hi> who
were guilty of the most notorious <hi>Incest</hi>
and <hi>Murders;</hi>
               </q> I much rather chuse to
leave to the Censure of others, than be
tempted to return him his own Language.
But after all, I must take leave to let Mr.
<hi>Whitefield</hi> know, that if the Discourse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
any <hi>Picture,</hi> or any <hi>Features</hi> or
<hi>Lines</hi> of any <hi>Picture,</hi> that he is conscious
will fit him; or if it affords any <hi>Parallel</hi>
which he is <hi>conscious</hi> then subsisted, or
which <hi>now</hi> subsists, or may <hi>hereafter</hi>
subsist 'twixt <hi>him</hi> and any of the <hi>Enthusiasts</hi>
therein mentioned, with Respect either to
<hi>Principles</hi> or <hi>Practices,</hi> he is very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to either or both of them, for I mean
not to make him any the least <hi>Apology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time the <hi>World</hi> is pretty well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with this <hi>Gentleman's</hi> Manner of
<hi>Iournalizing</hi> both <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> so
as to answer the one Point in View. If his
Measure of <hi>Slander</hi> and <hi>Abuse</hi> is not yet
full, it must soon be so: And therefore a
few <hi>Remarks</hi> will suffice (and which I
shall take this Opportunity to offer) on the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004721_0007_0000000000000000"/>
several <hi>other</hi> Passages of his <hi>Iournals,</hi> in
which I have the Honour to be mentioned.</p>
            <p>From Page 14th to the 22d of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<hi>Continuation &amp;c.</hi> he gives an Account
of what he calls <hi>the Commissary's Dealings
with him,</hi> that is, the Proceedings of the
<hi>Ecclesiastical Court</hi> against him: But
which is so stufft with his own <hi>Impertinence</hi>
he was indulged in, beneath remarking on;
and so full of <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Mistakes</hi> (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
he had a <hi>Copy</hi> of all Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in his Hands) as would take more space
than can be well afforded to correct; and
therefore I shall content myself only to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
by way of Specimen.</p>
            <p>1. Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s <hi>Integrity</hi> of Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in this Affair. He assures me to my
Face (<hi>Iournal continued from</hi> January 11,
1739, P. 16) that <q>he would regard my
Suspension as much as a Pope's Bull.</q>
Well; he is se<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

at the <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> of the Court; and after
having set down the several crude Things
he said on that Head, the Words of his

                   facs="unknown:004721_0008_0000000000000000"

               <hi>Iournal</hi> are theseâ€”<q>I therefore upon
the whole humbly desired as a Favour
from the Court, that I might have 'till
to-Morrow 9 o'Clock, to inform myself
of the Extent of their Ecclesiastical Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in this Province, ASSURING THEM
THAT UPON FINDING THEIR AUTHORI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY
VALID, I WOULD IMMEDIATELY AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SWER
TO ANY INTERROGATORIES, AND
WOULD BE READY TO RECEIVE ANY
SETENCE THEY COULD WITH JUSTICE
PASS UPON ME.</q>â€”Now on this
<hi>Promise</hi> or <hi>Assurance</hi> his Request was
granted; but what was the Event? Did
not Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> consult some <hi>Gentlemen</hi>
of the <hi>Law</hi> concerning the <hi>Validity</hi> of the
Court's Jurisdiction? And did not they
satisfy him that it was <hi>valid?</hi> And did he
not accordingly own himself so satisfied in
open Court? Tho' afterwards, at the Check
of his <hi>Advocate,</hi> he shuffled and retracted
it! And yet after all this, did he perform
his <hi>Promise</hi> which he made the <hi>Court?</hi>
No, he did not; but instead of <hi>receiving</hi>
and <hi>answering</hi> to the <hi>Articles</hi> objected, or
abiding any <hi>Sentence</hi> upon them, he brings
a <hi>Recusation of the Iudge,</hi> founded chiefly
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004721_0009_0000000000000000"/>
on the <hi>following</hi> Discourse which I had
preached the <hi>Sunday</hi> next before, and which
therefore it was necessary to represent in
<hi>such</hi> a Light as he has done. Alas; poor
<hi>Youth,</hi> what was he afraid of? A <hi>Pope's
Bull!</hi> 
               <q>This <hi>Recusatio Iudicis</hi> (saith he

Friends, not to quibble with, or evade
the Force or Rigour of any Law what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
that I might justly fall under.</q>

                  <hi>He (the

               </gap>eof to be authentically certified
into this Court.</p>
            <p>P. 22. He mentions a <hi>private</hi> Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he had with me, after the Affair of
his <hi>Appeal</hi> was finished; and the following
Particulars of it. <q>That I charged him
with <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> for saying if it was in
his Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>That he charged me
with accusing the <hi>Methodists</hi> in general,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>And that he asked why I ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed
him for making Grimaces in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004721_0011_0000000000000000"/>
Pulpit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> By all which and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
the Reader will be greatly instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
As to my charging him with <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy,</hi>
his Account is <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>unfair.</hi>
I objected indeed, that his <hi>Behaviour,</hi> ever
since he had been cited to appear before me,
had been very <hi>base</hi> and insidious, in <hi>haran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing</hi>
the Populace every Day, to <hi>excite
their Passions</hi> against me as a <hi>Persecutor,</hi>
(when he must know in his Conscience I
was but doing my bounden Duty) and at
the same Time professing such <hi>Flights of
Love</hi> for me, that <q>were it in his Power,
he <hi>would place me at the Right Hand of</hi>
GOD;</q> Which <hi>Phrase,</hi> I observed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every where in holy Scripture appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to <hi>Christ,</hi> GOD-MAN, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to any other <hi>in terminis</hi> and without
Restriction, sounded but too much as if the
Meaning were to <hi>displace CHRIST,</hi> which
would be <hi>Blasphemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why did not Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> instead
of these <hi>Dregs</hi> of the Conversation, give
the main <hi>Substance</hi> of it; which turned on
this <hi>Question,</hi> which I very seriously asked
him, viz. <hi>Whether he was in</hi> Jest <hi>or</hi> Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004721_0012_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>in the Scene he was carrying on in the
World?</hi> In Answer, he affirmed that he
was in <hi>Earnest,</hi> and that it was the Work
of God he was carrying on; and for the
Truth of which, he appealed (1st) to his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Feelings;</hi> and (2dly) to the <hi>ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

visible Effects</hi> of his Preaching, <hi>viz</hi> the
<hi>Crouds</hi> that attended it, and the <hi>Numbers</hi>
proselyted to his Doctrine, and wondered
how I could doubt of these being God's
<hi>Seals</hi> to his Ministry, or sure and certain
<hi>Evidence</hi> of his Approbation of it, by the
Aids, Influences, and Operations of his <hi>holy
Spirit</hi> attending it. On which Answer I
easily observed; (1st) That as to his <hi>inward
Feelings,</hi> whatever they were, or what <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
soever they might be to <hi>him,</hi> they
could be <hi>none</hi> to <hi>me,</hi> nor to any <hi>other</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

As to the outward visible <hi>Effects</hi> of his

               </gap>eaching, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Crouds</hi> attending it,

               </gap>grees, attended the Ministry
of <hi>Mahomet, Muncer, Fox, Nailor,</hi> and
<hi>Muggleton,</hi> and therefore that such Effects
can be no <hi>better</hi> Evidence of the <hi>Divine</hi>

Approbation of <hi>his</hi> Ministry, than they
were of <hi>theirs,</hi> who carried on, not the
Work of <hi>God,</hi> but of the <hi>Devil</hi> plainly.
And (3dly) that it must be either <hi>meer</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
or <hi>strong</hi> Delusion, in him, to ascribe
those <hi>Effect,</hi> to the Power or Influences of
the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Talent of Delivery,</hi> or Voice and Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
in Speaking, adapted to take the
Ear and excite the Passions of his Hearers.
I bid him only to put the <hi>same</hi> Words,
which from <hi>his</hi> Mouth produced the boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>

Effects, into the Mouth of an <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
Speaker, and see whether the <hi>same</hi> Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
would be the Consequence. To the
1st and 2d Particulars he made no Reply,
To the latter Part of the 3d, he answer'd in
these precise Words, that <hi>the Words of God
would not have the same Effect from the
Mouth of a</hi> fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e <hi>Prophet, as of a</hi> true.
On which I desired him to say, what he
meant by a <hi>true Prophet</hi> in Contradistinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to a <hi>false</hi> one? He said, he meant a
Person not only regularly called to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry</hi>
of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> by the <hi>outward</hi> Call
or Order of the Church, but who was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004721_0014_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>regenerate</hi> by the holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> in his
Sense of Regeneration, and had the <hi>same</hi>
Feelings of the <hi>Spirit's inward</hi> Call to that
Office, and Influences and Operations in it,
as he <hi>himself</hi> had; and that without these
no one's Ministry would be attended with
<hi>such</hi> Eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>cts as his was, even supposing he
preached the <hi>same</hi> true Doctrines of the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi>
â€”In Answer to this, I bid him to
cease his Arrogance, and consult the 26th
<hi>Article</hi> of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Moreover
adding, that if the <hi>boasted</hi> Effects of his
<hi>Preaching</hi> depended on his <hi>Regeneration</hi>
and <hi>Feelings</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> how came it
to pass, that the <hi>same</hi> Effects did not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the <hi>Preachings</hi> of the Two <hi>Wesleys,</hi>
of <hi>Seagrave, Ingham, Kinchin, &amp;c.</hi> whom
he allowed to be <hi>equally</hi> regenerate Men,
and equally to have the <hi>same</hi> Feelings of
the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as he <hi>himself</hi> claimed or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to?</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>main</hi> Substance of what pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in that Conversation, which continued
not exceeding <hi>Half an Hour;</hi> and in the
Close of which, 'tis very true, he told me
(in Answer to every Thing, and especially
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004721_0015_0000000000000000"/>
the last mentioned) that he believed me to
be <hi>an unregenerate Man, an Enemy to
God,</hi> and <hi>of a like Spirit with the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
Saul. And thus, by calling me hard
Names to my Face (whom in a former
<hi>Iournal</hi> he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>P. 8. <q>
                  <hi>Sunday Iuly</hi> 6. Went to
Church Morning and Evening, and hear'd
the Commissary preach as <hi>virulent</hi> and
<hi>unorthodox, inconsistent a Discourse,</hi> as
ever I heard in my Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> That Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
is contained Word for Word in the
<hi>Third</hi> of the <hi>Six</hi> Letters to him, which are
now before the World.</p>
            <p>P. 23. <q>
                  <hi>Sunday Iuly</hi> 20th. Preached
this Morning as usual, and went after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to Church to hear the Commissary.
His Text was, <hi>Take heed how ye hear.</hi>
               </q>
I have been often told by Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s
Hearers, that however he <hi>shifted</hi> his Texts,
yet generally his Discourses were still much
the <hi>same,</hi> and that many of them would
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004721_0016_0000000000000000"/>
equally have suited any <hi>other</hi> Texts in the
<hi>Bible</hi> as those from which they were
preached. But whatever his own Practice
may be, as to regarding or not regarding
his Texts, yet sure when he pretends to
<hi>journalize</hi> an Account of any other Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher's
Discourse, he ought not to <hi>blunder</hi>
in asserting the <hi>Text,</hi> as he has here done.
For the <hi>Text</hi> here mentioned was not my
<hi>Text</hi> of the <hi>20th Iuly,</hi> but of the <hi>13th,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the Discourse in which he alledges I
drew so lovely a <hi>Picture</hi> of him, and which
I now publish; and my Discourse on the
<hi>20th,</hi> which he here speaks of, was on these
Words of <hi>St Paul,</hi> COL. 4th, 17th. <hi>And
say to Archippus, take heed to the Ministry
which thou hast received of the Lord, that
thou fulfil it.</hi> This shews how careful our
<hi>Iournalist</hi> is, and what Credit is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to his <hi>Iournals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. 25th. <q>I endeavour'd to stop their
(the People) Resentment against the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary</hi>
as much as possible, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
Peace and Moderation to them
in most of my Discourses.</q> Just as <hi>Mark

Anthony</hi> behaved towards the Conspirators,
in the Case of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Account he has given (in his next
preceding <hi>Continuation of his Iournal,</hi> P.
15 and 16.) of the <hi>first</hi> Conference 'twixt
us after he commenced. <hi>Apostle,</hi> and at
which I turned him and his Disciples out of
my House, is partly <hi>defective,</hi> partly <hi>false,
warped</hi> and <hi>mangled</hi> throughout. He has
<hi>omitted</hi> to say, that the Bells were chiming
for Morning Prayer when he came to my
House, and that I therefore desired to post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone
our Conference 'till the Afternoon:
â€”That he gave no Ear to this, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>iately
said, he supposed I had heard of
<hi>his Charges</hi> against the <hi>Clergy;</hi> and that it
was very true he <hi>charged</hi> them with <hi>three
Things,</hi> which he distinctly mentioned Word
for Word as I now set them down. 1st,
That they preach <hi>false Doctrines,</hi> contrary
to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the <hi>Articles</hi> of the
Church. 2dly, that they are guilty of <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy,
in subscribing</hi> to the <hi>Articles</hi> of the
Church, while yet they do <hi>not believe</hi> them.
And 3dly, that they are <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>negligent</hi> of
their Duty. He has <hi>omitted</hi> what passed on
the Subject of <hi>Iustification by Faith aloue;</hi>
but which is contained more at large in my
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004721_0018_0000000000000000"/>
printed Letters. He has <hi>omitted</hi> the
Reason he gave for not using the <hi>Liturgy</hi>
of the Church, when he officiated in F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>las
or <hi>Meeting-Houses, viz</hi> That the <hi>Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi>
meant only publick Prayers in <hi>Churches.</hi>
He has mentioned <hi>Balls</hi> and <hi>Assemblies</hi> in
<hi>Charles-Town</hi> as of dangerous Consequence
to Religion, without giving any Account or
Description of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>m; which therefore I must
take leave to supply. The <hi>Balls</hi> in
<hi>Charles-Town</hi> were the usual Breakings up
of the <hi>Dancing-School</hi> twice a Year, when
Parents and Relations generally went to see
the Children's Improvement. The <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
also on the <hi>Anniversary,</hi> either of his
Majesty's <hi>Accession</hi> or <hi>Birth-Day,</hi> usually
made an Entertainment of a Dinner for
the <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> and of a Supper and <hi>Ball</hi>
for the <hi>Lad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>es</hi> in the Evening. Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
also <hi>transient</hi> Gentlemen have given
such <hi>Entertainments,</hi> on their leaving the
Place; but very rarely. So that the whole
Number of <hi>Balls</hi> in <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> never
exceeded 5 or 6 in a Year, and but seldom
3 or 4, and some Years there have been
none at all.â€”And as to the <hi>Assemblies,</hi>
there never was any such Thing in the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004721_0019_0000000000000000"/>
Place, 'till about 2 or 3 Years ago some
10 or 12 <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and their <hi>Ladies,</hi> of
the first <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> in the Place,
agreed to meet during the <hi>Winter Season</hi>
only, and one Evening in a Week, to
pass 2 or 3 Hours in Conversation, or any
other <hi>innocent</hi> Diversion or Amusement.
Nor did ever this <hi>fiery Creature,</hi> nor any
of his <hi>begetting</hi> here, dare to charge that
<hi>Assembly</hi> with any the least <hi>Excess</hi> either of
<hi>Drinking</hi> or <hi>Gaming,</hi> or with the least <hi>Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion</hi>
of any sort of <hi>Vice</hi> or <hi>Immorality</hi>
whatsoever. So that 'tis very true, it never
entered my Thoughts to preach against it,
no more than against Friends, Neighbours,
or Acquaintance Meeting together to pass
a Winter's Evening in their own private
Houses. And I very freely declare, that
had there appeared to me <hi>but half</hi> the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to <hi>Religion,</hi> or the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Happiness</hi>
of Society, from such <hi>Balls</hi> and <hi>Assemblies,</hi>
which has but too plainly appeared from his
<hi>Mobb-Preachings,</hi> and the <hi>Assemblies</hi> of
his Institution, of Men and Women,
Boys and Girls, <hi>building up one another</hi> in
Conceit of their being <hi>righteous,</hi> and not
only <hi>despising</hi> but <hi>damning all others</hi> round

Infant's Regeneration, and desiring the
<hi>Commissary</hi> to watch if the Child brought
forth the <hi>Fruits of the Spirit; viz.</hi> that
<hi>Baptism</hi> itself was the <hi>Sign;</hi> that as to <hi>other</hi>
Signs there appeared as many of its <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>
as of its <hi>Reason;</hi> and that as the
<hi>Infant</hi> growing up might abuse, and
depart from the due Use and Improvement
of its <hi>Reason,</hi> so it might of its <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi>
which only secured its Salvation
during its infant State, and before it came
to undo itself by <hi>actual</hi> Sins and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.â€”But
this <hi>instantaneous</hi> Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of Infants in <hi>Baptism</hi> (I take Leave
to add) is not the Regeneration which he
preaches; which is a Regeneration from
<hi>actual Habits</hi> of Sin in <hi>adult</hi> Persons after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004721_0022_0000000000000000"/>

L. 14. C. 17. He has <hi>omitted</hi> to say, that
he was ignorant of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> asserting the

would allow it; and that afterwards calling
for a <hi>Text</hi> of Scripture to prove it, he was
answered, what need to prove it to him,
who had <hi>suscribed</hi> it? Or to that Effect.
But above all, his Account of what passed
on the <hi>16th Article</hi> of the Church, is most
surprizing. He asserted (he says) that a
true Child of God, tho' he might fall <hi>fouly,</hi>
yet could never fall <hi>finally.</hi> Dr. <hi>Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
objected the <hi>16th Article,</hi> which says,
â€”<hi>after we have received the Holy Ghost,
we may depart from Grace given, and fall
into Sin.</hi> To which he answered, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ollows, <hi>and by the Grace of
God we MAT arise again.â€”</hi> Now if he
had thus fairly cited the <hi>Article,</hi> how in
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004721_0023_0000000000000000"/>
the World could it have serv'd his Purpose,
or answer'd to support his Assertion, that
<hi>a true Child of God could never fall finally?</hi>
For, what only MAY <hi>be,</hi> MAY <hi>not be;</hi>
and as the <hi>Article</hi> only says, <hi>we</hi> MAY
<hi>arise again,</hi> it implies, that <hi>we</hi> MAY <hi>not
arise again.</hi> But he knows what <hi>Trick</hi> he
would have put upon the <hi>Doctor.</hi> For in
citing this Part of the <hi>Article,</hi> he omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Word [MAY] and clap'd the Word
[SHALL.] into the Room of it;â€”<hi>we</hi>
SHALL <hi>arise again.</hi> Which obliged that
truly learned and worthy <hi>Divine</hi> to correct
him, by laying a strong <hi>Emphasis</hi> on the
Word [MAY] <hi>we</hi> MAY <hi>arise again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here that this 16th <hi>Article</hi> comes in
my Way, puts me in Mird, how widely
the <hi>old-Calvinists</hi> differed from the <hi>modern</hi>
Ones, in their Judgment about our <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>
The <hi>old-Calvinists</hi> were far from
judging our <hi>Articles</hi> to be <hi>Calvinistical,</hi> or
that they were drawn up according to <hi>that</hi>
Scheme. They plainly saw the Doctrines
of <hi>universal Redemption,</hi> and <hi>falling from
Grace,</hi> contained in them, (Art. 31, and 16)
which blow up <hi>that</hi> Scheme, and break
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004721_0024_0000000000000000"/>
its fine <hi>Chain</hi> of Doctrines all to Pieces:
And therefore they complained and called
for a Reformation of the <hi>Articles,</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and at the <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
(See <hi>Coll.</hi> Eccles. Hist.) and again
after the <hi>Restoration.</hi> (See Bishop <hi>Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s
no Necessity of reforming the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>) And
Dr <hi>Waterland,</hi> I think, fairly proves (<hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
to</hi> Arian <hi>Subscrip.</hi>) that the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi>
were not form'd by <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Scheme,
but according to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
â€”How differently our <hi>modern Calvinists</hi>
judge of them, I need not say.â€”But to
return,</p>
            <p>He has owned that he said, he saw <q>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
Souls among the Baptists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
But has supressed, his asserting his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Discernment.</hi> And I take
Leave to instance in his Two Fellow-Labourers,

what the World calls innocent Pleasures,

the Love of him who is to be the only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
Hope, and Delight, of their whole

the Protestants of <hi>Germany,</hi> as well
as those of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and has occasioned
several Edicts against it in the Dutchy of
<hi>Saxony.</hi> The Professors of it are accused
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004721_0032_0000000000000000"/>
of all the ill Practices which may seem to
be the Consequences of their Principles, as
that they ascribe the worst of Actions,
which their own vicious Tempers throw
them upon, to the Dictates of the Holy
Spirit; that both Sexes under Pretence of
devout Conversation visit one another at
all Hours, and in all Places, without any
Regard to common Decency, often making
their Religion a cover for their Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and that the very best of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

taken the most effectual way in the world
for the keeping their fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

do not mean the punishments they in flict
on Men's persons, which are commonly look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

deter them from breaking through the pale
of the Church, though certainly these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ay a

Cause why there are so few sects in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be the Maltitude of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004721_0033_0000000000000000"/>
with which they every where abound,
that serve as Receptacles for all those fiery

Houses of Devotion<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> All Men of dark
Tempers, according to their Degree of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy

fitted to their Humours, and meet with
Companions as gloomy as themselves. So
that what the Protestants would call a
Fanatick, is in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
of such or such an Order; as I have
been told of an <hi>English</hi> Merchant at <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
who after some great Disappointments
in the World was resolved to turn Quaker
or Capuchin; for, in the Change of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
Men of ordinary Understandings do
not so much consider the Principles, as the
Practice of those to whom they go over.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Words are connected with the
several next preceding Verses of this
<hi>Chapter,</hi> which contain our blessed Saviour's
<hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Sower,</hi> and his Exposition
of it to his Disciples.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Parable</hi> sets forth certain Cases,
in which ever so good <hi>Seed</hi> cast into the
Ground will perish, or bring no Fruit to
Perfection; <hi>viz.</hi> when either cast <hi>on the
Way-side,</hi> or <hi>on stony Ground,</hi> or <hi>among
Thorns;</hi> representing, in the <hi>Mythology</hi> or
<hi>Exposition,</hi> certain parallel Cases, in which
<hi>the Word</hi> (or Gospel) <hi>preached will not
profit</hi> the Hearers, i.e, will not bring forth
in them the Fruits of <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi>
and <hi>good Works,</hi> or be of any Advantage
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004721_0035_0000000000000000"/>
towards their <hi>Salvation:</hi> To which is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd
this <hi>Caveat</hi> or Admonition of the
Text, <hi>Take heed therefore how ye hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS the <hi>Parable</hi> and <hi>Exposition;</hi> and
which naturally direct our Discourse on the
<hi>Words</hi> before us, to a particular Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the several Things, pursuant to
the Tenor of the <hi>Parable,</hi> which we are
<hi>to take heed</hi> or beware of in Hearing, so as
<hi>the Word preached may profit us;</hi> i.e. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
or prevail upon us, <hi>to be Doers of
the Word, and not the Hearers only, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
our ownselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT <hi>first</hi> it will be of Importance, to
premise, and carry along with us these <hi>Two</hi>
Observations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> THAT the true Scope and Intent
of the whole <hi>Parable</hi> is, to charge the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulness</hi>
of the <hi>Word</hi> to the <hi>bad</hi> Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Men. For though
various other Causes there are of the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulness</hi>
of <hi>Seed sown,</hi> besides the <hi>bad</hi>
Dispositions of the Ground, as <hi>Floods,</hi> or
<hi>Drought,</hi> the <hi>Caterpillar,</hi> or <hi>Canker-worm,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004721_0036_0000000000000000"/>
Blasts,</hi> or <hi>Mildews,</hi> &amp;c. yet none other
we find mentioned in the <hi>Parable,</hi> but the
<hi>bad</hi> Dispositions of the Ground only: And
correspondently in the <hi>Application,</hi> though
various <hi>divine</hi> Aids and Graces are as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to the <hi>Fruitfulness</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi> as
the <hi>good</hi> Dispositions of the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Men,
yet is not its <hi>Unfruitfulness</hi> charged to any
Want of the <hi>former,</hi> but of the <hi>latter</hi> of
these only; Nay, such <hi>divine</hi> Aids and
Graces are not so much as mentioned, lest
Men should <hi>charge God foolishly,</hi> by char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
their Unprofitableness in Hearing to
his either <hi>total</hi> withholding, or <hi>partial</hi> and
too sparing Communications of these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> IT is obvious also on the Face
of the <hi>Parable</hi> and <hi>Exposition,</hi> that the
<hi>bad</hi> Dispositions of Men's Hearts, which
obstruct their <hi>profitable</hi> Hearing of the
<hi>Word,</hi> are wholly owing to themselves, to
their own <hi>bad</hi> Husbandry and Neglect.â€”
And thence agreeably the Caveat of the
Text, <hi>Take heed therefore how ye hear;</hi>
that is, <hi>take heed</hi> that you sue all <hi>good</hi>
Husbandry and Diligence to amend those
<hi>bad</hi> Dispositions of your Hearts, which
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004721_0037_0000000000000000"/>
through Slothfulness, or Want of due Care
and Cultivation, are grown up in them,
and obstruct your <hi>profitable</hi> Hearing of the
<hi>Word;</hi> and which we now proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
with one Variation only of the order
in which they are set down in the <hi>Parable.</hi>
And,</p>
            <p>I. THE first <hi>bad</hi> Disposition of Heart,
in the Order of the <hi>Parable,</hi> which we are
<hi>to take heed</hi> of and be sure that we amend,
in order to our <hi>profitable</hi> Hearing of the
<hi>Word,</hi> is that represented or resembled by,
<hi>the Way side.</hi> But as this Disposition ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs
the <hi>Fruitfulness</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> various
Ways, and which we purpose more fully
to observe, we therefore take Leave to post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone
it to the <hi>last</hi> Place, and proceed,</p>
            <p>II. To the <hi>second,</hi> viz. That which is
represented by <hi>the stony Ground.</hi> And by
<hi>stony Ground</hi> is well represented a Heart
<hi>incumbered</hi> with stubborn, corrupt <hi>Habits,
Lusts</hi> and <hi>Passions.</hi> What <hi>Rooks</hi> or <hi>Stones</hi>
are in a Corn-field, the same are inveterate
corrupt <hi>Habits, Lusts,</hi> and <hi>Passions,</hi> in the
Hearts of Men; and what Obstruction those
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004721_0038_0000000000000000"/>
will be of to the <hi>Fruitfulness</hi> of <hi>Corn-seed</hi>
sowed in the one, the same will <hi>these</hi> be of
to the <hi>Fruitfulness</hi> of <hi>Gospel-seed</hi> sowed in
the other. <hi>The Seed</hi> (saith the Parable)
<hi>which fell in stony Places, sprang up,</hi> but
<hi>lacking</hi> sufficient <hi>Moisture,</hi> a little Stress
of the Sun-beams upon it, scorched it up,
and it withered away. And in like Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> falling into the
Hearts of Men incumbered with corrupt
<hi>Habits, Lusts</hi> and <hi>Passions,</hi> may spring
and grow up for a Time; but alas!
such Soil must fail of sufficient <hi>Moisture</hi>
to nourish it, thro' various Stresses, up to
Perfection. Such Men may gladly hear
and receive the <hi>Word preached;</hi> it may
<hi>spring up</hi> in their Hearts into <hi>Faith,</hi> and
even formed <hi>Resolutions</hi> of Obedience; but
alas! when they come to <hi>Practice!</hi> when
they come to <hi>add to their Faith, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
and to Virtue, Knowledge; and to
Knowledge, Temperance; and to Temperance,
Patience; and to Patience, Godliness; and
to Godliness, Brotherly-kindness; and to
Brotherly-kindness, Charity;</hi> when they
come to enter on the Christian Warfare, the
<hi>Persecution</hi> of their darling <hi>Habits, Lusts
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004721_0039_0000000000000000"/>
Passions,</hi> to <hi>cut off a right Hand,</hi> or <hi>pluck
out a right Eye;</hi> how quickly will they be
<hi>offended!</hi> How quickly will the Heat of
the Contest scorch up the tender Blade of
the Word, and wither it away! So evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
is the Gospel <hi>a great Salvation</hi> to
the human World, that when fairly offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the most dege<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>erate Minds, they
cannot but see it, approve of, and rejoice
in it. They cannot but see it <hi>a great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
to the whole Posterity of Apostate
<hi>Adam,</hi> as containing a full and plain Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
not only of their <hi>Bondage of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;</hi>
that <hi>the whole Creation groaneth
and travaileth in Pain together,</hi> and how
or whence this Misery arose; but also of
a full and adequate Remedy; the proper
and adequate Means for <hi>delivering</hi> them
<hi>from this Body of Death,</hi> and restoring
them to <hi>the glorious Liberty of the Sons of
God,</hi> the Happiness of Life and Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The <hi>Heathens,</hi> by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
saw plainly this <hi>universal</hi> Bondage
of the human World: They plainly saw
themselves under it. They saw and felt <hi>Sin
reigning in their mortal Bodies;â€”a Law
in their Members, warring against the Law</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004721_0040_0000000000000000"/>
of their Minds, and bringing them into
Captivity to the Law of Sin; <hi>and even to
a plain Confession, that</hi> when they would do
Good, Evil was present with them;â€”
<hi>and the</hi> Good which they would they did
not, but the Evil which they hated, <hi>they
were led captive</hi> to do.
<q>Video meliora, broboque; deteriora sequor.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS <hi>common</hi> sore Evil or Misery of
Mankind, the <hi>Heathens</hi> saw, felt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed;
but whence it <hi>originated</hi> they were
wholly ignorant; and as to any <hi>adequate</hi>
Remedy, the Discoveries of their <hi>wisest</hi> Men
were next to Darkness, and agreeably of
little or no Effect or Service at all. All
their <hi>Philosophy</hi> indeed pretended such <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate</hi>
Remedy for its Object; But alas!
It was <hi>defective</hi> of the main <hi>Principles</hi> and
<hi>Motives</hi> for compassing this End. Their
greatest and <hi>wisest</hi> Men had no Knowledge
of the <hi>original</hi> State or Dignity of Human
Nature; nor how it came into its present <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi>
State or Condition; nor of the manner of
the <hi>Divine</hi> Interposition necessary for Men's
Recovery; nor of the glorious End to which
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004721_0041_0000000000000000"/>
God intends finally to conduct them: In
a Word, few or none of them had a <hi>right</hi>
Knowledge of God, much less <hi>how</hi> he was
to be worshipped, and least of all <hi>how</hi> to
be <hi>appeased</hi> for Offences committed against
him, so as to pardon them, and be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the Offenders. And as to <hi>the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of the Soul,</hi> the Certainty of a <hi>future
State,</hi> and the <hi>Rewards and Punishments</hi>
to be distributed in the Life to come, their
Notions were various, doubtful, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused.
â€”And agreeably<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
               <hi>they</hi> plainly saw
and confessed, that after all their Researches
after such Remedy, they were still surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Darkness; that all their Attempts
for the Recovery of Mankind from <hi>Error</hi>
and <hi>Corruption,</hi> were vain and fruitless,
and that it never could be effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>Divine Instructor,</hi> or some <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>
Assistance from God.</p>
            <p>NOW midst all this Distress of Bondage
and Darkness, how strongly must the <hi>Light</hi>
of the <hi>Gospel</hi> strike on, and affect the most
degenerate Minds! So evident, so plain a
Discovery of the alone certain and <hi>adequate</hi>
Means of their Relief and Deliverance from
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004721_0042_0000000000000000"/>
their Misery, and for advancing them to a
State of glorious Liberty and Happiness!
How strongly, I say, must this Discovery
of <hi>so great a Salvation</hi> strike the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
Minds of Men, and how necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
must they <hi>approve</hi> of, and <hi>rejoice</hi> in it!
Let the <hi>Sceptick</hi> pretend his <hi>no</hi> Certa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ty
of a God or an <hi>Hereafter,</hi> and the <hi>Deist</hi>
boast of his <hi>Religion of Nature;</hi> let Men
pretend to amuse themselves or others as
they please; yet not more certain is the
<hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> at Noon-day to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Eye, than that of the Gospel is to the
rational Mind. And agreeably, either let
the <hi>practical</hi> Precepts of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which
cross on the corrupt Lusts and Passions,
and confirmed Habits thence grown up in
Men, be struck out, and Christianity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
(as by the <hi>Antinomians</hi> it is) to a
mere <hi>Theory</hi> of Faith or Belief; or let Men
have no such Lusts, Passions, or Habits to
thwart or cross upon; and then let us see,
who would not be <hi>Christians indeed!</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Hearers of the Word preached unto
them? For, if not only <hi>bare</hi> Assent, Faith,
or Belief, but even Purposes and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Obedience, were sufficient to <hi>profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004721_0043_0000000000000000"/>
Hearing, who would not <hi>profitably</hi>
hear the <hi>Gospel?</hi> Who would not see, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and rejoice in it, as <hi>a great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
But, alas! so long as the <hi>Gospel</hi>
contains such Precepts as <hi>cross</hi> on the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Lusts, Passions, and Habits of Men,
and Men retain such Lusts, Passions, and
Habits to <hi>cross upon;</hi> these will prove the
great stumbling Stones, and Rocks of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against the <hi>Gospel;</hi>â€”will cause, that
<hi>the Word preached</hi> shall <hi>not profit</hi> the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
but be <hi>barren and unfruitful;</hi>â€”that
their <hi>Hearts shall wax gross, their Ears
dull in Hearing, and their Eyes dim in See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
so as, <hi>Hearing they shall hear, and
not understand, and seeing they shall see,
and not perceive;</hi>â€”nay finally, will cause,
that they shall <hi>turn away their Eyes</hi> from
seeing, and <hi>like the deaf Adder stop their
Ears, and refuse to hear the Voice of the
Charmer, charming never so wisely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us <hi>take heed</hi> then, my Brethren,
of this <hi>Indisposition</hi> of our Hearts in <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
viz. their Incumbrance with corrupt
Lusts and Passions, and Habits derived from
them, which will be sure to defeat <hi>the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004721_0044_0000000000000000"/>
Word,</hi> and render it <hi>nnfruitful.</hi> Let us
<hi>take heed</hi> of this Indisposition I say, so as
to do all our Skill and Diligence to correct
or amend it. Can the Husbandman expect
to reap from Seed sown in a <hi>stony Field?</hi>
Or is such a Field consistent with good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
and Cultivation? No more can a
<hi>Gospel Hearer</hi> expect to reap from the <hi>Word</hi>
sown in his Heart cumber'd with Lusts, and
Passions, and Habits of Corruption; nor is
such a Heart consistent with the Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
Care, and Cultivation required of a
<hi>Christian.</hi> As surely as a <hi>stony Field</hi> will
turn out <hi>no</hi> Fruit to Perfection, from any
<hi>Seed</hi> sown in it; so surely such Hearts of
Men will turn out <hi>no</hi> Fruit to Perfection,
from <hi>the Word</hi> sown in them.</p>
            <p>III. The <hi>third</hi> and last <hi>bad</hi> Disposition
of Heart, in the Order of the <hi>Parable,</hi> we
are to <hi>take heed</hi> of for <hi>profitable Hearing,</hi>
is that represented by <hi>the Thorns; viz.</hi> the
Heart charged and <hi>cumbered</hi> with the Things,
the <hi>Cares</hi> and <hi>Amusements</hi> of the World.
And a strong and beautiful <hi>Emblem</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
it is. For in every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or Respect, as <hi>Thorns</hi> in a Field will
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004721_0045_0000000000000000"/>
defeat the Growth or Increase of any <hi>Grain</hi>
sown in it; so will the <hi>Cares and Amusements</hi>
of the World defeat the Increase of
<hi>the Word,</hi> in the Hearts of Men. As
<hi>Thorns</hi> in a Field, like an oppressive rich
Neighbour, will enhanse the <hi>Moisture</hi> of
the Ground, and deprive the poor tender
<hi>Grain</hi> of its proper Nourishment; or as
growing up with the tender <hi>Blade</hi> or
<hi>Stalk,</hi> they will entangle and oppress it; or
when grown up, the least Ruffle of Wind
beating the <hi>Stalk</hi> or <hi>Ear</hi> against them, they
will tear, wound, and destroy it; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So
answerably, in <hi>every</hi> Circumstance, will
the <hi>Cares</hi> and <hi>Amusements</hi> of the World
choak, oppress, entangle, and defeat the
Increase of <hi>the Word,</hi> in the Hearts of Men.
They will enhanse that <hi>Moisture</hi> of Heart,
that good <hi>Inclination, Thought,</hi> and <hi>Serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
which shou'd nourish it; growing up
with it, they will entangle and oppress it;
and when grown up, will be sure, on the
various emergent Ruffles, either of Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity
or Adversity, to wound, defeat, and
destroy it.</p>
            <p>AND how generally, alas! is this the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004721_0046_0000000000000000"/>
fatal Case of <hi>Men?</hi> How many are there,
who otherwise would be <hi>profitable Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
but for the <hi>Cares,</hi> the <hi>Riches,</hi> and

Nor is it the absolute Case of
any all at once, but which they advance to
in Time, and by Degrees. For before these
grow up into confirmed <hi>Habits,</hi> and get
full Possession of the Heart, many are often
so far profited in <hi>Hearing the Word,</hi> as not
only to believe, but also to take up full <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions</hi>
to obey or practise it. But then
alas! how often also are these <hi>Resolutions</hi>
defeated by the World, and overcome?
Some <hi>Care,</hi> some <hi>Pleasure,</hi> some <hi>Amuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
or other, it always throws in the
Way: <hi>Honours</hi> or <hi>Preferments,</hi> immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
<hi>Gains</hi> or <hi>Losses, Wives, Children,
Weddings, Births, Funerals;</hi> some or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such <hi>Care,</hi> or <hi>Pleasure,</hi> or <hi>Amusement</hi>
it always throws in upon them, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quite oversets these Resolutions, or at
least suspends the Performance of them to a
longer Day. And this Delay or <hi>Suspension</hi>
once gained, it not only becomes a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Precedent</hi> for the future, but mean
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004721_0047_0000000000000000"/>
time also affords Opportunity for other fresh
<hi>Cares</hi> and <hi>Temptations</hi> to enter and obtain:
So that they move, as 'twere, in an <hi>inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Circle</hi> of Resolutions and Suspensions,
Promises and Non-performances, Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to do much, and yet doing Nothing at
all.</p>
            <p>THUS the <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Briars</hi> of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Things, Cares, Riches, Pleasures, Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Concerns in the Hearts of Men,
entangle and oppress the <hi>Word preached,</hi>
beat down every good Motion or aspiring,
prevail over Reason, and either defeat the
<hi>strongest</hi> Purposes and Resolutions, or finally
reduce and limit them to certain <hi>Terms</hi> or
<hi>Conditions.</hi> When these or the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are obtained, (article such Men)â€”
This or the other <hi>Difficulty</hi> got over;â€”
This or the other <hi>Point</hi> gained;â€”When
such or such Matters, Things, Periods,
Circumstances in view, shall be accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
oh then, they will set about the Duties
of <hi>Religion</hi> in good Earnest; they will then
be no longer <hi>only Hearers of the Word,</hi> but
<hi>Doers of the Work</hi> also, they will throw
off the World, all its <hi>Cares, Pleasures,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004721_0048_0000000000000000"/>
Pomps,</hi> and <hi>Vanities,</hi> and wholly attend the
laying up for themselves <hi>Treasures</hi> in a
better Place; <hi>where neither Moth nor Rust
doth corrupt, and where Thieves do not
break thro' and steal.</hi> But, alas! before
these can be brought to bear, these Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
attained, and Matters adjusted to their
Minds, either the Evening of their Day
draws on, or other and still farther Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
appear necessary, so as finally they
turn out <hi>unprofitable Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOW plainly then is <hi>the World En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
against God?</hi> And agreeably, how
much is the Whole of our blessed <hi>Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s
both Life and Doctrines pointed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this single Evil, as the main Root or
Scource of Human Misery? His whole
Lite was a continued Scene of his Enmity
to, Hatred, and Contempt of the World;
â€”<hi>The Son of Man had not</hi> so much of it
as <hi>where to lay his Head.</hi> And scarce ever
opened he his Mouth in Doctrine, but to
teach, and enforce Men's Imitation of his
own Practice and Example. To teach, that
<hi>They cannot serve God and Mammon;</hi>â€”
that <hi>If any Man love the World, the Love
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004721_0049_0000000000000000"/>
of God is not in him;</hi>â€”that they should
<hi>take no Thought what they should eat, or
what they should drink, or wherewithal
they should be cloathed;</hi>â€”be ready to
<hi>forsake Fathers, and Mothers, and Houses,
and Lands,</hi> even to quit all earthly Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
and Enjoyments, to <hi>follow him,
and have Treasure in the Kingdome of
Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND agreeably such indeed was the
Behaviour and Conduct of his Disciples and
Followers of the <hi>First</hi> Ages. Their Minds,
their Love and <hi>Affections were set upon
Things above, and not on Things on the
Earth.</hi> Their Spirits breathed too free an
Air, to be caught by any or all the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Charms this World can afford; and
their cheif Care was to <hi>keep themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted
from it; using</hi> indeed, but not <hi>abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
it, as well knowing, that both <hi>this
World</hi> and <hi>the Fashion of it,</hi> quickly <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
away.</hi> In Testimony of this I might
produce you all the <hi>Apologists</hi> and other
Christian Writers of those Times, but <hi>Ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
Martyr</hi> alone shall suffice. <hi>Christians</hi>
(saith he) <hi>dwell in their own Country but
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004721_0050_0000000000000000"/>
as</hi> Inmates <hi>and</hi> Foreigners; <hi>they have all
Things common with other Men as</hi> Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citizens,
<hi>and yet suffer all Things as</hi> Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
<hi>Every</hi> foreign Region <hi>is their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and every Country is foreign to them.
â€”They are</hi> in the Flesh, <hi>but do not</hi> live
after the Flesh; <hi>they dwell upon the</hi> Earth,
<hi>but their</hi> Conversation is in Heaven. <hi>As
the Soul lives</hi> in <hi>the Body, but is not</hi> of <hi>the
Body, so Christians dwell</hi> in <hi>the World, but
are not</hi> of <hi>the World. An</hi> immortal Spirit
<hi>dwells in a</hi> mortal Tabernacle, <hi>and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
while they sojourn in these</hi> corruptible
<hi>Mansions expect and look for an</hi> incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
<hi>State in Heaven.</hi>â€”We now return,</p>
            <p>To consider that <hi>bad</hi> Disposition of Heart,
which obstructs <hi>profitable</hi> Hearing, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in the <hi>Parable</hi> by <hi>the Way-side;</hi>
which tho' <hi>first</hi> in the Order of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi>
we have chose to treat of in the <hi>last</hi>
Place.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Parable</hi> sets forth <hi>Seed falling by
the Way-side,</hi> which must suppose the <hi>Field</hi>
or Ground sowed in <hi>open</hi> and <hi>unfenced,</hi> so
as to have <hi>Roads</hi> or <hi>Path-ways</hi> made thro'
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004721_0051_0000000000000000"/>
it. Now as that Ground is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
or <hi>ill</hi> disposed for bringing any <hi>Seed</hi> to
Perfection, which lies <hi>unfenced,</hi> or <hi>open</hi> to
all Comers and Goers to make <hi>Path-ways</hi>
in;â€”For so the <hi>Seed</hi> will either be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
down, or lie so uncover'd, that the
<hi>Fowls of the Air will devour it:</hi> Even so,
those <hi>Hearts</hi> of Men are altogether unfit
and <hi>ill</hi> disposed to bring any Fruit of the
<hi>Word</hi> to Perfection, which are not sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fenced in, with <hi>Zeal according to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi>
but lie open and exposed, to the
Inroads of <hi>Scepticism</hi> on the one Hand, and
<hi>Enthusiasm</hi> on the other:â€”For so the
Seed of <hi>the Word</hi> will either be <hi>trodden
down</hi> by the <hi>Phlegmatick</hi> Notions of the
former, or devoured by the <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
ones of the latter.</p>
            <p>1. Without the <hi>Fence</hi> of a <hi>Zeal accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Knowledge,</hi> what Inroads or Path-ways
will <hi>Scepticism</hi> make in our Hearts!
And how, by the phlegmatick <hi>Weight</hi> of
Coldness and Indifference, will its Notions
crush and tread down <hi>the Word</hi> sown there!
And hence, alas! so many occasional or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
<hi>Hearers</hi> in these our Days, whose
Attendance on the <hi>Word preached</hi> once a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004721_0052_0000000000000000"/>
Month, may be reckoned an extraordinary
Attendance. Something or other is always
the Matter they cannot come; or marrying
of Wives, or Farms, or Merchandize; or
still much lower, the Church begins too
soon or too late, they have not a proper
Seat, or proper Cloaths to appear in; 'tis
either too hot or too cold, too dusty or too
dirty Weather. Some or other of these, or
such like Reasons of Absence, is always at
Hand, while yet the true one is, if they
would speak out, that 'tis a Matter of the
utmost Indifference to them, whether they
come or stay away. Thus <hi>occasionally</hi> or
by Chance it is that they come to hear; but
there is more Certainty than Chance, that
what they thus hear will not <hi>profit</hi> them.
They come as if they came not; that is,
without proper Design, Desire, or Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Heart to be edified; and what
Marvel if the <hi>Word preached</hi> be unto them
as a <hi>sounding Brass, and tinkling Cymbal?</hi>
What less can God expect and demand of
us towards our <hi>Edification,</hi> than a <hi>willing
Mind,</hi> a hearty and sincere Desire of being
<hi>edified?</hi> Or what less can we bring with
us, if any Thing at all? Surely it is but
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004721_0053_0000000000000000"/>
small and inconsiderable Matter, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us in this Behalf; <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>willing
Mind.</hi> Let us contribute but this Mite,
the first essential Requisite for our profitable
Hearing. For as God has been pleased to
create us <hi>free</hi> Creatures, we cannot be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
without our own Consent, Will, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
much less against them.</p>
            <p>2. Without the <hi>Fence</hi> of <hi>Zeal accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Knowledge,</hi> what <hi>Pathways</hi> also
will <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> make in our Hearts?
And how will its <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>frantick</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<hi>devour</hi> up the Seed of <hi>the Word</hi> sown
there?</p>
            <p>A <hi>First</hi> and <hi>common</hi> Consequence of the
Want of <hi>this Fence,</hi> and a main Introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> is, <hi>the Itching of the
Ears;</hi> that is, that Men run <hi>to and fro</hi>
to hear, more for the <hi>pleasing the Ear,</hi> or
moving their Passions, than the Instruction
of their Minds. And how numerous such
Hearers are every where, I need not say.
They love the Man (the <hi>Preacher</hi>) and
will go to hear him. Why so? Because
as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was to the <hi>Iews,</hi> so is he unto
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004721_0054_0000000000000000"/>
them, <hi>as a very lovely Song of one that
hath a pleasant Voice.</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi> came to
hear the <hi>Prophet,</hi> not that they regarded
the Matter he delivered, or intended to
do according to his Words; no, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his <hi>Talent of Utterance</hi> hit their Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<hi>his Words were to them as a very love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Song.</hi> They came only for <hi>Sound,</hi> and
<hi>Sound</hi> they had, and <hi>Sound</hi> they carried
with them, and no more. And thus as the
Case was with the <hi>Iews</hi> of old, so it is
with many <hi>Christians</hi> of our Times. Their
<hi>Religion,</hi> alas! derives not from the vital
Principles of <hi>Divine Faith and Love</hi> in the
Heart, springing forth into <hi>Holiness of
Life;</hi> but from the <hi>Phantoms</hi> and <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of their Heads, which turn them a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after the <hi>fine Preacher,</hi> the Man whose
<hi>Tone</hi> and <hi>Air</hi> they are best pleased with,
whose <hi>Voice is unto them as a very lovely
Song;</hi> accounting when their <hi>Ears</hi> and
Fancies are most <hi>pleased,</hi> their <hi>Minds</hi> are
best <hi>instructed.</hi> This is a sore Evil, and
the more so, that there's seldom a Remedy
for it in Human Power. Speak it out, you
offend them. Represent it in its true Light
and Nature, you provoke their Indignation,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004721_0055_0000000000000000"/>
and their Returns of Hatred and Ill-will.
Men are strongly averse to having their
<hi>Understandings</hi> called in Question, and not
to be thought <hi>wise</hi> enough to judge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
for themselves. To accuse of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
is to accuse of Folly and Ignorance;
and therefore rather than submit to the
Accusation, though in the <hi>softest</hi> Terms,
they'll choose to abide by their <hi>former</hi>
Judgment, and to go on in their own
Way.</p>
            <p>BUT the agreeable well turned <hi>Voice,</hi>
is not always the alone Object of <hi>itching
Ears;</hi> but generally they extend, as did those
of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> to <hi>new Things,</hi> new or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
Notions or Doctrines, new Lights,
or Revelations;â€”are <hi>turned away from
the Truth, and turned into Fables.</hi> Now
in such Case, while Men are thus without
<hi>Zeal according to Knowledge,</hi> their Ears
<hi>itching</hi> after the <hi>fine Preacher,</hi> who can
please the Ear, rouse the Passions, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse
the Understanding with <hi>mysterious</hi>
Doctrines, <hi>new</hi> Lights, and Revelations;
is it not ten thousand to one, but the

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:004721_0056_0000000000000000"/>
and <hi>Utterance,</hi> shall be the Man? Such
<hi>Hearers</hi> indeed will not be long without
<hi>Zeal;</hi> but alas! a <hi>Zeal</hi> not <hi>according to
Knowledge,</hi> is worse than none at all; a
furious rampant Thing! and which can
serve only to rivet fast the <hi>Chains</hi> of Error
and Delusion: <hi>They want</hi> the Charming of
the Ear;â€”The <hi>Enthusiast</hi> either has the
<hi>natural</hi> Talents that will wholly answer, or
his <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Impetuosity</hi> will make good the
Defect: <hi>They want</hi> to hear Things that
will <hi>rouse</hi> their Passions, as Children do Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of <hi>Ghosts</hi> and <hi>Hobgoblines,</hi> which yet
make them tremble and afraid to go in
the Dark;â€”<hi>He</hi> is provided of these suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
to <hi>scare</hi> and <hi>frighten them out of
their Wits,</hi> if that will please: <hi>They want</hi>
to hear <hi>new Things,</hi> strange or <hi>mysterious</hi>
Doctrines, <hi>new Lights</hi> or <hi>Revelations,</hi> tho'
only to <hi>amuse</hi> their Heads, and <hi>perplex</hi> their
Understandings;â€”No one has greater
Store; <hi>He</hi> is always <hi>speaking Mysteries in
the Spirit,</hi> always full of <hi>Impulses, new
Lights,</hi> and <hi>Revelations.</hi>â€”And thus
must the <hi>Enthusiast</hi> be the <hi>Man of God</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed!
So throughly furnished to supply
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004721_0057_0000000000000000"/>
all the <hi>Wants,</hi> or <hi>Itchings</hi> of such Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>POSSIBLY, or rather <hi>commonly</hi> indeed,
<hi>such Hearers</hi> are, at <hi>first,</hi> a little stumbled
at his high and confident Pretensions to the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> his <hi>Impulses</hi> and <hi>Inspirations;</hi> but
how short a Time, under the Influence of
the <hi>powerful Man,</hi> will suffice, to remove
all such Prejudice, and fully convince them
of the Reality of these Pretensions, and that
of a Truth he has the <hi>Indwelling of the
Spirit</hi> in him? Nor only so, but this Point
got over, and the Doctrine of the <hi>Indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Spirit the Priviledge of all
Christians,</hi> a little more fully opened and
insisted on, they will soon be persuaded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>Feeling</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> of the same
<hi>Motions, Impulses,</hi> and <hi>Inspirations</hi> in
themselves.â€”And now the Work thus
far advanced; the Wheels of a heated Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
set thus a going, God only knows
where they will stop, whether in <hi>Bedlam,</hi>
or <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>no Christianity,</hi> or <hi>no Religion
at all.</hi>

               <hi>TAKE heed</hi> then (my Brethren) of this
<hi>Way-side</hi> Indisposition of Heart in <hi>Hearing.</hi>
Give all Care and Diligence to <hi>fence in</hi> and

who shall prescribe or set the Bounds? No

No <hi>Practices</hi> so wicked or

the <hi>Impulse of the Spirit,</hi> the Command of

            <p>THIS is no <hi>Speculation,</hi> but what the
World has sufficiently <hi>experienced</hi> in Fact,
in many and <hi>notorious</hi> Instances.â€”What
was all the <hi>Heathen</hi> Religion of <hi>Sybils</hi> and

            <p>THE <hi>Dutartres,</hi> you know, were a

Sons and four Daughters) settled in <hi>Orange

themselves regularly and blameless, in

soon filled their <hi>Heads</hi> with many wild and

publick Worship, and all outward Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God in his Church, and from all
Conversation with the World; and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to conceit, that they were the <hi>alone</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily

he gave them. Finally it came to <hi>open Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
and <hi>Revelations.</hi> God <hi>raised up a
Prophet unto them from among themselves
(PETER ROMBERT,</hi> who had married
the eldest Daughter of the Family, a Widow)
<hi>like unto</hi> Moses, and <hi>to whom they should
hearken.</hi> And to this <hi>Prophet</hi> God was
pleas'd openly and plainly to reveal, that

Revelation he was sure of, he knew it, he
felt it, as certainly as the Wind blowing on
his Body; and they with as full Assurance
believed and depended upon it.</p>
            <p>SOON after this, God was pleased to
reveal himself again to the <hi>Prophet</hi> a second
Time, saying; <hi>Put away the Woman
whom thou now hast for thy Wife; for
when I have destroyed this wicked Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

up her first Husband from the Dead, and
they shall be Man and Wife as before; and
go thou and take to Wife her youngest Sister,
who is a</hi> Virgin; <hi>so shall that chosen Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
be restored entire, and the holy Seed
be preserved pure and undefiled in it.</hi> The
<hi>old Man</hi> (the Father) was staggered at so
strange a Message; but the <hi>Prophet</hi> assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him that God would give him a <hi>Sign;</hi>
which accordingly came to pass, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
on which the <hi>old Man</hi> took his

went in unto her, and lay with her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any farther Ceremony, pursuant to the
Divine Command. And thus they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in open and notorious <hi>Adultery</hi> and
<hi>Incest</hi> 'till the fatal Period, we now come to

            <p>SO far possessed were these poor Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
with a Conceit of their own Holiness,
and of the Impurity and Wickedness of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that they would give no Obedience

was not to be suffered; and therefore

On their Approach this wretched <hi>Family</hi>
shut themselves up in their House, and thence

            <p>ALAS, poor miserable Creatures! How
amazing a Delusion prevailed over them!
They had the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God (especially the
Prophet) <hi>leading them into all Truth.</hi>
They were <hi>sure</hi> of it, they <hi>knew</hi> it, they
<hi>felt</hi> it. This <hi>Spirit</hi> commanded them <hi>not</hi> to

for the Defence of their Country; but this
<hi>same Spirit</hi> commanded them to bear Arms
in <hi>Rebellion</hi> against the Laws of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and to commit <hi>Murder.</hi>â€”The <hi>holy

the Cases, but by his <hi>express Order</hi> and <hi>Command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS the visiting of Persons <hi>under Sentence of
Death</hi> is a part of my Duty as Minister of this
Place, so I attended these unhappy Creatures
with more than ordinary Pains and Diligence.
They very readily owned, repeated, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
all the <hi>Facts</hi> and <hi>Circumstances,</hi> as before
mentioned, with no material <hi>Variation</hi> from
what they had done in <hi>Court.</hi> But when I came
<hi>to reason</hi> with them on those <hi>Facts,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to convince them of the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness</hi>
they were guilty of in committing them;â€”they

Motto was <hi>answer him not a Word!</hi>â€”They
had the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God speaking inwardly to
their Souls, who was I to pretend to talk to,

of God, and were about to suffer Martyrdom
for it; but God had assured them, that he wou'd
either work a great Deliverance for them, or
raise them up from the Dead the <hi>third</hi> Day.
And thus the three before-mentioned (who
were executed) continued to insist and aver to
their dying Breath<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Their last Words to the
Spectators were, that they should surely see
them alive again from the Dead, the <hi>third</hi> Day.</p>

they expected, they became sensible of their
Delusion, at least professed themselves so, and
were pardon'd. But alas! One of them relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
into the same Share; and murdered an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Person, without any previous Quarrel
or Provocation, and for no other Reason, as
he acknowledged, but that <hi>God commanded him
to do it.</hi> He was tried for this Murder, found
guilty, condemn'd, and executed. I attended
him again under this second Sentence of Death,
and it pleased God with all apparent Success.
No one ever appeared more sensible of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion,
or to die a more hearty and sincere
Penitent or, in greater professed Hopes
of Salvation, thro' the all-sufficient Merits of
<hi>Christ</hi> his Redeemer.</p>
            <p>AND thus ended this <hi>tragical</hi> Scene of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm;</hi>
in which no less than seven Persons lost their
Live; one killed, two murdered, and four executed for
those Murders. A remarkable Instance, to what Heights
of Extravagance, Folly, and Wickedcess, this Turn of
Head or Imagination, will hurry the poor Sons of Men!</p>
            <p>LET us <hi>take heed therefore</hi> (my Brethren) <hi>how we hear.</hi>
As the <hi>Prophet</hi> singeth of his beloved touching his Vineyard,
that <hi>he fenced it, and gathered out the Stones thereof,</hi> &amp;c Let
