            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE one half at leaſt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired writings is <hi>Hiſtorical</hi>: not as if the Spirit of God had no farther aim therein, than to acquaint us with ancient <hi>Chronology,</hi> or to reſerve for us the monuments of antiquity, and thoſe renowned names, which
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000900_0003_0FAC98B9A4D7AFB8"/>
elſe would have been loſt in the rubbiſh of their Sepulchers: but as part of that <hi>Canon</hi> by which he furniſheth us with a perfect <hi>Rule of Faith, and Manners,</hi> whereby we are directed in the way to the glorifying of God, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of eternal bleſſedneſs: and to reſt in any thing ſhort of this improvement of it, is to loſe the Principal deſign for which it is commended to us.</p>
            <p>For a <hi>Goſpel Miniſter,</hi> in the Execution of his Function, to accommodate any portion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ, meerly to eſtabliſh points purely <hi>Ethical, Oeconomical, Civil or Military,</hi> would be to play the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> and not act the part of a <hi>Divine,</hi> who, as ſuch, hath no farther to do with thoſe things than as they are tributary to the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>As to the Hiſtories of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they are Exemplary and <hi>Written for our Admonition,</hi> there are many perſons and things recorded in them, which are alſo <hi>Typical,</hi> referring to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to ſpiritual things; and though it would undermine the Authority of <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> to allow two diſtinct ſenſes to one <hi>Text</hi>; yet there muſt be a compound one obſerved in thoſe that are <hi>Typical</hi>: and things are to be diſtinctly conſidered, as they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000900_0004_0FAC98BA62F35B70"/>
to the <hi>Type,</hi> and as they refer to the <hi>Antitype</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Solomon,</hi> to whoſe Hiſtory our <hi>Text</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, was a <hi>Type of Christ,</hi> is too manifeſt to need any digreſſion for the proof of it: though all things written in his Life cannot with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be reckoned <hi>Typical.</hi> That wherein God more peculiarly choſe <hi>Solomon</hi> to repreſent <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was his <hi>Kingly Office:</hi> for which end he furniſhed him with Wealth, Honour, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſurpaſſing all the Monarchs, which ever had been, or ſhould be. And this <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of his, though it graſped in its comprehenſion, a knowledge univerſal of things natural, civil and divine, yet is more eminently celebrated in the well-ordering and ſettling the Affairs of his <hi>Kingdom</hi>; in which, his firſt care was about <hi>the Houſe of God,</hi> and his <hi>Inſtituted Worſhip,</hi> in which he exactly followed the Divine Preſcript, and the <hi>Patterns</hi> left him by his Father <hi>Davd,</hi> which he receved from God by <hi>Immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi>: Nextly, and ſubordinately, for the well-ordering and ſetling of the Outward Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of his Kingdom in matters <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>; and this laſt is the thing about which we are at preſent concerned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomons</hi> peculiar Stile or Tide was, <hi>King of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000900_0005_0FAC98BB25AF0C88"/>
Iſrael</hi>; though all the circumjacent Nations were his Tributaries, or ſome way or other did him Homage. Thus is <hi>Chriſt</hi> more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>King of his Church,</hi> though all <hi>Principality, Power, Might and Dominion are put under his feet for the Church, as</hi> Eph. 1.21, 22.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Holy Land,</hi> which God gave for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to his People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the bounds whereof were aſſigned to them by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Numb.</hi> 34. was peopled, not only by the genuine Poſterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but alſo by the remains of thoſe <hi>Devoted Nations,</hi> who after long Hoſtility, were ſubdued and ſubjugated by <hi>David,</hi> and made Subjects of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though in a more inferiour and ſervile eſtate than the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere; which may ſemblably be applied to the Viſible Church, in regard of the divers Subjects of it, according to, Rom. 9.5. <hi>all are not Iſrael, that are of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>verſe</hi> 20, <hi>to</hi> 24. of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> we have an account of <hi>Solomons Prudence,</hi> in aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto theſe two ſorts of men, the ſervices moſt proper for them, and wherein they might moſt ſutably ſerve for the good of the whole, they were both employed. <hi>Christ</hi> will make uſe of all within his viſible Kingdom, ſome
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000900_0006_0FAC98BBE4C715B8"/>
way or other for his Glory, whether they be willing or no. Of the former of theſe, we read, verſe 22. <hi>that he Levied of them a tribute of Bond-Service</hi>: they were put to the drudgery work, and the more Servile Employments of the State; as moſt proper for them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in this <hi>verſe</hi> 22. we are told, that he found out a more honourable Service for them that were true born <hi>Iſraelites</hi>; they were not excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from buſineſs, but they were employed in ſuch as was worthy of free Subjects. I ſhall not inſiſt on the ſeveral Services that are here mentioned; it may ſuffice to obſerve that the thing is expreſſed, both <hi>negatively, he made no Bond men of them</hi>; and of this God himſelf had given an expreſs prohibition, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.39. And <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> where the firſt thing which is inſtanced in, is the ſubject that we have now under conſideration; <hi>they were men of War, i. e.</hi> they were men Liſted among the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Exerciſed or Trained in the <hi>Art Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</hi> The word uſed for <hi>men,</hi> is not that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble word [<hi>Iſh</hi>] which ſignifieth <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Valour,</hi> and is wont to be applied to perſons of Renown; but that more contemptible word, <hi>Enoſh,</hi> which ſignifyeth <hi>Sorrowful, Sickly</hi> and <hi>Mortal</hi>; not with any deſign to reproach the Calling, but poſſibly to put Souldiers in mind of their frailty, to humble them, who,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000900_0007_0FAC98BCA6A53810"/>
when in their Plumes, are too apt to be lifted up over much in their minds: the word [<hi>War</hi>] comes of a root that ſignifieth to <hi>Eat</hi> or <hi>Devour</hi>; intimating the unhappy fruits of War; The <hi>Sword</hi> is therefore ſaid <hi>to devour,</hi> 2 Sam. 2.26. giving us to underſtand that War is in its own nature an evil thing.</p>
            <p>We may here, in the firſt place, take notice of theſe words, as they are put with the former diſtributively, and ſo they will afford us this</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE. The Employment of a Souldier is very Honourable.</head>
               <p>It is too good for a <hi>Canaanite</hi> to be admitted to, or for a Slave to have his name Enrolled in this Muſter: but is only fit for a free-born <hi>Iſraelite.</hi> God hath therefore put Honour on this Calling, by aſſuming that as one of his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Exod. 15.3. <hi>The Lord is a Man of War, the Lord is his Name</hi>; but the word [<hi>Iſh</hi>] is there uſed.</p>
               <p>It is true, had man retained his primitive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, there had been no occaſion for the <hi>Art Military</hi>; becauſe he would have had no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

to Encounter; no Fortreſſes to be Built, and Garriſoned; no Inſtruments of War to be invented, no <hi>Tackticks</hi> to be learned. He was in a great Error, who aſſerted, <hi>That the State of Nature is a State of War,</hi> if he referred it to the Condition of the Creation, as it was at firſt diſpoſed by God. But when once ſin had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Humane Nature, it filled man with jarring principles, and ſowed in him the ſeeds of diſſention; ſo that now he is no farther in ſafety, than as he puts himſelf in a poſture of <hi>Defence</hi> againſt the aſſaults, and of <hi>Offence</hi> for the ſuppreſſion of his moleſting adverſary; which, though it hath not taken away the evil nature of War in it ſelf, yet it hath made it occaſionally both good and neceſſary; and it muſt needs therefore be <hi>Honourable,</hi> when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, not for its own ſake, but for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or recovering of the publick peace and tranquility: and though ſome are of the mind that there will be a time come, when that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie ſhall have a compleat literal accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Iſa. 2.4. <hi>they ſhall beat their Swords into Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhears, and their Spears into pruning hooks.</hi> Yet till this, will this Employment retain its digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Theſe are they whom under God, we are beholden for our peace and liberty; <hi>who are not afraid to ſpeak with the Enemy in the Gates</hi>; who ſecure our Religion and Civil Priviledges from
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000900_0009_0FAC98BE2314BA68"/>
forreign Uſurpation; and through whom we <hi>Sit under our vine and fig-tree.</hi> As for the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious diſpute about the precedency between the <hi>Gown</hi> and the <hi>Sword,</hi> I purpoſely wave it: only I may ſafely aſſert, that without both no people can be happy; nor can either Order be free from contempt, except furniſhed with men of Courage.</p>

                  <p>And is Chivalry a thing of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown? Let it beſpeak all that profeſs it, to walk worthy of their Vocation. If our Calling hath put honour upon us, we ought to endeavour to be an honour unto it; otherwiſe, the more honourable it is, the greater reproach we ſhall be to it. There are none that ſhall need to be aſhamed of this Employment, but ſuch as are a ſhame to it. I confeſs it is but an old <hi>Rule,</hi> but how it will be Rectified, I ſee not; men will readily judge of things by the example of thoſe that profeſs them. Is then a Souldier a name of Credit?

               <head>DOCTRINE. Chriſtianity is no Enemy to Souldiery.</head>
               <p>The Religion revealed by God to fallen man forbids it not to him, but approveth of it. Nor let it be ſuppoſed, that I uſe the word, <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> precariouſly; as if it were not applicable hither, or as if the people of God in former times, before <hi>Chriſt came in Fleſh,</hi> might lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make War, and conſequently ſtudy and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice Military Skill; but that Chriſt, upon his Coming, had brought in a new Law, which forbids it; and that becauſe he thought it to be a great Chriſtian Duty, to <hi>bear injuries,</hi> and not to <hi>revenge</hi> themſelves; therefore War is now unlawful for them; and if ſo, to what purpoſe ſhould they be <hi>Souldiers?</hi> Whereas Religion hath been the ſame in all the Eſſentials of it, ever ſince the Fall, and hath received no alteration but in <hi>Poſitives.</hi> The <hi>Goſpel</hi> was Preached to our Firſt Parents preſently upon their Apoſtaſy; there hath been but one way for the Salvation
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000900_0011_0FAC98BFA2BC5968"/>
of Sinners, and that is by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Acts 4.22. <hi>there is Salvation in no other.</hi> The <hi>Moral Law</hi> was renewed upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and <hi>given in the hand of a Mediator,</hi> to be a Rule of Obedsence to the Worlds End unchangeably: nor did <hi>Chriſt come to deſtroy it</hi>; nay, he hath aſſured us, that he will not ſuffer <hi>one jot or tittle of it to fail,</hi> Mat. 5.17, 18. If then the <hi>Moral Law</hi> doth not condemn War, but preſcribe to it; and that Law be a <hi>Rule</hi> for <hi>Christians,</hi> as it certainly is, <hi>Christ</hi> did not prohibit it, though he forbad private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for perſonal injuries: which yet was no addition to the Law of Nature, or Law Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but only an interpretation of it, and a vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating it from the falſe gloſſes of corrupt men.</p>
               <p>Nor indeed can the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe defended or ſecured againſt the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and oppreſſors of it, who are <hi>unreaſonable men,</hi> and can be no other way diſputed, but at the Swords point, and Canons mouth; and if at any time War proves detrimental to the Intereſt of Chriſt, the fault is in the men, not in the Profeſſion. When the <hi>Souldiers</hi> came to the <hi>Babtist</hi> for advice, he doth not caſhier them, nor adviſe them to disband, but directs them how to manage their Calling becoming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Luk. 3.14 <hi>Do violence to no man, neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe any falſly, and be content with your Wages</hi>;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000900_0012_0FAC98C10772F798"/>
and that Calling which the Word of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to regulate, muſt needs have its appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. Nor would Chriſt have warned us in the Goſpel of Wars to be expected, if he had not reckoned it our duty to prepare for them; nor have adviſed us rather to Sell our Coat than not to have a Sword, if he had thought it unlawful to uſe it when we have it; as he doth. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.36. <hi>He that hath no Sword, let him Sell his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and buy one.</hi> This expenſe would be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſuperfluous, if <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> taught us to hold up our throats to every one that offers to cut them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Self Preſervation</hi> is a principle ſtamped on the nature of Second beings. <hi>Inanimates</hi> have it by an innate quality put into them; <hi>Senſitive Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> have it by inſtinct, and their very natures are furniſhed for it: and that reaſon ſhould not fortify this principle in men; or that Religion ſhould contradict any maxime of the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is unintelligible. Certainly then, they who pretend to make it a ſin in a Chriſtian to uſe Arms, do it in policy, ſeeking to bind mens hands, or, which is as bad, their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> that they may enſlave or ſlay them without reſiſtance. And we need to look no further for an inſtance to confirm this, than the <hi>German Anababtiſts</hi> at <hi>Munſter.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Prudence</hi> is a natural foreſight of future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies, and providing our ſelves accordingly againſt the danger of them. Prov. 27.12. <hi>The Prudent fore ſeeth the evil, and hideth himſelf.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Providence of God Governeth, and infallibly determineth all Contingencies; yet they do not, for that, ceaſe to be Contingencies, as to the order of Second cauſes; among which Peace and War have their Revolutions, though known to God, yet caſual to us. Eccl. 3.8. <hi>A time of War, and a time of Peace.</hi> So that Peace is never ſo ſetled, but that War may on a ſudden ariſe: and ſecurity, which is the mother of negligence, always expoſeth a people unto dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. It is an ill time, when the <hi>Trumpet</hi> of War is ſounded, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> is at the gates, for a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then to have their Forts to build, their Arms, Ammunition and Proviſion to ſeek, and their Souldiers Untrained. Nor is it leſs hazardous, when once Peace is proclaimed, for men to let their Fortifications fall, hang up their Arms, and let them grow ruſty and uſeleſs, and lay aſide their Military exerciſes, as things ſuperfluous.

                  <hi>Arms,</hi> are for the maintaining of Peace, as well as the ſuppreſſing of War, for its preſervation as well as recovery. Nor will any thing ſtrike more of terrour into our ill willers, than to ſee us always ready for the worſt: hence ſuch an expreſſion. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Terrible as an army with Banners.</hi> Whereas, if they who watch for an advantage, find us, <hi>Laiſh</hi> like ſecure, and no way provided, nor expecting evil, they will be ready to ſerve us, as the Tribe of <hi>Dan</hi> did them. <hi>Judg.</hi> 18.27. <hi>They came unto Laiſh, unto a People that were quiet and ſecure; and they ſmote them with the edge of the Sword, and burnt the City with fire.</hi> It was an argument uſed by <hi>Aſa,</hi> that becauſe all was <hi>quiet before them, and God had given them reſt,</hi> it was their wiſdom to take the Opportunity to <hi>build Cities, and make walls, and towers about them,</hi> as if they had expected an attack from enemies. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 6, 7. He did not think it to be an evidence of a ſtrong faith for men to neglect the means, on pretence of truſting in God.

                  <p>Let this ſerve to warn and caution ſuch as pretend to be liſted among God's <hi>Iſrael</hi>: ſuch as covet to bear the ſtile &amp; title of Chriſtians. It is indeed worthy name, and no ſmall honour to thoſe that bear it, and carry themſelves worthy of it; nor indeed can there be a greater dignity conferred on the Children of men. Chriſts Servants are his Free-men, yea his friends, yea they are priviledged to be <hi>the Children of God.</hi> Joh. 1.12. But he would have you to fit down and compute the coſt. If you would be his <hi>Servants,</hi> you muſt be his <hi>Souldiers</hi>: and be not deceived in your expectations and reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, leſt you repent <hi>when you ſee War,</hi> as there is hazard you ſhould do if not prepared. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.17. Leſt when you meet with hardſhips

and difficulties, you do as the mixed multitude in the Wilderneſs did. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Weep and fell on luſting.</hi> And as the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, when the <hi>Spies</hi> told them of <hi>Cities walled to heaven, and Giants to encounter.</hi> Chap. 14.4 <hi>They ſaid one to another, let us make us a Captain, and let us return into Egypt. Dulce bellum inexpertis.</hi> Inconſiderate perſons account it a fine thing to be a Souldier, whiles they look only upon the bravery, liberty, eaſe, and plunder which they promiſe themſelves in it; and how readily do they liſt themſelves for Volunteers? but when they come to meet with the hard Services of long Marches through thick and thin, ſhort fare, difficult lodging, watchings and wardings, and cruel battels, theſe unexpected things affright them, and now they wiſh themſelves at home again. Know it, if you will be of Chriſts Camp, you muſt <hi>put on</hi> your <hi>whole Armour,</hi> and put it off no more till death disbands you, but March in it, and Lodge in it: you muſt <hi>ſtand continually in your ward all day, and be ſet in your watch whole nights</hi>: you muſt fight with the moſt powerful and malicious adverſaries; and that not at a diſtance, but in the cloſeſt battels. You muſt, after one fight is over, be prepared to engage in another, nor may you, in the greateſt diſtreſs, ever cry quarter. If theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions may content you, come and welcome.</p>

                  <p>Let it invite all to come in to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and give up their names to him, and be liſted in the Muſter-Roll of Saints. The fore-going warning was not deſigned to diſcourage any but white Livered and ſlothful perſons: nor properly to diſcourage them from coming, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct all in the <hi>manner of the Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In other Muſters care is had, or ought ſo to be, that none but men, and thoſe alſo able of body, be entred: but <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth order to beat up for all that will, Men, Women, Children, Young and Old; none are exempted. Why then are you ſo backward? Why ſo ſmall an appearance? Do you not know that whether you will or no, you muſt be Souldiers? There are two <hi>Camps</hi> in the World, <hi>Chriſts</hi> and the <hi>Devils</hi>; and to one of theſe you muſt: belong. There are no neuters in this War. Nay, till you do come over to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you belong to ſome of Satans Regiments. We are all of us either fighting for God, or againſt Him. Now think which is beſt, to abide where you are, or to fly over unto Chriſt. You ſerve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a cruel Commander, who hateth you, and purſueth your deſtruction: whiles he flattereth
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000900_0027_0FAC98CBA3EDD488"/>
you with fair promiſes, he will put you upon the hardeſt Services, and moſt deſperate engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and will leave you there to fall, as <hi>Joab</hi> did <hi>Uriah.</hi> And the more daringly you have ſerved him here, the more cruelly will he tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you hereafter. You are engaged in a curſed cauſe, which will certainly fall at laſt, and all that have ſtood by it, will be ſent, with their Leader, to be with him <hi>in blackneſs of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ever. None ever reſiſted God, and proſpered.</hi> But if you will give your ſelves up to Chriſt, he will treat you honorably; he will conduct you ſafely; He is a tender and compaſſionate General; He will be with you in every Battel, to protect you, and give you an aſſured Victory at the laſt. He will <hi>bind up the Wounds,</hi> which you receive in fight, and that with his own Robes, as <hi>Alexander</hi> once did by one of his Souldiers. You will be on the ſureſt ſide; and if you ſhould be worſted in any ſingle fight, yet you ſhall be <hi>Conquerours</hi> in the Warfare. He will revive you if you faint, and commend you if you be faithful and reſolute, and ſay to you, <hi>Well done.</hi> Yea, and he will provide for you a <hi>Triumphal Chariot,</hi> in which you ſhall ride gloriouſly into the great City; and there will he Erect for you <hi>Trophies</hi> and <hi>Arches</hi> for everlaſting remembrance. <hi>This Honour have all His Saints.</hi>

                  <p>Let it be to excite all that belong to the Camp of Gods Iſrael to approve themſelves good Souldiers of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Whatſoever is among men juſtly accounted Commendable in a man of War, apply it Spiritually, and do likewiſe. Remember, your great <hi>General</hi> is called, <hi>Faithful and True</hi>; and be you like Him, <hi>following upon white Horſes, and Clothed in fine Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, white and clean,</hi> as it is repreſented in, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.12, 14. Study much the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> by which you may be furniſhed with the whole <hi>Diſcipline</hi> in which Chriſts <hi>Militia</hi> is to be trained. Be much in the Exerciſe of all the Graces of the Spirit, which are your <hi>Panoply,</hi> and with which you muſt fight, if you hope ever to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome. <hi>Entangle not your ſelves with the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this Life,</hi> leaſt you thereby unfit your ſelves for the Service of him, <hi>who hath choſen you to be Souldiers,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.4. Get your hearts fortified with an heroick reſolution never to flinch in your Service, to deſert your Poſt, much leſs to fly from your Colours, nor <hi>to love your lives unto the death,</hi> ſo you may diſcharge the truſt repoſed in you. Be not diſcouraged if you get a foil, but reinforce the battel, calling aloud for aid from heaven: Nor be ſecure when you win the Field, but be always ready for a

new onſlaught. Remember, <hi>you muſt have no diſcharge in this War</hi> for age or infirmity: there are no <hi>Milites emeriti,</hi> or <hi>rude donati,</hi> in Chriſts Army, till the War ends. Remember, you have potent enemies, and very cruel, to cope withal, who are never wearied, but ever engaged to do you the greateſt harm. Conſider, you are not fighting for <hi>Counters</hi> and <hi>Goats hair</hi>; not for <hi>contemptible Crowns,</hi> and fading Laurels; but it is for your lives, and for your Souls, <hi>for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible Crown, an eternal weight of Glory.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, your Cauſe is good, and the iſſue is ſecured. Conſider, That <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> look on, and the voice from Heaven is, Courage brave Souldiers; yet a few skirmiſhes, yet a battel or two more, and the War is at an end; <hi>and you ſhall reſt from your labours, and your works ſhall follow you:</hi> You ſhall lodge your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and hang up your Shields in Heavens <hi>Capitol</hi>; and exchange your purple and crimſon Garments, for the white Robes of Glory. It is your faithful Leader who is thus animating of you; <hi>be thou faithful unto the death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life</hi>; and makes that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to you; <hi>To him that overcometh, will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne; even as I alſo overcame, and am ſat down with my Father on his Throne.</hi>
