            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN Conſequence of the preſent Debate, every impartial Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of the Province of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> will be naturally induced to conſider which of the Profeſſions in this Country he would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to chuſe as Guardian of his civil and religious Liberties, in a <hi>Government,</hi> where, according to the Conſtitution, no one Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſion in particular can be eſtabliſhed by Law, withous a manifeſt breach and Violation of its original Foundation. But as the Conteſt ſeems particularly to be between the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> we ought, as Members of one common Society, ſeriouſly to weigh the Merits of both Parties, before we liſt ourſelves under the Banner of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,—Neither ought Country, Prejudice of Education, or particular Opinions in Religion, ſway us with regard to <hi>Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> becauſe even the <hi>Mahometan Juriſdiction</hi> is to be preferred (with reſpect to Liberty of Conſcience) to many Countries in <hi>Europe</hi> govern'd by Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>I have never read of any Country in the World, where <hi>Quakers</hi> have had Authority except <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> ſo that all the Examples of their good or bad Adminiſtration, muſt be drawn from this Place. Now even the moſt prejudiced cannot but acknowledge, after taking an impartial View of the conduct of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that we have been wiſely and judiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly govern'd. For Matters of Fact ſpeak loudly in their Favour. The preſent amazing Perfection this Province has arrived to in ſo ſhort a Time, both in Riches, Trade and Commerce, is owing to the wiſe and prudent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of this good People. Was not every uſeful and ſalutary Plan purſued by them to encourage Emigrents of all Nations to ſettle here? And when they did ſettle, did they not enjoy Liberties both civil and religious in the moſt ample Manner? Has the bloody Spirit of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution ever prevail'd among them to the Detriment of other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009703_0004_0F7A44F8305BEDB8"/>
And to whom can the diſtreſſed go with ſurer Confidence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief than to them. And I dare venture to affirm that theſe very Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations mov'd the firſt Adventurers from <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſend for their poor Relations to populate this Province, whoſe delightful Plains far ſurpaſs the barren Mountains of <hi>Carentaugher, Slemiſh</hi> or <hi>Slevgallion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether any of theſe new comers ſettled upon unpurchaſed Land belonging to <hi>Indians,</hi> or whether they always kept within Bounds, is a Queſtion I will not undertake to determine. But however it appears very unlikely that the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould maintain an inviolable friendſhip with us, when they might have cruſh'd us in a moment, till we were grown a numerous People, and then go to war with us for no reaſon when we were able to cope with them in the field of battle.</p>
            <p>I ſhall readily allow that according to the ſtrict rules of <hi>Quaker prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> they are not qualified to govern in time of war. And indeed the majority of thoſe worthy people themſelves are of the ſame opinion; for ſome time ago, when there was an abſolute neceſſity for protecting this province by an armed force, many of the <hi>Friends</hi> who were then in the Houſe of <hi>Aſſembly</hi> reſign'd their ſeats, and left the management of public affairs in the hands of people of another profeſſion. This part of their conduct certainly argued great prudence and diſcretion, as well as wiſdom and modeſty. But had their ſeats been fill'd with <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> we ſhou'd innevitably have been in a much worſe condition, for it is very evident from undeniable facts, that they are by no means proper men to hold the reigns of government, either in war or peace.</p>
            <p>For if a firm attachment to the <hi>King,</hi> and the laws of our country, be neceſſary qualifications for a Repreſentative of the people, a <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> can lay no claim to them; and conſequently ought not to be elected. If we are to form any judgment of the preſent members of that ſociety by either their own conduct, or that of their forefathers, we ſhall find that in the annals both of ancient and modern Hiſtory, <hi>Preſbyterianiſm and Rebellion</hi> were twin-ſiſters, ſprung from faction; and their affection for each other has been ever ſo ſtrong, that a ſeparation of them never cou'd be effected. What <hi>King</hi> has ever reign'd in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> whoſe Government has not been diſturb'd with <hi>Preſbyterian Rebellions,</hi> ſince ever they were a people? Will they not be anſwerable for all the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood ſpilt at <hi>Pentland Hills</hi> and <hi>Bothel Bridge?</hi> From whence cou'd they have poſſibly learn'd but from <hi>Mahomet</hi> to propogate their Religion with the Sword. If we were to credit their Hypocritical declarations, we muſt believe they are actuated in all their proceedings by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious influences of the <hi>Bleſſed Spirit,</hi> and to be the moſt loyal ſubjects in <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>America.</hi> But do they not belie the <hi>Bleſſed Spirit</hi> in fathering upon him all the unnatural Rebellions they wickedly raiſed againſt their lawful Sovereign <hi>King Charles</hi> the <hi>Firſt?</hi> Did the <hi>Bleſſed Spirit</hi> teach them to rebel twice, and match to the borders of <hi>England;</hi> and after obtaining every thing they unjuſtly deſir'd, break their public faith the third time, by entering into a moſt damnable covenant to march an army into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:009703_0005_0F7A44F90FB1B728"/>
with a view to extirpate or butcher all thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> who wou'd not join them in the worſhip of their great goddeſs the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi> which they had ſet up in their own country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Did the <hi>Bleſſed Spirit</hi> teach them to ſell their <hi>King,</hi> in imitation of <hi>Judas</hi> who ſold out <hi>Savior,</hi> even after he had voluntarily reſign'd himſelf: Did they not murder their <hi>King</hi> in the face of the ſun, and put a Tyrant choſen from the very dreggs of the people upon the Throne, who ruled them with a rod of iron, and corrected their harden'd and ſtubborn diſpoſitions with ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions inſtead of whips? How did they raiſe inſurrections in various parts of the kingdom againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Second.</hi> And when they collect<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed an army of ſaints to fight <hi>Cromwell</hi> at the battle of <hi>Dunbar,</hi> did not their miniſters in the name of the Lord aſſure the army of ſucceſs; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd that they had been ſeeking <hi>God;</hi> and had obtained an anſwer to their prayers? <hi>Cromwell</hi> however ſoon made it appear that they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and propheſied falſely.</p>
            <p>Was not the <hi>Scotch Rebellion</hi> one principal cauſe of the inſurrection of the <hi>Iriſh-Papiſts</hi> in the Year 164<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>? The Succeſs that attended the one in behalf of the <hi>Kirk,</hi> encouraged the other to purſue the ſame ſteps in favor of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> and if ſo, it may undoubtedly be made a queſtion, whether all the innocent blood that was ſhed in that horrid <hi>Maſſacre,</hi> may not be juſtly laid to their charge? Certain it is the Natives of both king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſeem'd to vie with each other in acts of cruelty. For if the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics</hi> committed many outrages in defending their country againſt the inroads and depredations of thoſe foreign interlopers who ſwarm'd like locuſts from the barren hills of <hi>Loughaber</hi> in ſearch of a better country, the <hi>Scotch-Preſbyterians</hi> were no way behind hand with them, when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt remorſe, they murder'd 4,000 of the native <hi>Iriſh,</hi> men, women and children in the <hi>Iſle Mc-Gee,</hi> much in the ſame manner their offspring murdered the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Lancaſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However glorious the <hi>Revolution</hi> might be, it is very certain the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> had no hand in it; for it is well known that when the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Church</hi> refus'd to comply with <hi>King James</hi>'s diſpenſing power (for which ſeven of their Biſhops were impriſon'd, and one of their Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities ruin'd) the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> join'd with that weak, bigotted and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Prince, and thank'd his Majeſty in many fulſome Addreſſes from all parts of the kingdom, for his goodneſs in overturning the conſtitution in favor of them and their dear Brethren the <hi>Catholics.</hi> Many of this ſame godly ſect took commiſſions from <hi>James,</hi> and rais'd Regiments in order to oppoſe the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> but when the deſigns of our <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deliverer</hi> were attended with ſucceſs, then indeed they turn'd tail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their old maſter, and ſet up their pretenſions for merit with the new King, who, being bred a <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> eſtabliſh'd their Religion in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and conferr'd many other acts of favor on them.

Majeſty, who had been bred up in the principles of moderation in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> recommended a Bill to be paſſed for the Toleration of Diſſenters in <hi>Scotland;</hi> but the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> of that kingdom repreſented it to the people in ſuch odious and black colors, and petition'd with ſo much ſpirit and warmth againſt it, as having a pernicious and dangerous ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to deſtroy the <hi>Kirk,</hi> that it was laid aſide. From this period the <hi>King</hi> deſpis'd and abhorr'd them, as a bigotted, ſtiff-necked, rebellious, pedantic crew, who had groſsly impos'd upon him, in procuring an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to maſſacre the poor innocent inhabitants of <hi>Glencoe</hi> in cold blood.</p>
            <p>I ſhould exceed the bounds I have preſcrib'd to myſelf if I was to give a minute account of the Rebellions, which happened in the Year 1715 and 1745 in <hi>Scotland,</hi> when that kingdom was twice up in arms in favor of the <hi>Pretender,</hi> under two of the wiſeſt and beſt <hi>Kings</hi> that ever ſway'd the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Scepter; I mean <hi>George</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>George</hi> the <hi>Second.</hi> Neither has the Government of our preſent moſt gracious <hi>Sovereign</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap'd. It was but the laſt ſummer that thouſands of the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> in the North of <hi>Ireland</hi> took up arms under pretence of grievances; but it evidently appear'd that their malice was chiefly bent againſt the <hi>Church-Clergy,</hi> who ſtood in the way of their idol, <hi>Preſbytery;</hi> for they made all the eſtabliſh'd Clergy in the North fly to the ſtrong Fortreſs of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donderry,</hi> in order to avoid being maſſacred. From all theſe inſtances it appears that <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> have been always enemies to <hi>Kingly-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and conſequently not fit to be entruſted with any ſhare of the civil power, when a King reigns: And how can it be otherwiſe, ſeeing that not only their ſolemn League and Covenant, to which thouſands of them adhere to this day, was founded on Rebellion; but that <hi>Formula</hi> of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and diſcipline, call'd the <hi>Weſtminſter Confeſſion,</hi> which is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent infallible ſtandard receiv'd by the whole body of them, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by a ſet of men, when they were in open <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt their King; deſtroying the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and endeavouring to plan, both in Church and State, the Conſtitution of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> after the model of a <hi>Geneva</hi> Republic.</p>
            <p>Theſe few hints may ſerve as a <hi>Looking-Glaſs</hi> for <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> born within the Dominions of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> (as Foreigners who go under that name in this Province are not concern'd) who wou'd feign think themſelves qualified perſons to ſit as Repreſentatives of a free People. I earneſtly hope, every other denomination will take the pains to examine them thro' this perſpective, which is no magnifying one; and then judge whether they are fit to be intruſted with our lives, liberties and properties; eſpecially if they keep in mind, that whenever this righteous people have the power in their hands, they will tolerate no other profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or opinion but their own, and never ceaſe till they eſtabliſh them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch a manner as to exclude all other ſects. For the proof of this, witneſs <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>New-England;</hi> countries where their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion has been propagated by the Sword, inſtead of that peaceful manner recommended by the <hi>bleſſed Jeſus.</hi>

            <p>I come now more particularly to conſider the Pamphlet intitled the <hi>"Quaker unmask'd"</hi> or <hi>"Plain Truth"</hi> addreſs'd (and that ſeriouſly too) to the Freemen of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author ſets out with adviſing us, to find out the "Aggreſſors" that the ſaddle at laſt may be put on the right horſe. Here I join Iſſue with him, and do affirm that the reaſon of all the preſent <hi>Party-Rage</hi> was the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> murdering the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> under the Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government; had this not happen'd we ſhou'd have had none of all this diſturbance among us. But how they came to be ſpirited on to ſuch an inhuman deed, more than the <hi>Dutch</hi> who are equal ſufferers with them on the Frontiers, can be accounted for no otherwiſe, than becauſe they exceed all other People in acts of brutality. This polite, elegant, witty Pamphleteer condemns the action himſelf, but wou'd have us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the alleviating circumſtance, "<hi>What are they?</hi>
               <q>Why the Maſſacre of the back Inhabitants.</q>
Here one wou'd have expected that the Gentleman wou'd have attempted to prove the <hi>Lancaſter Indians</hi> guilty; but not a word againſt them; not even a preſumption. They had liv'd long 'tis true even from their infancy, in the interior parts of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; their characters are well known to be inoffenſive; but we loſt our relations by <hi>Indian Barbarians;</hi> and therefore we will kill <hi>Indians</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we can find them. A fine way of reaſoning! Old <hi>King Hendric</hi> who died gloriouſly fighting at the head of his troops for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> wou'd innevitably have been murder'd, had he met with any of the <hi>Paxton-Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers</hi> before that time. Thoſe brave Fellows alſo under <hi>Sir William Johnſon,</hi> wou'd have dyed by the very men, for whom they are going to battle. And not even the <hi>bleſſed Preſbyterian Indian Saints</hi> under the learned, pious and Rev. <hi>Mr. Braynard</hi> would have eſcap'd the <hi>Paxton-Boys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another alleviating Circumſtance our Author mentions, page 6th, is, "that they had long before ſent ſeveral petitions to the Governor and Aſſembly, which were conceal'd by ill deſigning perſons." I wiſh this elegant writer had nam'd the men to whom the Petitions were delivered, that the public might be aware of them. Thoſe in Government who act wrong ſhou'd undoubtedly be brought to the light, that if members of the Houſe, we may mark them at the next election; and if of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that his Honor may call them to an account for thus bringing him and the Province into diſtreſs. This is a Piece of Juſtice due to the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, who are under this indefinite charge? for why ſhou'd the prudent and juſt be cenſur'd for a fault of which they never were guilty; Beſides, why was not copies of the petitions publiſh'd, that the public might judge whether they contain'd any thing worthy the attention of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:009703_0008_0F7A44FE43669EE8"/>After all, I am induc'd to believe the truth is, theſe men acted in the ſame manner the <hi>Catholics</hi> did in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Firſt begin the <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and then appoint the ableſt of their Divines to ſtudy for arguments to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it.</p>
            <p>We are told in this ſame ſublime pamphlet,
<q>that ſome of the <hi>Indians</hi> in the <hi>Barracks</hi> were well known to have been at the battle againſt Col. <hi>Bouquet,</hi> and at the Siege of <hi>Fort Pitt</hi> by officers who are in town.</q>
If ſo, theſe military Gentlemens conduct, upon this occaſion, ought to have been a pattern of humanity to theſe brave <hi>Paxton Volunteers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly when we reflect that<note n="†" place="bottom">Capt.

To kill an enemy in the heat of battle is honorable, but to put him to death when he is diſarm'd, tied and bound at your feet, is a cowardly action, and argues a prodigious depravity of <hi>Human Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author produces the Revolution as an inſtance to juſtify the <hi>Pax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Inſurgents.</hi> If he thus miſapplies the Bible when he preaches, he ſhall never be my Teacher. But for curioſity ſake, let us ſee how the compariſon will hold. The whole People of <hi>England</hi> headed by two branches of the <hi>Legiſlature,</hi> oppoſes the King for perverting the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore about two hundred <hi>lawleſs Banditti</hi> of <hi>Paxton</hi> and <hi>Donegall</hi> may attempt to overthrow all the parts of the <hi>Legiſlature</hi> in <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania.</hi>—A Province containing about 250,000 Inhabitants. Such is the great force of our Author's Logic when reduced to form; but I am almoſt tired with his abſur'd and inconcluſive manner of reaſoning.</p>
            <p>Our Author further tells us, page 6th,
<q>the <hi>Indians</hi> were in great danger of receiving their juſt deſerts;</q>
i. e. the <hi>Paxton Boys</hi> were juſt at hand with intention to murder them, had not their Friends from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who were in League with them, made them acquainted with the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar force in the Barracks: But he forgets himſelf page 8th, where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us,
<q>that their deſign was nothing elſe, but that their grievances might have a fair hearing.</q>
Thus he contradicts in one page what he aſſerts in another, My advice to him is (and I humbly apprehend it is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary) that he wou'd get ſome better information of the ſubject he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to diſcuſs. when he takes up his pen the next time to write, otherwiſe he will be perpetually liable to miſtakes and blunders.</p>
            <p>"The <hi>Paxton Boys</hi> were brave and loyal ſubjects to his Majeſty" ſays this judicious Pamphleteer. As to their bravery no body will ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it that has heard of their gallant and loyal behaviour at <hi>Lancaſter</hi> where only fifty of them compleatly armed were able to vanquiſh a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous company of eight men and women, and ſeven ſmall children, all
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009703_0009_0F7A44FF28FE3B70"/>
coop'd up in a Jail. The ſame of this noble and gallant exploit ought ſurely to be recorded in the annals of <hi>America</hi> for the honor of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, chriſtian <hi>Preſbyterians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Loyalty was equally conſpicuous in bidding defiance to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of his Honor; trampling upon the juſt and righteous Laws of their Country; and holding a Treaty with his Majeſty's Repreſentative as if they were Foreigners at war with <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> What a Noſe of wax the word Loyalty has been made to ſerve the vile purpoſes of all the inſurrections that have been rais'd againſt the Sovereign, is well known to thoſe, who are the leaſt acquainted with Hiſtory? The Rebels in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in 1641, call'd themſelves loyal ſubjects to <hi>King Charles.</hi> And the <hi>Scotch</hi> Rebels, when they march'd an army to deſtroy the king, not only warmly profeſs'd, but ſwore to be loyal to him and his hens in their infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous covenant.—Oh! but crys the Gentleman, they did no body any harm. No thanks to them for that For had they gone to rob and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the country, the whole Province wou'd have bravely hunted them down like wolves, Beſides it was politic in them to behave diſcreetly to the Inhabitants. When the Pretender march'd into <hi>England</hi> the laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, his Adherents behav'd as diſcreetly as the <hi>Paxton Boys,</hi> yet this did not ſave the Leaders of them from the ax and the halter.</p>
            <p>I can't comprehend how our Author ſhou'd know that <hi>Squaws</hi> have charms, had they not made ſome deep impreſſions on his own heart. For Love <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, is ſtronger than Death. Poſſibly however the jealouſy of being rivall'd may have been the cauſe of the late diſtaſte he and his brethren have conceiv'd for theſe poor females; it ſo, I can aſſure them, they may with all the freedom in the world repair to the Barracks, and brighten their former acquaintance, as all tranſgreſſions of this kind are eaſily waſh'd away by ſtanding in the <hi>Kirk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would ſeriouſly ask this great Writer, or any of his Advocates, what cou'd a ſett of men do more in the Aſſembly for protecting this Province, than the people call'd <hi>Quakers</hi> have done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It can be undeniably prov'd that more money has been rais'd in this Province for carrying on the war, than any other in <hi>America.</hi> It can alſo be prov'd that the neceſſity of raiſing money was never diſputed, but the mode of taxation: Had our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives given up this inherent right of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> they wou'd have betray'd the truſt repos'd in them by their Conſtituents, and deſerv'd the cenſure of the very <hi>Paxton Boys</hi> themſelves. Beſides their peculiar tenets in religion as is alledg'd, have no influence on their actions relative to Government. For <hi>Quakers</hi> are no more anſwerable for the bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences charg'd upon their doctrines by the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> when they do not affect their conduct) than <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> are chargeable with all the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities of <hi>Abſolute Decrees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shou'd not a <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> be as paſſive as a <hi>Quaker</hi> according to his own principles; for certainly if God fore-ordains whatever comes to paſs, he can no more alter the irreſiſtable decree, than he can overturn the world; conſequently all reſiſtance againſt an enemy is vain, becauſe we
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009703_0010_0F7A44FFC4F6EF60"/>
then fight againſt the will of God, and reſiſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which is an abominable crime.</p>
            <p>Our Author makes a tedious Harrangue about the <hi>Quakers</hi> for once taking up arms to defend themſelves, when the city appear'd to be in the utmoſt danger of maſſacre, Plunder and deſolation, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> a total overthrow of the very being of our conſtitution. This is a ſimilar caſe to that at the Revolution. No one precept in the Goſpel is more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enforc'd than obedience to the King; abſolute neceſſity, however, for once compell'd the <hi>Engliſh Nation,</hi> at the Revolution, to diſpenſe with this poſitive command. Now will our Author be ſo hardy as to ask,
<q>if theſe are the people, who always profeſs obedience to the King according to a divine command;" and then conclude; "what amazing hypocriſy appears in their profeſſion." "They muſt either confeſs that they have hitherto reſiſted the bleſſed Goſpel, or that the <hi>Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> has given them a new Goſpel contradictory to the old one; but this is to blaſpheme God, and belie the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> yet ſuch is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</q>
This is the force of his Argument when applied to the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and any one wou'd certainly conclude that our Author by his manner of reaſoning was a <hi>Nonjuror:</hi> And indeed I am apt to believe there is ſomething in it; for I never heard that <hi>Preſbyterian Miniſters</hi> in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> country were oblig'd to take the Oaths to the Government, or give any other teſt of their fidelity to the King. Whoever heard a <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Sermon upon the duty of ſubmiſſion to the preſent eſtabliſhment? Are not the Covenanters preaching againſt his Majeſty every day, and all by the direction of the Spirit? Four different ſorts of <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> have all in the name of the <hi>Bleſſed Spirit</hi> damn'd each other in <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> Muſt not each party have belied the <hi>Bleſſed Spirit,</hi> in anouncing contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and blaſphemous Anathemas in his name? But to conclude. Beware, my Countrymen, of men who wou'd cram Laws down your throats with muskets, daggers, tomahawks and ſcalping-knives. Give me leave to recommend to you a ſpirit of watchfulneſs and jealouſy. The Inhabitants of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> enjoy the moſt extenſive privileges both ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and religious of any people in the world. Let us then, like true <hi>Britons,</hi> warmly oppoſe any that wou'd preſume to deprive us of them! Let us boldly contend for the cauſe of Liberty and our Country, and never be puſillanimous or ſupine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when we ſee men of bad principles at work behind the curtain, to wreſt them out of our hands! Let us as we value every thing that is dear and ſacred to us, endeavour to ſuppreſs the preſent prevailing faction! And finally, let us exert all our influence and power to keep the Reigns of Government out of the hands of <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> (which can be done no other way than by placing ourſelves under the protection of our gracious and royal Maſter, <hi>King George</hi> the third of bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory) as we are convinc'd, thoroughly convinc'd, of their unfitneſs to govern both by experience and undeniable inſtances from Hiſtory!</p>

But ſuch is the profound, wiſe policy of ſome of our <hi>State Phyſicians,</hi> who have been at work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the ſcenes to encourage one part of the inhabitants to riſe up in arms, and attempt to draw blood of the reſt; tho' happy for us, they are too rampant, and not eaſily rid out of their liberties.</p>
            <p>The veil of hypocriſy was too thin, and is now plainly ſeen thro' by the good inhabitants of this province, who heartily and ſincerely pity the poor deſpicable wretches that were made <hi>Dupes</hi> of upon this occaſion to ſerve the turn of thoſe ſhallow pated <hi>Stateſmen,</hi> who cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger up ſtorms and tempeſts to caſt away the ſhip that they may (like

the moon-curſers of <hi>Cornwal</hi>) murder the crew, and run away with the plunder.</p>
            <p>As I am an <hi>American</hi> born, and have neither place nor penſion under the G—t, I earneſtly hope my dear countrymen will look upon my weak endeavours to ſerve them, free from prejudice and partiality, and as the overflowings of a heart truly touch'd with a deep ſenſe of their misfortunes, and ſympathizing with them under their preſent unhappy calamity.</p>
            <p>Muſt it not rouſe the indignation of every patriot breaſt in P—a to ſee ſo many hireling pens proſtituted to ſupport arbitrary meaſures; when if they were equally employ'd in vindicating the rights and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the people; in expoſing wicked miniſters of ſtate, thoſe ſons of corruption, who are preparing the minds of mankind for ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and bondage, they might do honor to themſelves, die without a guilty conſcience ſtaring them in the face, and their memory (inſtead of rotting) wou'd be gratefully rever'd by poſterity?</p>
            <p>As my principal deſign is to examine the merit of <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> for government, without troubling myſelf much about pamphlets, that have, or may be written in defence of the <hi>P—r</hi> and his <hi>Tools</hi> in Oppoſition to the <hi>Freemen</hi> of this Province; nevertheleſs I look upon it as a Duty incumbent on me juſt to give a <hi>Key</hi> to one of them, call'd the "Conduct of the Paxton Men impartially repreſented."</p>

If the Reader however in the Peruſal of the Pamphlet, will bear this in his Mind, and as he goes along, when he meets with words. <hi>Tyrant, Traytor, Rebel,</hi> &amp;c. Apply the firſt to a certain Ruler not much eſteem'd, and the two laſt to the <hi>Paxton Men,</hi> and <hi>Preſbyterians!</hi> Theſe with a few more of the like Emendations, may make it tolerable Senſe and what is more give it ſome Color of Truth.</p>
            <p>Our Author commends the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of the Freemen of <hi>Rome,</hi> for murdering <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> in the State Houſe, becauſe he had tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally depriv'd them of their Liberty, and reduc'd them to a State of Vaſſalage and Slavery.—I believe his Employers have more Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding than to thank him for this Inſtance of his Zeal, as it militates ſo ſtrongly againſt the Cauſe for which it was produc'd, and ſets ſuch an Example to the Senators of P—,a as I am confident they wou'd by

no Means imitate. Thus I might run a Parallel thro' all his Inſtances from Prophane Hiſtory, to ſhew that every Example he has adduc'd is in Favor of the People and their Repreſentatives. He has taken a Deal of Pains to ſhew the Similarity between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> (but this was a needleſs Undertaking, as every Body knew it before). He has alſo endeavor'd to make it appear that all other <hi>Profeſſions</hi> intermix'd among them, are the <hi>Heathens</hi> with whom they have to contend. That if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Force</hi> will not do, <hi>Fraud</hi> may be made uſe of to deſtroy their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, by Craft, Treachery, or Diſſimulation.—He wou'd feign make us believe too that as God formerly gave the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by a Charter from Heaven to the Jews; ſo he has given <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> to the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> by Virtue of the ſame Commiſſion, <hi>Judith,</hi> cries our Author, tells a Lye to <hi>Holofernus,</hi> makes him drunk, and then ſevers his Head from his Body with a Scymitar,—ſo ought all the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Preſbyterianiſm,</hi> ſerve thoſe of a different Perſuaſion who do not coincide with them in Religion and Politics, ſmite them under the fifth Rib as <hi>Joab</hi> did <hi>Abner,</hi> and betray them with a Kiſs into the Hands of their Enemies, as <hi>Judas</hi> did our <hi>bleſſed Savior.</hi> Might I not as well quote this Paſſage of the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> and apply it with equal Propriety to the late Expedition to <hi>German-town? Holofernus</hi> (i. e. Col—A.-m-s-g) was the chief Captain of the Army of the Paxton Volunteers, who had formerly march'd Weſt and ſecur'd himſelf behind a Tree; till his Forces vanquiſh'd the <hi>Catananites;</hi> after which, in the Name of the Hoſts of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he fired at a Bundle of Deer-Skins which fell before him; for which gallant and brave Exploit he was crown'd with Laurels: He then ruin'd his Sword againſt <hi>Judah</hi> to the Eaſtward, and ſaid I will go forth in my Wrath and devour mine Enemies, and ſtraitly block up the Capitol.—Now had there been a Woman in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> as bold as <hi>Judith,</hi> and us'd the ſame Means to deſtroy this <hi>Holofernus</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantown,</hi> wou'd ſhe not be equally entitled to the Bleſſings pronounc'd by <hi>Ozias,</hi> that Judith was, according to the curious Application our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Author has made to this Text?</p>
            <p>What a ſhocking Opinion muſt Mankind have of <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> who firſt kill People, and then erect Courts of <hi>Judicature</hi> to try them? Our Author has been at great Pains to take ex Parte Depoſitions, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them to the World as ſufficient Proof of the <hi>Indians</hi> Guilt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whether they were innocent or guilty is little to the Purpoſe now, as their Doom is irreverſable. Will the Verdict of the Public reſtore them to Life, ſuppoſe it is given in their Favor. Theſe Allegations were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, if true, to confine them by Virtue of the civil Authority in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to bring them to a legal Tryal, that they might either be acquitted or condemn'd by their Country.—But who, under the Heavens, gave Presbyterians Authority to be their own Carvers, or appointed them Judges, Jurors, Hangmen, and Executioners, to butcher the <hi>Indians,</hi> Man, Woman and Child in cold Blood, without firſt examining either their Merit, or Demerit, or giving them any Chance to plead for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:009703_0014_0F7A4504F305D038"/>The <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> want more Members from the back Counties to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them, and have added this to the Catalogue of their Grievances upon the Frontiers. Now ſuppoſe it was granted, I believe it wou'd make very little Alteration for the better, as that County has ſeldom ſent a <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> to repreſent them, (one qualified being very rarely to be found,) and but a-few from the others; and even ſome of thoſe that are ſent, appear as warm for the Liberties of their Country as any of their Brother Members. Are not the Gentlemen in general who repreſent the five back Counties, I wou'd ſeriouſly ask this Gentleman, as unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in their Votes againſt the P—r as any of the Members who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the interior Parts of the <hi>Province?</hi> And are not they the beſt Judges from what Fountain the Grievances of their Conſtituents flow? Had they proteſted againſt the Reſolves of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> publiſh'd their Reaſons, and ſhewn that they were out number'd by a <hi>Quaker Majority;</hi> there wou'd have been ſome color of Argument for making ſuch a Clamor about more Members. But no ſuch Thing. Theſe Gentlemen know the odds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſixpence and a Shilling, as well as other People, and think it no Deed of Charity to pay the P—r's Taxes, whoſe Eſtate is ſaid to be worth, at a moderate Computation, ten Millions Sterling.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that all Means are to be uſ'd between this, and next Election to unite the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> as one Man to chuſe ſuch Perſons for Aſſemblymen who (upon certain Conditions) will grant any Thing the P—s demand. This Plot may be conceited by ſome-time ſerving Hirelings of that Party, but I cannot ſuffer myſelf to believe the Majority of the landed Men among them who, by the bye, love Money as well as their Neighbours, and are no <hi>Creatures</hi> to the <hi>G—t</hi> wou'd ever ſubmit to ſuch a ſervile Yoke—If any Thing induces them it muſt be their cloſe Attachment to their peculiar Tenets in Religion; the artful Perſuaſions of their Teachers; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable hopes of an Eſtabliſhment in <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> And if theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives prevail what may we expect to be the Conſequences? Why—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> a Bill exempting the Proprietaries from all Taxes forever,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Bill ſettling an Annuity upon <hi>Deputy Governors</hi> for the Time being of one Thouſand per Annum or more. In lieu of which the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> ſhall have.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> A Bill rating every Taxable of whatever Denomination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſupporting <hi>Presbyterian Miniſters</hi> and their poor Widows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> A Bill obliging every Body to attend <hi>Preſbyterian Mettings,</hi> under Pain of Corporal Puniſhment for the firſt Offence, and Hanging for the ſecond.</p>
            <p>For the firſt Offence five Pounds to the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and for the ſecond Offence Excommunication from the Converſation of all Man kind, and to be given over to <hi>Satan</hi> to be buffered, till abſolv'd by the <hi>Kirk.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Knox's</hi> Leturgy.</note> ſuch, my dear Countrymen, wou'd be the Effects of a <hi>Preſbyterian Aſſembly,</hi> when properly tutor'd by the Government and their Preachers. The <hi>Preſbyterian Policy</hi> therefore purſued with indefatigable Zeal, in this,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009703_0015_0F7A4506401AE6B8"/>
and the Neighboring <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> ought to awaken the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every true Lover of his Country, and rouſe all other Perſuaſions, to unite as one Man againſt them, being the moſt formidable and dangerous Enemies we have to cope with.</p>
            <p>Let us next examine into the Charity of the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> ſo much boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, I will not ſay to other Societies; for that was never heard of; but even to their own diſtreſſed Brethren on the Frontiers.</p>
            <p>I believe it will be as hard a Task to prove, that ever they, (conſider'd as a Society) rais'd a <hi>general Contribution,</hi> of <hi>their own Money,</hi> for the Relief of the <hi>back Inhabitants,</hi> as it is to prove, that <hi>Quakers</hi> did ſo; and I think the moſt difficult Work of the two. Here I ſuppoſe ſome of their paſſionate Teachers will be ready to fly in my Face, and ask me, with an angry Tone,
<q>if we did not give away Hundreds both at <hi>Lancaſter Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and afterwards, when every Body was raiſing Men for them, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Quakers.</hi>
               </q>
I readily own it. But the next Queſtion is, pray Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, whoſe money were you ſo liberal of? Was it your own, or the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable contributions of the <hi>Good People of England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> put into your Hands for that Uſe?—If it was your own, then you have theſe charitable Donations ſtill in your Pockets, to ſupply the Sums you have advanced, and pay you for your Diſburſments. And if it was not your own, but the Money rais'd in <hi>England,</hi> that you and your Brethren pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raded away upon at <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> and ſince made ſuch a Noiſe about your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> on the Frontiers, as I am apt to believe it was? why in the Name of Senſe do you aſſume the <hi>Merit</hi> of it to yourſelves, as if you were the only charitable, humane People in the Province.—Either you muſt candidly confeſs that this is the true State of the Caſe, or you have impos'd upon the generous People of <hi>Europe</hi> with falſe Notions.</p>
            <p>As many of my Readers, (who are not of their Profeſſion) may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with this Piece of <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> craft, I ſhall unravel the whole Myſtery of their iniquitous Scheme, contriv'd in their moſt ſacred Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, by the beſt and ableſt of their Divines and Lay-Elders.</p>
            <p>A few Years ago the Heads of this Society petition'd the <hi>Governor</hi> of this <hi>Province</hi> for a Charter to incorporate a certain Number of themſelves, to raiſe Money for the Uſe of <hi>poor, diſtreſſed Preſbyterian Miniſters and their Widows;</hi> their Petition being granted with certain Powers and Limitations, the next Conſideration was how to procured Fund. One of their own Members who had been a <hi>Pedlar,</hi> and conſequently well qualified for ſuch an undertaking, offer'd his Service. Having had his Education under Mr. T—<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, who was a Maſter Workman at begging, ha was univerſally approv'd of as one of their ableſt Diſemblers, fitted out with proper Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials, and ſent abroad. At a ſecret <hi>Committee</hi> of this Corporation it was agreed on, that, as collecting Money for a <hi>Widows Fund,</hi> might prove but a dry ſubject to declaim on in <hi>Europe,</hi> their Delegate ſhou'd have a ſet of private Inſtructions directing him, that upon his Arrival, he ſhou'd make no Mention of the <hi>Widow's Fund,</hi> but get a Brief drawn up, ſetting forth the Miſeries and Diſtreſſes of the <hi>back Inhabitants</hi> of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania;</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:009703_0016_0F7A45068EDD0208"/>
the vaſt Numbers of Chriſtian Captives doom'd to perpetual Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, together with the abſolute Neceſſity of contributing Money for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. This was undoubtedly a crafty Scheme. For as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had often contributed Money for the Redemption of <hi>Chriſtian Captives in</hi> Africa, large Sums were generouſly given for theſe pious Uſes; at which liberal Donations we need not be ſurpriz'd, if we can credit the <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> themſelves, who ſay, "that this very Deputy of theirs carried Home with him a Parcel of Squirrel Scalps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when he had in <hi>Ireland,</hi> work'd up the Paſſions of his Audience by diſmal and melancholly Relations of murder'd <hi>Miniſters</hi> in the back Woods to a proper Degree of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation; produc'd theſe as Proofs, declaring they were the Skins of their Heads that were barbarouſly and cruelly torn off by the wild <hi>Indians.</hi> In Conſequence, I ſay, of this mournful Detail, the People were extreamly charitable; never once dreaming that three fourths of their Donations wou'd never be applied to the Uſes for which they were given.—How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever when the Cheat was diſcover'd innocently in <hi>England</hi> by one who was their very good Friend, but not in the Plot, the Pedlar ſlipt off, and left the beſt Part of his Pack behind him, which was detain'd, till proper Aſſurances were given from this Side the Water, that it ſhou'd not all be miſapplied.—.To ſave Appearances then, an Addreſs was preſented to Governor <hi>H</hi>—<hi>n</hi> from a Deputation of this <hi>Preſbyterian Corporation</hi> ſetting forth their Deſire to advance a Sum of Money for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Captives, a Copy of which, with his Honor's Anſwer was ſent to <hi>England</hi> to juſtify the Pedlar's Brief, and confute the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Aſperſions of a certain Gentleman, however notwithſtanding all this, as Truth will generally prevail he juſtify'd himſelf, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting their Falſhoods, Malice and Knavery in a written Vindication, Sign'd by one of the P—rs, and <hi>Dr, Chandler,</hi> (the Head of the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> in <hi>England</hi>) and tranſmitted it over here, by way of a <hi>Looking-Glaſs</hi> for them to ſee themſelves in; but they appear'd ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ugly and deform'd they were aſham'd to ſhew this <hi>Glaſs</hi> even to ſome of their own Brethren.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Addreſs</hi> and <hi>Anſwer</hi> were look'd upon by People of other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations in this <hi>Province,</hi> as a ſevere Reflection caſt upon them; as if <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> were the only People here, who had the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe poor Slaves at Heart; whereas it is well known that the large Preſents made to the Indians by the Government in order to bring about a Pacification and Return of Priſoners were rais'd by an equal Aſſeſment upon every Denomination.— After all; how fraudulent was it to collect Money for one Uſe, and then apply it to another. This Crime I apprehend is equal in Guilt to many made Capital in <hi>England:</hi> If ſo, what then did our Orator deſerve who wickedly defrauded the Public, or what did thoſe men deſerve, who advis'd him to that baſe and unrighteous Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? How wicked and ungenerous was it for them to deceive their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors by falſe Repreſentations, and after they had obtain'd the Caſh, to pocket three fourths of it for their own Uſe, and the remainder give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

way at a <hi>Public Treaty</hi> for charitable Purpoſes <hi>as their own?</hi>—They took particular Care never to inform his <hi>Honor,</hi> or the Public, in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs that they had receiv'd a Sum of Money from <hi>England</hi> to redeem their poor Countrymen in Bondage—no; this would be to act out of Character; for it muſt be all a deceitful, blind Piece of Deception from Begining to End.</p>
            <p>When we ſeriouſly conſider the <hi>Kind</hi> of an <hi>Eſtabliſhment Preſbyterians</hi> have obtain'd in the <hi>Midland Provinces of North America</hi> by Virtue of this <hi>Charter,</hi> and the particular Favors done for them by <hi>Governor Belcher</hi> in the <hi>Jerſey;</hi> who procur'd them an excluſive <hi>Charter</hi> from the Crown for the Management of their College to the Detriment of all other Profeſſions (for which Favors they are now gratefully paying his <hi>Majeſty</hi> in <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania,</hi> we ought all to be alarm'd, and try to ſtem the Torrent of <hi>Preſbyterianiſm,</hi> which is pouring down upon us from the North Pole, and if not timely prevented, will, with more than <hi>vandalic Barbarity,</hi> bury us, our Religion and Liberties, in one general Inundation.</p>

               <hi>Prince-Town</hi> was choſen for the Seat of their College, becauſe it was ſituated in ſuch a manner that no Place of <hi>Worſhip</hi> was within many Miles of it, by which means, the Students wou'd be oblig'd to attend <hi>Preſbyterian Preaching.</hi> This was an Artifice to erect <hi>Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſm</hi> on the Ruins of all other Societies, and to inſtill their Mode of Worſhip, and Principles of Calviniſm into the tender Minds of the Youth, who by the Time, they had taken their Degrees, wou'd either be Converts to <hi>Preſbyterianiſm,</hi> or at leaſt go away with favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ideas of it.—It is well known that there is little or no Peace at this Seminary for the Students who retain their Integrity, and do not ſwallow all the wild, indigeſted Fumes of Enthuſiaſm taught by the <hi>New-Lights</hi> and their <hi>Followers.</hi> The Severity of their Diſcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line has been carried ſo far very lately as to prohibit all Converſation between what they call the converted and unconverted (how fair ſoever their moral Character might be) till this holy Inquiſition had ſet a Seal upon their Foreheads, as a Mark of their being abſolutely elected; and by which Means they might be known to all the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Children of true <hi>Preſbyterianiſm.</hi>

            <p>The College in this City plan'd upon the Principles of Moderation and Liberty, and intended for the Uſe and Benefit of every Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is now got into the Hands of a <hi>Preſbyterian Faction.</hi> The Profeſſors and Tutors being generally choſen of that Perſuaſion, lord it with ſuch a high Hand over other Profeſſions, that they are not contented with uſing their Power to keep all others out; but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable in planing to thruſt thoſe out who differ from them that are in.</p>

no better Quarters from this College than the Church, and are drove to the Neceſſity of building one at <hi>Rhode-Iſland.</hi> The Number of Students greatly decreaſe, not caring to ſtay where there is ſo much Partiality ſhewn in Favor of a particular Society and generally return Home with their Heads ſtuff'd full of Vulgar Phraſes, inſtead of that native Purity of their Mother Tongue they brought with them. The Honors of the Inſtitution are ſo indiſcriminately conferr'd in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> and with ſo little Diſcernment, that Leather-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tches Makers, and Gentlemen are put upon the ſame Level. Such is the preſent Situation of our College, which might have been at this Day an Ornament to the Province, had it been carried on upon the Principles of Moderation, and Catholiciſm as was originally intended.</p>
            <p>The Eligance and Politeneſs of theſe <hi>Preſbyterian Divines,</hi> who ſet themſelves up for Profeſſors of Colleges will be handed down to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to their immortal Infamy, in the two ſtupid Addreſſes they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to <hi>Governor F—n</hi> and <hi>Governor P—n.</hi> That they underſtand a little Latin and Greek I will not diſpute, and perhaps may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing acquainted with the logical, pedantic Rules of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> Anti Arminian, or <hi>Calvinistic Metaphyſics,</hi> and ſome other Myſtical Rhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſodies; but that they underſtand Dignity of Style, Propriety and Ele<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gance of Expreſſion, let theſe two Addreſſes declare.

Half a Million of Money given to defend the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is certainly one <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Proof of Quaker Loyalty; and what is a farther and ſtronger Confirmation of it, is, that they are heartily willing, and extreamly anxious that his Majeſty ſhou'd take them under his immediate Protection and Government. They are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of looſing their Charter; of being ſaddled with heavier Taxes; or paying Tythes to the Church Clergy, as this whiffling Politician <hi>ſquints</hi> at in one of his Obſervations.</p>
            <p>Let us next conſider what are the <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Proofs of Preſbyterian Loyalty.

There has been a half yearly Meeting of the Quakers in this City, but this Change of Government has not been propos'd in their Meeting, as we can yet underſtand, nor is it approv'd of by the Heads of that Society.</p>
                  <p>This Affair is in all Probability, a <hi>Trap</hi> laid to enſnare the unwary, and then to caſt an Odium on the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> for ruining or attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ruin the Province. The Frontier Counties are now ſuing for a Redreſs of Grievances, and we have the greateſt Reaſon to believe that it is no more than an artful Scheme to <hi>divide</hi> or <hi>divert</hi> the Attention of the injur'd Frontier Inhabitants from proſecuting their Petitions, which very much alarm them. For theſe Reaſons we wou'd earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to you to loſe no Time in adviſing all under your Influence, whether of our Denomination or others, from ſigning any ſuch Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition—</p>

            <p>By this Letter his <hi>Majeſty</hi> and the Public may plainly ſee what ſort of Loyal Subjects <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> are to him in this Government, who think it the greateſt Curſe that can befal them, to be <hi>reduc'd to the Form of a King's Government:</hi> Their Quarrel is not with a bad King, more than a good one; but their Abhorrence is to the very <hi>Form,</hi> which they utterly deteſt, as inconſiſtent with their <hi>Weſtminſter platform,</hi> and a perpetual Check to the Rigor of their Diſcipline. The general Cry of <hi>modern Preſbyterians,</hi> is to glory in the <hi>Revolution,</hi> and their firm Attachment to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Hanover;</hi> to lay all the Blame of former Rebellions at the Door of the <hi>Covenanters,</hi> and the Oppreſſions of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>STEWART.</hi>—What kind of Affection they have for King <hi>George</hi> is evident in this Letter, by which they are ſowing the Seeds of Diſloyalty among the good People of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>—This however is quite agreeable to the Tenor of their Conduct under King <hi>William.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>When the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> Commiſſioners return'd from King <hi>William</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and told the General Aſſembly of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that the King had poſitively declar'd, that he wou'd not any longer ſuffer them to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and perſecute the <hi>Epiſcopal Subjects.</hi> The Moderators ſaid open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009703_0020_0F7A4509731DFFA0"/>
that if it were not for the great Army he had with him he durſt not have ſaid ſo to them," And however, it wou'd have been wiſer in him to have held his Peace, for they own'd no Maſter but <hi>Chriſt."</hi> One of them in a Sermon "declar'd, that <hi>King William</hi> deſign'd to dethrone. <hi>King Jeſus."</hi> And the Moderator of the General Aſſembly imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after it's Diſſolution, reflected upon <hi>King William,</hi> as ſent in Wrath to be a Curſe to <hi>God's Kirk.</hi>—Another of their Preachers tells us that they brought in a Dog, (<hi>i. e.</hi> K. Wm.) for Gods Sake, and that he now began to bite the Bairnes <hi>i. e.</hi> the Children.—One Mr. <hi>Kennedy</hi> in the ſame Reign, before the General Aſſembly in which he was Moderator ſaid in his Prayer, "Lord! Moderation is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us by the King, and we all know that it is a Virtue that is ſometimes uſeful, Lord; but I cannot ſay that which he calls Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration now, is ſo convenient at this Time for thy People and Cauſe; for even to be free with thee, good Lord, I think it is beſt to make a clear Houſe, by ſweeping them out all at the Door, and caſting them out to the Midden [Dunghill] <hi>i. e.</hi> other Profeſſions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Borlands in Gallowshields pray'd thus,
<q>O God! Thou haſt bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den us pray for Kings, and yet they have been always very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to thy <hi>Kirk;</hi> they ſay that this new King thou haſt ſent us, viz. King William takes the Sacrament from the Hands of a Biſhop kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ah!</q>
That's black Work, that's foul Work. Lord deliver him from Popery, and Prelacy; from a <hi>Dutch</hi> Conſcience; and the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedneſs of the <hi>Stewarts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it appears that nor only Covenanters, but the whole Body of Presbyterians are actuated by the ſame rebellious Principles ſince the <hi>Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi> they were before; and that not even the Eſtabliſhment of their Profeſſion in <hi>Scotland</hi> can make them in Love with <hi>Monarchy.</hi> Is not the Language of theſe Quotations from their Moderators and principal Divines, exactly of a Piece with this treacherous Jeſuitical Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian <hi>Bull</hi> ſent forth from the College of Philadelphia? Are theſe fit Men to have the Tuition of His Majeſty's Proteſtant Subjects? To inſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Youth an evil Idea of <hi>Royal Government;</hi> to inſtruct them, that a covetous, mercenary, avaritious, tyrannical hard-hearted land-Lord, who is for laying heavy Burdens on his Tenents, and will not touch them with one of his Fingers is to be preferr'd to our moſt <hi>gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign;</hi> that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> will ABRIDGE us of our Privileges, but we may be aſſur'd he never will ENLARGE them, or grant us any Favor; and laſtly, that the Province may expect nothing but Ruin, Deſtruction and Deſolation, the Moment we put ourſelves under <hi>King George the Third.</hi>—Cou'd a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> cou'd a <hi>Spaniard</hi> entertain a worſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the glorious Conſtitution of <hi>Great-Britain?</hi> Yet theſe are the Men, who wou'd ſcarce have a Mouthful of Bread to ſupport themſelves or their Families, had it not been for his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Royal Bounty and Favor, in promoting a generous Collection by his own good Example; I ſay, theſe are the Men, who maliciouſly aſperſe his Crown and Dignity.</p>

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:009703_0021_0F7A450A3AF77198"/>However ſome particular Friends have ſuffer'd themſelves to be diſtrain'd upon, rather than pay Taxes towards carrying on the War, yet they have been always paſſive without the leaſt murmuring. The Number that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain theſe conſcientious Scruples is but ſmall, the Majority of that good People having always contributed their <hi>Quota</hi> as chearfully as any other Society. How therefore <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> or thoſe who write in their behalf, can have the Aſſurance to caſt this in their Teeth, above all other People (when they know that they have carried this Point further than any <hi>Quakers</hi> ever did in the World) is a Piece of Effrontery that can only be fitted to their own Foreheads.</p>
            <p>In a Book call'd the <hi>Hind let looſe</hi> which is almoſt as ſacred among them as the Confeſſion of Faith, Page 701, I find this Declaration.
<q>The exacting Taxations for maintaining the Army, and the paying of Subſidies, was, and remains to be a conſuming crimſon wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, the cry whereof reaches to Heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſame Author, Page 912, I find Words to this Purport,
<q>The paying of Subſidies to the preſent Government, is to furniſh that Party of the Dragon's Legions, in their War againſt Michael with Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, which no Body can excuſe no more than ſheding the Blood of their innocent Children to Molach.</q>
—Now did ever any Quaker make uſe of ſuch vile Language againſt the Government? Did ever a Quaker reckon the granting of Supplies for the King's Uſe as crying a Sin as the ſacrificing innocent Children to the Devil?</p>
            <p>I appeal to the impartial Part of the Preſbyterians themſelves, if they think, that our Repreſentatives can have any Thing elſe in View but the Good of their Country, in the Struggle they make in Behalf of the Liberties of the Province,—I have often heard that Parliament Men have been blam'd and cenſur'd for ſelling themſelves and their Country, to wicked Miniſters of State, for a Bribe, Place or Penſion, but never for oppoſing illegal Taxes; arbitrary Power; or Miniſterial Corruption.—The ever memorable <hi>Hambden</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Charles the</hi> 1ſt, rather than pay an illegal Tax of 30 S. (a much leſs Sum than 110 pounds demanded by the <hi>P—r</hi> according to his own Calculation) went to Jail; by which noble ſtand the Liberties of <hi>England</hi> were in a great Meaſure preſerv'd. Muſt it not be an everlaſting Blot in the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Preſbyterians, that they are the only People in <hi>P—a,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Nations, Sects and Profeſſions ſettled in it, that will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a <hi>T—l</hi> Landlord to diſtreſs and oppreſs his Tenants;—a Land lord, who cannot be contented wirh his Legal Dues, but wants the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pay his Taxes for him into the Bargain, and if he cannot perſuade them to pay the whole, wou'd rather (like Murtah O Lavery) take the one Third of a farthing, than go away with nothing at all.</p>

            <p>MR. J—n E—g being choſen Moderator, the Meeting was open'd by him with a Prayer to the following Effect.</p>
            <p>L—d thou knoweſt the end of our Meeting as well as we can tell thee, that it is to ſettle the Election; not the Election of Grace, but of Members of Aſſembly for this Province! O! Do thou confound theſe curſed Quakers, that are endeavoring to bring us under a Kingly Yoke, which thou knoweſt that neither we nor our Fathers ever cou'd bear! Do thou turn the Hearts of the ignorant Dutch from <hi>King George</hi> to ſerve the P—r in ſuch a manner as will enable us to eſtabliſh our Religion upon the Necks of both! Confound our Enemies the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> and all their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are Lovers of <hi>Monarchy</hi> and Abhorrers of <hi>Preſbyterianiſm!</hi> Pour down in a particular manner thy Judgments upon F—n and G—y, and let the thunderbolts of thy Vengeance ſink them down to the lower regions! Enable us thy Servants at this Time ſo to ſettle Matters that <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterianiſm</hi> may be eſtabliſh'd among us, and all other Profeſſions crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before it! Let the King's Name become odious and ſtink in the Noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trils of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and let them join heartily with us thy Servants in turning out the preſent Members of <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and in putting in ſuch Men as ſhall be ſubſervient to all our preſent and future Views for the Good of thy <hi>Kirk! Amen!</hi>

               <p>THE Buſineſs we are now met upon demands our moſt ſerious Conſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deration. It is of no leſs importance than the eſtabliſhing of our moſt holy Religion in this Province; for the Accompliſhment of which you know all means, whether juſtifiable or unjuſtifiable, are to be us'd, ſeeing the End is ſo valuable. Our late Behaviour in killing the Savages in in this Place; marching to <hi>Germantown;</hi> and intimidating the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> hath ſo far recommended our Society to the G—t that all the Places of Truſt are to be thrown into our Hands, eſpecially the Commiſſions of the Peace. And as you know the New Lights and old Lights who were formerly Juſtices, gave Judgment againſt the Followers of each other, according as the Plaintiff or Defendant was of a Party, and not agreeable to the Merits of the Cauſe, for which four or five of them were turn'd out, through the intereſt of a certain eminent and ſenſible Courtier; ſo now as we are all one People again, our Elders who will generally be made Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, will have it in their Power to be revenged upon all the Enemies of <hi>Preſbyterianiſm.</hi> This is the firſt Advantage we ſhall reap from our firm

Secondly, that an Annuity of 1000 <hi>per Annum</hi> be ſettled upon all our ſucceeding G—s; for which Favors we ſhall have in return.—</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. A Law eſtabliſhing our <hi>Kirk</hi> by Seſſions, Preſbytaries and Synods, with all the Appendages of <hi>Preſbyterianiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2dly. A Law rating every Taxable, of whatever Denomination, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſupporting our Miniſters; and you all know how much we ought to have this at Heart, as Numbers of us can ſcarce afford a Dram of Whisky in the Morning.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. A Law obliging every Body to attend our Worſhip under Pain of Corporal Puniſhment for the firſt Offence, and hanging for the ſecond; this will oblige the Heatheniſh Quakers; the papiſtical Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> the ignorant and ſtupid <hi>Dutch</hi> (whom we have now got faſt in a Halter, and upon whoſe Credulity we have artfully impoſed, by ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ſeaſonable, political Romances about the Country) to attend our places of Worſhip; and will be the happy means of adding many Souls to our Number.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. A Law prohibiting all carnal Converſation between Men and their Wives on the Sabbath-Day, leaſt the Fleſh ſhou'd be more powerfull than the Spirit. For the firſt Offence, £. 5 to the Miniſter; for the ſecond, Excommunication from the Converſation of all Mankind, and to be given over to Satan to be buffetted, till abſolv'd by the <hi>Kirk,</hi> according to the Plan laid down by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Knox.</hi> Such my Brethren, are the Advantages we ſhall aſſuredly reap, if we are able to carry our point at the enſuing Election; for that End is this Meeting appointed, that we may fall upon ſuch ways and means as will be the moſt likely to accompliſh it. Dr <hi>A—n</hi> and I put <hi>W—n;</hi> (who you know was caſt out of our <hi>Preſbytaries</hi> for kiſſing a Girl behind a Buſh in Sermon time on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath) upon writing that ſtupid Epitaph on Mr. F—n; and altho' it is ſtuff'd with ſuch palpable Falſhoods, yet the ignorant <hi>Dutch,</hi> who are no Witches, ſwallow it down with the greateſt Avidity. If they once get a Story by the end, it is hard beating it out of them; however, if it holds them 'till the firſt of <hi>October</hi> is over, we don't care how ſoon they are undeceiv'd afterwards.</p>
               <p>In order to cajole the <hi>Church of England</hi> we have agreed that ſeveral of out Members be choſen from among them; but as their Principles are

               <p>I have one Queſtion to ask, and that is— how can all theſe good Laws be obtain'd in favor of our Church, if we chooſe <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent us?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Moderator</hi> reply'd, that there were a good many <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> who would be return'd: but it was not material who were choſen this Year, if they cou'd but get <hi>F—n G—y</hi> and <hi>R—s</hi> out, with two or three others; the reſt wou'd be like a Body without a Head.—And they knew if they cou'd but put in whom they pleas'd this Year, by Virtue of the ſame Strength, they wou'd be able to put them out the next. For if, ſays he, we can change them for one Year, we can always do it, ſo that we may fill the Houſe with <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The grand points we have to carry is to be unanimous among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to blind the <hi>Dutch</hi> by all the Political Duſt we can raiſe; by encreaſing their Prejudices againſt the King; alarming their Fears; and trying to perſuade them that the <hi>Pr—r</hi> is a Prince.</p>

               <p>I believe that will be hard to do. I ſounded one of them who is a Neighbour of mine upon that Subject the other Day, and the Fellow very abruptly told me, that the firſt Thing he did when he came into this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, was to ſwear Allegiance to <hi>King George,</hi> not the P—r; that <hi>King George</hi>'s Father and Mother were both <hi>Dutch</hi> People, and he wou'd ſpend the laſt Drop of his Blood for them;—that they might talk of the Aſſembly as they pleas'd, but <hi>Dutch</hi> Men knew the Worth of Money as well as their Neighbours; that no Body cou'd perſuade him that it was right for the Country People to pay the P—r's Taxes; that he lived cloſe by one of the P—s Manors, as fine Land as any in the Province;—
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009703_0026_0F7A450E5FD5CBA8"/>
that it was rated no higher than ſome barren ſtony Hills in his Poſſeſſion, not worth Six-pence an Acre;—that he knew theſe Manors had ſerv'd upon the Frontiers, as ſo many lurking Places for the ſculking <hi>Indians</hi> to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them;—that had they been ſettled, they cou'd have made a better De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the Inroads of the Savages; but if they are kept unimprov'd, all the Laws or Treaties in the World will never protect the back Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, nor give them one Hour's Security from thoſe Barbarians, who have always a ſafe Retreat in theſe Wilderneſſes interſpers'd among the People, and kept to all Appearance for that Uſe. The Man was going on with Abundance of ſuch Reaſoning, but I ſtopp'd him ſhort, and told him he knew nothing of the Matter, upon which he went away in a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I confeſs his Arguments thunderſtruck me ſo at that time, that I did not know how to anſwer him otherwiſe.</p>

               <p>Your Converſation with the <hi>Dutchman</hi> brings to my Mind ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe I had the other Day with one of my Elders, a Man of tolerable good Senſe and honeſt, but extreamely opinionative, proud, loquacious, and one who gives me more trouble in the Seſſions, when any Matters of Fornication, Adultery, Slander, Drunkenneſs or Lying is diſcuſs'd among us (which alas! is very frequent] than all the Reſt of the Elders put together.</p>
               <p>Having called a Seſſions about the enſuing Election, I expatiated upon the Advantages we ſhou'd reap in oppoſing the K—g, and adhering to the P—r; the many diſtinguiſhing Marks of his Favor he hath ſhour'd upon <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> in particular, above any other Denomination in <hi>Pennſylvania<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>I never underſtood that the Clergy had any Commiſſion from Heaven to ſettle the Affairs of this World; I always imagin'd their Buſineſs was to prepare us for the next: Whenever they attempt to regulate King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Provinces, I am always ſuſpicious thrt they are making fair Weather with Satan in order to enjoy thoſe earthly Kingdoms themſelves, which are rejected with the greateſt contempt by our <hi>bleſſed Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Days of Darkneſs and Superſtition, the Clergy had engroſs'd all the <hi>civil</hi> as well as <hi>religious</hi> Authority in <hi>Europe.</hi> It was the Glory

however of <hi>Preſbyterianiſm</hi> at the Reformation to ſtrip them in a great Meaſure of both. In every Attempt they have made ſince to regain their loſt Influence they have generally failed; and altho' one would think that the paſt Experience of our Forefathers might convince the Miniſters of this Day, and deter them from ſuch unparallel'd pride, and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Folly; yet, ſuch is the Nature of ambitious Prieſts, that they are ever reſtleſs, like the foaming Sea, caſting forth Mire and Dirt, till ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a few of them domineer over the reſt, or the whole over us that are Laymen.</p>
               <p>The Motive that led me to theſe Reflections, was the Conſideration of that imperious <hi>Jeſuitical Bull</hi> ſent forth from our Miniſters in <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> to their Brethren in the Country.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe we have no great Affection for <hi>Kingly Government,</hi> yet why our Miniſters ſhou'd be ſuch ſhallow Politicians as to publiſh this to the World under the mild Reign of <hi>George the Third,</hi> who has never done us any Injury, is a Piece of Prieſtcraft that I can't account for? Can it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us acceptable to the <hi>King</hi> to proclaim to the World, that our Antip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parhy is to the "Form of his Government," of which he can by no Means diveſt himſelf, without renouncing his Crown? Surely by this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, viz. "as long as the <note n="*" place="bottom">See Circular Letter in No. 2 of the <hi>Looking-Glaſs.</hi>
                  </note>

               <p>Neither was it prudent in them to inſinuate that we ſhou'd be <hi>"re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,"</hi> by ſuch a Change; ſurely they did not mean like half-pay Officers, broken Soldiers, or Wealthy Farmers reduced to Want and Beggary through the Calamities of the Times, and who had Nothing to live upon but daily <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. I am ſtill more aſtoniſh'd when reading their Letter; I find them poſſeſs'd of ſuch diſreſpectful Thoughts of our <hi>moſt gracious Sovereign,</hi> as to compare him to a Rat-Catcher by indecently ſaying he wou'd make <hi>"Traps,"</hi> to catch the poor and worthy Inhabitants of <hi>Pennſylvania!</hi> I love our Chriſtian Cauſe, and therefore bluſh and ſhudder at the Conſequences of ſuch raſh and diſloyal Conduct. Men who can make ſo free with their Sovereign, may well take upon them to lay their peremptory commands upon their Fellow Miniſters, who are their Equals in all reſpects, in this thundering and arbirary Tone,
<q>And let no Man perſuade you to the contrary,</q>
Did ever the <hi>Pope</hi> exceed this in his Conclave? Whatever Mandates they are pleas'd to ſend us we muſt ſwallow them down implicitly by Wholeſale, without Examination, and not even ſuffer any Man to Reaſon with us on the Subject: Surely if a few Miniſters in Town, who are of a paſſionate Diſpoſition with ſuch horrid Preſumption' diametrically oppoſite to our Diſcipline, and the ſublime precepts of the Chriſtian Religion lord it with ſuch a high Hand over their Brethren in the Country, what will our Miniſters do over us that are Laymen? As for my part I am determin'd to be a free Agent and think for myſelf; I have read all the Pamphlets and Speeches that have been publiſh'd on the preſent Diſpute, and am fully of Opinion that Religion has nothing to do with it; I am alſo perſuaded, that if our Miniſters ſpent

the Time, that they trot about the Country after Politicks in correcting their Sermons and adapting them in a better Manner than they have lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly done to the Uſe and Benefit of their Hearers it wou'd be much more for our Edification and their Credit. Can it redound to the Honor of our Profeſſion, the Time our Miniſters ought to ſpend in reading and ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, is taken up in Writing Lampoons, Satires and Libels upon the honorable and worthy Speaker of the Aſſembly in this Province, and his Son the Governor of a Neighbouring one, and who has been no way concern'd in our late Controverſies? How can our Brethren in the <hi>Jerſey</hi> ever with any Face requeſt that Gentleman to do them any Kindneſs, when we here have baſely inſulted him in the moſt ſcurrilous and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Manner? what is the unpardonable Crime our <hi>Aſſembly</hi> has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted? Why that <hi>great one</hi> of contending with the P—r, whether he ſhall pay his own taxes or we ſhall pay them for him; I confeſs the reaſon of my leaving my native Country was to get clear of oppreſive Land lords, and paying of Tithes;—And while the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> is defending me from the firſt, I ſhall always admire their Firmneſs and Integrity; neither ſhall I ever willingly contribute to the latter, tho' it were to the eſtabliſhing of you Sir (ſpeaking to the Moderator) in this Congregation. I love my Profeſſion very well, but I love my Liberty better, and think it much more to the Advantage of the Laity to have the Clergy under their Thumb, than the Clergy to have us under theirs.</p>
               <p>Shew me an inſtance in the Annals of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> where the preſent Royal Family has attempted to <note n="*" place="bottom">See Circular Letter.</note> "abridge" the religious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the People; or taken any Advantage of their inteſtine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions to lay any Hardſhips upon the Conſciences of their Subjects? Can any one believe that the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> don't love their own Liberties, and the Priviliges of their Conſtituents better than the P—r and his Tools, who wou'd rather ſee the Province overflowed in a Deluge of Blood than pay his proportionable Share of the Taxes? It is my humble Opinion that if ſix and thirty Turks were on the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> in Place of the preſent Members, that the ſame innate love of Freedom wou'd prompt them to ſtruggle for the Liberties of their Country, and purſue the <hi>ſame meaſures while the ſame Bone</hi> of Contention ſubſiſted.—That Bone may now be removed by an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the <hi>Crown</hi> to take us under it's immediate Protection, and ſend us Governors to paſs ſuch Bills as will lay an <hi>equitable Tax</hi> upon all Lands without any Exceptions?—And were all the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> to be choſen from among my Countrymen, and Brother Elders to-morrow, were they to give up that ſingle point, of an <hi>equitable Tax</hi> upon all Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, even tho' they ſhou'd procure an Eſtabliſhment in Lieu of it for our Miniſters [which by the by, wou'd be no Advantage to us Laymen) I wou'd be one of the firſt that wou'd hang them up as high as Gilderoy, and ſend their Quarters into all parts of the Province by way of Memento to their Succeſſors.—Here I interrupted my Elder, for I cou'd not bear his Impudence no longer, and aſſured him if he was not ſilent in an inſtant I wou'd cain him; he acknowledg'd, without making any other Reply,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009703_0029_0F7A4511570D2F20"/>

               </p>

               <p n="6">6thly.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Chr.</speaker>
               <p>What do you ſay? The Repreſentatives of the Freemen of the Province of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> have not a Right to Petition their <hi>King</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Tyranny and Oppreſſion of one of their Fellow Subjects, and pray him to deliver them out of Slavery, by taking the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into his own Hands, reſerving to the People their Rights granted by Charter. Pray if the Repreſentatives of a whole Province have no Right to propoſe or Stipulate with the Crown in Matters of the utmoſt Conſequence to their Conſtituents. How came <hi>William Penn</hi> to have a Right in behalf of one Man only, and that himſelf, to propoſe the Sale of this Government to <hi>Queen Ann,</hi> and Stipulate with her about

the Price; for he at firſt ask'd ſeveral Thouſand Pounds more for it, than he afterwards agree'd to take—and at the Crowns rejecting his firſt offer, he was but in the ſame Situation which he was in before he made it; we don't underſtand that the <hi>Queen</hi> thought he had no Right, to make Propoſals in regard to his Rights, but left it to two of her Miniſters to agree with him as they ſhould think proper; which will undoubtedly be the Caſe, with regard to the Petition now ſent home: Either the <hi>King</hi> will accept the Government on the Terms propoſed; or reject it, and leave us as we are until other Terms can be agreed on.</p>

               <p>I make no doubt but that the <hi>King</hi> will accept the Government, upon its being offer'd to him, but the Reſervation of our Liberties is expreſſed in ſuch faint Terms, that the <hi>King</hi> will take little or no notice of them; and on the change will new moddel them over again, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhall looſe our Rights.</p>

               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN making the tour of <hi>Europe</hi> I had the pleaſure of writing to you laſt from <hi>Belgrade</hi> the Capital of <hi>Hungary;</hi> I have ſince had the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, (before I enter <hi>Holand</hi>) to viſit <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> a Province formerly under the Dominion of the <hi>Turk,</hi> but now belonging to the <hi>Emperor</hi> of <hi>Germany;</hi> and as its <note place="bottom">
                  <hi>Waywode,</hi> the name given to the Prince or Governor.</note> 
               <hi>Waywode</hi> is almoſt independant of his Sovereign, he has peopled it with Perſons of all Nations, and of every profeſſion under Heaven.</p>
            <p>Having made a purchaſe of the ſoil from the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who were the original Proprietors; he has alſo obtain'd a grant from the <hi>Emperor</hi> to him and his Heirs, for being perpetual <hi>Waywode</hi> of the Country: This enables him, together with his great diſtance from Court, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Inhabitants, who flocked from all Quarters to ſettle the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try under the ſanction of a Charter of Privileges and immunities, granted for the preſervation of their Religion and Liberties, with an abſolute ſway.</p>
            <p>In ancient times the Natives and Foreigners lived in perfect friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; but within theſe ten years paſt, there has been nothing but bloody Wars carried on between them. The original cauſe of which is ſaid to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009703_0034_0F7A4514CC049578"/>
be, the <hi>Waywodes</hi> taking the advantage of the ſimplicity and ignorance of the Natives in purchaſing their Lands, with regard to their nature and ſituation, as well as deſcription; and cheating them out of ten times more than ever they ſold. This, (with the trade driven on among them by ſome Chriſtians, who firſt made them drunk, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded them, and proſtituted their Females,)—a Syſtem of religion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them and their Forefathers diſguſted them to ſuch a degree, that they immediately declared War. The <hi>Turks</hi> joining them, there was then a neceſſity for the <hi>Waywode</hi> and his Subjects to raiſe money. The Delegates being aſſembled to conſult the welfare of the Country, inſiſted that a Tax ſhou'd be laid upon all the Cow-kine in the Province. The <hi>Waywode</hi> agreed, upon condition, that all his own ſhou'd be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, as he had large flocks all over the Country. This, the Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates refus'd, becauſe his Cows were as liable to be made a prey of by the Enemy, as their own: He then told them his Bulls were free from Taxes, as they could not come under the denomination of Cow-kine, but Bull-kine. This conſtruction however the Delegates wou'd not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of. A long diſpute then enſued. His Excellency told them that if Bulls ſhou'd be taxed, which he could not believe was juſt, yet certainly Heffers and Calves of all kinds were clear. The Delegates reply'd- they ſaw no reaſon why his Excellency's Bulls, Heffers and Calves ſhou'd be exempted, and not their own. The Barbarians in the mean time laid waſte the Frontiers with fire and ſword. This inteſtine diſpute prov'd more fatal to the Province, than all the depredations of a foreign Enemy. Such was the cruel, unrelenting diſpoſition of the Lord of the ſoil, that he wou'd rather ſee a general Maſſacre of all the Inhabitants of the Land, than ſuffer one of his calves to be taxed towards protecting them from a foreign force.</p>
            <p>A few of the well affected Natives to the Government, threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under it's protection, and deliver'd up their Wives and Children as a pledge of their future Fidelity; Lands were aſſign'd for the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſome, and others were ſupported at the public-expence near the Metrapolis. Such was the ſtare of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> upon my firſt arrival at the Capital.</p>
            <p>I waited upon his Excellency the <hi>Waywode,</hi> who receiv'd me very politely. He appear'd to be a middle aged Man of ſmall ſtature; ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with half a Dozen of boys who were called Prime Miniſters of State; four young Nymphs of Circaſſian breed, and a Calidonian wry nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Muſician. The Room was filled with inſtruments of muſic. A Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin; a harpſichord; ſix Bagpipes, and one dozen of Jews Harps. He enquired if I underſtood Muſick; I anſwered, ſome few Italian Airs upon the Bagpipe. Joy then appear'd upon his countenance, and he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately gave me a general invitation to accompany him either to the chaſe (as he lov'd a bow and arrow) or concert, every day during my ſtay at <hi>Weiſſenburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Scarce had two days elapſed when the City was all in arms, at the news of the Piſs—Brute—tarians (a bigotted, cruel and revengeful ſect, ſprung
<pb facs="unknown:009703_0035_0F7A4515822B7B20"/>
from the Turks, and Adoters of <hi>Mahomet</hi> as to abſolute Fate, but nominal Chriſtians in ſome other reſpects, having murder'd the innocent Natives Man Woman and Child, who were ſettled in the Country, were in full march to butcher thoſe under the protection of the City. In Conſequence of this intelligence, eight hundred men were put under arms, and ten pieces of cannon prepar'd. A Truce however enſued, and the <hi>Waywode,</hi> not only put up with the inſult, but meanly ſtoop'd to carreſs the rebels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay, he promis'd them an act of Indemnity, and engag'd to take them into high favor, if they wou'd turn their reſentment upon the Delegates of the Province, inſtead of himſelf. This they agreed to. The Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates had no way to ſave themſelves from deſtruction, and preſerve the Government from Anarchy but by appealing to the <hi>Emperor</hi> to be taken under his own protection, and reſcued from the oppreſſions of the Piſs— Brute—tarians, and the Tyranny of the <hi>Waywode,</hi> After this ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution at Court, all that were Rebels but a few days before, were now the Court Favorites; and thoſe, who had bravely and generouſly taken up arms to ſave his Excellency's wind-pipe from being ſever'd in a thouſand pieces, were look'd upon as Enemies to the Government. Such is the inſtability of Courts, and the wonderful Wiſdom of Miniſters of State! It is ſaid his Excellency's Muſical Inſtruments in the fray were all put out of tune, and that he has been diſconcerted ever ſince; be that as it will; a ſudden reſolution was taken to call a Council, wherein it was decreed, that there ſhou'd no Magiſtrates hold Commiſſions under the Government, who had ſhewn any Love for the <hi>Emperor;</hi> or was not a Piſs— Brute—tarian; or cou'd not play upon the Jew's harp.</p>
            <p>As I had the happineſs to be acquainted with Counſellor Wiſeman, a moſt accompliſh'd Gentleman, who had directed the Board for ten Years, with the greateſt integrity through all the political ſtorms, and tempeſts that had threatened the deſtruction of the Province, during the whole time by reaſon of a bloody war that had been carried on with the grand <hi>Turk,</hi> he took the firſt Opportunity after the Council broke up to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to me the ſubſtance of the rebate upon that important ſubject.</p>
            <p>His Excellency the <hi>Waywode,</hi> inform'd the Board, that he wou'd not have one Aſſert<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rian in the Commiſſion of the peace, or any other civil office throughout the Government, as they ſeem'd all tinctur'd with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious diſpoſition towards him and his family, and had transferr'd their Loyalty to the Emperor himſelf. That by their late proceedings, in chooſing ſuch men to repreſent them, who were his bitter Enemies, and in complaining to the <hi>Emperor</hi> againſt him, by which means he wou'd be look'd upon with an evil Eye at the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and either oblig'd to reſign his Government, or throw himſelf under the Protection of the grand <hi>Turk;</hi> therefore as they had thus ſhewn their malicious intentions againſt his Adminiſtration, they were no longer to be enrolled among the Number of his Friends. He alſo added, that thoſe of the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Religion had behav'd in ſuch a cold indifferent manner (a few in <hi>Weiſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> excepted) as plainly made it appear that they were as well affected to the <hi>Emperor</hi> as himſelf;— that their principles in Religion and the max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009703_0036_0F7A4516321019E0"/>
by which they and their Anceſtors were govern'd for one Thouſand Years, were peculiarly adapted to ſupport the <hi>Emperial Family</hi>— that theſe things being conſider'd, he cou'd not expect their firm attachment to his perſon, or their general concurrence to his meaſures; and therefore in good policy they ought not to be truſted at ſuch a critical conjuncture. He therefore deſir'd the Council to give their opinions, whether any other Sect were to be truſted as Magiſtrates in the Government, beſides the Piſs— Brute—tarians, a Sect whoſe principles have ever been diametrically oppoſite to Monarchy; and not only * <hi>ſworn</hi> Enemies to the <hi>Emperial</hi> Family, but murder'd one of the <hi>Emperors</hi> before his own palace; and have always been the foremaſt in all the Rebellions that have been rais'd againſt his Succeſſors ever ſince. He alſo ſaid, that there was a few of his Enemies, who have dared publickly to eſpouſe the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s cauſe, and whom he "mark'd" out for puniſhment; he wiſh'd it cou'd be with the loſs of their heads, inſtead of their Commiſſions. The Enemies were <hi>Pottonius, Paulinus, Mortonus,</hi> and <hi>Trumponius,</hi> the laſt he was ſome what ſorry for, as he ſuppos'd his Anceſtors were great Muſicians; for they had taken a name, to perpetuate the poſterity, by which ſome Nations call a Jews-Harp.</p>
            <p>The Generality of the Council heartily concurr'd with his Excellency the <hi>Waywode;</hi> but when it came to Counſellor <hi>Wiſeman</hi> to give his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he begg'd leave to diſſent from the reſt of the board; and hoped his Excellency wou'd with that attention and deliberation for which he was remarkable, hearken to his reaſons.</p>
            <p>He told his Excellency, he hoped he wou'd excuſe him, if he differ'd with him in ſome of the Political Obſervations he had juſt now made, and unto which Meſſieurs <hi>Simpleton, Prigg, Beau,</hi> and <hi>Brainleſs</hi> his Brother Counſellors had ſignified their approbation. He told him that as he had been but a ſhort time <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of the province he ought to uſe every method in his power to cultivate a good underſtanding with the people;—that that as a ſpirit of Freedom had drawn them from all Nations to populate ſuch an extenſive province, ſtripping them of their rights and privileges, was not the Way of either gaining the good opinion of thoſe who were wavering, or of bringing them back that were the moſt ſeditious; that tho' his Excellency was ſenſible, how little either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or the Council troubled themſelves about what was called Religion, yet (as he very well knew) there was a neceſſity of keeping up external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances; that it was a uſeful engine to keep the Vulgar in awe;—that if therefore he abandoned the profeſſion of it, he wou'd be held in univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal diſeſteem by all its Profeſſors —that if he appeared more Zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for one ſect than another, a general Jealouſy wou'd take place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, and perhap unite them all againſt him; that if this ſhou'd happen, the Piſs-Brute—tarians were not the tenth of his Subjects, and conſequently could not ſupport him againſt the other nine;—that if he made an impartial diſtribution of places of Profit and Honour in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and eſtabliſh'd them in all their equitable demands, the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:009703_0037_0F7A451864CA1358"/>
wou'd have no objection towards the continuing of him in his <hi>Vice-royalty;</hi> no complaints cou'd have any weight againſt him; his Character wou'd appear fair at Court, and perhaps ſave him the expence und trouble of a long Journey to defend himſelf.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Aſſertorians,</hi> the raking them into his favor, in imitation of many of his worthy Predeceſſors wou'd, perhaps, effectually regain their Friendſhip; make them drop the proſecution of their Appeal: and as they are above one fifth part of the Inhabitants, they are no contemptable body to diſoblige. <hi>Pottonius</hi> (who appears to be particularly ſingled out) is a Gentleman, who has remarkably diſtinguiſh'd himſelf this twenty Years paſt, for his Integrity, in faithfully diſcharging the Office of a Magiſtrate; his fortune places him above the fear of affection of Mankind, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of Juſtice; and therefore he does you Excellency as much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in accepting of the Commiſſion, as you can do him in giving it. As to thoſe of the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Religion, it is well known that two of their Prieſts, and a number of their People, who either hold Offices in reality under you, or live in expectation of them, in this Metrapolis, have gone greater lengths to ſerve you, than any other Sect among us in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,</p>
            <p>Have they not abandoned their former Principles, violated every obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation that was either civil of ſacred, or that bound them by the ties of Conſcience or honor to be faithful to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> in order to ſupport your Cauſe? Have they not proſtituted their Temple, (a place ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated for pious uſes) as an Amphitheatre for the Rabble to combat in? Has not their Altar been profaned by the unhallowed hands of Turks, Jews, Infidels and Piſs—Brute—tarians? And all this in favor of your Excellency?</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Paulinus, Mortonus,</hi> and others of the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Profeſſion, whoſe characters have been irreproachable, and whoſe Virtues have made them rever'd by their Country, ſhall they become the objects of your Excellency's diſapprobation for no other reaſon, than that they ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to have a regard for the <hi>Emperor,</hi> and cannot eaſily conquer their old prejudices in favor of the Emperial Court?—Time might bring them over as well as others; but ſuch raſh and precipitate meaſures, will create a Jealouſy throughout all all <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> as if your oppoſition to them was purely out of ſpite to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> for whom they wou'd be made a Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Your Attachment to the Piſs—Brute—tarians is ſomewhat remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as they have been the cauſe of all the trouble that has happen'd in the Government. Had there never been a Rebellion amongſt them here, your Excellency wou'd never have been brought into ſuch difficulties. Had the Traitors been puniſh'd according to their Demerit, there never wou'd have been an Appeal to <hi>Vienna.</hi> How then can you place your chief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in a ſect vvho have been the ſole cauſe of your misfortunes? Theſe invincible arguments ſtagger'd his Excellency; but being a Man of weak
<pb facs="unknown:009703_0038_0F7A4518C8EBF750"/>
Intellects, and abandon'd (like <note n="*" place="bottom">The laſt King of the Aſſyrian Empire, who for his extream Effeminacy was ſo diſdain'd by his own Captains, that they conſpired againſt him. When he ſaw himſelf ſo ſtraitned, that there was no eſcaping, he turned valiant and making a funeral pile of all his precious Things (Fiddles) he burnt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Palace, and went out in a blaze.</note> 
               <hi>Sardana palus</hi>) to wine, muſick and Wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men, was ſoon confirm'd in his former opinion, by his other Counſellors who told him, that all the People in the Province were a ſet of Villain but the Piſs—Brute—tarians and themſelves, and hop'd he wou'd govern himſelf accordingly. Thus the Council broke up. But I am afraid, I have trangreſs'd the bounds of a ſingle Letter, and have only tired your patience with ſome few hints about the Politicks of a Country, the name of which is ſcarcely known in <hi>America.</hi> You ſee by this how I improve my time in my Travels, and I hope to return to <hi>America</hi> equally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd with thoſe of my Countrymen who have made this Tour before me.
