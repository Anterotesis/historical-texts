            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The Gentleman ſaith that the Occaſion of his writing was ſome Deiſtical Papers la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in order to reſcue the Quakers from ſo unjuſt a Charge, I ſhall give the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a ſhort Detail of the Principles of a Deiſt; and then it will be requiſit of the Gentleman to prove that the Quakers are Deiſts, on whom the Reflections, in his Book are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrown, which if he ſhould fail to do, I hope he will be ſo juſt, to do as he has done before, <hi>viz.</hi> Recant</p>
            <p>The Deiſts deny <hi>Revealed Religion,</hi> viz. That God ever communicated the Knowledge of himſelf to Mankind by any ſupernatural Method: But the Quakers (the Gentleman himſelf confeſſes) contend for a Superior Dictator, <hi>viz. The Spirit of God:</hi> The Deiſts deny the Worſhip of God through Jeſus Chriſt, which the Quakers hold to be the only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Way of worſhiping him, with other Things very different from the Beleif of the Quakers; ſo that I am at a Loſs to know why the printing of a Deiſtical Paper ſhould provoke the Gentleman to quarrel with a People ſo different in Opininion from the Deiſts as the Quakers are.</p>
            <p>The firſt Eight or Nine Pages of his Book are ſpent, in proving. That which no Body hereabouts contradicts, <hi>viz. That the Chriſtian Revelation, is exellent, and neceſſary.</hi> But the Grand Queſtion in Debate, is, <hi>What this Chriſtian Revelation is, and how made known?</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:040110_0004_10162DB3B57F34A8"/>
which our Author ſeems to reſolve in Page <hi>10th,</hi> where he calls the Bible, <hi>The Rule of Faith, by which we ought to try our Opinions.</hi> And ſince the whole Tenor of his Book aims to confine all Religion to the Bible, and the external Ordinances therein contained. I ſhall endeavor to confute, by proving, That God has ſaved Mankind, and communicated the Knowledge of his Son ſufficient to Salvation without the Help of the Bible, or any of the external Ordinances therein mentioned; which if I ſhould do, I know not why the Bible it ſelf, and more eſpecialy the External Ordinances it contains, ſhould be enumerated among the Graces eſſential to Chriſtianity, on why thoſe who gratefully accept the Former as proceeded from the Spirit of God, and therefore underſtand it in a Spiritual Manner, although they diſallow the Uſe of the Latter; I ſay, I know not why they ſhould be loaded with falſe and odious Opinions to render them vile in the Sight of the World. In order to prove the abovementioned Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That God has communicated the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Son ſufficient to Salvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Bible, or any of the external Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances taught therein, it would be obvious for the Reader to ſearch the Origine thereof, which if he ſhould do, he will find no Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of it in the World, till about. Two Thouſand Four Hundred Years after the Creation; about which Time the Law was

to the <hi>Jews,</hi> all which Time, the moſt ſevere Formaliſt muſt grant that Mankind had no outward Revelation of the Will of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it appears by the Bible it ſelf, That Chriſt was taught, and the Goſpel preached, as by <hi>Noah,</hi> whom the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls <hi>A Preacher of Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.5. Likewiſe, by God himſelf, who the Apoſtle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Preached it to</hi> Abraham. And conſequently it muſt be the Goſpel that <hi>Noah</hi> preached, for Righteouſneſs, is not of the Law as the Scripture univerſally teſtifie. And it is evident that he had no Bible to inform him, or communicate the Knowledge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of to him; neither had the Prophets <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> after Times, any Dictator, but the Spirit of Chriſt, which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>was in them.</hi> And if we look into the Progreſs of the Bible, ſince its being compleated, <hi>viz.</hi> ſince Chriſt's Appearance upon Earth, viſibly, we ſhall find it confined to a ſmall Part of Mankind, with reſpect to thoſe who act without it, and among thoſe that act without it; we ſhall find many who never had an Opportunity of ſeeing it till lately, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the natural Inhabitants of this Continent, on which we now live, could not poſſibly have ſeen it till about Two Hundred Years ſince; And yet it would be contrary to the Bible it ſelf, to pronounce them all damned that died without that Opportunity, for Chriſt ſpeaking of the <hi>Jews,</hi> John 15.22. <hi>If I
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:040110_0005_10162DB5B65725E8"/>
had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had Sin; but now they have no Cloak for their Sin.</hi> and Verſe 24. <hi>If I had not done among them, the Works which no other Man did they had not had Sin.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Where no Law is, there is no Tranſgreſſion.</hi> So that it will inovitably follow, That the Nations that had no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſeeing the Scriptures could not have Sin if the Knowledge of Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Scriptures only: But then it will follow, That the ſame Scriptures that acquits them from Guilt, denys them Salvation, for the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other, for there is none other Name under Heaven given among Men whereby we may be ſaved.</hi> And Chriſt, in <hi>John,</hi> 1.36. ſaith, <hi>He that, believeth on the Son hath everlasting Life, but he be that believeth not on the Son ſhall not ſee Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> Therefore it muſt be granted, That if the Knowledge of Chriſt be communicated to Mankind by no other Method than by the Scriptures only, That thoſe which have no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſeen the Scriptures could not believe on him and ſo cannot be ſaved; and by what hath been ſaid already, it is manifeſt that they can not be damned; ſo that theſe People can neither be ſaved nor damned, according to the inconſiſtant Opinion of this Author, Therefore, I am at a loſs to know how the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:040110_0005_10162DB5B65725E8"/>
Author would diſpoſe of the greater Part or Mankind, without reviving again the <hi>Papiſtical Opinion</hi> of a Purgatory.</p>
            <p>If the Force of the above Argument be well weighed, it might ſerve for an effectual Anſwer to the Authors whole work, ſince the whole Scope of it tends to lay upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind an unneceſſary Burthen of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eedleſs Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, without the Obſervation of which, or even the Knowledge of the Latter of the Bible it ſelf Salvation may be obtained; and if ſo, By what Force of Reaſon? By what Divine Warrant do they confine the Almighty God to particular Methods of Salvation? And ſuch Methods too, as he himſelf ſaith he will ſave no Man by, <hi>viz. An outward Law of Works.</hi> Is it not more agreeable to the Nature of God and the Scope of the Scriptures to conclude with the Apoſtle <hi>Peter Acts</hi> 10.34, 35. <hi>Of a Truth I perceive God is no reſpecter of Perſons; but in every Nation he that feareth him and worketh Righteouſneſs is accepted with him,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus is the Doctrine of Chriſts being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Mankind without humane or external Aid, once and for ever eſtabliſhed. And tho' this Gentleman, with others, may think that the unovoidable Conſequences of the above Argument may tend to place the Bible a Degree lower in the Eſteem of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:040110_0006_10162DB83A7B0DD8"/>
Mankind; but ſuch I muſt take leave to tell that it is now ſet in the Place of God, by this Gentleman and his Adherents; for in it we are told That the Spirit of God co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habits with Juſt Men as, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</hi> And if ſo, Why ſhould we bring the Dictates of ſo divine an Inſtructor to the Bible for Proof. In a Word, it is nothing but to arraign God before his Works to prove whether he be God or no.</p>

               </gap>ake notice of his Doctrine of Satisfaction by the Blood of Chriſt; a Doctrine ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scriptures, and derogatory from the Honour of God, a Heap of Errors which his Carnal Conſtruction of the Scriptures has led him into, to confute which I ſhall only with Brevity ſay that God in proclaiming His Name, <hi>Exod,</hi> 34.6, 7. <hi>And the Lord paſſed by before him, and proclaimed, the Lord, the Lord God merciful gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and truth, keeping Mercy for Thouſands, forgiving Iniquitys and Tranſgreſſions,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay, That here God ſignifies himſelf to be a God that can forgive Sin, tho' this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaith he will not, until he has received Satisfaction, which is no Forgiveneſs at all And would it not likewiſe follow, That if the Doctrine of the Trinity be true (that

            <p>But the Gentleman, to prove this Matter conjures up an Argument that he will be puzzled to ſet aſide, although he thinks he has done it, which is, <q>That it was unjuſt for Chriſt, who was Righteous, to ſuffer for the Wicked;</q> "the Force of which he pretended<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:040110_0008_10162DBD300FD158"/>
Satisfaction muſt be Puniſhment: Then it muſt certainly follow, That God muſt delight in puniſhing the Innocent; for, whoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Man's Surety muſt make Satisfaction, and if the Satisfaction be ſuch, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever makes it muſt be made infinitly miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and that God has ſaid, as I have already poved, <hi>That non ſhall be puniſhed or made miſerable by him, but the Wicked.</hi> But his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Son in making Satisfaction is made miſerable, and puniſhed by him: It muſt certainly follow, That Guilt was found on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from Chriſt's ſubmiting to it: But I ſhall only make this ſhort Reply, That he may as well argue, the Perpetuity of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> and other Moſaick Ordinances, from Chriſt's of ſubmitting to them.</p>
            <p>But he tells us, That the Apoſtles prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed it, which is true, tho' not from Chriſt, but from <hi>John;</hi> for they baptiſed with water long before the Holy Spirit, or Chriſt's Baptiſm was given them; neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that he may as well enforce almoſt all the Ceremonies of the <hi>Jewiſh Law,</hi> from the Practice of the Apoſtles; as this of Water Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>The Charge given to baptize, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. Which the Gentleman calls, <hi>The great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> could never intend Water: Becauſe the Apoſtles would have needed no new Commiſſion to perform that which they had done before, and, That they baptiſed with Water before, appears from, <hi>John</hi> 4.2. Neither needed they any new Aſſiſtance to baptize with Water: But here Chriſt charged them not to depart from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> until
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:040110_0011_10162DC6215A25A0"/>
they were endued with Power from on high, that is, until they were baptiſed themſelves with the Holy Ghoſt, and not with Water: Therefore, it is obvious to believe, That ſince they received a new Commiſſion, and new Aſſiſtance, they received a new Baptiſm alſo; even that Baptiſm with which they were baptized with themſelves, before they could act in this Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>But the Gentleman ſaith, that Baptiſm cannot be underſtood as the Quakers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it; becauſe in the Text aforeſaid, <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Baptizing</hi> are both mentioned; but he miſtakes the Senſe, for if they are both mentioned, yet they are both included in the ſame Act; for Chriſt ſays, <hi>Teach all Nations, baptizing them.</hi> that is, in the Act of Teaching into the Name of the <hi>Father Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as the Words are truly rendered, and by the Name of Chriſt, we are to underſtand his Power or Authority, as in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>In my Name ye ſhall caſt out Devils.</hi> That is, in my Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Authority: So that without the Gentleman can prove That every Perſon dipt in Water is baptized into or ſeaſoned with the Power of the <hi>Father Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
