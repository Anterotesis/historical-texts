            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE art of exerciſing the faculty of thinking and reflecting upon every object that is ſeen, ought to conſtitute a material branch of a good education; but it requires the ſkill of a maſter's hand, to lead the minds of youth to the habit of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Dr. Watts ſays, that there are four methods of attaining knowledge. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, reading, converſation, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The firſt lies within the compaſs even of children, and from the early dawn of reaſon, they ſhould be accuſtomed to obſerve every thing with attention, that falls under their notice. A judicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor will find matter for a leſſon among thoſe objects, that are termed common or inſignificant. How little this is generally the caſe, may be collected from the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, not of children only, but ſometimes of youth, who, although they have attained a conſiderable degree of claſſical learning, are unacquainted either with the materials of thoſe things they daily uſe, or the meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of manufacturing them. The form and appearance of ſubſtances are ſo much
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:036664_0003_100A5F3BE05A3DE8"/>
changed by the effects of art, that it would be impoſſible for a mind, unprepared by inſtruction, to conceive the original mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of many things, that are in the moſt common uſe. Would any child ſuppoſe, that the cloth, of which her frock is made, is compoſed of the fibrous parts of a green plant; or that the paper upon which ſhe draws, is the ſame ſubſtance wrought into a different form; that the tranſparent glaſs, out of which ſhe drinks, was once a heap of ſand and aſhes; or that the ribbon ſhe wears is the produce of an inſect? The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the following little work, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the curioſity of young perſons on theſe ſubjects, by furniſhing information on a few of the moſt obvious. The form of dialogue has been adopted as beſt ſuited to convey inſtruction blended with amuſement; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous that it ſhould be read rather from choice than compulſion, and be ſought by my young readers as an entertainment, not ſhunned as a mere dry preceptive leſſon.</p>

                  <p>HOW happy are we, my dear ſiſter, to be bleſſed with ſuch parents, who devote ſo much time to our inſtruction and amuſement! with what tenderneſs do they liſten to our converſation, and improve every ſubject that ariſes to our advantage!</p>

                  <p>I am never ſo happy in any other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; they have the art of rendering inſtruction and ſtudy agreeable. Though I tenderly love my gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erneſs, I feel ſuch a ſuperior attachment to my mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, that I am not able to expreſs it; and I am ſure Mrs. Selwyn will not blame me for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſhe always adviſes me to look up to my father and mother as my beſt and kindeſt friends.</p>

                  <speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
                  <p>Mrs. Selwyn our worthy governeſs, is too wiſe and diſcreet to be jealous of our preferring our parents to every body; ſhe would ſooner direct us to regulate our affections properly, and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly give them the firſt place.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>CECILIA.</speaker>
                  <p>What bitter repentance do I feel, when I have done any thing to offend them, particularly when I am inattentive to their inſtruction! How comes it, Sophia, that I am ſo often idle, and my
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036664_0007_100A5F44B60D3C08"/>
thoughts wander from what I am about, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intend to be good?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
                  <p>You are very young, my dear, and mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma ſays that the habit of attention is difficult to form; but that by ſteadily endeavouring to fix our thoughts on one object we ſhall every day find it more eaſy; and though it may coſt us ſome pains at firſt, let us remember what we owe to the affectionate care of ſuch a mother, and give our whole attention, when ſhe condeſcends to inſtruct us.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>CECILIA.</speaker>
                  <p>I often pity poor Auguſt; ſhe has no mamma, and her governeſs ſeldom teaches her any thing but her regular leſſons.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
                  <p>I both love and pity her; ſhe is of a good diſpoſition, but has not received the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that we have; her papa is engaged in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and leaves her wholly to the care of her gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erneſs, who takes but little pains with her.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>CECILIA.</speaker>
                  <p>Let us deſire our parents to give as leave to invite her often to be preſent at our evening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations. Papa has promiſed to give us ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of various manufactures; all will be new to her, ſhe will be delighted, and it will be a means of ſupplying her with ſome of the inſtruction ſhe wants.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
                  <p>Mamma will be very willing, I dare ſay: ſhe takes pleaſure in doing good, and is never better pleaſed than when ſhe has an opportunity of improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young people.</p>

                  <speaker>CECILIA.</speaker>
                  <p>I long for the evening, when we are all to meet in the ſtudy. I wonder what will be the ſubject papa will have prepared for us. My brothers too are to be of the party, and when we have been ſeparated all day, it is ſuch a pleaſure to meet them, that I cannot ſay how delighted I am with the thoughts of it.</p>

                  <speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
                  <p>It is almoſt time to attend our writing maſter, and do not let us forget the terms of admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to theſe agreeable evening converſations; atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our leſſons in the day, and obedience to the commands of our dear mamma, are the only methods
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036664_0008_100A5F4639AC82D8"/>
of obtaining a ſeat in the ſtudy at night. Papa will not confine the ſubject of his lectures wholly to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufactures, but intends to explain the nature of the materials of what we wear and uſe, which will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently lead him to deſcribe objects of natural hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a ſtudy of which I am particularly fond.</p>

                  <p>The ſubſtance called whalebone, adheres to the upper jaw, and is formed of thin paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel laminae, called whiſkers; ſome of the longeſt are four yards in length; they are ſurrounded by long ſtrong hair, to guard the tongue from being hurt, and alſo to prevent the return of their food, when they diſcharge the water out of their mouth.</p>

                  <p>The common whale is the largeſt of all animals, of whoſe hiſtory we have any certain account; it is ſometimes found ninety feet long, and thoſe which inhabit the torrid zone are ſaid to be much larger. The ſize of the head is about one-third of the whole fiſh, the under lip is much broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the upper, which is narrow and oblong, the tongue is a ſoft, ſpongy, fat ſubſtance, ſometimes yielding five or ſix barrels of oil; the gullet or ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is very ſmall for ſo large an animal, not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four inches in width; but that is proportioned to the food it eats, which is a particular kind of ſmall

                  <p>There are many ſtrong reaſons that prevail with thouſands to undergo a life of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, toil, and danger. The neceſſity of earning a living, to which you, who are brought up in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of plenty, are ſtrangers, is one ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement.</p>

                  <speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
                  <p>But I would chuſe ſome eaſier employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a gardner has an agreeable life.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>But do you not reflect that all men cannot be gardeners; there is employment for but few in that line. Providence has wiſely endued mankind with as great a variety of inclinations and purſuits, as there is diverſity in their perſons; ſome ſhew a very early inclination for a ſea-life, that no danger can deter, or perſuaſions prevail with them to give up; which appears to be implanted for the purpoſe of providing the means of an intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the inhabitants of diſtant countries, by which each party may reap advantage by interchanging the ſuperfluous produce of diſtant climes, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the mutual good offices of love and kindneſs. But to return to the whale; it has two orifices in the middle of the head, through which it ſpouts water to a great height, and, when it is diſturbed or wounded, with a noiſe like thunder. Its eyes are not larger than thoſe of an ox, and placed at a great diſtance
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036664_0011_100A5F4EA4C0F368"/>
from each other. There is no fin on the back, but on the ſides, under each eye are two large ones which ſerve it for rowing. The colour varies, the back of ſome being red, others black, and another variety is mottled; the belly is generally white. They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely beautiful in the water; the ſkin is very ſmooth and ſlippery. Under the ſkin the whale is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with fat or blubber, from ſix to twelve inches thick, which ſometimes yields from one to two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred barrels of oil. All Europe is ſupplied with oil for lamps, and many other purpoſes, from this blub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The fleſh is red and coarſe, ſomewhat like beef; the Greenlanders eat it, and the Icelanders ſoak it in ſour whey.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>It muſt be very diſagreeable food. I ſhould think, the oil would make it very greaſy and ſtrong.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>So it does: but the poor people, who live in countries ſo far north, have but little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of meat to tempt their appetite. In winter, as your mother has already remarked, the ground is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſnow, and affords no vegetation but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle moſs, which is found on the bodies of trees, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the larger animals, ſuch as cattle, &amp;c. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt there. The reindeer is peculiar to thoſe parts, and ſupplies his maſter with a ſcanty proviſion during that dreary ſeaſon; but as they are valuable for many other purpoſes, they are unwilling to kill them, but from neceſſity; the fleſh of the whale is therefore reckoned a dainty, which may afford us a leſſon, to be contented with beef and mutton, and to diſcourage that ſpirit of gluttony and ſenſual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, that prevails too glaringly at the tables of the rich, who are ſeldom ſatisfied with one or two plain diſhes, but cover their tables with a profuſion, that invites a falſe appetite, and waſtes the good things that are provided for our uſe.</p>

                  <p>Do whales ever ſtray ſo far from their uſual haunts, as to be found on our coaſts? it would give me great pleaſure to ſee one.</p>

                  <p>There have been inſtances of a few, that have been left at low water on ſhore, but they occur but ſeldom; when it happens, they are called royal fiſh, and become the property of the king and queen. Notwithſtanding its vaſt ſize, the whale ſwims ſwiftly, and generally againſt the wind. The female brings but one, or at moſt two young ones at a time, which are nine or ten feet long; they ſuckle their young, and if purſued, ſhew the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſolicitude for the preſervation of their offspring, as land animals, by wrapping them up in their fins cloſe to their bodies.</p>

                  <p>Yes; Spermaceti is prepared from the oil that is found in the head of a whale. It is melted over a gentle fire, and put into moulds, like thoſe wherein ſugar loaves are formed; when cold and drained, it is taken out, and melted over again, till it be well purified and whitened; it is then cut with a knife into flakes, and is uſed as a medicine for various complaints of the lungs; it is alſo uſed for making candles, which are but little inferior to thoſe made of wax.</p>

                  <p>The fleet uſually ſets ſail about the beginning of April, and ſteers northward, till they reach about the 75th degree of north latitude, where they uſually begin to meet with the ice. It is among theſe huge heaps of ice, that float about in theſe ſeas, that they find the whale, and there moſt of the veſſels take their ſtation for the fiſhing. In the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036664_0013_100A5F5323A722E0"/>
Engliſh whale fiſhery, every ſhip has ſix or ſeven boats belonging to it, each of which has one har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pooner, one man to ſteer, one to manage the line, and four ſeamen to row it; each boat is provided with two or three harpoons, ſeveral lances, and ſix lines faſtened together, each one hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fathoms long. To each harping iron is faſtened a ſtrong ſtick, about ſix feet long, and a ſoft pliable line of as many fathoms, called the fore gauger, which is faſtened to the lines in the boat. The inſtrument with which the whale is ſtruck, is a harping iron, or jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, pointed with ſteel, in a triangular ſhape, like the barb of an arrow.

If the whale return for air to breathe, the harpooner takes the opportunity to give him a freſh wound, till fainting by loſs of blood, from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated wounds, the men ſeize that moment for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching him, and thruſting a long ſteel lance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his gills, into his breaſt, and through the inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, ſoon diſpatch him.

                  <p>You will do right; for a Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land whale catcher is a much more valuable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſociety, than an idle man of fortune, who lives on the labours of others. In order to take the blub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or fat, from which they procure the oil, and the fins, as they are called, or whalebone, ſeveral men get upon the fiſh, equipped with a kind of iron caulkers or ſpurs, to prevent their ſlipping, and cut off the tail, which is hoiſted on deck, and then cut ſquare pieces of blubber, weighing two or three thouſand pounds, which are hoiſted on board with the capſtan, where each piece is again divided into ſmaller pieces, of two or three hundred pounds weight, then theſe are thrown into the hold, and left for a few days to drain. When all the blubber is cut from off the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the fiſh, it is turned on one ſide, by means of a piece of blubber, left in the middle, called the cant or turning piece: thus they are cut out the ſides in large pieces, which they call hockies. The next operation is to cut out the two large jaw bones, ſituated in the under lip, which when hoiſted on deck, are cleanſed, and faſtened to the ſhrouds, with tubs placed under them to catch the oil which they diſcharge. The carcaſe is left to float, and ſupplies food for Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land birds, called mallemuck, &amp;c. After the pieces of blubber have lain a few days in the hold, they hoiſt them on deck, cut them into ſmall pieces, and put them through the bung holes into their caſks; one of the largeſt fiſh will fill more than ſeventy butts. The produce of a good large whale is valued at about one thouſand pounds. When thus richly laden, they begin to ſail homewards with their ſpoil:
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036664_0015_100A5F57F6E45288"/>
on their return, the fat is to be boiled, and melted down into train-oil. The whale fiſhery begins in May, and continues through the months of June and July. Whether the ſhips are ſucceſsful or not, they muſt come away, and get clear of the ice before the end of Auguſt.</p>

                  <p>I am glad to hear you were pleaſed with laſt night's converſation; it is a proof that your minds are capable of reliſhing national amuſement. An early habit of trifling is difficult to be ſubdued, and ſhould be carefully avoided; thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands are rendered unhappy by it; for having never been accuſtomed to exerciſe their faculties, as they grow up, they find every thing fatiguing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires reflection, and as the mind cannot reſt wholly inactive, they fly from one trifling, uſeleſs purſuit, to another; always tired of themſelves, and rendering no benefit to others; but a well-regulated mind is marked by the judicious diſpoſal of time, converting even amuſement into inſtruction. Nature and art preſent ſo many objects, calculated to amuſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, that none but the idle need want a ſucceſſion of employment.</p>

As ſoon as my leſſons are over, and nothing can be more tireſome than they are, I am without employment, and wander about

                  <p>Perhaps it will not be ſo eaſy, at firſt, as you imagine; ill habits are difficult to ſurmount; but by degrees it will become familiar, and in time agreeable. In the firſt place, never be unemployed; read, draw, work, walk, and accuſtom yourſelf to obſerve every thing you ſee with attention; conſider how they are made, what the materials are, and from whence they come. If you are unable to diſcover the anſwers, keep a little book, and make a memorandum of what you want to know, and we will endeavour to give you information. This alone will fill many an hour, that now paſſes tediouſly away.</p>

                  <p>I thank you for theſe directions, and will begin to-morrow; but I have hindered Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court from begining his account of the cod.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>The cod is a fiſh of paſſage, and is found from eighteen inches to three or four feet long, with a great head, and teeth in the bottom of the throat, its fleſh white, its ſkin browniſh on the back, and covered with a few tranſparent ſcales. It eats excellent, when freſh; and if well prepared and ſalted, will keep a long time. Salt-fiſh or ſtock-fiſh, commonly eaten in lent, is cod thus prepared. There are two kinds of ſalt cod, the one called green or white, the other dried or cured. The moſt eſſential thing in the green cod fiſhery, is the ſkill of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036664_0018_100A5F5F8F7CF358"/>
employed to open the fiſh, to cut off the heads, and to ſalt them, upon which laſt the ſucceſs of the voyage chiefly depends. The principal fiſhery for cod is on the banks of Newfoundland, in North-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica; and the beſt ſeaſon, from the beginning of February to the end of April, when the cod, which during the winter, had retired to the deepeſt part of the ſea, return to the bank, and grow very fat. Each fiſher takes but one cod at a time, yet the more experienced will catch from three hundred and fifty, to four hundred every day. This is a very fatiguing employment, both on account of the weight of the fiſh, and the extreme cold which reigns on the bank. They ſalt the cod on board. The head being cut off, the belly opened, and the guts taken out, the ſalter ranges them in the bottom of the veſſel, head to tail, and having thus made a layer of them, a fathom or two ſquare, he covers them with ſalt, over this he places another layer of fiſh, which he covers as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and thus he diſpoſes all the fiſh of that day, taking care never to mix the fiſh of different days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. By the time they have lain three or four days thus to drain, they are removed into another part of the veſſel, and ſalted again: then they are left untouched till the ſhip has got its load, unleſs they put them in barrels for the conveniency of room.</p>

                  <p>The curing and taking of cod muſt be leſs diſagreeable and dangerous than whale-catching. I had no idea that the catching of fiſh alone employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo many men.</p>

The ſmalleſt domeſtic accommodation is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not to be had, without the aſſiſtance of ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al hands; a pin or needle, for inſtance, employs a great number of workmen, before they are brought to the degree of perfection in which we receive them. And the ſupply of a common table, if we conſider the reſources from which it is drawn, moſt probably em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys

                  <p>In the fiſhing for dry cod, veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of various ſizes are uſed, though ſuch are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally choſen as have large holds, becauſe this kind of fiſh encumbers more than it burthens. As cod can only be dried by the ſun, the European veſſels are obliged to put out in March or April, in order to have the benefit of the ſummer for drying. Indeed the Engliſh ſend veſſels for cod later, but they only purchaſe of the inhabitants what had been caught and prepared before hand. In exchange for which, we carry them meal, brandies, biſcuits, pulſe, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes, linen, &amp;c. The fiſh choſen for this purpoſe, though the ſame ſpecies as the green cod, is yet much ſmaller. As ſoon as the captains arrive, they unrig all the veſſels, leaving nothing but the ſhrouds to ſuſtain the maſts; and, in the mean while, the mates provide a tent on ſhore, covered with branches of fir, and ſails over them, with a ſcaffold, fifty or ſixty feet long, and about one third as broad. While the ſcaffold is making ready, the crew are fiſhing, and as faſt as they catch, they bring their fiſh, open them, and ſalt them on moveable benches; but the main ſalting is performed on the ſcaffold, called flake. When the fiſh have taken ſalt, they waſh them, and lay them on piles, on the galleries of the ſcaffold, to drain again; when ſufficiently drained, they are ranged on hurdles, a fiſh thick, head againſt tail, with the back uppermoſt; obſerving, while they lie thus, to turn and ſhift them four times every twenty-four hours. When they begin to dry, they lay them in heaps of ten or twelve a piece, to retain their warmth, and continue to enlarge the heap eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, till it becomes double its firſt bulk. At length they join two of theſe heaps into one, which they turn every day as before; laſtly, ſalt them over again, beginning with thoſe that had been ſalted firſt, and in this ſtate lay them in huge piles, as big as hay-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036664_0020_100A5F652625F5F0"/>
and thus they remain till they are carried on ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ip board, where they are laid on branches of trees, diſpoſed for that purpoſe, in the bottom of the veſſel, with mats around them, to prevent their contracting any moiſture. There are four kinds of commodities drawn from cod; the ſounds, which is a jelly like ſubſtance, that covers the inſide of the main bone, and the tongues are ſalted at the ſame time with the fiſh, and barrelled up for eating. The roes or eggs being ſalted and barrelled, are uſeful to caſt into the ſea, to draw fiſh together, particularly pilchards; and laſtly the oil, which is uſed in dreſſing of leather; and thus, by the art and ingenuity of man, every part of this fiſh, that can be ſerviceable is put to uſe; and by his ſkill in curing and drying it, a large ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of wholeſome proviſion is preſerved, which muſt otherwiſe be loſt. Nor is this care beſtowed on the cod alone; the herring ſupplies food to vaſt numbers of families, eſpecially the poorer ſort, to whom they are a great relief, when other proviſions are dear; but perhaps you are all tired of this ſubject, and wiſh to hear no more concerning the catching of fiſh; if that be not the caſe, the herring, though a ſmall fiſh, will furniſh us with wonders almoſt as extraordinary as the whale.</p>

About the beginning of June, a ſhoal of herrings, in bulk not leſs than the whole extent of Great-Britain and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, comes from the north, on the ſurface of the ſea; their approach is known to the inhabitants of Shetland (an iſland to the north of Scotland) by ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral

They caſt their ſpawn, when they arrive in theſe ſeas, for they come to us full, and are ſhotten long before they leave us. The great ſhoal divides into columns of five or ſix miles in length, and three or four in breadth, reflecting, in bright weather, as they paſs, many ſplendid colours.</p>

                  <p>The herring is a ſmall ſalt-water fiſh, with a bluiſh back, and a white ſilvered belly. It is commonly ſaid that nobody ever ſaw a herring alive, they die ſo immediately on being taken out of the water; but there have been inſtances to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. By what I have already told you, you will perceive that the herring is a fiſh of paſſage; they go chiefly in ſhoals, and are fond of following any fire or light; indeed, as they paſs, they reſemble a kind of lightning themſelves, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

is ſimple; there are two ways of doing it, the one makes white or pickled herring, the other what is called red herring. The white or pickled herring is prepared by cutting open and gutting the fiſh, as ſoon as it is taken out of the water, but the milts and roes are always left in; they are then waſhed in freſh water, and left for twelve or fifteen hours in a tub full of ſtrong brine, made of freſh water and ſea ſalt. They are then taken out and drained, and when well drained, put up in barrels, diſpoſed evenly in rows or layers, preſſed well down, and a layer of ſalt ſtrewed over them at top and bottom. After waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gutting, and ſalting the fiſh, as above, when they intend to make them red herrings, they ſtring them by the head on little wooden ſpits, and hang them in a kind of chimney, made for the purpoſe, and when the chimney is filled, which generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ten or twelve thouſand fiſh, they make a fire underneath of bruſh-wood, which yields much ſmoke, but no flame, which moſtly dries them ſufficiently in twenty-four hours; they are then barrelled for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Theſe are the moſt important fiſheries, and employ by far the greateſt number of people; though there are many poor men who live on the ſea coaſts, whoſe ſcanty ſubſiſtence depends on the dangerous and precarious employment of fiſhing; a little boat is their chief treaſure, in which they venture out in rough and boiſterous weather, when the preſſing wants of their family urge them to the undertaking.</p>

                  <p>Salmon, and perhaps many other kinds of fiſh, ſeem abſolved, by the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from the ſedulous attention in rearing their young, that is requiſite in birds and terreſtrial ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; their chief care is to provide for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the eggs, by depoſiting them in a ſuitable place, and after they have performed that office, they appear to have no further thought about them. Strangers to the pleaſing ſolicitude of parental fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they may with propriety be ranked in an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſcale of exiſtence to the beautiful feathered race, whoſe tenderneſs and patient care may ſerve as mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to careleſs mothers, who neglect their offspring, from indolence, or a love of other purſuits.</p>

                  <p>When I was at Ballyſhannon, I paſſed ſeveral hours in watching the fiſh leap up the caſcade, and it is hardly credible, but to thoſe who have been eye-witneſſes, that they ſhould be able to dart themſelves near fourteen feet perpendicularly out of the water; and, allowing for the curvature, they leap at leaſt twenty. They do not always ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed at the firſt leap; ſometimes they bound almoſt to the ſummit, but the falling water daſhes them down again; at other times they dart head foremoſt, or ſide-long upon a rock, remain ſtunned for a few moments, and then ſtruggle into the water again; whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> they are ſo ſucceſsful as to reach the top, they ſwim out of ſight in a moment. They do not bound from the ſurface of the water, and it cannot be known from what depth they take their leap; it is probably performed by a forcible ſpring with their tails bent; for the chief ſtrength of moſt fiſh lies in the tail. They have often been ſhot, or caught with ſtrong barbed hooks fixed to a pole, during their flight, as it may be termed; and inſtances have been known of women catching them in their aprons. At high water, the fall is hardly three feet, and then the fiſh ſwim up that eaſy acclivity without leaping. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have ſeen at low water fifty or ſixty of theſe leaps in an hour, and at other times only two or three. I placed myſelf on a rock on the brink of the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade, ſo that I had the pleaſure of ſeeing the ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing efforts of theſe beautiful fiſh cloſe to me; and at the bottom of the fall, porpoiſes and ſeals tumbling and playing among the waves; and ſometimes a ſeal carries off a ſalmon under his fins.</p>

The fiſh was large and ſtrong, and ſtruggled to eſcape from his hold; but after a pretty ſmart conteſt, the boy came off victorious, and brought his antagoniſt ſafe to land.</p>

                  <p>It was an object to which I paid particular attention. It is ſituated at the northern extremity of the iſland. It conſiſts of about thirty thouſand natural pillars, moſtly in a perpendicular ſituation. At low water the cauſeway is about ſix hundred feet long, and probably runs far into the ſea, as ſomething ſimilar is obſerved on the oppoſite coaſt of Scotland. It is not known whether the pillars are continued under ground, like a quarry. They are of different dimenſions, being from fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen to twenty-ſix inches in diameter, and from fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen to thirty-ſix feet in height: their figure is gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally pentagonal or hexagonal. Several have been found with ſeven, and a few with three, four, and eight ſides, of irregular ſizes; every pillar conſiſts
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036664_0028_100A5F7580F3FCF0"/>
as it were of joints or pieces, which are not united by flat ſurfaces; for on being forced off, one of them is concave in the middle, and the other convex, many of theſe joints lie looſe upon the ſtrand. The ſtone is a kind of beſaltes, of a cloſe grit, and of a duſky hue; it is very heavy, each joint generally weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two hundred and a half. It clinks like iron, melts in a forge, breaks ſharp, and by reaſon of its extreme hardneſs, blunts the edges of tools, and by that means is rendered incapable of being uſed in building. The pillars ſtand very cloſe to each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and though the number of their ſides differ, yet their contextures are ſo nicely adapted, as to leave no vacuity between them, and every pillar retains its own thickneſs, angles, and ſides, from top to bottom. Theſe kinds of columns are continued, with inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, for near two miles along the ſhore. By its magnitude and unuſual appearance, it forms altogeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er an object of great rarity, and is moſtly viſited by all ſtrangers, who have any curioſity.</p>

                  <p>This is a wonderful account. It ſeems to be one of thoſe productions of nature that may be termed an unique. I know of nothing ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to it. I met with a paſſage, laſt night, in Collin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Hiſtory of Somerſet, though not immediately referring to the ſubject before us, that I cannot reſiſt the pleaſure of repeating. It is concerning a pecul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iar property of the limpet (a ſpecies of ſhell-fiſh,) that is found at Minehead in that county; that contains a liquor curious for marking linen. When the ſhell is picked off, there will appear a white vein lying tranſverſely in a little furrow next the head of the fiſh, which may be taken out by a bodkin, or any other pointed inſtrument. The letters or figures made with this liquor will preſently appear of a light green col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and if placed in the ſun, will change into the following colours; if in winter, about noon; if in ſummer, an hour or two after ſun-riſing; and ſo much before ſetting; for in the heat of the day in ſummer, it will come on ſo faſt, that the ſucceſſion of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036664_0029_100A5F7810B4AC20"/>
each colour will ſcarcely be diſtinguiſhed. Next to the firſt light green, it will appear of a deep green, and in a few minutes change to a full ſea green; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, in a few minutes more, it will alter to a blue, then to a purpliſh red: after which, lying an hour or two, (if the ſun ſhines) it will be of a deep purple red, beyond which the ſun does no more. But this laſt beautiful colour, after waſhing in ſcald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water and ſoap, will, on being laid out to dry, be a fair bright crimſon, which will abide all future waſhing. This ſpecies of limpets are, ſome red, oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers white, black, yellow, brown, and ſand colour, and ſome are ſtriped with white and brown parallel lines.</p>

Common ſalt, uſed for ſeaſoning and preſerving meat, fiſh, &amp;c. is one of the moſt uſeful neceſſaries of life; and is of three kinds, viz. foſſile, or rock ſalt; ſea, or marine ſalt; and ſpring ſalt. Foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſile, or rock ſalt is found in large beds, or ſtrata, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bowels of the earth, ſometimes cryſtallized, but more frequently in irregular maſſes of red, yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or blue colour.</p>

                  <p>All ſalt becomes white by grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There are mines of rock-ſalt in various parts of the world; they are found in Poland, Hungary, Germany, Italy, Spain, and England; as well as in ſome other countries in Europe. I ſhall confine myſelf to deſcribe the manner of procuring this kind of ſalt, before I ſay any thing of the other ſorts. The account of the Poliſh mines, in the village of Wiliſka, five leagues from Cracow, the capital of Poland, which were diſcovered in the year 1251, will furniſh us with an idea of them, that will ſerve for a deſcription of ſalt mines in general. Their depth and capacity are ſurpriſing. Within them exiſts a kind of ſubterraneous republic, or common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which has its policy, laws, families, &amp;c. nay, even public roads, for horſes and carriages, are kept here, for the purpoſe of drawing the ſalt to the mouth of the quarry, where it is taken up by engines. Theſe horſes, when they are once down, never ſee the light again; but the men take frequent occaſions.

of breathing the freſh air. What aſtoniſhment muſt a traveller feel, on arriving at the bottom of this wonderful abyſs, where ſo many people are interred alive, and numbers of them even born there, that have never ſeen day light. The firſt thing that ſtrikes him with ſurpriſe, is a long ſeries of vaults, ſuſtained by huge pilaſters cut with the chiſſel out of the rock ſalt, reſembling ſo many cryſtals, or precious ſtones of various colours, reflecting a luſtre from the light of the flambeaux, which are continually burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men he will find employed in hewing the rocks of ſalt, in form of huge cylinders, uſing hammers, pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axes, and chiſſels, much as in our ſtone quarries, in order to ſeparate the ſeveral banks. As ſoon as the maſſive pieces are got out of the quarry, they break them into fragments proper to be thrown into the mill, where they are ground, and reduced into a coarſe farina, or flour, which ſerves all the purpoſes of ſea-ſalt.</p>

                  <p>The other kind is leſs compact, and ſuitable only for kitchen uſes. The colour of the ſalt, while in the maſs, is a little browniſh; and yet, when ground, it becomes as white as if it had been refined. Some of theſe maſſes are found as hard and tranſparent as cryſtal; ſome white, yellow, blue, and fit for various works of taſte, in which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave as on precious ſtones. The mine is cold and moiſt, which cauſes ſome difficulty in reducing the ſalt into powder. They make a blackiſh ſalt of the water drawn out of it, which ſerves to fatten cattle. The ſalt mines of Catalonia are found in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Duchy of Cordona; they form a ſolid mountain of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This prodigious mountain of ſalt, which has no mixture of other matter with it, is eſteemed a great natural curioſity, and has raiſed a doubt among naturaliſts, whether ſalt does not vegetate or grow. To give you an imperfect idea of the quantities of ſalt produced annually, it is ſaid, that one of the Norwich pits, which is in Cheſhire, has yielded, at a medium, four thouſand tons of ſalt in a year. The ſalt is eſteemed unfit for domeſtic uſes, in its natural ſtate; and therefore they uſe the method practiſed in Poland, Hungary, and many other places, on the coarſer rock ſalt; they refine it, by diſſolving it in weak brine, and then boiling it into ſalt again. The works, where the rock ſalt is refined, are called Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies. The rock ſalt is broken ſmall, and put into leaded ciſterns, where it is diſſolved in cold ſea-water, when the ſolution has ſtood a day and night to ſettle, it is drawn off from the ſediment into the ſalt-pan, and refined into ſalt in the ſame manner that common ſalt is boiled up. The ſcratch or calcarious matter falling from it, forms a cruſt on the ſides of the ciſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern. They are careful not to waſte the brine leſt in the pans after the ſalt is taken out, but add it to the next quantity put into the pan, and ſo on to the end
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036664_0035_100A5F853509D9B0"/>
of the works. I cannot diſmiſs the ſubject of rock ſalt, without mentioning the iſland of Toongming, in the Eaſt-Indies, which affords the moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kind of foſſile, or native dry ſalt, in the world. The country is, in general, very fruitful, but in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain parts of the iſland there are ſpots of ground, of ſeveral acres, which appear wholly barren, yielding not the leaſt appearance of any thing vegetable on them. Theſe ſpots of ground taſte very ſalt, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with ſalt in ſuch a manner, as not only to ſupply the whole iſland, but a great part of the neighbouring continent.</p>

                  <p>When the inhabitants perceive the ground become dry, and covered with white ſpangles, which are pieces of ſalt, they are ſufficiently aſſured that this is a proper place to dig for that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity. It is very remarkable that the ſame pieces of land, which produce vegetables one year, will produce this ſalt another; and on the contrary, the ſalt parts will, ſome ſeaſons, be covered with vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſalt work in this iſland is of great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the inhabitants, and ſupplies all the poor, during the ſeaſon, with employment. The men are occupied in collecting the ſalt and wetting the earth, and the women in boiling up the water, which they attend as carefully as the men. The ſecond kind of ſalt is marine or ſea ſalt, which is made from ſea wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thickened by repeated evaporation, and at length cryſtallized.</p>

The ſalt, thus deprived of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, cryſtallizes, or hardens, and ſhoots into cryſtals,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:036664_0036_100A5F8816E3B208"/>
ſuch as I ſhewed you the other day in the microſcope. Opake ſtones, pyrites, and minerals, when regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formed, are ſaid to be cryſtallized; as well as tranſparent ſtones and ſalts. Ice will give you the idea of a complete cryſtallization, compoſed of long needle-like maſſes, flattened on one ſide, and joined together in ſuch a manner, that the ſmaller are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted into the ſides of the greater. The cryſtals of different kinds of ſalts afford great variety and beauty of forms, and are curious objects of microſcopic ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. The regularity of their figure, each dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſubſtance producing a form appropriate to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is a confirmation, that not only the more obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous works of nature, but alſo the internal ſtructure of organized bodies, are formed with the ſame har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, order, and beauty, that characterize the other parts of the creation. Marine ſalt is prepared by boiling ſea-water. The ſalt-works are erected near the ſea, in order to afford an opportunity of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſalt-water into them by pipes, which is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards boiled in pans of an immenſe ſize. It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to have the roofs of wood faſtened with wooden pegs, as the effluvia, which evaporates from the boiling pans, ruſts, and deſtroys iron in a very little time. Whilſt boiling, they purify it with whites of eggs, or ſometimes the blood of ſheep or oxen is uſed for the ſame purpoſe. The ſaline liquor which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains from the making of ſalt, is called bittern, and is uſed for medicinal purpoſes.</p>

                  <p>I think we may obſerve in the proceſs of ſalt, as well as many other things, that nature provides materials for man's ingenuity and induſtry to work upon; nay, ſhe supplies us with few things, that does not require ſome labour to render them ſuitable for our uſe.</p>

life. Much has already been diſcovered, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps lies ſtill behind; the field is vaſt, and may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply uſeful and intereſting occupation for many ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding generations of men. The third, and laſt mind of ſalt, is prepared in much the ſame manner as marine ſalt, from the water of ſalt-wells and ſprings, and is called brine, or fountain ſalt. The whiteſt, drieſt, and fineſt grained ſalt is ſometimes made up in form of ſugar loaves, in ſmall wicker baſkets. In preparing baſket ſalt, they uſe reſin, and other addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to break the grain, and render it very ſmall; and, to finiſh the proceſs, it is dried in ſtoves. Great quantities of brine or ſpring ſalt are made in moſt of the inland countries, as in Germany, Switzerland, Hungary, and in ſome parts of France and England. Lakes of this kind are found in the Podolian deſert, near the river Boryſthenes; on the Ruſſian frontiers, towards Crim Tartary; in the kingdom of Algiers; and in other countries. Where nature does not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply theſe lakes or ponds, artificial ones may be made. This is annually done very advantageouſly in France, where the chief coaſts for bay-ſalt, are thoſe of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne, Saintonge, and the Pay d'Aunts. In order to make a ſaline, or ſalt-marſh, a low plot of ground muſt be choſen adjoining to the ſea, and diſtant from the mouths of large rivers; and to render it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, it ſhould be near ſome convenient harbour for veſſels. The ground thus choſen, muſt be hollowed out to three ponds or receptacles. The firſt, into which the ſea-water is admitted, may be called the reſervoir; the ſecond receptacle, which is to be again divided into three diſtinct ponds, communicating with each other by narrow paſſages, and containing brine of different degrees of ſtrength, may be called the brine-ponds; and the third receptacle, is to be furniſhed with an entrance, between which and the brine-ponds, there is to run a long narrow winding channel, the reſt of it is to be divided into ſmall pits, containing a very ſtrongly ſaturated brine, which is to be converted into ſalt, and they may therefore
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:036664_0038_100A5F8C92CF0870"/>
properly be called the ſalt-pits. The firſt receptacle muſt communicate with the ſea, by a ditch, defended by walls; the ditch ſhould have a flood-gate to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, retain, or let out the ſea-water, as occaſion may require. The bottoms of the reſervoir, or brine-ponds, are to be lined with any kind of tough clay, or earth, that will hold water. The proper ſeaſon for making ſalt in theſe artificial ſalinae, is from May to the end of Auguſt. When the ſalt-men open the flood-gate, at the time the tide is out, to drain off all the ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating water, and after repairing and cleanſing the receptacles from mud and dirt, they admit the ſea-water, at the next high tide, till it floats the whole marſh, and ſtands at a proper height in the reſervoir. In a few days, moſt of the water, in the ſalt-pits, is exhaled by the power of the ſun, and what remains is a very ſtrong brine. They daily ſupply themſelves with more ſalt-water, in proportion to what is exhaled by the ſun, and the workmen draw out the cryſtals or ſalt, as they are formed every day, and diſpoſe them in a pyramidical heap, which they cover over at the top with thatch or ſtraw, to preſerve it from the injuries of the weather. Thus, at a ſmall expence and trouble, a ſalt is prepared, very fit for all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic uſes; and France, eſpecially, is furniſhed with a very profitable article for exportation. The uſes of common ſalt are various and extenſive. Its acid and alkali are employed in many chemical oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations in the arts. It is an important ingredient in the fuſion of glaſs, which it whitens and purifies. It facilitates the fuſion of the metallic parts of minerals; and its peculiar uſe in preſerving meat, &amp;c. and giving a poignancy to the taſte of various kinds of food, is univerſally known. Common ſalt is alſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as a manure, by contributing to fertilize the ſoil.</p>

                  <p>The Beaver is about four feet in length, and twelve or fifteen inches broad; his ſkin in the northern regions is generally black; but it brightens into a reddiſh hue, in the temperate climates. He is covered with two ſorts of hair, one long, and the other a ſoft down; the latter, which is an inch in length, is extremely fine and compact, and furniſhes the animal with a neceſſary degree of warmth, the long hair preſerves the down from dirt and wet. The head is like that of the otter, but longer, the ſnout is pretty long, the eyes ſmall, the ears ſhort, round and hairy on the outſide, but ſmooth within, and the teeth very long, the under teeth project the breadth of three fingers, and the upper, half a finger, all of which are broad, crooked, ſtrong and ſharp; beſides thoſe teeth, which are called inciſors, which grow double, are ſet very deep in their jaws, and bend like the edge of an axe; they have ſixteen grinders, eight on each ſide, four above, and four below, directly oppoſite to each other. With the former, they are able to cut down trees of a conſiderable ſize; with the latter, to break the hardeſt ſubſtances; the legs
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:036664_0041_100A5F932FF1AE80"/>
are ſhort, the fore-legs not exceeding four or five inches in length, the fore-paws are formed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like the human hand. Theſe feet ſerve the beaver to dig, ſoften, and work the clay for different purpoſes, the hind feet are furniſhed with membranes, or large ſkins, extending between the toes, like thoſe of ducks, and other water-fowl; the tail is long, a little flat, entirely covered with ſcales, ſupplied with muſcles, and perpetually moiſtened with oil or fat, which the creature diſtributes all over them with his ſnout, and which he procures from ſour bags, which are placed under the inteſtines, and are found in ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery beaver, whether male or female. Theſe bags are filled with a reſinous liquid ſubſtance, which, when it is ejected, ſettles into a thick conſiſtence. Phyſicians call it caſtoreum, and preſcribe it as an excellent remedy againſt poiſons, vapours, and other maladies, but when it grows old, it blackens, and degenerates into a dangerous poiſon.</p>

                  <p>Before Sophia relates the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and occupations of this creature, let us give par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention to the implements with which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has furniſhed it. The form and ſtrength of the teeth are ſuited to cutting of wood and hard ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and we have already been told that with theſe they are able to fell trees; the fore-paws are adapted to handling and diſpoſing the materials of the work; the hind-feet are formed for ſwimming, and evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew that the creature is intended to live in both elements, and is what is called an amphibious animal: the tail, from its flatneſs, and the hardneſs of its ſcales, may ſerve very well for a hod, ſuch as bricklayers uſe for carrying mortar, &amp;c. And now, Auguſta, do you think it totally improbable, that a creature fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſuch tools, and endued with a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable degree of ſagacity to uſe them, ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conſtruct houſes of three ſtories, or build bridges, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Indeed I begin to be ſtaggered; but is this really the caſe? Pray, Sophia, go on, for I am
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:036664_0042_100A5F95E9C90D50"/>
impatient to hear what you have to tell us further on this ſubject.</p>

                  <p>When they are going to chuſe a place to build a habitation, they aſſemble in companies ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of two or three hundred, and after mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, fix on a ſpot where plenty of proviſions, and all neceſſaries may be found. Their houſes are always ſituated in the water; and when they can find neither lake nor pond adjacent, they endeavour to ſupply the defect, by ſtopping the current of ſome brook or ſmall river, by means of a cauſey or dam; for this purpoſe they ſet about felling of trees, which ſeveral of them together effect pretty eaſily, with their ſtrong teeth; they take care to chuſe out thoſe that grow above the place where they intend to build, that they may ſwim down the current. They alſo, with wonderful ſagacity, contrive that they ſhall fall towards the water, that they may have the leſs way to carry them. After the tree is felled, they cut it into proper lengths, and then roll them into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and navigate them towards the place where they are to be uſed. The cauſey raiſed with theſe pieces of wood, is ſometimes ten or a dozen feet in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at the foundation; it deſcends in a ſlope on the ſide next the water. The oppoſite ſide is raiſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly like our walls, and the ſlope, which at its baſe, is twelve feet broad, diminiſhes towards the top to the breadth of two feet. They drive the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of theſe pieces of wood very near each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, into the earth, and interlace them with other ſtakes more ſlender and ſupple. But as the water, without ſome other prevention, would glide through the cavities, and leave the reſervoir dry, they have recourſe to a clay, which they perfectly well know how to procure, and which they work up into a kind of mortar with their tails, and cloſe up the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices with it, both within and without, and this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſecures the water from paſſing away. If the violence of the water, or the footſteps of hunters, who paſs over their work, damage it, they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:036664_0043_100A5F98B1F1FAF0"/>
ſet about repairing it. They build their cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins, either on piles in the middle of the ſmall lakes, they have thus formed, on the bank of a river, or at the extremity of ſome point of land, that advances into a lake. The figure of them is round or oval, divided into three partitions, raiſed one above anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The firſt is ſunk below the level of the dike, and is generally full of water, the other two ſtories are built above it. The whole edifice is moſtly capable of containing eight or ten inhabitants. Each beaver has its peculiar cell aſſigned him, the floor of which he ſtrews with leaves, or ſmall branches of the pine tree, ſo as to render it clean and comfortable. Their works, eſpecially in the cold regions, are completed in Auguſt or September; after which they furniſh themſelves with a ſtore of proviſions. During the ſummer, they regale upon all the fruits and plants the country produces. In the winter they eat the wood of the aſh, the plane, and other trees, which they ſteep in water, in quantities proportionable to their conſumption, and they are ſupplied with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtomach, to facilitate the digeſtion of ſuch ſolid food, at two operations. They cut twigs from three to ſix feet in length, the larger ones are conveyed by ſeveral beavers to the magazine, and the ſmaller by a ſingle animal, but they take different ways. Each individual has his walk aſſigned him, to prevent the labourers from being interrupted in their reſpective occupations. Theſe parcels of wood are not piled up in one continued heap, but laid acroſs one anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with interſtices between them, that they may the eaſier draw out what quantity they want; and they always take the parcel at the bottom. They cut this wood into ſmall pieces, and convey it to their cell, where the whole family come to receive their ſhare. Sometimes they wander in the woods, and regale their young with a freſh collation. The hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who know that theſe creatures love green wood better than old, place a parcel of the former about their lodge, and then have ſeveral devices to enſnare
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:036664_0044_100A5F9B0FC2C270"/>
them. When the winter grows ſevere, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times break the ice, and when the beavers come to the opening for air, they kill them with hatchets, or make a large aperture in the ice, and cover it with a very ſtrong net, and then overturn the lodge, upon which the beavers, thinking to eſcape in their uſual way, by flying to the water, and immerging at the hole in the ice, fall into the ſnare, and are taken.</p>

                  <p>Men's hats are made of the fur of the Beaver. Women are employed by the hatters, to clear the ſkins of the hair; for which purpoſe they uſe two knives; a large one, like a ſhoe-maker's knife, for the long hair; and a ſmaller, not unlike a vine knife, to ſhave or ſcrape off the ſhort hair or down. When the hair is off, they mix the ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ff, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to one third of dry caſtor, two thirds of old coat, a term they uſe for the hair of thoſe ſkins which have been worn ſome time by the ſavages, and by that means is become finer than the reſt. After it is mixed, they card it; which is pulling it ſmooth and even, between two things reſembling a curry-comb, with fine teeth: ſuch as are uſed to card wool with, before it is ſpun. They then take a proper quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this ſtuff for a hat, and put it upon the hurdle, which is a ſquare table with chinks cut through it lengthwiſe, then the workman takes an inſtrument, called a bow, very like a fiddle-ſtick, and works the fur till it mixes well together, the dirt and filth paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through the chinks. In this manner they form
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:036664_0045_100A5F9D028EA9C0"/>
two gores or pieces of an oval form, ending in a ſharp corner at top. Theſe pieces, or capades, as they are called, being formed in this manner, they proceed to harden them into cloſer and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent flakes, by preſſing them with a hardening ſkin or leather; they are then carried to the baſon, which is a ſort of bench, with an iron plate fitted in it, and a little fire underneath it, upon which they lay one of the capades, ſprinkled with water, and make uſe of a ſort of mould to form it; when, by means of the heat of the fire, the water, and preſſing, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thickens into a ſlight hairy ſort of felt or ſtuff. After they have turned up the edges all round the mould, they lay it by, and proceed in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with the other half. The next thing is to join the two pieces together, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o as to meet in a point at the top, and form a high crowned cap. The hat thus baſoned, is removed to a large receiver or trough, which is a kind of copper kettle, of a peculiar ſhape, filled with hot water and grounds, after dipping the hat in the kettle, they begin to work it, by rolling and unrolling it again and again, firſt with their hands, and then with a little wooden roller, dipping it frequently in the kettle, till by fulling and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening it in this manner for four or five hours, it is brought into the ſize of the hat intended; they form the crown by laying the high crowned cap on a wooden block of a proper ſize, and tying it round with a packthread, called a commander, which they gradually puſh down to the bottom of the block, with a piece of iron properly bent, which they call a ſtamper. When the hat is dried, they ſinge it, and rub it with pumice, to take off the coarſer knap, it is afterwards rubbed with ſeal-ſkin, and laſtly carded with a fine card.</p>

to the dyer's, who makes a dye of log-wood, verde-greaſe, copperas, and alder-bark, and fills his copper with it, which is moſtly large enough to hold ten or twelve dozen of hats at a time. He boils the hats in this dye for near an hour, then ſets them out to cool, and boils them again ten or more times over, till the dye is complete; it is now returned to the hatter, who dries it thoroughly over a charcoal fire, and then ſmears it with glue, or gum ſenegal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, to ſtiffen it. The next thing is to ſteam it on the ſteaming-baſon, which is a little hearth or fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, covered over with an iron plate that exactly fits it; on this plate, wet cloths are ſpread to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the hat from burning, the hat is placed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>A viſit to the Britiſh Muſeum, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with a friend of my papa's, who is a collector of ſhells, has rendered me capable of reſolving that queſtion; they are generally divided into three claſſes, Univalves, bivalves, and multivalves; which include ſea, land, and freſh-water ſhells, which are ſubdivid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into many genera and ſpecies. The firſt claſs conſiſts of ſhells that are of one ſingle piece; as a

ſnail-ſhell; the ſecond, of thoſe which are formed of two, as the oyſter or muſcle; and the third, of thoſe which have more pieces than two. Sea-eggs will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us an example of theſe, being covered with ſpines or prickles. Land-ſhells are of two kinds, the recent and the foſſile; the recent are thoſe which are inhabited by living animals; but the foſſile are the remains of marine bodies, ſuppoſed to have once inhabited the deep ſeas, though frequently found in great quantities under ground, in mines, and in places far diſtant from the ocean, and ſometimes on the tops of mountains.</p>

                  <p>This is a convincing proof of the truth of the hiſtory of the deluge: the account that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes gives us of the flood has always appeared to me ſo wonderful, that I could ſcarcely believe it; but I think, after this confirmation, I ſhall never doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain concerning any thing, however extraordinary, that I find written in the Scriptures.</p>

                  <p>Remember, my dear, that the ſacred writings contain a hiſtory of the miraculous interpoſition of Divine Providence, in teaching man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind the moſt holy and pure religion, from the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt ages to the glorious diſpenſation of the Goſpel. Can we then be ſurpriſed, that they ſhould contain things out of the courſe of nature? the very eſſence of a miricle is, that an effect is produced which can only be accounted for by the influence of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural power. In the rude ages of groſs ignorance, when the worſhip of idols was almoſt univerſal, ſome ſtriking inſtances of a miraculous diſplay of divine
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:036664_0051_100A5FAC0360C2E8"/>
power was neceſſary to convince men, that a God exiſted, who had created all things, and who gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned them with an all-ſeeing eye. The children of Iſrael were choſen as a peculiar people, among whom were diſplayed theſe extraordinary manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the divine Preſence, that by their means the worſhip of the One True God might ſupplant the adoration paid to the ſun, moon, ſtars, animals of various kinds, and even to ſtocks and ſtones, by the different nations of the earth. The multitude of foſſile bodies found in places remote from the ſea are an incontrovertible proof of ſome violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion of nature, and perhaps are permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as a monument, to ſilence all cavillers on this ſubject; but let us reſume the thread of our diſcourſe: the vaſt variety of ſhells that are ſeen in the cabinets of collectors are not all the produce of one ſea or one country. Some of the moſt beautiful come from the Eaſt-Indies and the Red-Sea. The colours and brilliancy of ſhells ſeem to be improved and heightened by the heat of the ſun, as thoſe of warm climates always excel thoſe found in cold countries in luſtre. The ſhores of Aſia furniſh us with the pearl-oyſters and ſcallops in great perfection. Shells of great beauty are alſo found on the ſhores of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica and the Weſt-Indies. In Africa, on the coaſt of Guinea, abounds a ſmall ſpecies of porcelain ſhells, which the natives uſe as money.</p>

                  <p>There are various methods of poliſhing ſhells, and adding to their natural beauty. Among the immenſe variety of ſhells with which we are acquainted, ſome are taken out of the ſea, or found on its ſhores, in their utmoſt perfection, and cannot be improved by the hand of art, their beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tints being ſpread upon the ſurface, and the nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural poliſh ſuperior to any that could be given: but in others the beauties are concealed by a courſe outer coat, which the hand of a ſkilful poliſher way remove. Collectors ſhould have ſpecimens of the ſame ſpecies, both rough and poliſhed, that the naturaliſt may compare the natural ſtate with the artificial one. How many fine ſtrokes of nature's pencil in this part of the creation would be entirely concealed from our view, were it not for the aſſiſtance of an art that unveils and diſplays them

in full luſtre? A ſhell that has a ſmooth ſurface, and a natural dull poliſh, requires only to be rubbed with the hand, or a piece of chamoy leather, or ſome tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli or fine rotten ſtone may be uſed, and it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come perfectly bright and poliſhed; but even this ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Some ſhells require more ſevere treatment, which is called ſcaling them, and is performed by a horizontal wheel of lead or tin, impregnated with rough emery, and the ſhell is worked down in the ſame manner as ſtones are by the lapidary; this requires the hand of a ſkilful artiſt to avoid wearing away the ſhell too low, and ſpoiling it. After the ſhell is cut down as far as is proper, it is to be poliſhed with fine emery, tripoli or rotten ſtone, with a wooden wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>When we go to the ſea-ſide, in autumn, we may collect ſhells, and poliſh them at our leiſure hours. Among other curioſities that were pointed out to my obſervation, at the Britiſh Muſeum, was a piece of byſſus, which is a fine cloth, uſed by the ancients, when ſilk was rare, made of the threads of the pinna marina, a fiſh ſomewhat like a muſcle, but much larger, and is held in its place in the ſame manner, by a prodigious numbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of very fine threads, which the animal has the power of ſpinning as it finds occaſion, as the ſpider and caterpillar do. Theſe threads have in all times been uſed for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes as ſilk. At preſent they are manufactured at Palermo, the chief city of Sicily, and other places, into gloves, ſtockings, and different ſorts of wearing apparel. The method of rendering it fit for uſe, is by laying it for a few days in a damp cellar to ſoften, then comb and cleanſe it; and laſtly ſpin it, in the ſame manner as they do ſilk. By theſe threads, the pinna marina, or ſea-wing, as it is ſometimes called, ſuſpends itſelf to the rocks twenty or thirty feet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ſurface of the ſea. In this ſituation, it is ſo ſucceſsfully attacked by the eight-footed polypus, that the ſpecies could not exiſt, but for the aſſiſtance of the cancer pinnotheris, which lives in the ſame ſhell, as a guard and companion. The pinnotheris or pinnophylax is a ſmall crab, naked like Bernard the hermit, but is furniſhed with good eyes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inhabits the ſhell of the pinna; when they want food, the pinna opens its ſhell, and ſends its faithful ally to forage; but if the cancer ſees the polypus, he returns ſuddenly to the arms of his blind hoſteſs who, by cloſing the ſhell, avoids the fury of her enemy; otherwiſe, when it has procured a booty, it brings it to the opening of the ſhell, where it is admitted, and they divide the prey.</p>

                  <p>The general form of the nautilus is adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſwimming on the water, and reſembles the figure of a boat or veſſel, but varies in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the different ſpecies. The name is derived from a Greek word, ſignifying both a fiſh and a ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor. It is ſuppoſed that men firſt took the idea of ſailing in veſſels from what they ſaw practiſed by this little creature. The paper nautilus is ſo named from the thinneſs of the ſhell, which it ſometimes creeps out of, and goes on ſhore to feed. When this animal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſail, it extends two of its arms on high, and ſupports a membrane between them, which it throws out to ſerve as a ſail, and its two other arms hang out of the ſhell to be uſed occaſionally as oars, or as a ſteerage; but this laſt office is generally performed by the tail. When the ſea is calm, numbers of theſe fiſh are frequently ſeen diverting themſelves with ſailing about in this manner, but as ſoon as a ſtorm ariſes, or any thing diſturbs them, they draw in their arms, and take in as much water as makes them a little heavier than the ſea-water in which they ſwim, and by that means ſink to the bottom. When they deſire to riſe again, they expel this abundant water through a number of holes which they have in their arms, and ſo lighten themſelves.</p>

inſtances of the ſame admirable wiſdom that has formed the inhabitants of the earth and air. Should man ever be enabled, by any future diſcovery to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the bottom of the ſea, what wonders would be opened to his view! what numberleſs examples of contrivance and ſagacity, directed by the ſame wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that has inſtructed the bee to gather honey, and the beaver to conſtruct his habitation, would appear! The different contrivances that ſeveral ſpecies of fiſh, whoſe manners are known, diſcover, in the modes of catching their prey, are ſo wonderful and curious, that I cannot deny myſelf the pleaſure of relating a few inſtances. The ſturgeon is without teeth, and his mouth placed under the head, like the opening of a purſe, which he has the power of puſhing ſuddenly out, or retracting. Before this mouth, under the beak or noſe, hang four tendrils ſome inches long, and which ſo reſemble earth-worms, that at firſt ſight they may be miſtaken for them. This clumſy toothleſs fiſh is ſuppoſed by this contrivance to keep himſelf in good condition, the ſolidity of his fleſh ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idently ſhewing him to be a fiſh of prey. He is ſaid to hide his large body amongſt the weeds near the ſea-coaſt, or at the mouths of large rivers, only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his irrhi or tendrils, which ſmall fiſh or ſea inſects miſtaking for real worms, approach for plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and are ſucked into the jaws of their enemy. The fleſh of the ſturgeon was ſo valued in the time of the emperor Severus, that it was brought to table by ſervants with coronets on their heads, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by muſic, which might give riſe to its being in our country preſented by the lord mayor to the king. At preſent it is caught in the Danube and the Wolga, the Don, and other large rivers, for vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpoſes. The ſkin makes the beſt covering for carriages; iſinglaſs is prepared from parts of the ſkin, cavear from the ſpawn; and the fleſh is pickled or ſalted, and ſent all over Europe, as your father told you in his account of the fiſheries. There is a ſea inſect deſcribed by Mr. Huges, whoſe claws or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles

This order contains fifteen genera, of which nine are fixed, and have no power of removing from the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they are formed; as the iſis or red coral, ſea-fan or gorgonia, alcyonium, ſponge, fluſtra, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bularia, corallines, ſertularia, and vorticella; but the others poſſeſs the faculty of tranſporting themſelves from one place to another, as the hydra or polype, the pennatula or ſeapen, toenia, volvex, ſuria, and chaos, or the aſſemblage of chaotic or microſcopical animals. The ſpecies under this order are one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty-ſix. The immenſe and dangerous rocks built by the ſwarms of coral inſects in the Southern Ocean, which riſe perpendicularly like walls, are deſcribed in Cook's Voyages. A point of one of theſe rocks broke off, and ſtuck in the hole that it had made in the bottom of one of the ſhips, which muſt otherwiſe have periſhed by the admiſſion of water.</p>

                  <p>Their prodigious multiplication in all ages of the world is ſhewn by the numerous lime-ſtone rocks, which conſiſt of a congeries or heap of the cells of theſe animals, which conſtitute a great part of the ſolid earth. Specimens of theſe rocks are

to be ſeen in the lime-works at Linſel, near Newport, in Shropſhire; in Coalbrook Dale; and in ſeveral parts of the Peak of Derbyſhire. It is remarkable that many of thoſe found in a foſſile ſtate, differ from any ſpecies of the recent ones that are known, and have either been produced in the deep ſeas, where no human eye can penetrate, or are become extinct.

                  <p>The fiſhing ſeaſon for coral is from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril to July.

A great quantity of hemp is looſely twiſted round, among which they mix ſome ſtrong nets, and faſten to the beams; thus prepared it is let down into the ſea, and when the coral is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty much entangled, they draw it out by a rope, which ſometimes requires half a dozen boats to effect. It is uſed as a medicine in various diſeaſes.</p>

                  <p>It was formerly ranked among the number of marine plants, but the diſcoveries of modern naturaliſts have raiſed it to the animal king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſince their obſervations ſatisfactorily prove that it is the ſtructure and habitation of certain ſea ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and deſigned for their protection and ſupport. The nature and origin of coral have been as much diſputed as any ſubject in natural knowledge. Some have conſidered coral, and the other ſimilar produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſea as ſtone. They adopted this opinion from their exceſſive hardneſs, and ſpecific gravity, as well as from obſerving that when theſe bodies were calcined, they were converted into lime. Kircher
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:036664_0060_100A5FBF77A95FD8"/>
ſuppoſes that there are entire foreſts of it at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the ſea, which is not at all improbable, ſince M. de Peyſonnel has demonſtrated, by his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it is conſtructed by an animal of the polype kind. In forming coral, and other marine productions of this claſs, the animal labours like thoſe of the teſtaceous kind, each according to its ſpecies, and their productions vary according to their ſeveral forms, magnitudes, and colours. The coral inſect, he obſerves, expands itſelf in water, and contracts it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in air; or when it is touched with the hand, or when acid liquors are poured upon it; and he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſaw theſe inſects move their claws or legs, and expand themſelves, when the water in which they were, was placed near the fire. Broken branches of coral have been obſerved to faſten to other branches. The coral inſects, not having been injured, continue their operations, and as they draw no ſuſtenance from the ſtone of the coral, they are able to increaſe in a detached ſtate. M. de Peyſonnel obſerved that it grows in every direction, ſometimes horizontally, ſometimes perpendicularly downwards, at other times upwards. Coral then is a maſs of animals of the polype kind, having the ſame relation to the polypes united to them, that there is between the ſhell of a ſnail, and the ſnail itſelf. Pray, Charles, tell us how many kinds of coral there are?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>There are three kinds; red, white, and black; the black is the rareſt, and moſt eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but it is the red that is moſtly uſed in medicine. There is no part of the world where white coral is produced in ſuch abundance as on the ſhores of the iſland of Ceylon, and other of the neighbouring coaſts. The lime made in thoſe countries for building houſes, fortifications, &amp;c. is all prepared by burning this coral. It lies in vaſt banks, which are uncov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered at low water, and it is ſpongy and porous. While young, it is formed erect in ſhape of little ſhrubs, and is then firm and ſolid, with a ſmooth ſurface; but the branches continually ſhoot out, and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:036664_0061_100A5FC1E5E6ED38"/>
from thoſe new branches proceed others, till the whole is one confuſed buſh, which is all covered with a white viſcous matter, which in time hardens upon them, and becomes coral; and this filling up all the interſtices, and hardening between them, renders it one coarſe rock.</p>

Naturaliſts have till lately been greatly embarraſſed in which of the three king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to place it; but it is now decidedly allowed to be of ſome ſpecies of worm or polype. The ſame M. de Peyſonnel has diſcovered, and deſcribed the worms that form four different ſpecies of ſponges; he thinks the ſponge is formed from the juice or ſlav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is depoſited by the worms that inhabit them.</p>

                  <p>After having choſen twigs and branches to your fancy, reſembling the manner of the growth of coral as much as poſſible; you muſt peel and dry them.

                  <p>Late riſing is a bad habit, that you have been allowed to contract; but my dear Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta, determine to overcome it; it will require a little reſolution at firſt, but when you conſider the advantages it will procure, I am perſuaded the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty will appear trifling. Health and opportunity for improvement, reſult from an early hour; a pale face, languor, and ſlothfulneſs, are the penalties of lying long in bed. A too great proportion of ſleep is equally a ſpecies of intemperance with gluttony and drunkenneſs, and yet many perſons, who would ſhudder at being accuſed of thoſe depravities, freely
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:036664_0063_100A5FC6EEA8E2A0"/>
indulge themſelves in the former, from want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, ill example, and long habit; and by that means injure their conſtitutions, and loſe a large portion of the active part of their lives. Perhaps the building of this grotto may be the fortunate means of accuſtoming you to wake at a proper hour, and when once you have uſed yourſelf to it, you will find it both pleaſant and profitable.</p>

                  <p>You have convinced me of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of riſing early, and I ſhall endeavour to be one of the firſt at the grove. Papa has lately given me a fine pearl necklace that was mamma's; my govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs tells me that they are not beads, but that they are found in oyſters. I thought I would enquire the next time we met, how they came there, as I ſuppoſe they are no part of the fiſh.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>Many have been the conjectures of both ancient and modern writers concerning the production of pearls. Some have ſuppoſed them to proceed from a diſeaſe of the fiſh; but there ſeems to be a great ſimilarity between them, and what is found in crabs, called crabs-eyes, which are formed near the ſtomach of the animal, and ſerve as a reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir of calcareous matter againſt the forming of a new ſhell, at which time they are diſſolved, and depoſited for that purpoſe. As the internal part of the ſhell of the pearl, oyſter, or muſcle, conſiſts of mother pearl, which reſembles the material of pearl, and as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imal has annually occaſion to enlarge his ſhell, there is reaſon to ſuſpect that the looſe pearls are ſimilar reſervoirs of the pearly matter for that purpoſe. The fiſh, in which the pearls are found, is much larger than the common oyſter, and is called concha mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garitifera. It abounds on the coaſt of Perſia, near Ormus, about Cape Cormorin, and on the coaſt of the iſland of Ceylon. The oriental pearls are moſt valued on account of their largeneſs, colour and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but pearls are caught in the ſeas of the Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in thoſe of America, and in ſome parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. At the commencement of the ſeaſon, which
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:036664_0064_100A5FC91E883150"/>
is in March and April, and again in Auguſt and September, there appear frequently two hundred and fifty barks on the banks; in the larger are two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; in the ſmaller, one. Each bark puts off from ſhore before ſun-riſe, by a land-breeze which never ſails, and returns again by a ſea-breeze, which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds it at noon. As ſoon as the barks have arrived at the place where the fiſh lie, and have caſt anchor, each diver binds a ſtone under his body, which is to ſerve him as ballaſt, and prevent his being driven away by the motion of the writer, and alſo to enable him to walk more ſteadily among the waves. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, they tie another heavy ſtone to one foot, in order to ſink them to the bottom of the ſea: and as the oyſters adhere ſtrongly to the rocks, they arm their fingers with leather gloves, or take an iron rake to diſplace them with. Laſtly, each diver carries with him a large net, tied to his neck by a long cord, the other end of which is faſtened to the ſide of the bark. The net or ſack is intended to hold the oyſters he may collect, and the cord is to pull him up by, when his bag is full, or when he wants air. Thus equipped, he precipitates himſelf, ſometimes above ſixty feet under water. As he has no time to loſe, as ſoon as he arrives at the bottom, he begins to tear the oyſters off the rocks, and cram them into his budget. At whatever depth the divers are, the light is ſufficient for them to ſee what paſſes around them, and ſometimes, to their great conſternation, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold monſtrous fiſhes, from whoſe jaws they can eſcape only by mudding the water, and concealing themſelves by that means; although this artifice will not always ſave them from falling a prey to theſe formidable enemies. The beſt divers will remain under water near half an hour, during which time they hold their breath, without the uſe of oils, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the habit by long practice; but the exertion is ſo violent, as generally to ſhorten the lives of thoſe who repeat it frequently. Beſides this method of diving, there is a way of deſcending in a diving bell,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:036664_0065_100A5FCB25CFE2C8"/>
ſo contrived as to be repleniſhed often with freſh air, by means of air-barrels, which are let up and down by ropes.</p>

                  <p>The poor men, who encounter theſe dangers for a livelihood, do not conſider how trifling the value of the pearls is in itſelf, but what great advantages they can gain by the riſk. Single pearls have been ſold for immenſe ſums of money. Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, wore one as an ear-ring, that Pliny has eſtimated at eighty thouſand pounds ſterling. The real value of pearls and diamonds is ſmall, becauſe they do not contribute to the ſupport or comfort of the life of man; but whilſt people of fortune will laviſh great ſums upon ſuch inſignificant things, there will always be ſound people, whoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities will impel them to obtain them at the riſk of their lives. It is time to ſeparate. Remember our appointment in the grove at ſix to-morrow morning.</p>

                  <p>There are three ſorts of furnaces uſed in the glaſs-works. After having properly mixed the aſhes and ſand together, they are put into the firſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, where they are burned or calcined for a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time, and become what is called frit, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boiled in pots or crucibles of pipe-makers clay, in the ſecond furnace, is rendered fit for blowing.</p>

                  <p>The metamorphoſis, for it may well be termed ſo, is cauſed by the action of the fire, which when intenſe, vitrifies or turns them into glaſs. Sophia, go on with your account.</p>

                  <p>The workman, who blows the glaſs, takes his blowing iron, which is a hollow tube about two feet and a half long, and dipping it in the melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-pot, turns it about: the metal ſticks to the iron like honey: he dips four times for every glaſs, and at every dip, rolls the end of his inſtrument, with the glaſs on it, on a piece of iron, over which is a veſſel of water, which by its coolneſs conſolidates the glaſs, and diſpoſes it to bind better with the next to be taken out of the pot. When he has got enough of matter on the inſtrument, he begins to blow gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly through it, in the ſame manner as boys blow ſoap-ſuds through a pipe, and in order to give it a poliſh, he rolls it backwards and forwards on a ſtone or marble: after blowing, and whirling the iron till he has formed the glaſs to the intended ſhape, he delivers it to the maſter workman to break off the collet, which is a little piece that ſticks to the iron. In order to hollow it out, another workman thruſts in an iron inſtrument, and turns it round with a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular motion till it is ſufficiently enlarged. When it is perfectly formed, it is ſet in the lear or third furnace to anneal or harden; it is proper to add, that the ſtem, and the foot of a drinking glaſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire each a diſtinct operation.</p>

                  <p>The workman contrives to blow, and diſpoſe his glaſs to as to form a cylinder, which by frequent heating and working on a kind of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en table, at length begins to open and unfold like a ſheet of paper, a previous notch or inciſion being made for that purpoſe in the cylinder of glaſs, and thus it becomes flat; the table of glaſs is now nearly perfected, and requires nothing farther, but to be heated over again. When taken out, they lay it on a table of copper, from whence it is carried to the third furnace to anneal.</p>

                  <p>There are two methods of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plates for looking-glaſſes; the one, by blowing them much in the ſame manner as they blow glaſs for windows, but on a larger ſcale. The other, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or running of them, which is generally practiſed in making large glaſſes. The French claim the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of this invention. It was firſt propoſed to the French court in 1688, by the Sieur Abraham The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vart. It is performed in nearly a ſimilar manner to the caſting of ſheet-lead, and this method not only enables them to make glaſſes of more than double the ſize of any made by blowing, but alſo to caſt all
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:036664_0069_100A5FD4CDD70B88"/>
kinds of borders, mouldings, &amp;c. The furnaces for melting the materials of this manufacture are of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous ſize, and thoſe for annealing the glaſſes, when formed, ſtill larger. There are at leaſt twenty-four annealing furnaces or ovens, each above twenty feet long, placed around a melting furnace. All theſe furnaces are covered over with a large ſhed, under which are likewiſe built forges and workhouſes for ſmiths, carpenters, and other artificers, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually employed in repairing and keeping in order the machines, furnaces, &amp;c. as alſo apartments for theſe, and the workmen employed about the glaſs. So that the glaſs-houſe in the caſtle of St. Gobin, in the foreſt of Fere, in the Sciſſonois, celebrated for its excellence in this manufacture, appears more like a little city, than an aſſemblage of workmen's ſheds. The inſides of the furnaces are lined with a ſort of baked earth, adapted to ſuſtain the action of fire, and the ſame earth ſerves alſo for melting-pots, ciſterns, &amp;c. The ciſterns are about a yard long, and half as wide, they ſerve for the conveyance of liquid glaſs, which is drawn out of the melting-pots, to the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tables. When the matter is ſufficiently vitrified, refined, and ſettled, they fill the ciſterns, and leave them in the furnace, till they appear white through exceſſive heat. The table on which the glaſs is to be run, is of caſt iron. There is a curious machinery to remove the ciſterns from the furnaces to the table, which places them in an inclined poſition, ſo as to diſcharge a torrent of matter, like liquid fire, with which the table is preſently covered. As ſoon as the glaſs is come to a conſiſtence, they ſhove it off into the annealing furnace, with an iron raker as wide as the table, being aſſiſted by workmen on the other ſide of the furnace, who pull it to them with iron hooks.</p>

<pb n="71" facs="unknown:036664_0070_100A5FD6E8A72290"/>
quickneſs with which they perform the different op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations, is inconceivable to thoſe who have not been eye-witneſſes of that wonderful manufacture. The tiſors, or perſons employed in heating the large fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, run round the furnace in their ſhirts, without the leaſt intermiſſion, with a ſpeed ſcarcely inferior to that of the lighteſt courier: as they go along, they take two billets of wood, and throw them into the firſt furnace, and continuing their courſe, do the ſame for the ſecond. This they hold on uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>edly for ſix hours together. One would not expect, that two ſuch ſmall pieces of wood, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in an inſtant, would maintain the furnace in the proper degree of heat, which is ſo great, that a large bar of iron, laid at one of the mouths of the furnace, becomes red hot in leſs than half a minute. The proceſs of theſe glaſſes is now completed, except grinding, poliſhing, and foliating, or laying on of the quickſilver. The grinding of glaſs requires great nicety, when performed on glaſſes that are deſigned for teleſcopes, or other optical uſes. Plate or caſt glaſs is ground by placing it on a ſtone table, in ſuch a manner, that it cannot be ſhaken or diſplaced, and then by means of a wooden frame, another glaſs is rubbed backwards and forwards over it, with water and ſand between them, and thus by conſtant attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their ſurfaces become ſmooth.</p>

                  <p>Horn and oiled paper were the ſubſtitutes they were obliged to uſe. Glaſs windows were not known in England till 1180; and then were conſidered as a mark of great magnificence, ſuitable only to palaces, churches, &amp;c. The Italians poſſeſſed this art firſt. The French learned it of them, and from thence it was brought into England. Venice for many years excelled all Europe in the fineneſs of its glaſſes: and in the thirteenth century, were the only people that had the ſecret of making cryſtal looking-glaſſes. The glaſs manufacture was firſt begun in England in 1557. Glaſs plates were made at Lambeth, in 1673, under the patronage of the Duke of Buckingham, who introduced this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufacture into England, with amazing ſucceſs. So that in a century we have attained the art in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that rivals even the Venetians, and are no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obliged to be ſupplied with this article from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign countries.</p>

The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient manner of painting on glaſs was very ſimple, and conſiſted in the mere arrangement of pieces of glaſs of different colours, in ſome ſort of ſymmetry, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nd conſtituted a ſpecies of what we call moſaic work. In time, the taſte for this kind of work im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and the art being found applicable to the adorning of churches and other public buildings, they found means of incorporating the colours with the glaſs itſelf, by expoſing them to a proper degree of fire, after the colours are laid on.</p>

                  <p>There is an eaſy method of paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmall pictures on glaſs, called back-painting, which requires but little ſkill, and produces a pretty effect. You muſt take a piece of crown glaſs, the ſize of the print you intend to paint, a mezzotinto is the beſt adapted to the purpoſe; ſoak your print in clean water for forty-eight hours, if it be on very ſtrong, cloſe, hard gummed paper; but if on a ſoft ſpongy paper, two hours will be ſufficient; then lay the print between four ſheets of paper, two beneath it, and two above it, that the moiſture may be drawn out of it. In the mean while, let the glaſs be warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the fire, then with a hog's-hair bruſh dipped in melted Straſburg turpentine, ſmear the glaſs ſmoothly and evenly. Lay the print upon the glaſs, rubbing it gently from one end to the other, that it may lie cloſe. With the finger rub off the paper from the backſide of the print, till nothing can be ſeen, but the print, like a thin film upon the glaſs, and ſet it aſide to dry. When it is well dried, var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it over with ſome white tranſparent varniſh, that the print may be ſeen through it, which is now fit for painting. Having prepared a variety of oil col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:036664_0074_100A5FE010B42B38"/>
which muſt be ground very fine, and tempered very ſtiff, lay ſuch colours on the tranſparent print as your fancy and taſte direct; the outlines of the print guiding the pencil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it will produce a very pretty effect. You muſt be careful to lay on the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours thick enough to appear plainly through the glaſs. When your grotto is finiſhed, you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe yourſelves this way, and each one produce a picture, though much inferior to thoſe works that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the hand of an artiſt, yet affording amuſement for a leiſure hour, and varying the courſe of your occupations.

Deprived of hope of amending their condition, by any courſe of conduct they can purſue, they frequently abandon themſelves to deſpair, and die, in what is called the ſeaſoning, which is becoming inured by length of time to their ſituation.

                  <p>It is time to proceed in our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the proceſs of preparing the juice of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-cane for uſe. When the canes are ripe, they are cut, and carried in bundles to the mill. The mills
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:036664_0080_100A370BE2A94E68"/>
conſiſt of three wooden rollers, covered with ſteel-plates, and are ſet in motion, either by water, wind, cattle, or even the hands of ſlaves. The juice being ſqueezed out of the canes, by the rollers, runs through a little canal into the ſugar-houſe, where it falls into a veſſel, from whence it is conveyed into the firſt copper. With the liquor is mixed a quantity of aſhes and quick-lime, which ſerves to purify it, by raiſing up the unctuous matter in form of a ſcum to the top, which is ſkimmed off and given to poultry. This operation is performed five or ſix times, till the ſugar is ſufficiently purified, and become of a proper thickneſs to be converted into the various kinds for uſe. It is then put into hogſheads, and ſent over to England to the care of the ſugar-refiners, whoſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs it is to complete the proceſs, by boiling it up with bullocks blood, in order to clear it. Sometimes whites of eggs are uſed for the ſame purpoſe. They add a little of the fineſt indigo to give it a good col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. It is boiled over again, that the moiſt parts may evaporate. The next thing to be done is to fill the moulds, which are in the form of inverted cones. The rooms in which theſe moulds are placed are heated to a ſuitable degree, to dry the ſugar they contain. When the loaves are fully dried, they are papered, and ſold to the grocer.</p>

                  <p>The material is the ſame, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the preparation varies. Sugar-candy is ſugar cryſtallized. It is firſt diſſolved in a weak lime-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then clarified, ſcummed, ſtrained through a cloth, and boiled. It is afterwards put into forms or moulds, that are croſſed with threads to retain the ſugar as it cryſtallizes. Theſe forms are ſuſpended in a hot ſtove, which is ſhut up, and the fire made very vehement. Upon this, the ſugar faſtens to the ſtrings that croſs the forms, and there hangs in little ſplinters of cryſtal. When the ſugar is quite dry,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:036664_0081_100A5FEA73AB5B20"/>
the forms are broken, and the ſugar is taken out candied. Red ſugar-candy is coloured, by pouring a little juice of the Indian fig into the veſſel, whilſt the ſugar is boiling. Barley-ſugar, is ſugar boiled till it is brittle, and then poured on a ſtone anointed with oil of ſweet almonds, and formed into twiſted ſticks. It ſhould be boiled up with a decoction of barley, whence it takes its name; they ſometimes caſt ſaffron into it, to give to it the bright amber colour.</p>

                  <p>It is ſuppoſed that, although the ancients were acquainted with this plant, they were ignorant of our method of refining and preparing it. The firſt account we have of ſugar refiners in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, is in the year 1659. Several other things are produced from the ſugar-cane. Treacle is the ſyrup that runs from the barrels of raw ſugar. Rum is diſtilled from the ſugar-cane.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>It is ſometimes diſtilled from rice and ſugar, fermented with the juice of cocoa-nuts; but it is generally diſtilled from a vegetable juice called toddy, which flows by inciſion, out of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coa-nut tree, like the birch juice procured among us for wine. The ſugar-houſe of a refiner is a large building, conſiſting of ſix or ſeven floors, and the utenſils neceſſary to perform the different operations, require the aid of various kinds of workmen. The pans, coolers, ciſterns, ſyrup-pipes, baſons, ladles, ſkimmers, and ſometimes the candy-pots are made of copper. Pipes, pumps, and ciſterns made of lead
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:036664_0082_100A5FEBFA6737B8"/>
are alſo uſed. The iron founder ſupplies bars of a triangular form to be laid under the pans; alſo the cockel, which is an iron trunk uſed to dry the goods in the ſtove, iron doors, &amp;c. The carpenter is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to furniſh racks, troughs, ſtools, blocks, cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, oars, &amp;c. Tubs and backs to hold the lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, which contain from thirty to two hundred barrels, employ the back-maker. The wicker-work conſiſts of refining-baſkets, ſcum-baſkets, pulling-up baſkets, coal and clay-baſkets, &amp;c. Thus, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the numbers employed in budding the ſhips uſed in bringing over the ſugar, and in conveying the poor ſlaves from their own country; planters, overſeers, &amp;c. we may ſuppoſe that we do not taſte a lump of ſugar that is not produced by the united labour of a thouſand hands.</p>

Its aſhes afford a great quantity of pot-aſh, exceeded by a few of the trees that grow in the woods of the United States. The tree is ſuppoſed to arrive at its full growth in twenty years. It is not injured by tapping; on the contrary, the oftener it is tapped, the more ſyrup it yields. The effects of a yearly diſcharge of ſap from the tree, in improving and increaſing the ſap, are demonſtrated from the ſuperior excellence of thoſe trees, which have been perforated in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred places, by a ſmall wood-pecker, which feeds upon the ſap. The method of obtaining the ſap, is by boring a hole in the tree, with an auger; a ſpout is introduced about half an inch into the hole, made by the auger. The ſap flows from four to ſix weeks, according to the temperature of the weather. Troughs are placed tinder the ſpout to receive the ſap, which is carried every day to a large receiver, whence it is conveyed, after being ſtrained, to the boiler. There are three modes of reducing the ſap to ſugar; by evaporation, by freezing, and by boiling, of which the latter is moſt expeditious. The profit of this tree is not confined to its ſugar. It affords a moſt agreeable molaſſes, and an excellent vinegar. The ſap, which is ſuitable for theſe purpoſes, is obtained, after the ſap which affords the ſugar has ceaſed to flow, ſo that the manufactories of theſe different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of the maple-tree, by ſucceeding, do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with each other. The molaſſes may be uſed to compoſe the baſis of a pleaſant ſummer beer. The ſap of the maple is moreover capable of affording a ſpirit. A tree ſo various in its uſes, if duly culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, may one day ſupply us with ſugar; and ſilence the arguments of the planters, for a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſlave trade.</p>

                  <p>Sheep, according to Linnaeus, are of the order of pecora, and make a diſtinct genus, the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters which diſtinguiſh them, are that their horns are hollow, bent backward, wreathed, crocked, and ſcabrous. They have eight cutting teeth in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er jaw, but none in the upper, and no canine teeth. The wool of theſe animals conſiſts only of long ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hairs, much twiſted, and variouſly interwoven with one another. This cloathing is peculiar to the ſheep kind, ſo far as is yet known, no other animal having been diſcovered with a ſimilar covering; neither is it poſſeſſed by all the ſpecies of ſheep, ſome of thoſe of the diſtant nations have ſhort hair like that of the goat.</p>

                  <p>In addition to your general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſheep, I will enumerate the ſpecies, and their peculiarities, which according to the ſame great maſter of natural arrangement, Linnaeus, are three; firſt the ovis aris, or ram ſheep, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends many varieties, ſuch as the common ſheep, with large horns twiſting ſpirally and outwardly: the hornleſs ſheep, with the tail hanging down to the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:036664_0087_100A5FF828B98598"/>
knees; this kind is common in many parts of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The Spaniſh, or many horned ſheep, having uſually three horns, and ſometimes four or five. This ſort of ſheep is frequent in Iceland, Siberia, and other northern countries. The African ſheep, which has ſhort hair like that of the goat; and the broad-tailed ſheep, which is common in Syria, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary, and Ethiopia. The tails of theſe are ſo long, as to trail upon the ground, and the ſhepherds are obliged to put boards with ſmall wheels under them, to keep them from galling. Theſe tails are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great delicacy, being of a ſubſtance between fat and marrow; they ſometimes weigh fifty pounds each. The broad-tailed ſheep are alſo found in the kingdom of Thibet, and their fleeces are equal to thoſe of Caramania in fineneſs, beauty, and length. The Cackemirians engroſs this article, and have fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in all parts of Thibet, for buying up the wool, which they work up into thoſe elegant ſhawls, that are brought into this country from the Eaſt-Indies, and this manufacture ſupplies them with a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſource of wealth. The ſecond ſpecies is the ovis Guinienſis, commonly called the Angola ſheep. They are long legged and tall, and their ears hang down, the horns are ſmall and bending down to the eyes. The neck is adorned with a long mane, the hair of the reſt of the body is ſhort, and it has wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles on the neck. The third ſpecies is the ovis ſtrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiciros, or Cretan ſheep, with horns quite erect, twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a ſcrew, and beautifully furrowed on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. This kind is common in Hungary, and large flocks of them are found on Mount Ida, in Crete. The manners of this animal are naturally harmleſs and timid; it threatens by ſtamping with its foot, but its only reſiſtance is by butting with its horns. It generally brings one young one at a time, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times two, and rarely three. It is a valuable animal to the farmer, as it is kept at the leaſt expence of any, and will thrive upon almoſt any paſture ground, not particularly wet; a conſtant damp cauſes them to rot.</p>

                  <p>The ancients, always fond of fables, concealed the ſimpleſt events, under the appearance of ſome extraordinary ſtory. Jaſon, ſon of Aeſon, king of Theſſaly, ſailed in the firſt large ſhip (called Argo) to fetch the golden fleece from Colchis. Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four brave Theſſalians accompanied him in his expedition, and from the name of the veſſel are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Argonants. Their object is ſuppoſed to have been the eſtabliſhment of a profitable trade in wool, in which that country excelled. The difficulties he met with in his undertaking, and which he overcame by his prudence, are repreſented by the fable of a dragon, that guarded the fleece, and which he is ſaid to have killed by the aſſiſtance of Medea, an enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs.

                  <p>Various are the operations it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes before it is in a proper ſtate for the purpoſes you mention. The fleeces, when taken out of the bales in which they are packed, after ſhearing, muſt be ſcoured; when the wool has continued long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the liquor to diſſolve and looſen the greaſe, it is taken out, and well waſhed and dried; it is then beat with rods, on hurdles of wood, to clear it of the duſt and groſſer filth. The next thing is to pick it, and oil it with oil of olives. It is now given out to the ſpinners, who firſt card it on the knee; that is, paſs it between the points or teeth of two inſtruments ſomething like a curry-comb, called cards, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entangle it, and prepare it for ſpinning, which is an operation too common to need deſcription. The thread or worſted being ſpun, reeled, and made into ſkeins, is ready for the hand of the weaver, who begins his work by putting the warp, or threads, the long way of the piece, into the loom, which he ſtiffens with ſize before he forms the woof, which is done by throwing the thread with a ſhuttle acroſs the warp, till the work be finiſhed; when it is to be cleared of all knots, &amp;c. and carried to the fuller to be ſcoured and cleanſed, ready for dying; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is dyed, it is preſſed and prepared for ſale. Different kinds of goods require variation in the proceſs, according to the kind of ſtuff intended to be made.</p>

The one cheriſhed the uſeful arts, and diffuſed happineſs and wealth among her people; the other, from a gloomy ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, deprived his country of uſeful manufact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urers,

                  <p>AS the woollen manufacture ſeemed to afford us great entertainment the laſt time we met, may we not be amuſed with the particulars of the linen and cotton manufactures in their various branches? Sophia has made herſelf acquainted with the natural definitions of both flax and hemp, with the deſign of contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing materials for our converſation.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>We cannot adopt a more ſuitable ſubject; the one leads the way to the other. In the early ſavage ſtate, when men united in ſmall ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for the ſake of protection and defence, we find they clothed themſelves with the ſkins of beaſts in their rough natural ſtate, unimproved by any art or dreſſing, merely for the purpoſes of decency and warmth. In cold climates, the ſavage tribes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wear the hair inwards. As they advance to a higher ſtate of civilization, they make uſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials that admit of greater ſkill in preparing, and ſtudy ornament as well as uſe. Captain Cook re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that the inhabitants of ſome places he viſited, have a method of weaving cloth of a certain ſpecies of graſs. The natives of Atooi make cloaks and caps of feathers, with great ingenuity, on which they ſet a high value, and which appear appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the chiefs, and great men of the country. Many of the iſlands in the South-Sea, are ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards civilized life, as to have an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manufacture of cloth, which is made by the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. They take the ſtalks or trunks of the paper-mulberry, which rarely grows more than ſeven feet in height, and about the thickneſs of four fingers. From theſe ſtalks they ſtrip the bark, and ſcrape off the exterior rind; after which the bark is rolled up, and ſoftened for ſome time in water; it is then beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with a ſquare inſtrument of wood, full of coarſe grooves, but ſometimes with a plain one. When ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:036664_0093_100A60064FFBA4F0"/>
beaten, it is ſpread out to dry; the piece be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from four to ſix or ſeven feet in length, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half as broad. Theſe pieces are joined by ſmearing part of them with the glutinous juice of a berry, called Tooo; and, after being thus lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are placed over a large piece of wood, with a ſort of ſtamp, compoſed of a fibrous ſubſtance laid beneath them. The manufacturers then take a bit of cloth, and having dipped it in a juice expreſſed from the bark of a tree, called kokka, rub it briſkly over the piece that is making. This leaves a dry gloſs, and a dull brown colour upon the ſurface, and the ſtamp makes, at the ſame time, a ſlight impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which finiſhes the work. But when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe ſimple works, with the variety, elegance, and utility of the manufactures of the poliſhed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Europe and Aſia, the degrees of refinement and civilization are clearly marked; and we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to form diſtinct ideas of the difference between the rude productions of the untutored mind, and thoſe which are the reſult of ſcience and art; but I am wandering from our ſubject. Sophia, your young friends wait impatiently to hear your account of flax and hemp, which form the materials of the linen of this country, from the coarſeſt cloth, to the fineſt lace.</p>

                  <p>Flax is a genus of the petandria, pentagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia claſs. The flower has a permanent empalement, compoſed of five ſmall ſpear-ſhaped acute leaves, five large oblong petals, and five awl-ſhaped erect ſtami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, terminated by arrow-ſhaped ſummits. In the centre is ſituated an oval germen, ſupporting five ſlender ſtyles, crowned by reflex ſtigmas, which turn to a globular capſule with ten cells, opening with five valves, in each cell is lodged one oval, ſmooth ſeed, with an acute point. There are four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſpecies. The common flax is an annual plant, that will grow in any kind of good ſound land. The beſt land yields the beſt flax.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>The time of ſowing is the latter end of March. The beſt way of ſowing flax-ſeed is to drill it in equi-diſtant rows, about ten inches from one another. Towards the end of Auguſt the flax will begin to ripen, and muſt be pulled as ſoon as the ſeed grows brown, and bends down the heads.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>Riga ſupplies us with the beſt ſeed. Scotland and Ireland import great quantities from thence annually. Flax and hemp have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable property of communicating a poiſonous quality to water, when laid in it for the purpoſe of decaying the ſtem, and procuring the bark for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical purpoſes, ſo that cattle die that drink of it.</p>

                  <p>I am quite unacquainted with the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of making linen from a plant. Mr. Harcourt ſaid juſt now, that hemp and flax formed the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of linen. I thought linen had been made of thread.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CECILIA.</speaker>
                  <p>So it is; but all the various ſorts of thread we uſe are made of flax.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>Hemp is very ſimilar to flax in its culture and uſe, therefore one deſcription of the manner of preparing them will be ſufficient for both. When they gather it, they pull it up by the roots, after which they bind it up in bundles. They comb out the heads on the teeth of a ripple, which pulls off the leaves, the huſks of the ſeeds, and the ſeeds them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together. Theſe are gathered in a heap, and left in that condition for a few days, in order to heat a little, after which they are ſpread out to dry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are threſhed, and the ſeeds are ſeparated by winnowing and ſifting. Then, in order to rot the bark, they are laid in water, that it may be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſeparated from the reed. When it is ſufficiently rotted, the ſtalks are dried in an oven or kiln. The
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:036664_0095_100A60095B724E60"/>
next thing to be done is peeling off the bark, which is performed by various means, but it is moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiouſly effected by mills.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>The beating hemp with beetles is a very laborious employment, and is uſed as a puniſhment for the idle and diſſolute, who are confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there for ſmall crimes.</p>

                  <p>In order to complete the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, they beat it till it is ſoft and pliable, and, after waſhing and bleaching, it is heckled with inſtruments reſembling a wool-dreſſer's comb, to diſentangle the ſhorter tow from the longer, which is then fit to be ſpun into thread, for the different purpoſes of weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I am aſhamed of my ignorance; but it is wonderful to me, to think that this piece of linen ever grew in a field.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>It is ſaid that the firſt ſtep to knowledge, is a conſciouſneſs of ignorance. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, children, to increaſe your ſtock of uſeful knowledge daily, by attention to every thing you ſee and hear. There are various kinds of linen, the principal materials of which are flax, cotton, and hemp. The linen trade of Europe is chiefly in the hands of the Ruſſians, Germans, Flemings, Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, French, and Iriſh. Cotton is a woolly or downy ſubſtance, which incloſes the ſeed, and is contained in a brown huſk or ſeed veſſel of a certain plant that grows both in the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies. There are ſeveral ſpecies of this plant cultivated in different places. Cotton forms a very conſiderable article of commerce; it is diſtinguiſhed into two ſorts; cotton in the wool, and ſpun cotton. The firſt is quilted between two ſtuffs, and is made uſe of for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of rendering them thick and warm, as for cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlids for beds, petticoats, &amp;c. but the latter kind is of moſt general uſe, as when ſpun and wove, it makes calicoes, cloths, muſlins, dimities, beſides a kind of quilting, ingeniouſly contrived to reſemble
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:036664_0096_100A600CE7087E20"/>
that done with a needle. It is alſo frequently inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with ſilk or flax, in the competition of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kinds of ſtuffs. Mancheſter, which has long been celebrated for various branches of the linen, ſilk, and cotton manufacture, is now conſpicuous as the centre of the cotton trade.</p>

                  <p>Cotton anciently grew only in Egypt; and was confined to the uſe of the prieſts and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, for a ſingular kind of gown, worn by them alone.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>Although hemp does not form a material for works of ſo delicate a texture as flax and cotton, it deſerves to be noticed for the many uſeful properties it contains. Of what uſe would our ſhips be, without ropes and ſails? Sophia, you have performed but half your promiſe; I call upon you now to fulfil the other part of your engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <speaker>SOPHIA.</speaker>
                  <p>I am always ready to obey you. Hemp is a ſpecies of the dioecia pentandria claſs. It is male and female in different plants. The male flowers have a five-leaved concave empalement, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out petals, but have five ſhort hairy ſtamina, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by oblong ſquare ſummits. The female flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have permanent empalements of one leaf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out petals, but a ſmall germen, which afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a globular depreſſed ſeed, incloſed in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palement. We have but one ſpecies of this plant, which is propagated in the rich fenny parts of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire, in great quantities for its bark, which is uſeful for cordage, cloth, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Oh, I remember, my uncle ſhewed me ſome, when I was on a viſit at his houſe. It riſes quick into a tall ſlender ſhrub, its ſtem is hollow, and he told me, was frequently made into charcoal, and is uſed in that form in the compoſition of gunpowder. Its leaves ariſe from the ſame pedicle, and are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle jagged, yielding a ſtrong ſmell, apt to make one's head ache. The flowers grow in cluſters, and the
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:036664_0097_100A600F063BA460"/>
bark is a tiſſue of fibres, joined together by a ſoft matter, which eaſily rots away.</p>

                  <p>It does not appear that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients were acquainted with the uſe of hemp, with reſpect to the thread that it affords. The moderns are not contented with that production only, but tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture this poor plant, for another valuable commodity that it contains; Henry can tell us what that is.</p>

                  <p>Oil: I have not forgotten what I ſaw at the mill. They bruiſe the ſeed of flax, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led linſeed, as well as hempſeed, with vaſt hammers, which are too heavy for men to lift; and are ſet a going with wheels, which are turned by the ſtream of a river.</p>

                  <p>You ſhew a good memory. This oil has moſt of the qualities of the nut-oil, and is uſed as a ſubſtitute for it in painting. The oil drawn without the aſſiſtance of fire, is much eſteemed in medicine, eſpecially in the cure of catarrhs, coughs, aſthmas, &amp;c. After the oil is ſqueezed from the ſeeds, the ſeeds are heated over the fire, and being put into woollen bags, are preſſed into pieces about twelve inches long, and ſix inches wide, called oil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cakes, and uſed to fatten cattle. Theſe cakes, beaten again to duſt, become an excellent manure for land. Thus ingenuity and induſtry have applied almoſt every part of this plant to a valuable purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>There is a mineral ſubſtance, called aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſtos, of a whitiſh or ſilver colour, and a woolly texture, conſiſting of ſmall threads or fibres, endued with the wonderful property of reſiſting fire, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining unconſumed in the intenſeſt heat. A meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od has been found of working theſe fibres into cloth and paper. This kind of linen was much eſteemed by the ancients, being held equally precious with the richeſt pearls. Pliny ſays, he had ſeen napkins made of it, which, when taken ſoiled from the table at a feaſt, were thrown into the fire, and were better ſcoured in that manner, than they could have been, if they had been waſhed in water; but the purpoſe, for which it was ſo highly valued, was the making of ſhrouds for royal funerals, to wrap up the corpſe, ſo that the aſhes of the deceaſed might be preſerved diſtinct from thoſe of the wood, &amp;c. of which the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral pile was compoſed.

The ancient Romans carried the body, borne on a bed or litter, covered with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and followed by the kindred of the deceaſed, to the roſtra; and if he had been a perſon of great qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, attended by old women, called praeficae, ſinging ſongs in his praiſe; and the funeral was preceded by waxen images of all his predeceſſors borne on poles. When arrived there, the neareſt of kin pronounced an oration extolling his virtues and thoſe of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors;
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:036664_0099_100A601241EF54B0"/>
after which they proceeded to the funeral pile, whereupon they laid the body, and ſet fire to the whole. The aſhes were then carefully gathered up, and incloſed in an urn, which was placed in the ſepulchre or tomb. The ceremonies of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians were very peculiar. They embalmed the body with aromatic ſpices and perfumes, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it from decay; and it is ſuppoſed that the pyramids, ſo wonderful for their antiquity and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, were erected as monuments or tombs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the bodies of their departed kings.</p>

                  <p>One of their cuſtoms pleaſes me much, as I think it was calculated to reſtrain vice, and encourage virtue. They brought their kings to a form of trial after their death: thoſe who were convicted of having oppreſſed their people, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bad lives, were deprived of the honours of buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and their memories held in deteſtation; but very reſpect was paid to thoſe who had paſſed their lives in a virtuous manner; and even durable monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments erected to perpetuate their names, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the recollection of their example to the lateſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity. To-morrow evening we ſhall ſelect the ſilk manufacture as a ſubject, well ſuited to follow thoſe of wool and linen, and forming a proper ſequel to them. At preſent I find myſelf a little indiſpoſed, and wiſh to retire early. Adieu, my dear children, eaſy dreams, and a good night to you.</p>

                  <p>Wool and flax are extremely valuable for their uſe, and are no more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned in comparing them with ſilk, than iron is to be undervalued in compariſon with gold and ſilver. The coarſer metal, like the coarſer materials for cloth or ſtuff, is far more neceſſary for our accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, though leſs brilliant and inferior for the purpoſes of ornament and ſplendour, than the more beautiful productions of the mine, or the ſilk-worm. Diamonds are dazzling to the eyes of the ſuperficial obſerver, but was their real value ſubtracted from the adventitious price, that refinement and luxury have raiſed them to, we, like the cock in the fable, ſhould prefer ſomething more uſeful, and leſs ſhining.</p>

                  <p>The ancients were but little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the uſe and manufacture of the very ſoft, fine, bright, delicate thread, produced by the ſilk-worm.

                  <p>It was not long unknow to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, although it was ſo rare, that it was even ſold weight for weight with gold. And I have read that the emperor Aurelian, who died in the year 275,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:036664_0101_100A6017D87517D8"/>
refuſed the empreſs, his wife, a ſuit of ſilk, which ſhe ſolicited of him with much earneſtneſs, merely on account of its dearneſs. Heliogabalus, the emperor, who died about half a century before Aurelian, is ſaid to be the firſt perſon who wore a holofericum, or garment all of ſilk.</p>

                  <p>The Greeks of Alexander the Great's army, are ſuppoſed to have brought wrought ſilk firſt from Perſia, into Greece, about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty-three years before Chriſt. But the manufacture of it was confined to Phoenecia, from whence it was diſperſed over the Weſt. Two monks, coming from the Indies to Conſtantinople, in 555, under the patronage of the Emperor Juſtinian, brought with them great quantities of ſilk-worms; with inſtructions for the hatching their eggs, rearing and feeding the worms, and ſpirming and working the ſilk; which was the means of eſtabliſhing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufactures at Athens, Thebes, and Corinth. The Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, ſoon after this time, commencing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the Greek empire, ſupplied all the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of Europe with ſilks for many centuries. But various improvements have been made in the art ſince that time; ſuch as damaſks, velvets, &amp;c. The reſt of Italy and Spain, by degrees, learned this art, from ſome manufactories eſtabliſhed by Roger the Second, King of Sicily, about 1150, in different parts of his dominions. And a little before the reign of Francis the Firſt, the French became maſters of it.</p>

                  <p>It is moſt probable that they were only employed in needle-work of ſilk and thread; for Italy ſupplied England with the broad manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, the chief part of the fifteenth century.</p>

                  <p>Silk remained a rarity a long time in France. Their king, Henry the Second, is ſuppoſed to have worn the firſt pair of knit ſilk ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. After the civil-wars, the plantations of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-trees
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:036664_0102_100A601A191BEEC8"/>
were greatly encouraged by Henry the Fourth, ſurnamed the Great, on account of the love he ſhewed his people, and the true patriotiſm he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played during his troubleſome reign. His ſucceſſors continued to patroniſe the culture of theſe trees, and the produce of ſilk is at this day very conſiderable in that country. King James the Firſt was very earneſt to introduce it into England, but unhappily without effect. Although we have hitherto failed in rearing the worms, and raiſing raw ſilk of our own, the broad ſilk manufacture was introduced among us as early as the year 1620, and purſued with great vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and advantage.</p>

                  <p>Greatly were we indebted to the tyranny and intolerance of our neighbours, the French, who by the revocation of the edict of Nantes, in 1685, which means the repealing a law made in favour of Proteſtants drove vaſt numbers of their moſt ſkilful workmen in this branch, to take ſhelter in our land of liberty; they were kindly received, and ſettled in Spital-Fields, where they have carried on an ingenious and flouriſhing manufacture, till within theſe few years, that the Britiſh ladies have exchanged the wear of ſilk, for that of callicoes and muſlins, by which tranſition theſe poor manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are reduced to a very diſtreſſed ſituation; being without employment, and in want of moſt of the neceſſaries of life. It is an object worthy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of perſons of ability, to ſuggeſt ſome plan for turning the induſtry of ſo many hands into a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent channel, and rendering them capable of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their families, and becoming again uſeful to ſociety. The ſilk-worm is an inſect, not more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for the precious matter it furniſhes, than for the many forms it aſſumes. Cecilia, who keeps many of them, will amuſe us with an account of theſe metamorphoſes.</p>

                  <p>From an egg, about the ſize of a pin's head, it becomes a ſmall black worm, which daily increaſes, till it is as large as a common caterpillar;
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:036664_0103_100A601BB76A33F8"/>
during its worm ſtate, it frequently changes its ſkin, and becomes by degrees of a light aſh colour, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to yellow, and almoſt tranſparent when about to ſpin. Henry brings me freſh mulberry leaves ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery morning to feed them with. When come to maturity, the ſilk-worm winds itſelf up in a ſilken bag or caſe, about the ſize and ſhape of a pigeon's egg; it forms this ball by moving its mouth back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards, chuſing ſome corner to begin its work in, and faſtening its ſilk, with a kind of natural gum, to the ſides, till it has entirely incloſed itſelf; always working from one ſingle end, which it never breaks, unleſs diſturbed; and it is ſo fine, and ſo long, that I have read, that thoſe who have exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined it attentively, think they ſpeak within compaſs, when they affirm, that each ball contains ſilk enough to reach the length of ſix Engliſh miles. On open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this curious web, one is ſurpriſed to find a chryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis or aurelia, inſtead of a ſilk-worm, which is brown, and about the ſize of a bean. In this ſtate it remains for ſome time apparently without life or motion; till at length out creeps a whitiſh moth, leaving the huſk or outer ſkin of the chryſalis behind it. This is the laſt form it aſſumes; for, after having laid a multitude of eggs, it dies, and leaves them to be hatched by the warmth of the ſucceeding ſpring.</p>

                  <p>When the worm is ſuppoſed to have finiſhed its work, which is generally in about ten days, the people who are employed in the care of theſe inſects, for the ſake of profit, collect the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den balls from off the mulberry trees, to the leaves of which they glue their ſilk, and putting a handful of them into a copper of warm water, of a proper temperature to diſſolve the gum, and occaſion the ſilk to wind off more readily, having firſt pulled off a woolly coarſe kind of ſilk, which covers the balls. They take the ends of twelve or fourteen cones at a time, and wind them off into ſkeins. In order to prepare this beautiful material for the hand of the weaver, to be wrought into ſilks, ſtuffs, brocades,

                  <p>There is a kind of ſilk; that we muſt not omit mentioning, which comes from the Eaſt-Indies, and is not the work of the ſilk-worm, but comes from a plant, that produces it in pods, much like thoſe of the cotton-tree. The matter this pod contains is extremely white, fine, and moderately gloſſy. It ſpins eaſily, and is uſed in ſeveral man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufactures of Indian and Chineſe ſtuffs.</p>

                  <p>The ſecret has been diſcovered in France, within a few years, of procuring and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring ſilk from ſpider's webs, and the uſing it in ſeveral manufactures has been attempted. Spiders are diſtinguiſhed by naturaliſts into ſeveral kinds, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conſtruction of their parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but with
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:036664_0105_100A602089656540"/>
regard to the ſilk ſpiders, they are reduced to two kinds, thoſe with long legs, and thoſe with ſhort, which laſt furniſh the fineſt raw ſilk. The ſilk it makes is nearly as beautiful, gloſſy, and ſtrong, as that of the ſilk-worm; the ſilk proceeds from five papilla or nipples, placed under the belly, towards the end of the tail. Theſe ſerve as ſo many wire-drawing irons, to form and mould a viſcous liquor, which, when dried in the air, as it is drawn through them, forms the ſilk. The threads are of two kinds; the firſt is weak, and only ſerves for that kind of web, with which they catch flies. The ſecond is much ſtronger, and is applied to wrap up their eggs in, which by means of this incloſure, are ſheltered from the cold, and the depredations of other inſects. They wind theſe threads very looſely round the eggs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the balls or bags of ſilk-worms, that have been prepared and looſened for the diſtaff. After having gathered twelve or thirteen ounces of theſe bags, M. Bon, the perſon who made theſe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, had them well beaten for ſome time, to get out all the duſt; he then waſhed them in lukewarm water; after this he ſteeped them in a large veſſel, with ſoap, ſalt-petre, and gum arabic; when he boiled the whole, for three hours, over a gentle fire; the ſoap was then waſhed out of them, and the bags dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to fit them for carding. Stockings and gloves were made of it, and preſented to the Academy in Paris, as well as to our Royal Society in London. The great difficulty that remains to be ſurmounted, is the art of breeding and confining theſe voracious inſects in a room together, as the natural fierceneſs of ſpiders renders them incapable of living in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. Four or five thouſand, being diſtributed into cells, the large ones ſoon killed and devoured the ſmaller, ſo that, in a ſhort time, there was leſt ſcarcely more than one or two in a cell; and to this apparent unnatural propenſity of eating one another, the ſcarcity of ſpiders is attributed, conſidering the vaſt number of eggs they lay. Every ſpider lays ſix
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:036664_0106_100A6022558AA600"/>
or ſeven hundred. The young ones live ten of twelve months without eating, and continue in their bags without growing, till the warmth of the returning ſummer, putting their viſcid juices in motion, induces them to come forth, ſpin, and run about in ſearch of food. But I believe Sophia is better qualified to give us a lecture on the conſtruction and manners of this extraordinary little creature.</p>

                  <p>With peculiar pleaſure I ſhall relate what particulars I am acquainted with, as I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, no one, who has examined its parts with a microſcope, can behold it again as an object of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence. Spider, a genus of the aptera order of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects; Linnaeus enumerates forty-ſeven ſpecies. This inſect affords, to the ſagacious obſerver, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny curious particulars. As the fly (which is the ſpider's natural prey) is an animal extremely cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and nimble, and uſually comes from above, it was neceſſary the ſpider ſhould be furniſhed with a quick ſight, and an ability of looking upwards, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and ſideways at the ſame time; and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope ſhews that the number, ſtructure, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of its eyes are wonderfully adapted to the ſerving all theſe purpoſes. Moſt ſpiders have eight eyes, two on the top of the head or body; for there is no diviſion between them, the ſpider having no neck. Theſe look directly upwards. There are two more in front, placed a little below theſe, and diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering all that paſſes forwards; and on each ſide, a couple more, one of which points ſideways forwards, the other ſideways backwards, ſo that it can ſee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt quite round. Whatever be the number of the ſpider's eyes, for there are not the ſame number in all the different ſpecies, they are, however, always im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable and tranſparent, and are ſituated in a moſt curious manner. All ſpiders have eight legs, which they employ in walking, and two ſhorter ones, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arms, uſed in ſeizing their prey. All the legs are thickly beſet with hairs, each has ſix joints, and ends with two hooked claws, which are jagged on
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:036664_0107_100A6024B24AC568"/>
the inſide. By means of this ſort of teeth in the claws, they ſeize very faſt hold of their prey; beſides theſe weapons of attack, nature has furniſhed this creature with a pair of ſharp crooked claws, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps, in the fore part of its head. Theſe are placed horizontally or croſswiſe, and when not exerted for uſe, are concealed in two caſes, contrived for their reception, in which they ſold like a claſp knife, and there lie between two rows of teeth, which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe employed to hold faſt the prey, ſo that a poor fly has not the leaſt chance of eſcaping the jaws of ſuch a well-armed formidable enemy.</p>

                  <p>You are welcome to the uſe of it, provided you are careful not to break it. Mr. Lewenhoek, who has made microſcopic objects his peculiar ſtudy, has computed, that one hundred of the ſingle threads of a full-grown ſpider, are not equal to the diameter of the hair of his beard; and conſequently, if the threads and hair be both round, ten thouſand ſuch threads are not bigger than ſuch a hair. He calculates that when young ſpiders firſt begin to ſpin, four hundred of their threads are not larger than one, which is of a full growth. Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this to be fairly ſtated, four millions of a young ſpider's threads are not ſo big as the ſingle hair of a man's beard.</p>

                  <p>I PARTICIPATE the general pleaſure at being again aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, after ſo long an abſence, to renew thoſe pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inſtructive converſations, in which we have paſſed ſo many agreeable evenings. During our ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aration, our time has not been ſpent idly; we have attentively examined the different objects we have met with on our journey; and each one of us has collected obſervations on ſome particular ſubject, in order to furniſh materials for new entertainment. My dear Auguſta, how have you amuſed yourſelf ſince we have been abſent? have you added to your ſtock of knowledge by freſh acquiſitions; or have you employed your time in perfecting yourſelf in thoſe branches of ſcience already begun?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>AUGUSTA.</speaker>
                  <p>No one has ſo much reaſon to rejoice at your return, my dear Mrs. Harcourt, as myſelf, I have indeed deeply lamented your abſence; for without a guide, or a companion, what pleaſure is there in purſuing improvement? Summer is a ſeaſon that tempts one abroad. I have walked a great deal, and in ſome of my rambles have availed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of your directions, to become acquainted with the nature of plants and flowers. I have learned the names of the different parts that compoſe them; and, if Sophia will give me her kind aſſiſtance, I hope in time to become a botaniſt.</p>

                  <p>You cannot propoſe any thing more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to me, than that we ſhould purſue this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſtudy together. Our walks will become more intereſting, by having a particular object in view; every ſtep we advance will ſupply new enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; from the humble moſs, that creeps upon the thatch, to the ſtately oak, that adorns the foreſt.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="unknown:036664_0109_100A6028E2793DB8"/>
to your claims; but the ſtately oak, and its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant foreſt trees I have ſelected, as ſuitable to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe this company with; and though I readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign any thing to you that merely concerns myſelf, I cannot give up the only theme that I am prepared to ſpeak upon.</p>

                  <p>Charles has made ſo good a choice, that you cannot be more agreeably amuſed, than by attending to what he has collected on this ſubject. The beauty and utility of foreſt trees are ſo obvious and ſtriking, that the moſt careleſs eye muſt be ſenſible of them. Charles, begin by telling us which are the principal trees uſed for timber.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>Oak, elm, aſh, beech, poplar, walnut, cheſnut, fir, and ſervice tree; but they all yield to the oak, as well in beauty of foliage, as in the utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and duration of its timber. This noble tree forms our navies and cities; and, ſhould the cultivation of it be neglected, we may vainly deplore the loſs of thoſe wooden walls, that have ſo long been our pride and defence.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>I aſk pardon for making uſe of a figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative term. The naval ſtrength of our iſland is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called its wooden walls, and conſequently depends very much upon the cultivation of the beſt ſpecies of timber. Every part of the oak has its uſe; the body is ſawed into planks, to build ſhips and houſes with; ſhingles, pales, laths, cooper's work, and wainſcot, are made of oak; its wood is the moſt excellent for all works that require ſtrength and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The bark is uſed by the tanner and dyer, to
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:036664_0110_100A602A8C427550"/>
whom the very ſaw-duſt is uſeful. The aſhes and lie are made uſe of for bucking of linen, and to cleanſe and purify wine. The roots are ſuitable to make handles for daggers, knives, &amp;c. Its fruit, the acorn, ſupplies food for deer and hogs; and when bruiſed, all kinds of poultry will thrive on it. Man before the cultivation of corn, fed on acorns, and in times of ſcarcity, they may ſtill prove a valuable ſubſtitute. Different parts of the oak are uſed in medicine; they are all of an aſtringent, binding quality. The wood of this tree is the leaſt adapted to works that require to be glued together, as it will not eaſily adhere, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with its own kind or any other wood.</p>

                  <p>Is not ink made of oak galls? What part of the tree are they?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, they are uſed in making ink, as well as in the compoſition of various medicines: neither the oak apples nor the galls are any parts of the tree; they are formed by inſects, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit their eggs in the ſtem or leaf. There are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kinds of galls, formed by different inſects, the inhabitants of a great variety of trees and ſhrubs.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>The hiſtory of galls is ſo curious, that I cannot reſiſt relating ſome particulars concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. Among the ſmaller inſects, there are many which, either in the whole ſtate of the worm, or during ſome of the changes they undergo, are of ſo render and delicate a ſtructure, that they cannot bear the contact of air; and others that are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally expoſed to the ravages of a number of deſtroyers. Provident nature, in order to their preſervation, has allotted them the galls of trees and plants for an hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation; inſtinct directs them to make them for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for they never find theſe excreſcences ready formed. Some of theſe inſects are produced from eggs, laid by their parent animal on the ſtalks of leaves, and as ſoon as they are hatched, make their way into the leaf or ſtalk, and find a ſafe lodging in this receſs, and ſuitable food in its juices. Others are inſerted by the mother fly, even in the egg ſtate,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:036664_0111_100A602CD34FD900"/>
within the ſubſtance of the trees and branches. The parents of theſe are a peculiar race of flies, ſupplied with an inſtrument at the end of their tails adapted to this purpoſe.</p>

                  <speaker>CECILIA.</speaker>
                  <p>How wonderful is the order of nature! the formation of the ſmalleſt inſect, did we but know the purpoſe of its different parts, would furniſh us with ſubject of admiration.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>The galls produced by different inſects have a very different internal ſtructure; ſome of them have only one large cavity, in which a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the animals live in community, others have ſeveral ſmall cavities, with communications between each; and others have different numbers of little cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lules each ſeparate; and finally, there are others in which there is only one cavity inhabited by one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect. The inhabitants of theſe two laſt kinds live in perfect ſolitude during the worm ſtate, and can have no knowledge of any other living creature, till they have paſſed through the intermediate ſtate of chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalis, and become winged animals, like thoſe to which they owed their origin, and are ready in their turn to lay their eggs, and provide for the ſecurity of their future offspring. The variations in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds of galls are not confined to their ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture merely; each ſpecies has its peculiarity. Some of them are ſo hard, that they equal the hardneſs of the wood they grow upon; and when cut open, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear compoſed of films much more denſely and cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arranged than thoſe of the wood itſelf; others are ſoft and ſpungy, and reſemble ſome of the tender fruits in appearance. The firſt kind are called gall-nuts, and the latter apple-galls, or berry-galls; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them are beautifully coloured, and are very uſeful to the dyer, as well as the phyſician. The kermes is the moſt valuable of them all, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a ſcarlet dye, which is more durable than brilliant; it would take up too much time to mention the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous particulars of each ſpecies.

                  <p>There are many varieties of this uſeful tree, the different parts of each are capable of being turned to ſome advantage. Cork is the bark of a ſpecies of the holm oak. It grows in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in Spain, Italy, France, &amp;c. Depriving this tree of its bark does not injure it, for if timely cure be not taken to ſtrip it off, it ſplits and peels off of itſelf, being puſhed up by another bark formed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath. In order to prepare it for uſe, it is piled in heaps, in ponds or ditches, then flattened with weights, and dried. It is principally applied to purpoſes to which its peculiar quality of repelling moiſture is adapted; ſuch as ſoles for ſhoes, corks for bottles, and bungs for barrels. Waiſtcoats for ſwimming have alſo been made of it; its exceſſive lightneſs rendering it ſuitable for the purpoſe, as well as its power of repelling the water.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>The bark, or exterior covering of trees is not only uſeful to man for various purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but it is formed for the preſervation of the trees alſo; it defends them from external injury, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them from the cold, when it is too ſevere for their tender bodies. The reaſon that evergreens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their leaves during the rigours of winter, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their barks are of a more oily quality than the bark of other trees. There are a great many kinds of barks in uſe in the ſeveral arts. They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as powerful reſtoratives and ſtrengtheners in medicine. The bark of the alder is uſed in dying; that of a peculiar ſpecies of birch is converted by the Indians into canoes, capable of holding twenty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. A kind of rope is made of the bark of willows and linden trees. The bark of the cocoa-tree forms the cordage of the Siameſe, and moſt of the Aſiatic and African nations. In the Eaſt-Indies they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture the bark of a certain tree into a kind of ſtuff or cloth; it is ſpun and dreſſed much after the manner of hemp: indeed flax and hemp, with all their toughneſs, are only the ſap-veſſels, or ligneous films of the bark of thoſe plants. The Eaſt-Indian
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:036664_0113_100A603071D9DF10"/>
thread, produced from bark, is of a middle kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſilk and common thread; they ſometimes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture it alone, at others mix it with ſilk, as in ginghams, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>The ancients wrote their books on bark, before the invention of paper, particularly on thoſe of the aſh and lilia, or lime-tree. The outer bark was not ſuitable for this purpoſe, they made uſe of the inner and finer, called philyra.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>Good boy, for remembering what you have been told; the uſual method of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it, is by boiling it a ſufficient time; the roots of hyacinths, aſphodel, narciſſus and the black bryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, afford a tough ſtringy juice, in great quantities of the ſame kind.</p>

                  <p>I hope my Henry remembers alſo, that when he was told what materials compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed birdlime, he was taught to deſpiſe its uſe.

And it is to be feared that, when naughty, thoughtleſs boys have ſmeared the boughs with this ſubſtance, they have ſometimes forgotten to return to the place, and releaſe the entangled priſoner, which, by their cruel neglect and careleſſneſs, has been left to ſtarve.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall next mention the elm, as ſecond to the oak in ſize and beauty. It is particularly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to bear extremes of wet and dry, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is frequently uſed for water-works, mills, pipes, pumps, aqueducts, &amp;c. It is alſo ſuited to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of the wheelwright. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

In times of ſcarcity, when hay and fodder have been difficult to obtain, the dried leaves of the elm have been ſubſtituted as food for cattle. Charcoal made of elm is inferior to none but that of oak.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>They begin the operation by clearing a circular piece of ground, of turf and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er combuſtible matter. This ſpace is filled with wood cut into pieces of about three feet in length, and laid in the form of a pile, with a ſtake driven into the centre; the whole is covered over moderately thick with turf and other rubbiſh; after ſetting up a moveable ſcreen againſt the wind, the ſtake is pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and the pile ſet on fire, by pouring well-kindled coals into the cavity. The wood chars with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being conſumed, by properly regulating the vent-holes, and keeping the maſs covered. It is chiefly uſeful, where a clear ſtrong fire, without ſmoke, is required. Mathematical inſtrument ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, engravers, &amp;c. find charcoal very ſerviceable in poliſhing braſs or copper-plates, after they have rubbed them clean with powdered pumice-ſtone. Charcoal and ſoot-black ſupply the painter and varn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſher with the beſt and moſt durable black. One of the principal ingredients in making gun-powder is charcoal; but I do not mention this as an inſtance of its utility; happy would it be for mankind, did peace and good will prevail among them ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as to render ſuch deſtructive inventions uſeleſs; but ſince this benign deſire for univerſal harmony cannot be accompliſhed by the wiſhes of any one weak mortal, let each individual contribute his ſhare

The aſh, next to the oak, is of moſt univerſal uſe: it ſerves the ſoldier for ſpears, the carpenter, wheelwright, and cartwright for ploughs, axle-trees, wheel-rings, harrows, and oars.

                  <p>You told us that ſhips were built of oak; but I cannot think that the body of an oak, is either tall or ſtraight enough to make the maſts.</p>

                  <p>The maſts are made of fir or pine, which are tall ſtraight trees, adapted to the purpoſe; they love a chalky ſoil, and thrive well in a cold climate. Norway produces them in great abundance; they form that kind of timber commonly called deal, which is ſo much in uſe for floors, wainſcots, &amp;c. It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the enormous wooden horſe, introduced by the artifice of Ulyſſes within the walls of Troy, and which was the means of deſtroying that famous city, after ſuſtaining a ſiege of ten years, was formed of this trees.</p>

                  <p>The pine and fir trees are not valuable for their timber only, but turpentine, pitch, roſin, and tar are made from them by the following ſimple proceſs. In the ſpring, when the ſap runs moſt freely, they pare off the bark of the pine tree, and cut a hole at the bottom to receive the ſap;
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:036664_0116_100A603666607A68"/>
as it runs down, it leaves a white matter, rather thicker than cream, which is ſubſtituted inſtead of white wax, in the making of flambeaux. The liquor that runs into the hole at the bottom, is ladled into a large baſket; great part of this immediately runs through into ſtone or earthen pots, prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and forms the common turpentine. The thicker matter, which remains in the baſket, is diſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a large quantity of water, as long as any oil is ſeen ſwimming upon the ſurface of the water; which when ſkimmed off, is common oil, or ſpirit of turpentine. The matter, that ſettles at the bottom of the ſtill, is yellow roſin. When they have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all they can from the ſap of the tree, they cut it down, and hew the wood into billets, with which they fill a pit dug in the earth, and then ſet them on fire; whilſt burning, there runs from them a black thick matter, which is tar; if they deſire to make it into pitch, they boil it without adding any thing to it, and the work is completed. Charles, continue your account.</p>

                  <p>The turner uſes the wood of the beech-tree for diſhes, trays, rims for buckets, trenchers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. The upholdſter forms it into chairs, ſtools, bed-ſteads, bellows, &amp;c. The bark is uſed for floats for fiſhing nets, inſtead of cork.

                  <p>Of late years the drawing rooms of people of faſhion have been furniſhed with tables curiouſly inlaid with wood of various kinds, and the uſe of mahogany much laid aſide. This gives ſcope for the exerciſe of taſte in the artiſt, who, when at a loſs for a colour in the natural wood, ſuited to his purpoſe, unites the art of colouring or ſtaining it to that of deſign; feſtoons of flowers, fruits, birds, &amp;c. admirably executed, decorate the chairs and other pieces of furniture, in the place of the heavy gilding that adorned the ſtate rooms of our anceſtors, who were more delighted with magnificence than elegance. The art of japanning and varniſhing, which is now greatly improved, adds much to the beauty of paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or coloured wood. Subſtantial mahogany furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is beſt ſuited to people, whoſe rank and fortune ſubject them to the rules of uſeful oeconomy, and whoſe duty it is to prefer utility to ſplendor and ſhew.

Solomon's temple and palace were both built with it, which is a mark of its high eſtimation. They grow to a very great ſize, and thrive beſt in a poor ſoil. The cheſnut-trees that grow out of the lava of Mount Etna, in the iſland of Sicily, exceed any that I have heard of in magnitude The agreeable traveller, Brydone, relates, that the moſt celebrated among theſe, is called the caſtagne de cento cavilla; and that it meaſures two hundred and four feet round, though ſaid to be united below in one ſtem, and is a mighty buſh of five large trees growing together.

                  <p>Woods and groves were held ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred through all antiquity. The Pagans generally built their temples in or near them, and the druids and bards, who were the miniſters of religion among the ancient Britons, held them in the higheſt venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Particular trees were frequently conſecrated among the heathens to ſome favourite divinity. The laurel was devoted to Apollo, who preſided over po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry and the fine arts; hence victors in the Olympic games, ſucceſsful poets, and conquering heroes have been rewarded with crowns of laurel. The myrtle was the favourite tree of Venus, and the vine appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to Bacchus. White poplar was uſed in the ſacrifices of Jupiter, and the pine on the altar of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. The Perſian Magi burned their ſacrifices with myrtle and boughs of laurel. The mythology of the Pagans extended the idea of the tutelary protection of woods and groves ſo far, as to believe that they were generally inhabited by dryads, or wood nymphs.</p>

                  <p>As the number of inhabitants increaſed, agriculture gradually improved; the great power of the barons being diminiſhed, the people at large became of more conſequence, and it was found neceſſary to liſten to their importunity, and convert ſome of theſe extenſive royal foreſts into ſmiling corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields, the harbingers of comfort and plenty. It will be happy if the preſent generation do not run into the oppoſite extreme, and by neglecting the planting and preſerving of timber, ſubject this country to the inconvenience and diſadvantage of being ſupplied from a foreign market. Indolence, the love of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent advantage, and want of attention to the good of poſterity, are obſtacles to the improvement and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this uſeful part of huſbandry.

                  <p>Inſtructions ſhould always be rendered agreeable, in order to be beneficial to thoſe that are to learn. The ſkill of a preceptor conſiſts in gaining the affections of his pupils, and conveying knowledge in ſo gradual and clear a manner, as to adapt it to the ſtrength of the young ſtudent's capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Many a poor child has been diſguſted with books and learning, by the heavy laborious taſks that have been given him to learn by heart, before he was capable of underſtanding them. The ſpirit of improvement, that diſtinguiſhes this enlightened age, ſhines in nothing more conſpicuouſly than in educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>The auſtere manners of former times ſecluded children from the advantage of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with their parents or inſtructors; an unnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural diſtance was maintained between them; they were ſeldom admitted into the parlour, but to pay a ceremonious viſit. The great Duke of Sully relates, in his Memoirs, that his children were never ſuffered to ſit at table in his preſence on chairs with backs to them. The times art greatly altered in this reſpect for the better, and the familiar intercourſe, that is now maintained with young people by their parents, and thoſe who preſide over their education, affords them an agreeable opportunity of enlarging their minds, and attaining a fund of knowledge, by the eaſy medium of converſation.

                  <p>Yes, they are a kind of low willow found by the water-ſide; the wood of the willow, of late years, is come into great demand for the purpoſe of making ladies' hats. It is cut into thin narrow ſlips, by means of a machine, and woven into the form of a hat, which has a pretty effect. This kind of wood is ſuited to purpoſes that require elaſticity; the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, on the contrary, is adapted to uſes that need toughneſs, ſuch, as butcher's ſkewers, &amp;c. Almoſt every part of this tree has its medicinal uſe, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant-flavoured wine is made both from the flowers and fruit. Poplar is incomparable for all ſorts of white wooden ware, as alſo for heels of ſhoes. The hardneſs of box, and readineſs to take a poliſh, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it very valuable to the turner for mathematical inſtruments, pegs, nut-crackers, weaver's ſhuttles, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, rolling-pins, peſtles, tops, cheſſmen, ſcrews, lace bobbins, ſpoons, combs, &amp;c.

                  <p>Almoſt innumerable are the uſes, to which different parts of trees, growing in every temperature of the world, are applied. The bodies for timber, the bark, leaves, bloſſoms, fruit, gums, reſin, manna, ſugar, contribute to our accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are rendered, by art and ingenuity, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to our uſe. Some trees afford food, others poiſon; the fibres of ſome ſupply us with cloathing, the timber of many with habitations; from ſome we extract medicines for the uſe of our maladies; from others, dyes of various hues; ſome are adapted to form muſical inſtruments, by the ſonorous quality of their wood; ſuch as maple, ſir, yew, and pear-tree: others, deficient in that property, compenſate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, by excellence of a different kind. Every tree has its peculiar property, and ſcarce any but may be converted to uſeful purpoſes; their branches afford a lodging to birds, their berries ſupply them with food; numerous inſects inhabit every part of them. Let us admire the wiſe oeconomy of nature, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and nouriſhes one part of her works by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of another.

                  <p>The fecundity of vegetables is equally amazing with that of fiſhes. Mr. Ray aſſerts that one thouſand and twelve ſeeds of tobacco weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only one grain, and that from one tobacco plant, the ſeeds thus calculated amounted to three hundred and ſixty thouſand. The ſeeds of the ferns are, by him, ſuppoſed to exceed a million on a leaf. This numerous reproduction prevents the accidental extinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpecies, at the ſame time that it ſerves for food for the higher order of animation. Nature has provided in a wonderful manner both for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and preſervation of the immature ſeed. Every ſeed poſſeſſes a reſervoir of nutriment, deſigned for the growth of the future plant; this conſiſts of ſtarch, mucilage, or oil within the coat of the ſeed; or of
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:036664_0124_100A604AC009A4C0"/>
ſugar, and ſub-acid pulp in the fruit, which belong to it. In order to preſerve them from injury, ſome are wrapped in down; as the ſeeds of the roſe, bean, and cotton plant: others are ſuſpended in a large air veſſel, as thoſe of the bladder-ſena, ſtaphylaea, and pea: many are furniſhed with a ſort of wing or feath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as thoſe of the thiſtle and anemone, which aſſiſts their conveyance by the wind from one place to another.

                  <p>The upas-tree is ſituated in the iſland of Java. It is ſurrounded on all ſides by a circle of high hills and mountains; and the country round it, to the diſtance of ten or twelve miles from the tree,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:036664_0126_100A604EAF0A1D40"/>
is entirely barren. Not a tree, or a ſhrub, nor even the leaſt plant or graſs is to be ſeen. The deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive effluvia that proceeds from the tree is ſuppoſed to be the cauſe of this ſterile appearance. The poiſon which is procured from this tree, is a gum that iſſues out between the bark and the tree itſelf, like the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor. Malefactors, who are ſentenced to die for their crimes, are the only perſons, who collect the poiſon, and they are allowed this chance of ſaving their lives. After ſentence is pronounced upon them by the judge, they are aſked in court, whether they will die by the hands of the executioner, or go to the upas-tree for a box of poiſon? They commonly prefer the latter propoſal, as there is not only ſome chance of preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lives, but alſo a certainty, in caſe of their ſafe return, that a proviſion will be made for them in future by the emperor. They are alſo permitted to aſk a favour of the emperor, which is generally of a trifling nature, and uſually granted. They are then provided with a ſilver box, in which they are to put the poiſonous gum, and are properly inſtructed how they are to proceed, while they are upon their dangerous expedition. They are told to pay partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular attention to the direction of the winds, as they are to go towards the tree before the wind, ſo that the effluvia from the tree is always blown from them. They are likewiſe directed to travel with the utmoſt diſpatch, as that is the only method of enſuring a ſafe return. They are afterwards ſent to the houſe of an old prieſt, who lives on the neareſt habitable ſpot, appointed by the emperor to reſide there, for the purpoſe of preparing the ſouls of thoſe criminals for eternity, who are ſent to the tree, by prayers and admonitions. To this place they are commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by their friends and relations. When the hour of their departure arrives, the prieſt puts them on a long leathern cap, with two glaſſes before their eyes, which comes down as low as their breaſt, and alſo provides them with a pair of leathern gloves. Thus equipped, they are conducted by the prieſt and their
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:036664_0127_100A6051A159BC28"/>
relations about two miles on their journey. Here the prieſt repeats his inſtructions, and tells them where they are to look for the tree. He ſhews them a hill, which they are to aſcend, and that on the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſide, they will find a rivulet, which will guide them to the upas. They now take leave of each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and, amidſt prayers for their ſucceſs, the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents haſten away. Notwithſtanding the precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are taken, there are ſcarcely two out of twenty that eſcape. It is certain that from fifteen to eighteen miles round this tree, not only no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man creature can exiſt, but that, in that ſpace of ground, no living animal of any kind has ever been diſcovered. Every man of quality has his dagger or other arms poiſoned with the gum of this deſtructive tree; and in times of war, the Malayans poiſon the ſprings, and other waters with it; by this treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practice the Dutch ſuffered greatly during the laſt war, as it occaſioned the loſs of half their army. For this reaſon, they have ever ſince kept fiſh in thoſe ſprings of which they drink, and centinels are placed near them, who inſpect the waters every hour, to ſee whether the fiſh are alive. If they march into an enemy's country, they always carry live fiſh with them, which they throw into the water, ſome hours before they venture to drink of it, by which means they have been able in ſome degree to provide for their ſecurity.</p>

It grows to a very great height, perfectly ſtraight, having no branches except at top. Its leaves bear ſome reſemblance to thoſe of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioc: they are green on the upper part, and white beneath. The ſeeds are three in number, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a pod, conſiſting of three cells, not unlike thoſe of the palma chriſti; and in each of them there is a kernel, which being ſtripped and boiled in water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yields a thick oil or fat, which the natives uſe for the ſame purpoſes that we do butter. The juice, which is applied to many different uſes, is collected chiefly in time of rain, becauſe it flows then moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly.

                  <p>The nutmeg-tree is found in the Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and is ſaid to reſemble a pear-tree; the fruit is incloſed in four covers; a thick fleſhy coat, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like that of the walnut, contains the whole, which opens of itſelf when ripe: under this lies a thin reddiſh kind of net-work, of an agreeable ſmell and aromatic taſte, which we call mace, and is as valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the fruit itſelf: the ſhell is the third covering, and is hard, thin, and blackiſh; under this is a greeniſh film, of no uſe, and in it is found the nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg. According to Tavernier, birds are the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of propagating theſe trees by eating the nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, and afterwards dropping them undigeſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, and being ſoftened and prepared for growth by the heat of the ſtomach, they readily take root. Theſe birds are not permitted to be killed, on account of this circumſtance, as the productions of this tree afford a very lucrative branch of commerce to the Dutch Eaſt-India Company, who monopolize the ſpice-trade, and by that means render it very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.

In the vegetable productions, they riſe above us alſo in magnitude, luxuriancy, and frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The groves of pimento-trees in the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies fill the air with their odours; their fruit is a ſmall berry, which we call allſpice, becauſe it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the flavour of many of the ſpices of the Eaſt.

In this light I conſider the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Hiero's veſſel. But to return to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple inventions of the earlieſt navigators, the various tribes of ſavage nations, that inhabit the ſea-coaſt, will throw the beſt light on the ſubject. Canoe is the name given to the little boats generally uſed by thoſe who dwell in both Indies, as well as by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes in Guinea. They generally make them of the trunks of trees hollowed out, and ſometimes of pieces of bark faſtened together: they differ in ſize, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the tree of which they are made; they are rowed with paddles, ſomething like the oars of a boat, and but rarely carry ſails. The loading is placed at the bottom; but, as they have no ballaſt, they are frequently turned upſide down. The want of a rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with which they are not furniſhed, is ſupplied by the hind paddles. The negroes of Guinea uſe the ſame ſort of canoe, though made in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: they are long ſhaped, having only room for one
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:036664_0135_100A6063ECB3F458"/>
perſon in width, and ſeven or eight in length, and ſhew but little of the wood above the water. Thoſe accuſtomed to row them are extremely dexterous, not only in ſtriking the paddles with cadence and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, by which the canoes ſeem to ſkim along the ſurface of the water; but alſo in balancing the veſſel with their bodies, and preventing their overturning, which, without this addreſs, muſt continually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen from their extreme lightneſs; but what is ſtill more extraordinary, that when this accident does oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, many of them have the dexterity to turn them up again even in the water, and remount them.</p>

                  <p>I have often remarked, that ſavages ſhew great ingenuity in their ſimple contrivances, and that they excel the inhabitants of civilized countries in perſonal addreſs and dexterity. What European can vie with ſome of the Indians in running, when they purſue their game in hunting? or in patience, whilſt they ſuffer the want of food, when they happen to be diſappointed of obtaining it in the woods? The art with which they contrive ſtratagems in war, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their enemies, ſhews great cunning and ſkill; though I deſpiſe the principle, I admire the fertility of their invention. When I reflect upon their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority in theſe things, I am diſcontented, becauſe I cannot find a ſatisfactory reaſon why ignorance ſhould excel knowledge in any thing.</p>

                  <p>There are many cauſes why a ſavage ſhould perform acts of ſkill and dexterity, in a manner ſuperior to a perſon, whoſe mind has been enriched by the cultivation of ſcience; but there can exiſt no inſtance of ignorance being preferable to knowledge. The intellectual powers of a ſavage, though capable of receiving the ſame impreſſions, as a man of ſcience, are, from want of education, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to very few objects; on thoſe he beſtows his whole attention, and conſequently attains a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection in the things that belong to them.

Different cauſes have operated in forming the peculiar character of different nations. The nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs and poverty of the land inhabited by the Phoenicians and Tyrians, combining with their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural genius for traffic, rendered them the firſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of navigators among the ancients. Lebanon and the other neighbouring mountains ſupplying them with excellent wood for ſhip building, they were in poſſeſſion of a numerous fleet before other nations had acquired any knowledge in the art beyond that of coaſting in ſmall veſſels. The commerce they eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with foreign countries by the means of their ſkill in naval affairs, enriched them to an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pitch of opulence. The employment given to ſuch numbers of hands, by this enterpriſing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial ſpirit, increaſed the population of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to ſuch a degree, that they were obliged to found colonies in other countries, the principal of which was that of Carthage. In time, Carthage became more powerful than the mother country, and extended her navigation into Europe, as far north as Britain. The rivalſhip that ſubſiſted between the ſtates of Carthage and Rome for many years, ended in the total deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former, and left Rome without a compet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itor.

Eight years were ſpent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated applications before he ſucceeded. At length, in Auguſt 1492, this great man, furniſhed with a ſmall fleet of three ſhips, ſet ſail, and ſteered directly for the Canary Iſlands; from thence he proceeded due weſt, through unfrequented and unknown ſeas; and after many difficulties, arrived at Guanhani, one of the large cluſter of iſlands, called the Bahama Iſles, and returned to Spain, without having obtained his principal object, of diſcovering another continent, which he ſuppoſed to exiſt on the weſtern ſide of the globe. He made a ſecond voyage without any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſs. Undaunted by ſo many diſappointments, he undertook a third voyage and actually fell in with the vaſt continent of America; which, after all his indefatigable labour, received its name from a Flor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entine,

                  <p>The progreſs of commerce and navigation naturally keep pace together. Trade firſt gave occaſion to the fitting out large fleets of ſhips, and as that increaſed, the cargoes became more val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable, and each nation, jealous of her property, found ſhips of war neceſſary to convoy her merchantmen in ſafety to their deſtined ports. Ships, intended for different purpoſes, required a variety of forms and ſizes, as well as diverſity of conſtruction and rigging. The form of fiſhes being admirably adapted to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the fluid element, and make a way through the waters, furniſhed hints to ſhip-builders in forming the hulks of veſſels. Naval architecture comprehends three principal objects. In the firſt place, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give the ſhip ſuch an exterior form, as may be beſt ſuited to the ſervice for which ſhe is deſigned. Secondly, to find the proper figures of all the pieces of timber that compoſe a ſhip.

When they begin to build a ſhip, it is ſupported up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtrong platforms, inclined towards the water. All things being ready for the launch, the wedges and ſupporters are cut away, and the parts over which the veſſel is to paſs, are well daubed with greaſe and ſoap, to make her ſlide more eaſily. Every obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being removed, by degrees ſhe ſlides into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Very large veſſels are frequently built in dry docks, and when finiſhed, the flood-gates of the dock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard are opened, and the water ruſhes in, and raiſes the veſſel to the ſurface.

                  <p>It is a difficult one, but I will endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to give the company the cleareſt idea of them in my power. The firſt piece of timber laid upon the block is generally the keel; the pieces of the keel are ſcarped together, a term uſed for faſtening large pieces of timber together in a manner ſomewhat ſimilar to what the carpenters call dove-tail; thus united, they form one entire piece, which conſtitutes the length of the veſſel below. At one extremity of the keel is erected the ſtem, which is a circular piece of timber,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:036664_0141_100A6072A1F6DAD0"/>
into which her two ſides are fixed at the fore end: at the other extremity of the keel, is elevated the ſtern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt, into which are faſtened the after-planks, and in the ſtern-poſt hangs the rudder. The tranſoms and faſhion pieces are large pieces of timber that form the width of the ſhip. Theſe being ſtrongly united into one frame are elevated upon the ſtern-poſt, and the whole forms the ſtructure of the ſtern, upon which the gallaries and windows, with their ornaments, are afterwards built. The ſtem and ſtern poſt being thus elevated upon the keel, and the keel being raiſed at its two extremities by pieces of wood, the midſhip floor timber is placed acroſs the keel. The floor tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, both before and abaft<note n="*" place="bottom">Abaft, a ſea term for behind.</note> the midſhip frame is then ſtationed in its proper place upon the keel; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the kelſon, which is the next piece of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to the keel, and lying directly over it, is fixed acroſs the middle of the floor timber. The futtocks, or ribs, which form the ſides, are then raiſed upon the floor timbers, and the top timbers being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards faſtened to the head of the futtocks, completes the exterior figure of the whole.</p>

The cuddy ſerves for an eating-parlour; there is alſo on board an Indiaman a cabin, behind the cuddy, called the round-houſe.

                  <p>A ſhip is very imperfectly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed without naming the maſts, ſails, and rigging. The maſts are very tall poles fixed in the deck, to which are attached the ſails and the rigging. The ſails are generally made of a peculiar kind of coarſe hempen cloth, and their uſe is to gather the wind, by the force of which the veſſel is driven along; the rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging is compoſed of ropes, and ſerves to furl and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furl the ſails as occaſion requires; it alſo forms a ſort of rope-ladders, by which the expert mariners aſcend to the top of the maſt.</p>

ſea-watter, and rendering it freſh, is the invention of Dr. Irving. In order to have a clear idea of his method of accompliſhing this deſirable purpoſe; ſuppoſe a tea-kettle to be made without a ſpout, and a hole in the lid in the place of the knob; let this kettle be filled with ſea-water, the freſh vapour, which ariſes from the ſea-water, as it boils, will iſſue through the hole in the lid; fix the mouth of a tube in that hole, and the vapour of freſh water will paſs through the tube, and may be collected by ſitting a proper veſſel to receive it to the end of the tube. Dr. Irv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a ſimilar manner, has adapted a tin, iron, or copper tube, of ſuitable dimenſions, to the lid of the common kettle, uſed for boiling the proviſions on board a ſhip.

                  <p>The tea-tree, according to Linnaeus, is of the polyandria monogynia claſs; the cup is a very ſmall, plane, permanent, perianthium, divided into five or ſix roundiſh obtuſe leaves; the flower conſiſts of ſix or nine large roundiſh, concave, and equal pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; the ſtamina are numerous filaments, about two hundred, and are very ſlender, capillary, and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the flower; the antherae are ſimple: the ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the peſtil is globoſe and trigonal; the ſtyle is ſubulated, and of the length of the ſtamina; the ſtigma is ſimple; the fruit is a capſule, formed of three globular bodies growing together; it contains three cells, and opens into three parts at the top. The ſeeds are ſingle, globoſe, and internally annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. It is ſuppoſed that there is but one ſpecies of this tree, and that the difference between green and bohea tea, conſiſts only in the manner of cultivation, and drying the leaves. The root reſembles that of the peach-tree, the leaves are long and narrow, and jagged all round. The flower is much like that of the wild roſe, but ſmaller; the fruit contains two or three ſeeds of a mouſe colour, including each a kernel. Theſe are the ſeeds by which the plant is propagated; ſeveral of theſe are put promiſcuouſly into a hole, four or five inches deep, at proper diſtances from each other, and require no other care. In about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years, the ſhrub riſes to a man's height, which it ſeldom greatly exceeds.</p>

among the Chineſe. It loves to grow in val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, at the foot of mountains, and upon the banks of rivers, where it enjoys a ſouthern expoſure to the ſun, though it endures conſiderable variations of heat and cold, flouriſhing through the different degrees of climate in the extenſive kingdom of China. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the tea-trees grow on the ſteep declivities of hills, when it is dangerous, and in ſome caſes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable to get at them. The Chineſe are ſaid to make uſe of the large monkeys, that dwell among theſe cliffs, to aſſiſt them in obtaining the valuable leaves of the tea-trees; they irritate theſe animals, and, in revenge, they climb the trees, and break off the branches, and throw them down the precipice, which gives the gatherers an opportunity of reaching them.</p>

                  <p>The leaves conſtitute the tea we uſe; the beſt time to gather them is whilſt they are ſmall, young, and juicy; they are plucked carefully one by one; and, notwithſtanding the tediouſneſs of this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, the labourers are able to gather from four to fifteen pounds each, in one day. The buildings, or drying houſes, that are erected for curing tea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from five to twenty ſmall furnaces, each having at the top a large flat iron-pan. There is alſo a long low table, covered with mats, on which the leaves are laid, and rolled by workmen, who ſit round it; the iron-pan being heated to a certain degree, by a little fire made in the furnace underneath, a few pounds of the freſh gathered leaves are put upon the pan, the freſh and juicy leaves crack when they touch the pan, and it is the buſineſs of the operator to ſhift them as quick as poſſible with his bare hands, till they become too hot to be endured. At this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he takes off the leaves with a kind of ſhovel, and pours them on the mats before the rollers, who, taking ſmall quantities at a time, roll, them in the palms of their hands in one direction, while others
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:036664_0152_100A608AF5E126E0"/>
are fanning them, that they may cool the more ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, and retain their curl the longer. This proceſs is repeated two or three times, or oftener, before the tea is put into the ſtores, in order that all the moiſture of the leaves may be thoroughly diſſipated, and their curl more completely preſerved. On every repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the pan is leſs heated, and the operation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed more ſlowly and cautiouſly; the tea is then ſeparated into the different kinds, and depoſited in the ſtore for domeſtic uſe or exportation. The Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe drink tea more frequently than the Europeans; it is the chief treat, with which they regale their friends; and it is ſaid, that it is a branch of polite education in that country, to learn to infuſe and ſerve it gracefully. It was introduced into Europe, very early in the laſt century by the Dutch Eaſt-India company. About the year 1666, a quantity of it was imported from Holland, by Lord Arlington, and Lord Oſſory, at which time it was ſold for ſixty ſhillings a pound. The preſent conſumption of it is immenſe, nineteen millions of pounds being annually imported ſince the commutation act took place.</p>

                  <p>The cacao, or chocolate-nut, is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of South-America, and is ſaid to have been orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inally conveyed to Hiſpaniola from ſome of the prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inces of New Spain, where it was not only uſed as an article of nouriſhment by the natives, but likewiſe ſerved the purpoſe of money, being employed as a medium in barter; one hundred and fifty of the nuts were conſidered as nearly equivalent to a ryal by the Spaniards. It is a genus of the polyadelphia pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandria claſs; the flower has five petals, and five erect ſtamina; in the centre is placed the oval ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which afterwards becomes an oblong pod, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a point, which is divided into five cells, filled with oval, compreſſed, fleſhy ſeeds. The cacao-tree, both in ſize and ſhape, has ſome reſemblance to a young black-heart cherry-tree. The flower is of a ſaffron, colour, extremely beautiful, and the pods, which, when green, are much like a cucumber, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed immediately from all parts of the body and larger branches. Each pod may contain from twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to thirty nuts or kernels, not unlike almonds. Theſe nuts are firſt dried in the ſun, and then packed for market, and after the parchment ſhell, in which they are involved, is removed, they require but little preparation to be made into good chocolate.</p>

method of preparing it, firſt practiſed by them, was very ſimple, and the ſame with that in uſe among the Indians: they only uſed cacao, maize, and raw ſugar, as expreſſed from the canes, with a little achiotte or rocou, to give it a colour: of theſe four drugs, ground between two ſtones, and mixed together in a certain proportion, they made a kind of bread, which ſerved them equally for ſolid food, and for drink; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The firſt buſineſs of the planter is to chuſe a ſuitable ſpot for the purpoſe. A deep black mould is the ſoil beſt adapted to the growth of the chocolate-tree; it ſhould be a level piece of land, ſheltered round with a thick wood, ſo as to be well ſcreened from the wind, eſpecially the north; after having cleared it from all manner of ſtumps and weeds, the planter digs a number of holes, at eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or twenty feet diſtance. Having previously ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the largeſt and faireſt pods of the cacao, when
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:036664_0155_100A60920E5FEA98"/>
full ripe, he takes out the grains, and puts them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a veſſel of water; ſuch of them as ſwim he rejects, the others, being waſhed clean from the pulp, and ſkinned, are ſuffered to remain in the water till they begin to ſprout, when they are fit for planting. His next work is to take the leaves of the banana, or ſome other large leaf, one of which he places in the circumference of each hole, ſo as to line it within ſide; leaving the ſides of the leaf ſome inches above the ground, after which he rubs the mould in very light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till the hole is filled; three nuts are then choſen for each hole, and planted triangularly, by making a ſmall opening for each with his finger, about two inches deep, into which he puts the nuts with that end downwards from which the ſprout iſſues, and having lightly covered them with mould, he folds the edges of the leaf over them, and places a ſmall ſtone on the top, to prevent its opening. In the ſpace of about eight or ten days, the young ſhoots begin to make their appearance above the earth, and call once more for the attendance of the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who unfolds the banana leaves, that the growth of the tender plant may not be impeded; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſhelter them from the ſun, other leaves or branches are placed round the hole, and they are changed as often as they decay, during five or ſix months. Such tender care does the cacao require, and ſo requiſite is ſhade to its growth and proſperity, that, beſides the precautions I have mentioned, they are obliged to plant ſome other tree to the ſouth-weſt of the plant, which may grow up with it, and ſerve it for ſhelter againſt the ſcorching rays of the ſun; the erythina, or bean-tree, is generally choſen for this purpoſe. In the fifth year it begins to repay the cultivator for his trouble, and by the time it has ſtood eight years, attains its full perfection. It gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally produces two crops of fruit in the year, and will ſometimes continue bearing for twenty years. The ſame delicacy of ſtamina, which characteriſes its infancy, is apparent in all the ſtages of its growth;
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:036664_0156_100A609659479E60"/>
for it is obnoxious to blights, and ſhrinks from the firſt appearance of drought, and the greateſt part of a whole crop of cacao-trees have been known to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh in a ſingle night without any viſible cauſe.</p>

                  <p>I imagine that the profit it brings, when it ſucceeds, is the inducement to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; nothing is to be effected without pains and labour; we cannot learn the ſimpleſt mechanical op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration without repeated efforts; conſider what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs attempts an infant makes to walk or ſpeak, before it can either articulate a perfect ſound, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a few ſteps by itſelf. In the ſame manner, the habit of performing moſt of the common operations of the body, which we practiſe, as it were inſenſibly, when we have arrived at maturity, are acquired by almoſt imperceptible degrees: a child learns to judge of the diſtances of objects by experience, as of the diſtance and nature of ſounds. The powers of ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, taſting, feeling, hearing, and ſeeing, exiſt in a new born infant, though a conſiderable ſpace of time paſſes, before it is capable of reaping much benefit from them; repeated and continual practice, at length enables it to ſee, hear, taſte, feel, and ſmell, with accuracy and preciſion, if it be born with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect organs. This ſhould teach us never to deſpair of attaining any degree of perfection in virtue or knowledge, of which our nature is capable. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, pride, avarice, or anger, are the leading propenſities of a man's diſpoſition, let him war with determined reſolution and unremitted care againſt that particular vice, to which he feels himſelf prone, and he will certainly come off victorious in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat; reſiſtance againſt a predominant inclination is at firſt painful, by repetition it is rendered eaſy, and

                  <p>The poſſibility of overcoming vicious inclinations, and correcting what is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called our nature, is finely exemplified in the ſtory of Socrates and the phyſiogomiſt. A man, who pretended to diſcover the characteriſtic marks of the diſpoſition and affectious, by the lines of the face, was introduced to Socrates, without knowing the philoſopher, and deſired to declare, by the rules of his art, what kind of perſon Socrates was. He repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after obſerving his countenance attentively, that he was a drunkard, and a glutton, paſſionate, and a ſlave to vice in general. Upon which the company ridiculed his want of diſcernment, and denied all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the truth of phyſiognomy; but Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes reproved their raſhneſs, acknowledging that in his youth he felt himſelf powerfully inclined to the very vices the man had named, but that perſeverance and reſolution had enabled him to overcome them, and all preſent knew that he had attained ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over himſelf, as to be celebrated as a model of virtue and morality.

of my promiſe, though I feel myſelf ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly equal to the taſk. The coffee-tree is a genus of the pentandria monogynia claſs; the flower has one petal, which is funnel ſhaped; it has five ſtamina, which are faſtened to the tube, the roundiſh germen afterwards becomes an oval berry, containing two ſeeds, in ſhape like a half globe, flat on one ſide, and convex on the other. This tree originally came from Arabia Felix; but is now cultivated with ſucceſs in the Britiſh Weſt-Indies. It is a low tree, even in its native ſoil, ſeldom exceeding ſixteen or eighteen feet high. In the Weſt-India iſlands the negroes are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to gather the berries; as ſoon as they change their colour to a dark red, they are fit for gathering.

                  <p>There are two methods in uſe of curing or drying the bean. The one is to ſpread the freſh coffee in the ſun, in layers about five inches deep on a ſloping terrace, or platform of boards, with the pulp on the berry, which in a few days ferments, and discharges itſelf in a ſtrong acidulous moiſture; and in this ſtate the coffee is left, till it is perfectly dry, which, if the weather is favourable, it will be in about three weeks. The huſks are afterwards ſeparated from the ſeeds by a grinding mill, or frequently by pounding them with peſtles in troughs, or large wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en mortars. The other mode is to pulp it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately as it comes from the tree, which is done by a pulping-mill; the pulp and the bean (in its parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſkin or membrane which encloſes it) fall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly

                  <p>The coffee-berries are generally roaſted before we uſe them. They are put into a tin cylindrical box, full of holes; through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of which runs a ſpit: beneath this machine is placed a ſemi-circular hearth, in which is lighted a large charcoal fire: by help of a jack the ſpit turns ſwiftly, and in that manner roaſts the berries equally. When the oil riſes, and is become of a dark brown colour, it is emptied into two receivers, the bottoms of which are iron plates: then the coffee is ſhaken, and left till almoſt cold; and if it looks bright and oily, it is a ſign it is well done.

The globe, which we inhabit, may be compared to a vaſt ſtorehouſe, where an infinite variety of raw materials are laid up, ready for the exerciſe of invention and diligence. Few things in their natural ſtate are adapted to our uſe, though ſcarcely the meaneſt is void of utility, when compounded with other ſubſtances, or tranſformed by the action of fire, or changed by chemical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, or wrought by manual labour: a convincing proof, that a life of ſloth and inactivity is not ſuited to our nature, and that no rank, however exalted, is exempt from labour.

                  <p>That is a juſt repreſentation of them.

Moſt of them being men of intelligence and learning. have beſtowed attention on whatever they ſaw, that was curious or uſeful, and ſome of them have been enabled to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their obſervations to Europe; from this ſource, the moſt authentic information on the manufacture of porcelain has been obtained, and was ſent to the Grand Duke of Tuſcany.

The art of making porcelain is one of thoſe in which the orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal nations have excelled the Europeans; it is chiefly manufactured in China, from whence it takes its name, but it is alſo brought into Europe, from other parts of the Eaſt, particularly Japan, Siam, Surat, and Perſia.

                  <p>Although we muſt acknowledge that the Orientals are ſuperior to us in this art, yet Europe has eſtabliſhed manufactures for ſeveral years, that have produced wares but little inferior to thoſe of our eaſtern maſters. The firſt European porce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains are ſaid to have been made in Saxony. France followed her example, then England, afterwards Germany and Italy. Each of theſe manufactures differed from thoſe of Japan and China, and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectively poſſeſs a diſtinct character of its own.</p>

                  <p>Connoiſſeurs in porcelain have valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome of the produce of the manufacture of Meiſſen, a few miles from Dreſden, the capital of Saxony, at even a higher rate than thoſe of China: on account of the ſuperior excellence of the painting and enamelling. The Saxons attribute the invention to an alchymiſt, named Betticher, who was confined in the caſtle of Koningſtein, by the king of Poland, on a ſuſpicion that he was maſter of the ſecret of the philoſophers ſtone, which was ſuppoſed by credulous perſons, to poſſeſs the power of converting all metals into gold. Unable, with all his efforts, to obtain the ſubject of his reſearches, he employed his leiſure in more uſeful experiments, and diſcovered the means of making a ware, which by its excellence and value, continues to enrich his country. His death happened in the year 1719. Among the French porcelains, that of the late king's manufactory at Sevres is the moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed. The Chelſea China is but little inferior to thoſe of Saxony and France, but being expenſive, and adapted chiefly to ornamental purpoſes, is of no

very general advantage. Of the other manufacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries eſtabliſhed in this country, that of Worceſter is beſt ſuited to common uſe, as it wears well, and comes cheap. Sophia has acquainted herſelf with the materials, and manner of manufacturing this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity in the porcelain works in China, which will be ſufficient to give us a general idea of the ſubject, without entering into the particulars of the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of Europe, they being all formed upon one principle, however they may vary in minute differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>

                  <p>M. Reaumur beſtowed great pains in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alyſing the component parts of the eaſtern China, and found that it conſiſted of two ſubſtances, one of which is eaſily vitrified, or converted into glaſs, the other poſſeſſing a contrary quality; the combination of thoſe oppoſite materials produces porcelain, which is a half vitrified ſubſtance, or manufacture, in a middle ſtate, between the common baked earthen ware of our courſe manufactures, and true glaſs. This compoſition makes a very curious article in commerce, and not leſs ſo in natural hiſtory. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to proceed with method, I ſhall conſider four things; the materials that compoſe it; the art of giving the proper figure and ſhape to the different works; the colours with which it is painted, gilded and enamelled; and laſtly, the baking, or expoſing it to the proper degree of fire. There are two kinds of earths, and as many different oils, or varniſhes, uſed in the compoſition of porcelain. The firſt earth, called kaolin, is intermixed with glittering cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles; the ſecond, named petunſe, is plain white, but exceedingly fine. They are both found in quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries twenty or thirty leagues from Kingteching, the name of the town where the moſt conſiderable China-works are carried on, and to this place, theſe earths, or rather ſtones, are brought in a number of little barks, inceſſantly paſſing up and down the river Iaotcheou for that purpoſe. The petunſes are cut from the quarries in form of bricks, being naturally
<pb n="166"

pieces of a very hard rock; thoſe are moſtly valued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which the colour inclines to a greeniſh hue. The firſt preparation of theſe bricks is to break and pound them, till they are rendered impalpable, or as fine as can be conceived. This powder is thrown into an urn, full of water, and ſtirred briſkly about with an iron inſtrument. After letting it ſtand ſtill a while, the lighter parts of the powder form a ſkim on the ſurface of the water, ſeveral inches thick, which the workmen carefully ſkim off into another veſſel filled with water, leaving the heavier ſediment at the bottom to be reground. The ſecond veſſel is left to ſettle, and when it has ſtood long enough, they pour off the clear water, and reſerve the matter, which ſubſides, for uſe: when it is nearly dry, it is cut into ſquare pieces, and afterwards mixed with kaolin in proper proportion. The kaolin is much ſofter than the petunſe, when dug out of the quarry; yet this is the ingredient, which, by its mixture with the other, gives ſtrength and firmneſs to the work. The mountains, whence the kaolin is dug, are covered on the outſide ſurface with a reddiſh earth. The mines are deep, and the matter is found in glebes or clods. They prepare both theſe ſtones in a ſimilar manner.</p>

                  <p>The oils, that are added, ſoften them, I ſuppoſe, in a ſtill greater degree, and render their texture ſmooth and uniform. The firſt oil or var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh is a whitiſh liquid ſubſtance, drawn from the hard ſtone of which the petunſes are formed; they chuſe the whiteſt ſquares, and thoſe that have the moſt ſtreaks of green in them for making the oil; they prepare the petunſes for this purpoſe in the ſame manner as for making ſquares; when reduced to

this ſtate, it is mixed with a mineral ſtone, called ſhekau or kehao, reſembling alum, which they firſt heat red hot, and then reduce into an impalpable powder; this gives the oil a conſiſtence, but it ſhould not be made too thick, as it is ſtill to be kept in a liquid ſtate. The fourth ingredient is the oil of lime, which requires a more tedious and difficult proceſs. After diſſolving large pieces of quick lime, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them to a powder, by ſprinkling water on them, they put a layer of fern on this powder, and on the fern, another of the ſlacked lime, and ſo on alternately, till they have heaped a moderate pile, to which they ſet fire; when the whole is conſumed, they compoſe another pile of layers of the aſhes, and new layers of dry fern, which they burn as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; this operation is repeated five or ſix times, the oil being reckoned better, the oftener the aſhes are burned. A quantity of theſe aſhes of fern and lime is thrown into an urn filled with water, and to one hundred pounds of aſhes, is added one pound of ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kau, which diſſolves in it; the reſt of the proceſs is the ſame as in preparing the earth of the petunſes: the ſediment found at the bottom of the ſecond urn, kept in a liquid ſtate, is called the oil of lime, from which the porcelain derives its principal luſtre.</p>

I ſhould antic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipate a great deal of pleaſure in this viſit, were I not entirely ignorant of the ſubjects with which I am to be entertained; ſo many things ariſe in my mind, which I wiſh to enquire about, leſt I ſhould expoſe my ignorance before ſtrangers, that I find it difficult to ſelect the queſtions moſt neceſſary to aſk.</p>

                  <p>In order to prepare your mind for your intended viſit, we will defer our concluſion of the porcelain manufacture till our next meeting, and endeavour to explain the uſes to which ſome of the moſt common philoſophical inſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To enter into a deſcription of their conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or an explanation of their parts, would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſting and tedious, unleſs we had the machines before us. We will begin with the teleſcope, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the moſt conſpicuous, important, and noble objects in nature. It is an optical inſtrument, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:036664_0168_100A60AE82199518"/>
of ſeveral glaſſes or lenſes, fitted into a tube, through which remote objects are viewed as if near. Before the invention of the teleſcope, the wonders of the heavens were concealed from us beyond the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the naked eye; and aſtronomy, that exalted ſcience, which illuſtrates the Omnipotence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Creator of the univerſe more eminently than any other branch of human knowledge, has been improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and brought, by this ſimple inſtrument, to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection unthought of, in former ages. The diſcovery was owing to chance rather than reflection, as it is certain, that the theory, upon which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, was not known when the firſt teleſcopes were made. Several cliamed the honour of the invention but Galileo, in the beginning of the ſeventeenth centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, having been told of a certain optic glaſs made in Holland, which brought diſtant objects nearer to the eye conſidered by what means this effect could be produced, and grinding two pieces of glaſs into form as well as he could, fitted them to the ends of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan pipe, and with this indifferent apparatus ſhewed at once the novelty and wonder of the invention to the Venetian nobleſſe, on the top of the tower of St. Mark. From this time Galileo devoted himſelf wholly to the improving and perfecting of the teleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope, and by his perſeverance deſerved the honour, uſually attributed to him, of being the inventor of the inſtrument, and of its receiving the denomination of Galileo's tube, from his name. The Doge of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice rewarded his aſſiduity with the ducal letters, and doubled his ſalary.</p>

                  <p>The extraordinary talents of this great man improved the firſt invention of the teleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope to a vaſt degree of perfection; but it has been reſerved for the period in which we live, to advance the magnifying powers to a height at once truly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhing. Our cotemporary, Dr. Herſchel, has made ſurpriſing progreſs in celeſtial geography, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, by means of his New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonian ſeven feet reflector, the moſt powerful inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the kind ever ſeen.

                  <p>When the immenſe and inconceivable diſtances of the fixed ſtars are conſidered, it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to reflect that the inventive powers, of ſuch a diminutive animal as man, have ever attained to ſuch degrees of information on a ſubject apparently ſo far beyond his reach.</p>

                  <p>I do not think that the ſtars are ſo very far diſtant. On a clear night I have obſerved them but a little way above my head. I have tried ſeveral times to count them, but they are ſo numerous that I have always found it impoſſible.</p>

                  <p>You art very much deceived, my dear brother, in both reſpects. The ſtars, that are viſible to the naked eye, are not ſo numerous as we are apt to ſuppoſe, from viewing them in a confuſed irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner; a thouſand is ſuppoſed to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt number even ſeen in our hemiſphere at one time, by the keeneſt eye, and moſt attentive obſerver.

Nothing, that we know, is ſo ſwift in its paſſage as light; a ray of light paſſes from the ſun to the earth in eight minutes and thirteen ſeconds, a diſtance of ninety-five millions, one hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-three thouſand miles; and yet, though poſſeſſing this amazing velocity, it would be one year and a quarter traverſing the ſpace between us and the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>SOPHIA, the company has a claim upon you for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of your account of the porcelain manufacture, which was deferred, for the ſake of obliging Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta with ſome information concerning the uſe of philoſophical inſtruments. You have already amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with a deſcription of the materials, we are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to be informed of the manner of making them into porcelain.</p>

kinds demand a greater quantity of kaolin than the coarſer ſorts. Kneading and tewing the two earths together is the moſt laborious part of the work, which operation is performed in large baſons or pits, well paved and cemented, in which the workmen trample the materials with their feet, till the maſs be well incorporated, and becomes of a conſiſtence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the uſe of the potter. When taken out of the baſons, they are obliged to knead it again with their hands, after having divided it into ſmaller pieces. On this operation the perfection of the work depends, as the intervention of the ſmalleſt body, or the minuteſt vacuity, would be ſufficient to ſpoil the whole: a grain of ſand, or a ſingle hair will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cauſe the porcelain to crack, ſplinter, run, or warp.</p>

This part of the work partakes more of the nature of ſculpture than mere pottery, therefore ſeveral other inſtruments, proper to dig, ſmooth, poliſh, and touch up the ſtrokes that eſcape the mould, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give the piece its utmoſt perfection. Pieces in relievo, ſuch as flowers, &amp;c. are frequently form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt, and then added to the figure they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ornament, by cementing them with porce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain earth, moiſtened with water, and the fiſſure is poliſhed with an iron ſpatula.</p>

<pb n="177" facs="unknown:036664_0176_100A60C04F367478"/>
the Chineſe are exceedingly deficient, and muſt therefore yield the palm undiſputed to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans in theſe reſpects; as the fineſt tints, laid on without taſte or judgment, can only produce a glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effect upon the eye, but are inſufficient to pleaſe a correct fancy. In the brilliancy of their colours they excel us; but whether this ariſes from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials they uſe, the ſuperiority of their varniſh, or their method of burning them, I cannot decide.</p>

                  <p>The colours applied to porcelain are the ſame as thoſe uſed in enamel painting, and conſiſt of metallic calces, which are the reſidue of metals, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter calcination by fire, or ſolution by chemical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes. With deſign to form colours for painting on china or enamel, they bruiſe theſe calces, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate them with a very fuſible glaſs. Crocus of iron affords a red colour; Caſſius's precipitate of gold makes the purple and violet; copper calcined by acids, and precipitated by an alkali, gives a fine green; zaffre makes the blue; earths ſlightly fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruginous produce a yellow; and laſtly, brown and black colours are effected by calcined iron, mixed with a deep blue of zaffre. Theſe colours are ground with gum-water, or oil of ſpike, to render them fit for uſe. I am indebted to my mother for all that I have related concerning the colours, and I hope I have repeated it without miſtake. A powder or calx of gold is applied, as in the coloured enamels, for the gilding: the painted and gilded porcelains are expoſed to a fire capable of fuſing the glaſs, with which the metallic colours are mixed; by this means they adhere, and acquire a gloſs equal to that of the glazing of the china. The gold receives additional brightneſs from burniſhing it with a blood ſtone.</p>

At the top of the dome, which is in the form of a tunnel, is a large aperture, to give vent to the flames and ſmoke, mounting up continually, as ſoon as the oven is once lighted. The pieces of porcelain that are baked in the large ovens, are put into caſes or coffins, as they are called, made of the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials as the ovens, to prevent any diminution of luſtre, from the too violent effect of a naked fire.— Great caution is neceſſary in placing the pieces of porcelain in the ſmaller ovens, no caſes being uſed; they are piled up pyramidically, ſo that no part of that which is painted in one, touches the paint in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, leſt the colours ſhould run, and deſtroy the beauty of the whole.</p>

                  <p>A mixture of glaſs, with metallic cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, compoſes the ſubſtance called enamel. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral baſis of the different kinds conſiſts of an equal proportion of the fineſt lead and tin calcined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or burned together in a kiln, and then ſifted to a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which is boiled in ſeveral waters, pouring off the water carefully each time: this operation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated as long as any part of the calx paſſes off with the water: the remainder is calcined again, and waſhed in the ſame manner as before. After evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the different waters which have been poured off from the calces, a powder of extreme fineneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains; this, with an equal quantity of cryſtral ſuit, and a ſmall proportion of while ſalt of tartar, when powdered, ſifted, and well mixed together, is once more expoſed to the operation of fire for ſome hours, and being again reduced to powder, forms the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial of common plain enamel, of which all others are made.</p>

                  <p>Enamels are of three kinds; the firſt kind is intended to imitate precious ſtones; the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond is uſed in painting in enamel: and the third by enamellers, jewellers, and goldſmiths, on gold, ſilver, and other metals. The colours require to be very nicely ground, and mixed well together, adding a proper quantity of the matter of plain enamel: this mixture, when incorporated into one maſs by the heat of a furnace, is caſt into water to cool: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is dried, it is again melted in a furnace; in this ſtate it is uſual to try the colour, which, if too ſtrong, is weakened by adding more of the plain

                  <p>The two firſt kinds are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made by the artiſts who apply them to their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective uſes; but the laſt comes chiefly from Venice and Holland in the form of little thin cakes of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſizes, impreſſed with the maker's name, or ſome device adopted by him, as the ſun, &amp;c.

                  <p>In the tranſparent manner, the colours are laid on flat, and mixed with water only. Although we owe the improvement of this art, in its preſent ſtate of perfection, to the moderns, the orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal invention of giving colours to glaſs, upon which the ſyſtem of enamel painting is founded, is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ancient. I think we read of beautiful vaſes, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly enamelled with figures, being made in Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany, whilſt Porſenna was king of that country. A later period produced many admirable ſpecimens of the ſame diſcovery in the duchy of Urbino, enriched by the inimitable pencil of Raphael, which are ſtill to be ſeen in the cabinets of the patrons of the fine arts, under the name of Raphael's ware.</p>

                  <p>The French have the honour of having raiſed the art to its preſent height; in the year 1632, James Tantin, a goldſmith of Châteaudun, firſt diſcovered the method of uſing opake colours, which preſerved their luſtre, after being expoſed to a degree of heat ſufficient to melt them, without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one into another.

                  <p>Sometimes they are done upon vellum, or even paper; but it is neceſſary to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the paper with iſinglaſs ſize, thickened with pearl white; a coat of ſtarch, of moderate thickneſs, with a little iſinglaſs infuſed in it, is uſeful to render com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon paper more capable of bearing the colours. It ſhould be laid on very ſmoothly with a bruſh, and when the paper is almoſt dry, it ſhould be preſſed between boards. Two ſheets of paper, cemented together with this mixture, make a ſuitable ſubſtance for this ſpecies of painting, which conſiſts of dots or fine ſtrokes of the pencil. It is an elegant art, and well adapted to vary the amuſements of young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who have leiſure and taſte to purſue it. The capacity of repreſenting a lively image of a flower or a bird, may be ranked amongſt the higher accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but the power of delineating the human countenance is very much ſuperior to it; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that branch of deſign which enables the artiſt to convey to the ivory or canvaſs the reſemblance of an individual endeared by friendſhip. My dear girls, you have already attained a tolerable degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence in the uſe of the pencil, it will be eaſy for you to riſe higher, and adorn my cloſet with the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of thoſe friends that are deareſt to us.</p>

                  <p>The All-wiſe Creator, when he formed the various tribes of animals, endued them with propenſities adapted to their different natures, and beſtowed upon each, that power, or capacity, of purſuing the beſt means of preſervation, which we
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:036664_0188_100A60D902BDE398"/>
call inſtinct. The influence of this quality is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal amongſt every order of living creatures inferior to man; from the mighty elephant to the moſt minute inſect, its principle is uniform, producing a ſimilari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of action in every individual of the ſame ſpecies. Whole flocks of birds are known to migrate from one country to another, in ſearch of peculiar kinds of food, or induced by a tranſition of climate more congenial to their exiſtence: but the moſt acute phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher is unable to explain the ſenſation that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es them the proper moment to remove, or the courſe that leads to the exact ſpot that produces the food they are ſeeking. Although we cannot account for the many curious facts which reſult from animal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, it is a ſubject which deſerves our moſt attentive obſervation, ſupplying a never-failing ſource of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, and leading the mind to acknowledge and adore the wiſdom of the Supreme Being, manifeſted in his works.</p>

                  <p>A piece of water, of ſeveral acres, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the midſt of retired woods, being choſen, a number of pipes, as they are called, are formed to catch the wild fowl. Theſe pipes conſiſt of a ditch, or ſmall canal, communicating with the pond, and growing narrower from the entrance to the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; over which is an arch of netting ſuſpended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hoops, cloſing at the end of the canal in a funnel net. As the direction of the wild fowl depends upon the wind, a pipe is provided for almoſt every point
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:036664_0189_100A60DAB252BC78"/>
of the compaſs. Along each pipe are placed, at certain diſtances, ſcreens made of reeds, fixed in an oblique direction, ſo as to completely conceal the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coy man from the wild fowl, though he contrives to peep at them through ſmall holes cut in the ſcreens, over which he throws hemp-ſeed to the decoy ducks, in order to entice them to the farther part of the pipe; the hemp-ſeed being very light, floats upon the ſurface of the water, and allures the wild fowl to follow their inſidious companions into the ſnare. The decoy ducks will frequently lead the way up the pipe at the ſound of their maſter's whiſtle, and will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dive under water, whilſt the unwary ſtrangers fly above, and are taken in the ſnare. The decoy man is often obliged to make uſe of a little dog, when the wild fowl happen to be in ſuch a ſleepy, doving ſtate that they will not follow his ducks; the dog, having been long trained to the employment, plays backwards and forward between the reed-ſcreens, till he attracts the attention of the wild fowl; provoked at the diſturbance, they advance without ſoar, to drive away this contemptible enemy; whilſt the dog, by the command of his maſter, draws nearer and nearer to the end of the pipe, ſeducing his purſuers ſo far, that their return is prevented by the appearance of the fowler, who comes out from his hiding-place; nor will the nets above them ſuffer their eſcape upwards; preſſed upon all ſides, they ruſh into the purſe not, and meet their fate. If the dog does not obtain a ſufficient degree of attention, he is decorated with a red handkerchief, or ſomething very ſhewy, which generally anſwers the purpoſe.</p>

The facility with which dogs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inſtruction is wonderful, and renders them very beneficial to man, by enabling him to train them properly to the purſuit of many wild creatures, which he could never obtain without their aid. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion given to us over the inferior orders of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, authoriſes us to avail ourſelves of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they poſſeſs, that they may become more uſeful; but the abuſe of that power degenerates into tyranny, when we torment them unneceſſarily. You admire the groteſque attitudes and ready obedience of thoſe poor beaſts which are led about, and compelled to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe the unthinking ſpectators; but you would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate their ſufferings, did you know the cruel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline they have groaned under, for the purpoſe of attaining theſe ridiculous accompliſhments. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of reflection and humanity ought to diſcourage the tormenting of an inoffenſive horſe, a harmleſs pig, or an innocent dog, when there is no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for it, but the gratification of ſeeing either of them pick out the letters that are called for, paw the number of the hour, or dance a hornpipe. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their leſſons when very young, and they are enforced by deprivation of food, and the influence of the rod placed in the hands of an unfeeling maſter.</p>

                  <p>The dun birds are frequently taken in a different manner. It is uſual for theſe birds to riſe in vaſt numbers of an evening after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repoſed upon the water all day. The decoy man, acquainted with the time of their taking wing, watches the proper moment, and draws a very wide net acroſs the pond, which is ſupported by poles of fifty feet high; the leaders of the flight, impeded in their progreſs by the entanglement of the nets, fall back, and obſtruct the paſſage of thoſe that follow them; whilſt they, in their turn, do the ſame to thoſe behind them: confuſion enſues; and being heavy, and unable to riſe again, when once beaten down, they become an eaſy prey to the men, who ſtand on the bank of the pond, prepared to take and deſtroy them. Their number contributes to their deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſeventy dozen have been taken by this means in one night: the produce of a ſeaſon is almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond calculation.</p>

                  <p>That is practiſed only in the months of July and Auguſt, during the moulting ſeaſon, whilſt the birds are deprived of their wing feathers, which prevents them from eſcaping from the ſpaniel, which is well trained to the employment. The nets are ſet in creeks or narrow places, and the wild fowl being put up by the dog, and unable to fly from him, are driven immediately into them; or, ſometimes, the dog ſeizes them, and brings them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt to the feet of his maſter. They are taken alive, and yield conſiderable profit to the poor inhabitants of fenny countries; though, at that time, they are lean and out of fleſh, they preſently become fat and well-taſted, by feeding upon liver, barley, ſcalded bran, &amp;c. and are then thought by epicures to have

                  <p>The bird known by that name, is the ferina pochard, called by Ray the red-headed widgeon. It has a lead-coloured bill; the head and neck are of a bright grey colour; the breaſt, and part of the back, where it joins the neck, are black; the tail conſiſts of twelve ſhort feathers, of a deep grey; the dogs are lead-coloured, and the inſide of them a bright yellow, tinged with red. The head of the female is of a pale reddiſh brown. In the winter ſeaſon, they frequent our fens, and augment the number of delicacies ſound in the London mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, forming an article of commerce that enriches three deſcriptions of perſons; the decoy owner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns them, in conſiderable numbers, to a wholeſale trader, who retails them to the poulterers for the accommodation of his cuſtomers. During the courſe of the winter, eſpecially if it prove ſevere, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance pretty far to the ſouth, being ſound in the neighbourhood of Grand Cairo, in Egypt. They migrate into France towards the end of October, in ſmall flocks, from twenty to forty, and are alſo ſeen in the winter in Carolina. Their flight is rapid and ſtrong, adapted to ſuch long journies; but the flocks form no regular ſhape in flying, and they chiefly live upon ſmall fiſh and ſhells.</p>

                  <p>The poſſeſſors of theſe flocks do not rely only upon the demand for the uſe of the table, but upon the feathers for their principal gain. Vaſt numbers, however, are ſent annually to London, under the care of drovers, for the ſupply of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets. The ſuperannuated geeſe and ganders are got rid of, by mixing them with the others; but, as their fleſh is exceedingly tough and rancid, it cannot be ſuppoſed that the purchaſers of theſe anceſtors of ſo many defendants will be well ſatisfied with their bargain. They have recourſe to the barbarous method of plucking, in order to obtain the feathers, and this operation is performed five times in the year. About the latter end of March, they are plucked for feathers and quills; and they undergo the ſame diſcipline four times between that period and the latter end of September, for feathers only.</p>

                  <p>They were originally the ſame; the influence of domeſtication alone has cauſed the tame ones to differ from the parent ſtock. The grey lag, or wild gooſe, is two feet nine inches in length, and five feet in extent. The bill is large and eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of a fleſh colour, tinged with yellow; the head and neck aſh coloured; breaſt and belly whitiſh, clouded with grey; the back grey alſo, and the legs of a fleſh colour. This ſpecies reſides in the fens the whole year, breeds there, and hatches about eight or nine at a brood, which are frequently taken, and brought up tame; their fleſh is reckoned higher fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured than that of the domeſtic gooſe. When wild, the gooſe lays but once in a year; good keeping will cauſe the tame gooſe to rear two broods; and if the eggs are taken away in ſucceſſion, ſhe will produce a ſufficient number for three. In the management of animals, as in many other inſtances, art improves upon nature; the deſign of which is obviouſly to ſtimulate the induſtry and ingenuity of man. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, towards, winter, they collect in great flocks, they remain in the fens in all ſeaſons. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent they are migratory, paſſing from one place to another in flocks of ſeveral hundreds, the whole form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a triangle, proceeding with the point foremoſt, and headed by a conductor, which tiring ſooner than the reſt, retires behind, and leaves his place to be filled by another; when they journey in ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, they follow one another in a direct line. It is ſuppoſed that they are natives of all countries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found in every part of the globe.</p>

                  <p>Intereſt is the inducement, as you will perceive, when I tell you, that the pens up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the table are the quills taken from the wing of that bird. Our beds and pillows are ſtuffed with their feathers, which require a preparation for that purpoſe, by drying them well in the ſun, and when the juices, which would cauſe them to rot and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, are all exhauſted, they are put into bags, and the duſt beaten out of them with poles. Feathers form a conſiderable article of commerce, even between diſtant countries. Elder down, ſo much valued on account of its lightneſs and warmth for quilts and mattreſſes, is imported into England from Denmark, and grows beneath the feathers, upon the breaſt of thoſe ducks, that inhabit Hudſon's bay, Greenland, Iceland and Norway. Dantzic ſupplies us with a great quantity of cock and hen feathers. The down of the ſwan is brought from the ſame place, and from its ſnowy whiteneſs makes beautiful muffs and tippets. The oſtrich feathers, uſed at the inſtallation of the knights of the garter, are valued at a high price, which I ſuppoſe is cauſed by their ſcarcity. Muffs made of feathers of various kinds are beautiful, warm, and light. Sophia, can you recollect any part of the converſation that paſſed a few days ago upon the mechaniſm of feathers, and their peculiar ſuitableneſs as clothing to the inhabitants of the air?</p>

exquiſite neatneſs from head to tail, one folding over another, with the cloſeſt uniformity. As a preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative to this nicety, the feathered tribes, eſpecially water fowl, are furniſhed with a little bag, ſituated near the tail, containing an oily or unctuous matter, with which they prune and dreſs their feathers. A ſoft down lies cloſe to the body, beneath the feathers, which preſerves the bird from cold: it poſſeſſes none of the compactneſs and ſtrength of thoſe on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, that are expoſed to wind and weather.</p>

The outward vane is narrow and bending down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, whilſt the inward one is broad and turning upwards, by which it unites with the exterior vane of the next quill, which ſpreads over it. The tips are all ſloping, thoſe of the interior vanes inclining to a point, towards the outer part of the wing, and the exterior vanes towards the body; ſo that, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the pinion be extended or ſhut, the edge is as neatly ſloped, and completely finiſhed, as if trimmed conſtantly with a pair of ſciſſars.</p>

                  <p>It is with great willingneſs I comply with your requeſt, ſince I am certain your tenderneſs and humanity will never permit you to avail yourſelf of my information, to entrap or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a harmleſs bird wantonly. All creatures are given for our uſe, and are ſubject to our power; it is therefore allowable to kill them for food, or other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary purpoſes; but the boy who is capable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting pain without any other motive, than that vile and debaſing one, of beholding the ſufferings of the poor victim, is already hardened to a degree, that prepares him for the perpetration of cruelty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his fellow man, when arrived at manhood. Geeſe and ducks are caught by various means in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent countries; it would be tedious to repeat every particular method, as many of them have a great ſimilarity; but there is one, uſed both in the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies, as well as in China, that is very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; Charles is acquainted with it, and will ſave me the trouble of deſcribing it.</p>

                  <p>The fowler wades into the water up to the chin, and having his head covered with the ſkin of a dried goard, called a calabaſh, approaches the ducks, which, unmindful of this object, ſuffer him to mix among them, when he takes as many as he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, with the greateſt facility, by drawing them by the legs under the water. This method is often practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the river Ganges, ſubſtituting the earthen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Gentoos inſtead of calabaſhes: theſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are what the Gentoos boil their rice in, and are called Kutcharee pots; when once they have been u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they look upon them as defiled, and throw them into the river, where they are picked up for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I have mentioned.</p>

                  <p>The Chineſe prefer tame ducks to wild ones; and, it is ſaid, hatch great numbers by artificial heat; the eggs being laid in boxes of ſand, are placed upon a brick hearth, to which is given a proper heat during the time required for hatching

them. The ducklings are fed with the fleſh of craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh and crabs, chopped ſmall and mixed with boiled rice; in about a fortnight, they are put under the care of an old duck, which teaches them to provide for themſelves, being firſt habituated to a ſampane, or boat, from which the whole flock, often to the number of three or four hundred, thus brought up, go out to feed, and return at command. About the time of cutting the rice, and reaping the crop, theſe duck ſampanes are commonly ſeen rowing up and down the river, according to the opportunity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing food, which is found plentifully when the tide ebbs on the rice plantations, which are overflowed at high water. It is ſurpriſing to ſee thouſands of ducks, belonging to different boats, feeding upon the ſame ſpot promiſcuouſly, return at a certain ſignal to their reſpective ſampanes, without a ſingle ſtranger being found amongſt them.</p>

                  <p>You do right, Auguſta, to let nothing paſs, which you do not underſtand, without aſking for an explanation. The catching of ſmall birds, in the neighbourhood of London, is a trade followed by weavers, and other mechanics, who, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the months of March and October, exchange the cloſe confinement of garrets for a range in the open fields, where they ſubſiſt, for a time, upon the prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its of this employment. The nets they uſe are made to correſpond exactly with each other, and are gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally twelve yards long, and two and an half wide; they are conſtructed ſo as to flap over one another with ſuch velocity, as ſeldom to diſappoint their own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his prize, when the pullers are drawn. But all this apparatus would be ineffectual without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of birds to allure and ſeduce the wild ones into thoſe very ſnares in which they themſelves were once
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:036664_0200_100A60F4AA73A918"/>
caught. The emulation for ſuperiority of ſong, which excites the vocal tribes to vie with each other, is the mean uſed to enſnare them. The nets being properly laid, and ſinging birds, in ſmall cages, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced near them, the flur birds are braced by a ſilken ſtring, tied under their wings round their bodies, and by that confined to a moveable perch fixed within the nets. The office of theſe birds is to call others to a conteſt with them for excellence; upon the firſt perception of the approach of the wild birds, one of them gives notice to the reſt, which produces the ſame tumultuous joy and ecſtacy among them, as is heard in a pack of hounds upon diſcovering the ſcent. The invitation is given by what is called jerks, in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the bird catchers, and is ſo loud and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to ſtop the wild birds in their flight, and faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them to the very verge of the machinery pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for their deſtruction. Artificial means are uſed to cauſe theſe call birds to moult before the natural ſeaſon, which readers their ſong more powerful than that of others; but the proceſs is cruel, and many die under it, which enhances the value of the ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors to a ſurpriſing height: four or live guineas have been given for a ſingle ſong bird. The hens of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſpecies are killed, and ſold by the dozen for the uſe of the table; but the cocks are generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the ſake of their ſong.</p>

                  <p>The Orkney Iſles lie to the north of Scotland; multitudes of the inhabitants ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon the eggs of the birds which build upon the cliffs of the rocks, during the breeding ſeaſon: but this precarious ſupport is obtained at the utmoſt haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of their lives. The dauntleſs fowlers will aſcend the cliffs, which are of a tremendous height, and paſs from one to another with amazing dexterity. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

they are lowered from above by a rope, made either with ſtraw, or the briſtles of a hog, which they prefer even to ropes of hemp, becauſe it is not ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be cut by the ſharpneſs of the rocks. One man, who ſtands upon the edge of the precipice, lets down his companion, and holds the rope, depending on his ſtrength alone, which often fails, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer is daſhed to pieces, or periſhes in the ſea.</p>

                  <p>The Holm of Noſs is a vaſt rock, ſevered by ſome unknown convulſion of nature, from the iſland, about ſixteen fathoms diſtant. It is of the ſame ſtupendous height as the oppoſite preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, with a raging ſea between: ſeveral ſtakes have been fixed on the top of the correſponding cliffs, by ſome bold and fortunate adventurer, who muſt have attained the heights by extraordinary dexterity; a rope is faſtened to theſe ſtakes on both ſides, along which a machine, called a cradle, is contrived to ſlide; and, by the help of a ſmall parallel cord, the daring fowler wafts himſelf acroſs, and returns with his booty.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>The cliffs of the Feroe Iſlands, which lie in the Northern Ocean, and are ſubject to Denmark, are extremely high, and greatly frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſea-fowl; the eggs, feathers, and fleſh of theſe birds are the inducements which tempt the natives to explore the receſſes of theſe vaſt precipicies, both from above and below. When they purpoſe deſcending, they are furniſhed with a rope eighty or an hundred fathoms in length. The fowler faſtens one end of this line a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his waiſt and between his legs, recommends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the protection of the Almighty, and is lowered down by fix others, who place a piece of timber on the margin of the rock, to preſerve the rope from wearing againſt the ſharp edge. Their dexterity in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous employment is almoſt incredible to thoſe who have never been inured to face ſuch difficulties. They
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:036664_0202_100A60F856935BA0"/>
will place their feet againſt the front of the precipice, and dart ſome fathoms from it, with a cool eye ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the places where the birds neſtle, and again ſhoot into their haunts. Sometimes the fowler will ſpring from the rock, and with a fowling-net, placed at the end of a ſtaff, catch the old birds as they fly towards their neſts. When the dreadful taſk is finiſhed, he makes a ſignal to his friends above, by means of a ſmall line, faſtened to him for that purpoſe, and they pull him up, and ſhare the hard-earned profit. The feathers are preſerved for exportation; the fleſh is partly eaten freſh, but the greater portion is dried for winter proviſion.</p>

                  <p>At other times they begin their operations from below; the party ſet out in a boat, and proceed to the baſe of the precipice which they deſign to aſcend, when the perſon, who is to climb the rock, faſtens a rope about his waiſt, and takes with him a pole, with an iron hook fixed at one end of it, to aſſiſt him in his progreſs. Thus equipped, he climbs, or is thruſt by his companions, to the firſt ſpot where he can gain a firm footing. Here he lowers his rope, and brings up one of the boat's crew; others are hauled up in the ſame manner, and each is furniſhed with a rope and fowling-ſtaff. Their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to the higher regions is continued by the ſame means: when arrived to the heights where the birds frequent, they act in pairs; one of them faſtens him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his aſſociate's rope, and is let down to the haunts of the birds beneath him; but when the ſtrength of the man above is unequal to the taſk of drawing him up again, he is overpowered, and both inevitably periſh. The boat attends, and receives the booty. Theſe expeditions often laſt ſeveral days: the nights they paſs in the crannies of the rocks.</p>

The love of this amuſement prevailed among the ancient Britons, and deſcended to later times. The Engliſh nobility were devoted to it; a nobleman ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom appeared abroad without his hawk upon his hand; and the force of their example influenced their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, all ranks partook of it in a degree; but the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous expence that attended it, confined it principally to the great.

                  <p>Birds of prey, which feed wholly upon other creatures, are not only fierce and ſavage in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but are furniſhed with bills hooked at the end, for tearing their victims, and with ſtrong legs, and hooked ſharp claws to enable them to hold it with a firmer gripe. The bills of crows are ſtraight and ſtrong for picking: in water fowl, that live upon fiſh, they are long and pointed, for ſtriking; in others ſlender and blunt, for ſearching in the mire; and thoſe of the gooſe and duck tribe are flat and broad, for gobbling. Thoſe birds, that have long legs, have generally a long neck, or it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to reach their food from the ground. The power of retracting, bending, or ſtretching out the neck is poſſeſſed in an eminent degree by birds in general; and among other advantages that reſult from it that of poiſing themſelves in an exact equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium is none of the leaſt. There are a few birds whoſe wings are too ſhort to enable them to fly; as the oſtrich, caſſowary, penguin, &amp;c. but they aſſiſt the former in running, and the latter in ſwimming or diving, ſerving them as fins. The tail is uſed as a guide or rudder, to direct their courſe through the air; for, as the head turns one way, the tail is inclined to the oppoſite direction. It alſo poiſes their long necks and preſerves an even balance. Their peculiar abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to ſuſtain themſelves, and purſue long journies through ſo thin an element as the air, is ſaid to be aſſiſted by a power they enjoy, of enlarging their bulk when they have occaſion. This admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance is effected by air veſſels, diſperſed over vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of the body, even to the bones, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with the lungs. As theſe veſſels are fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or emptied, the body is contracted or dilated, and conſequently rendered heavier or lighter, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the bird requires. Many ſimilar obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations might be added, but at this moment I do not recollect them.</p>

powers of ſwiftneſs; were it otherwiſe, the weaker muſt always inevitably yield to the rapacity of the ſtrong and voracious. Many are preſerved by flitting from place to place with a reſtleſs agility, that the larger kinds cannot imitate; thoſe which live upon the water, ſecure themſelves by diving. Kites and hawks glide ſmoothly along; woodpeckers fly awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and by jerks, as if in danger of ſinking; but above all, I admire the elegant ſwiftneſs and agility of the ſwallow tribe; they ſeem as if they could live always upon the wing.</p>

                  <p>They are all curious, and adapted with wonderful ſagacity to the habits and wants of each inſtinctive architect. The ſtudy of neſts has indeed formed one of my moſt agreeable relaxations; but I am proud to boaſt, that I have never robbed one of thoſe anxious mothers of her treaſures, or diſturbed her in the fond office of rearing her young. The larger rapacious kinds make their neſts of ſticks and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moſt of them chuſe ſolitary places for their reſidence, ſuch as high rocks, ruined towers, &amp;c. a few of them build upon the ground. Parrots, and all birds with two toes forward and two behind, lay their eggs in holes of trees. Crows build in trees. The neſt of the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, though compoſed of rude materials, is made with exquiſite art, covered with thorns, like defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive armour, and only a ſmall hole left for an entrance. The oſtrich is celebrated for neglecting her young; ſhe lays her eggs upon the ſand, and abandons them to chance. The mode and place of building among ſmall birds vary; ſome build in buſhes, others in holes of walls, or upon banks, and ſome upon the ground. Swallows make a curious neſt, different from any other. Clay, moiſtened with water, is the material they uſe. The Chineſe eat the neſts of one of this ſpecies, which are formed of a glutinous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and eſteem it a great delicacy. Web-footed fowl

breed on the ground. Ducks ſtrip the down from their own breaſts to prepare a ſoft bed for their young. In very hot climates, where monkeys and ſerpents abound, many birds uſe a wonderful precaution to ſecure their young from their treacherous attacks; they build a pendulous neſt hanging at the end of a bough, too ſlender to ſupport their dreaded enemies.</p>

                  <p>The taylor bird, a native of the Eaſt Indies, makes a very extraordinary neſt of that kind; ſhe picks up a dead leaf, and ſews it to the ſide of one growing upon a tree; her ſlender bill is the needle, and ſome fine fibres her thread.

                  <p>The honey bee, for there are many kinds, is divided into three parts, conſiſting of the head, the breaſt, and the belly, which are united by two ligaments. The eyes are black, and of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long form, guarded by a horny tunicle or covering. The horns, moſtly called antennae, are placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the eyes, near the middle of the head, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the inſect in feeling his way, where the eyes are uſeleſs, for want of light. The jaws open ſideways, and, being armed with teeth, ſerve to remove every thing offenſive or inconvenient that is found in the live. In their wars with each other, they uſe their teeth, and the wounds they inflict with them are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be fatal. Their long trunk, or proboſcis, is of very curious conſtruction; it enables them to penetrate the inſide of flowers, and extract their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:036664_0209_100A610796AB96C0"/>
juice; it is long and taper, and ſo pliant and flexible, that it can be contracted and folded up at pleaſure. Four ſtrong ſcales are contrived to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this valuable member from injury two of which form a ſheath to it, whilſt the whole is incloſed in the larger pair. From the breaſt, which is of a duſky colour and oblong form, proceed two wings, and three legs on each ſide. The belly is divided into ſix rings, or folds, which, by ſliding over one another, ſerve to ſhorten or lengthen the body. Beſides the inteſtines, it contains a bag, which is uſed as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle for the honey they collect. The juices of flowers are conveyed into this bag from the proboſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, through a narrow pipe, which paſſes the head and breaſt. The legs are finiſhed, in every part, with the greateſt nicety; the hindermoſt ones are hairy, and ſtreaked croſswiſe on the inſide. Within the thigh of the working bee is a hollow place, edged with hair, where the bee loads the materials for wax in little pellets, as large as a pepper-corn. Each foot terminates in two hooks, with the points oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to each other: between theſe claws is a little, thin ſubſtance, which, when unfolded, enables the inſect to faſten to glaſs, or any other highly-poliſhed body. The ſting is ſituated at the extremity of the belly, and is compoſed of two bearded darts, incloſed in a horny ſheath, which has an opening near the end, for the paſſage of the darts; at the root of the ſting is placed a ſmall bag, filled with a venomous liquor, which is emitted through the ſheath into the wound made previouſly by the darts. Mr. Derham, who is celebrated for curious microſcopical obſervations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that he counted eight beards, like thoſe of fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks, upon each dart in the ſting of a waſp; and the ſame number may be ſeen, with good glaſſes, in that of a bee. One of theſe darts is rather longer than the other, and pierces the fleſh firſt; the other follows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly. They penetrate deeper and deeper, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, with their beards or hooks, till the whole ſting is buried in the fleſh, and then the inſertion of the poiſonous juice finiſhes the proceſs. If the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:036664_0210_100A61093B518FE8"/>
who is ſtung, has preſence of mind to remain ſtill, the bee inſtinctively draws the beards cloſe to the ſides of the darts, and the ſting comes out whole; but if the inſect is diſturbed, and attempts to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the ſting haſtily, the beards prevent its return, and it is generally left in the wound, which increaſes the pain, and retards the cure.</p>

                  <p>The body of the queen bee is longer and larger than that of the reſt of the ſwarm. As ſhe ſeldom leaves the hive, except for the purpoſe of ſettling a new colony, ſhe has but little occaſion for dexterity in flying; her wings are indeed but ill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to that exerciſe, being ſhort, and ſcarcely reaching beyond the middle of her body, the hinder part of which is more taper, and terminates ſharper than the bodies of the other bees. The under part of her belly and her legs are of a brilliant gold col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. She is the mother of the hive, as well as its ſovereign, and is followed, wherever ſhe goes, with the moſt dutiful obedience, by her children and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. A hive cannot ſubſiſt without a queen, as ſhe is the only female which produces eggs; nor do they ever permit more than one of them to remain alive in the ſame hive. If ſhe happens to find a rival, they ſight till one is killed, being armed with a powerful ſting, which ſhe ſeldom uſes, except in conteſts for empire, or when unuſually provoked. The queen bee is very prolific, laying ſeveral thouſand eggs ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſeaſon: ſhe generally lies concealed in the moſt ſecret part of the hive, and is never viſible, but when ſhe depoſits her eggs in thoſe combs which are expoſed to view. She is always attended by ten or a dozen of the common bees, which form a kind of retinue; theſe courtiers follow their miſtreſs with a ſolemn pace, in her progreſs from one cell to anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. She examines, with care, the cell where ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to leave an egg, leſt there ſhould be honey, wax, or any embryo in it. If ſhe find it empty, ſhe fixes a ſmall white egg to the bottom of it, which is compoſed of a thin membrane, or ſkin, filled with a whitiſh liquor. Should the queen inadvertantly lay more than one egg in the ſame cell, her attendants, the working bees, remove the ſupernumerary one. When a queen dies accidentally, the whole commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity deſiſts from its accuſtomed labour, conſumes the ſtore of honey, and its members fly about their own hive, and others that are near them, at thoſe hours when they ſhould be at reſt; they pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>He made uſe of words only to deceive the ſpectators; the magical wand which he uſed, to transfer them from place to place, was the queen bee. He placed all his dependence upon their fidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and attachment to her; for he knew, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe was carried, the ſwarm would certainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Repeated experiments taught him, that after turning up a hive, and tapping it upon the ſides and the bottom, the queen immediately appeared, to know the cauſe of the alarm, but ſoon retired again among her people. By ſeeing her frequently, he learned to diſtinguiſh her at the firſt glance, and practice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled him to lay hold of her ſo tenderly as not to endanger her perſon: having thus ſecured the queen, he ſlipped her gently into his left hand, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring her, or enraging her to ſting him. Then he replaced the hive, and retained her as his priſoner, till ſhe was miſſed by the bees, who, as ſoon as they perceived their loſs, took wing with the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion;

whilſt they were ſeeking their beloved ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, he placed her upon the ſpot he wiſhed them to ſettle. The moment ſhe was diſcovered by a few, they gave notice to the reſt, till the joyful news was communicated to the whole tribe, upon which they all aſſembled round her, and remained a long while in that ſituation, as if afraid of being deprived of her again.</p>

He would catch them with his bare hands, without fear of their ſtings; then he would diſarm them of their weapons, and ſuck their bodies for the ſake of their honey-bags; nay, ſo far would he carry his temerity, that he would ſometimes fill his boſom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his ſhirt and his ſkin, with a number of them. He would ſlide into gardens where bees were kept, and, ſitting down before the ſtools, would rap with his fingers upon the hives, and ſo take the bees as they came out. He has been known to overturn hives for the ſake of the honey, of which he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately fond; and, as if his imagintion was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by this one object, he had a habit of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the buzzing of bees with his lips, as he ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the fields and gardens.</p>

                  <p>The common drones, though ſmaller than the queen, are larger than the working bees; and in flying make a greater noiſe; they have no ſting, neither are their proboſcis or feet adapted for collecting wax and honey. They are the males, and are found in the hives only at certain periods of the year. Economy impels the working bees to deſtroy the drones at the approach of winter; they do not even ſuffer an egg or a maggot of that kind to eſcape, but exterminate the whole race, as uſeleſs, after the ſeaſon for increaſing the young ſtock is paſt, and they begin to provide a magazine, to ſupply the ſwarm with food during the cold weather, when no freſh honey can be procured. The working bees are the moſt numerous part of the ſtate; they have the care of the hive, collect the honey and wax, make and work up the wax, build the cells, feed the young, keep the hive clean, defend it from intruders, and perform every thing neceſſary to be done for the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit of the commonwealth. As the labourers are the guardians of the hive, the ſting is a requiſite weapon for them to reſiſt the attacks of their enemies; for there are many lazy, greedy inſects, which will attempt to devour them, as well as their honey.</p>

                  <p>On the third or fourth day after the egg is laid, a worm or maggot is produced, which, when it is grown ſo large as to touch the oppoſite corner of the cell, coils itſelf up into the ſhape of a ſemicircle, and floats in a liquid, which ſuſtains it, and promotes its growth. The working bees are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attentive in ſupplying the worms with a ſufficient quantity of this liquor, which is conjectured, by ſome naturaliſts, to be a mixture of water with the juices of plants and flowers, collected purpoſely for the nouriſhment of the young, whilſt in that helpleſs, tender ſtate. The working bees continue to feed the worm for about eight days, till one end touches the other in the form of a ring; when it begins to feel
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:036664_0215_100A6116C9489A28"/>
the firſt poſture uneaſy, it ceaſes to eat, and unrolls itſelf by degrees, thruſting that end forward towards the mouth of the cell, which is to be the head. The taſk of the attendant bees is now changed from that of feeding the worm, to faſtening up the top of the cell with a lid of wax, and cheriſhing the brood, and advancing the approaching transformation by their natural heat. In this concealment, the worm pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares a web of ſilk in the manner of the ſilk-worm. This web forms a lining to the cell, and affords a convenient covering for the change of the worm into a nymph or chryſalis. In the ſpace of eighteen or twenty days, the change is effected, and the bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to extricate itſelf from its dark and narrow priſon, by forcing its way with its teeth through the lid of the cell. One horn appears firſt, then the head, and, at laſt, the whole body. This expanſion to life and liberty is ſometimes the work of half a day. The bee, when releaſed from its fetters, ſtands upon the ſurface of the comb, till it has acquired its natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al complexion, and a degree of vigour and maturity to enable it to labour. The reſt of the bees gather round it in this ſtate, celebrate its birth, and feed it with honey out of their own mouths. The ſhell of the chryſalis, and the ſcattered pieces of wax, which are left in the cell, are removed by the working bees; and the receptacle is no ſooner cleared from the relies of its former inhabitant, and ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive another, but the queen again depoſits an egg in it. The hair, which covers the bodies of the young bees, being whitiſh, cauſes them to have the appearance of a grey colour; but they gradually loſe that hue, and become brown.</p>

                  <p>As the eggs, which are deſtined to become drones, are to produce larger inſects than thoſe of the common bees, ſo they are laid in cells of more extenſive dimenſions, and their coverings are raiſed convex, like a ſmall dome, whilſt the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are flat rooſed. Thoſe cells, which are intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the reception of the royal maggots, are built upon a very different model to any of the reſt; they
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:036664_0216_100A6118548AD5B8"/>
are of a longiſh oblong form, having one end bigger than the other, with their outward ſurface full of little cavities. They are ſometimes fixed in the middle, and at other times in the ſide of a comb. Several common cells are ſacrificed to form a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and ſupport to it. As ſoon as the young queen comes out of her cell, it is deſtroyed, and the vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy filled up with common cells; but, as the baſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, the comb is found thicker in that part than in any other. There are apartments prepared in every hive for the rearing of ſeveral queens, leſt, by any accident, they ſhould be deprived of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign miſtreſs, and have none to replace her. When the members of the commonwealth are become too numerous for the extent of their city, by the addition of the young brood, a part of them, conducted by one of the young queens, leaves the parent ſtate, and ſeeks a more convenient ſituation elſewhere. A new ſwarm is always compoſed of a queen, ſeveral thouſand working bees, among which there is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of old and young, and ſome hundreds of drones. The moment the colony has choſen a new reſidence, the labourers begin to work with the utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to procure materials for food and building. Apparently conſcious that their queen is ready to lay her eggs, they are more anxious to provide cells for her progeny, than for ſtoring of honey. Such is their induſtry, that they will form combs twenty inches in length, and proportionably wide, in the ſpare of a night and a day. If the weather is favourable, they make more wax during the firſt fortnight, than in all the reſt of the ſeaſon.</p>

I have ſeen whole hives en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a pitched battle, when one ſtate has been, by ſome circumſtance, plundered of its honied ſtore, hunger and neceſſity have compelled its members to ſeek a freſh ſupply in a neighbouring hive, from which they have been vigorouſly driven away by its owners.

                  <p>The little knowledge I have, you will be welcome to; and it will give me great pleaſure to be your aſſociate in this ſcheme, the plan of which we will arrange hereafter. A hive of bees may, with propriety, he compared to a well-peopled city, in which are commonly found from fifteen to eighteen thouſand inhabitants, ſubſiſting under the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect diſcipline of wiſe laws. The regulation of labour among them is very exact. They are divided into
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:036664_0218_100A611BD194E678"/>
four companies, one of which roves in the fields in ſearch of materials for building; another is employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in laying out the baſes and partitions of their cells; a third is occupied in poliſhing and ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſides of them; and the fourth compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny brings food for the reſt, or relieves thoſe which return oppreſſed with their burdens. But the ſame bees are not confined conſtantly to the ſame la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Their taſks are frequently changed. Thoſe which have been engaged in the hive are indulged in making excurſions abroad, whilſt thoſe which have enjoyed the wholeſome freſhneſs of the air, ſubmit, without reluctance, to confinement within. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear either to have a language of their own, or to underſtand one another by ſigns. When one of them is in want of food, it bends down its trunk to the bee, from whom it expects aſſiſtance, whilſt this laſt opens its honey-bag, and ſuffers ſome drops to fall for the needy one, which ſtands ready to receive it. So ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably is the work diſtributed, and ſo great is their diligence, that in the ſpace of a day, they are able to build apartments, ſufficiently numerous to contain three thouſand inhabitants.</p>

                  <p>The advantage of order and regular ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement is ſhewn in the policy of this ſmall inſect. Were the bees guided by no rule, inſtead of provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the accommodation of ſuch numerous inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants, confuſion a muſt perplex their deſigns, and they would interrupt one onother in the progreſs of their work, like the builders of the Tower of Babel.</p>

                  <p>Their ſagacity in conſtructing and diſtributing their cells is equally admirable. In their manner of building, the bees have attained three eſſential points aimed at by all good architects; the two firſt of which are, the greateſt poſſible economy of room and materials; and the laſt is to procure all the accommodation that can be obtained in the ſpace allowed for the edifice. The form of their cells is a hexagon, or figure of ſix equal ſides. If you exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine it, you will ſee, that the circumference of one cell makes part of the circumference of thoſe adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     </gap> which can be loſt, where there is no void between the apartments. The third advantage will be more difficult to your comprehenſion, as it depends upon mathematical knowledge; but thoſe who are ſkilled in that ſcience, tell us, that the hex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agon affords more ſpace than any other figure that can be joined together. Their frugality induces them to make the partition very thin; but they ſtrength<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The combs lie parallel to each other, and there is left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween every one of them a ſpace which ſerves as a ſtreet, broad enough for two bees to paſs by each other. There are alſo holes which go quite through the combs, and may be compared to lanes, for them to paſs from one comb to another, without being obliged to go a great way about.</p>

method of returning it, when they want it for uſe; and it is only when in this ſoft and pliant ſtate, that they can apply it properly in the making of combs. It is ſuppoſed, by the quantities they collect, that a great deal of it is laid up for food. In this ſtate it is known by the name of bee-bread.</p>

                  <p>The crude wax, by which I mean the material which they ſwallow to make wax, is not always yellow, but varies according to the flowers from which it is gathered. The combs are at firſt white, but are changed to yellow, by the ſteam and impurities ariſing from ſo many inſects confined in one place. Honey, which is their principal treaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, is originally a juice digeſted in plants, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udes through their pores, and exiſts chiefly in their flowers, or in reſervoirs, called honey-cups, of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous forms, and differently ſituated in different flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The bees obtain the honey, either by penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into theſe receſſes, or they collect it when expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the ſurface of the flower. This precious ſpoil is carried home in their ſtomachs; ſo that, though heavily laden, they appear, to a ſuperficial obſerver, as if they had procured nothing by their excurſion. Bees are equally fond of another ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, called honey-dew, of which there are two kinds, both being produced upon vegetables, though ariſing from different cauſes. The firſt kind, which is commonly ſuppoſed to be a dew, that falls upon trees, is nothing but a mild, ſweet juice, which, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circulated through the veſſels of vegetables, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſeparated in reſervoirs in the flowers, or on the leaves, where it is properly called the honey-dew. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it reſides in the pith, as in the ſugar-cane; and at others in the juice of pulpy ſummer fruits, when ripe. Manna, which is found on the aſh and maple trees of Calabria, iſſuing from their leaves and trunks, is a ſpecies of honey-dew. The ſecond kind is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by a ſmall inſect, and ſupplies the bees with a reſource, when the ſpring flowers are gone, and the dew, which tranſpires from the plants is no longer to be obtained.</p>

                  <p>There is yet another ſubſtance collected and uſed by bees, but I cannot ſay, with any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where they procure it; ſome ſuppoſe, that they meet with it on the birch, the willow, and the pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. It is a reſinous gum of a more gluey quality than wax, and different from it in many reſpects. The uſe to which they apply it, is to plaſter the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of their hives, and to fill up the moſt minute crannies, that may chance to be in them. It was called by the ancients propolis. When they begin to work with it, it is ſoft, but in length of time acquires a brown colour, and becomes much harder than wax.</p>

                  <p>As ſoon as they reach the hive with a load of honey, they depoſit it in an empty cell. They have two ſorts of ſtore-houſes, one is filled only with honey, that is intended for the ſupply of accidental wants; the other contains their winter ſtore, which they are careful to preſerve, by ſeveral ſagacious precaut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is, in each cell, a thicker ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſomething like a cream, which is placed over the honey, to prevent it from running out; this gradually riſes as the cell is filled; when it reaches the top, the bees cloſe up the cell with a covering of wax, and it remains untouched, till neceſſity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels them to have recourſe to it.</p>

                  <p>It is wonderful to ſee them hang by one another in a heap or cluſter, when they ſettle in a ſwarm. I cannot think how the bees, from which the others ſuſpend themſelves, can bear ſo great a weight.</p>

                  <p>When a ſwarm divides into two cluſters, it is a ſure proof that there are two queens among them, one of which muſt be deſtroyed before they will unite and ſettle quietly. Their inſtinct is as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable in providing for their own ſafety and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being in ſome other reſpects, as in thoſe I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready remarked. They defend the hives from the intruſion of other inſects, by gluing up every avenue by which they might gain an entrance; and ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels are appointed to watch the mouth of the hive,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:036664_0223_100A6128F1A32F10"/>
to prevent the admiſſion of a ſtranger; but if a ſnail, or other large inſect, ſhould, by any means elude their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance, they ſting it to death, and incruſt it with a coat of propolis, to prevent maggots, or a diſagreeable ſmell iſſuing from the putrefaction of ſo large an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. It is conjectured, that bees are ſenſible of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of bad weather. You may ſometimes ſee them, though ever ſo buſy at work, ſuddenly deſiſt from their labour, and return home in ſuch crowds, that the door of their habitation cannot admit them. Look at the ſky, and you will perceive the cauſe of all this buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in the gathering of ſmall clouds that foretel rain. It is ſaid, that no bee is ever caught even in a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſhower, unleſs at a great diſtance from home, or in a ſick or diſabled ſtate. They crowd together in the middle of the hive, in order to protect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the effect of cold, which is very injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them. Upon every occaſion, they appear to be endued with a ſagacity ſuperior to moſt other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects, of whoſe economy we are informed.</p>

                  <p>Linnaeus enumerates fifty-five; ſome of which live in ſociety, whilſt others dwell and labour in ſolitude, building cradles for the reception of their infant progeny; as the leaf-cutter bee does with the leaf of the roſe-tree; the upholſterer, with the gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy tapeſtry of the corn-roſe; the maſon-bee with a plaſter: and the wood-piercer with ſaw-duſt. Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are their modes of building, as well as the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials they uſe, according to their different inſtincts, and the climates they inhabit. The honey-bee, which has taken up ſo much of our attention, is, in ſome degree, domeſticated, and its manners differ from thoſe in a wild ſtate, as hives are provided by man for it to build its comb in.</p>

                  <p>The management of bees is an art, which would take up too much of our time to define, but ſome obſervations relative to it, will ſerve to illuſtrate what has already been ſaid. The firſt

care is to chuſe a ſituation for the apiary, that is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too much expoſed to the rays of the ſun, or to the cold. A ſupply of food is the next conſideration, which greatly depends upon the abundance of thoſe plants in the neighbourhood which yield honey in plenty. Thyme, heath, and broom are thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for the purpoſe, as well as many others which I ſhall paſs over. As ſome ſituations are deficient in this reſpect, at certain ſeaſons, contrivances have been uſed, in countries where bees form an eſſential branch of agricultural economy, to remove them from one place to another. In many parts of France, it is not unuſual to ſee floating bee-houſes. They will put from ſixty to a hundred hives on board one barge, well defended from the injuries that might be occaſioned by an accidental ſtorm. By this convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, they float gently down the river, feeding on the flowery paſtures on its banks, and, by the honey they collect during the voyage, repay their owner for the trouble of removing them.</p>

The productions of ſpring are full ſix weeks forwarder in Upper Egypt, which induces the bee owners of the lower diviſion to embark their hives on the Nile, at the proper ſeaſon for reaping the benefit of the advanced ſtate of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in that country, and to bring them back time enough to collect the rich produce of the fields in their own neighbourhood,</p>

                  <p>This is one, among numberleſs inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of the improvement that animals receive, from living under the government of man.

the winter, when they cannot provide themſelves a ſubſiſtence abroad. Though bees are pretty much in this ſtate, and eat little, whilſt cold weather laſts, yet, if their honey is taken away, they require to be ſupplied with a ſufficiency for their ſupport, or they muſt inevitably periſh.</p>

                  <p>It is a common practice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy theſe induſtrious, uſeful inſects, when their hives are plundered, by digging a hole near them, and putting a ſtick into the hole, at the end of which is faſtened a rag, that has been dipped in melted brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, the rag is ſet on fire, the hive is placed over it, and the earth is immediately thrown up all around, ſo that none of the ſmoke eſcapes. In a quarter of an hour all the poor bees appear to be dead, and are ſoon irrecoverably ſo, by being buried in the earth, that is returned back into the hole.</p>

                  <p>Many ingenious perſons have applied their talents to the invention of ſchemes to prevent this cruelty. The moſt elegant and ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that I have ſeen, is effected by placing a flat, round board, perforated with holes, ſufficiently large for the bees to paſs eaſily through, over the hive; upon this board ſtands a glaſs, formed a little like a flower-pot, ſmalleſt at bottom, and expanding at top; this may be covered by another board, to ſerve as a foundation for a ſecond glaſs; additional ſtories, in like manner, diminiſhing in ſize till they form a pyramid, may likewiſe be raiſed to what height the owner pleaſes. When the bees have filled their hive, they continue to work upwards, filling not only the glaſs hives, riſing one above another, but alſo ſmall bell glaſſes, placed over holes made at the edges of the boards, till they are all ſtored with wax and honey; which is obtained by removing theſe glaſſes when full, and placing empty ones in
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:036664_0226_100A612FEB696740"/>
their ſtead; the bees, finding room and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the young ſwarms, remain in their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without attempting to colonize. This appara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus is expenſive, and for that reaſon can be adopted only by perſons of fortune; but wooden hives, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed upon a ſimilar principle, will probably, in time, come into general uſe, as they will be found to unite profit with convenience.</p>

                  <p>I read a wonderful account, a little while ago, in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, of a bird, found in the interior parts of Africa, called the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator, or honey guide, which directs travellers to the ſpot where honey is to be found. It is a ſpecies of cuckow, but much ſmaller than that which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents Europe. Honey being its favourite food, it is prompted by ſelf intereſt to point out the place where the booty is concealed, as it is generally repaid for its intelligence, by a part of the ſpoil. The morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the evening are the times in which it ſearches for food, and it is then heard calling, in a ſhrill tone, cherr, cherr; a note which immediately draws the attention of the honey-hunters, as they conſider it a ſignal for the chace. From time to time they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with a ſoft whiſtle, which the bird hearing, continues its note. As ſoon as it perceives the men, it flutters gradually to the place where the bees are ſituated, continually repeating its former call of cherr, cherr: nay, if it ſhould happen to have advanced conſiderably before the hunters, who are very liable to be impeded by buſhes, rivers, &amp;c. it returns to them again, and redoubles its note, as if to ſtimulate them to more activity. At laſt the bird is obſerved to hover for a few moments over a particular ſpot, and then to retire ſilently to a neighbouring buſh, or reſting place, and the hunters are ſure of finding the bee's neſt in that identical ſpot; whether it be in a tree, or in the crevice of a rock; or (as is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the caſe) in the earth. Whilſt the hunters are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy in taking the honey, the bird is ſeen looking on attentively to what is going forward, and waiting for its ſhare of the ſpoil; the bee-hunters never fail to
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:036664_0227_100A6132147D50C8"/>
leave a ſmall portion for their conductor, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly take care not to give him ſufficient to ſatisfy his hunger, but only a taſte, that may incite him to ſeek for another neſt.</p>

                  <p>The inſtinct of this cuckow is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, and properly introduced. Wax and honey are the productions which invite men to plunder the ſtores of the bees. Wax forms a very conſiderable article of commerce, the quantity of it conſumed in the different parts of Europe being almoſt incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There are two kinds of it, uſed for different purpoſes, white and yellow; the firſt is bleached by art, the laſt is as it comes from the hive. After the honey is taken out of the comb, the remaining mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is put into a kettle, with a ſufficient quantity of water, then it is melted over a moderate fire, and ſtrained through a linen cloth, by means of a preſs; the ſcum is taken off before it is cold, and it is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into moulds made of wood, earthen-ware, or met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. The bleaching of wax, or rendering it white, is performed by ſpreading it into very thin cakes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them on linen cloths to the air, both night and day, for the dew is as effectual in whitening it as the ſun. When they are perfectly blanched by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, they are melted for the laſt time, and caſt, with a ladle, upon a table, covered over with little round dents, or cavities, of the ſize and form of the cakes of white wax ſold in the apothecaries' ſhops. This wax is uſed for candles, torches, tapers, flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaux, figures, and other wax works. It is alſo an ingredient neceſſary in incauſtic paintings. Plaſters, cerates, and ſalves acquire a conſiſtency by being mixed with it; and, in ſome caſes, it is adminiſtered internally.</p>

that remained uncovered. Then I threw plaſter of Paris over it as quickly as I could, making a thick coat; when this hardens, half the mould is formed; the other half may be obtained in the ſame manner. After I had finiſhed my moulds, I joined them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and poured a little melted coloured wax into them, through a hole, which I made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and then ſhook it about till the inſide was lined with the wax.

                  <p>There are few ſtudies of more import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to hiſtory, than that of medals. The evidence upon which the veracity of an hiſtorian muſt reſt, is ſuch corroborating teſtimony as is manifeſt to every body, and cannot be falſified. Public memoirs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to ambaſſadors, and other ſtate papers, confirm the veracity of modern hiſtory: ſuch memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials are, however, liable to accidents, and by remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally in the countries where they were firſt publiſhed, are incapable of giving that univerſal ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction, that ſhould authenticate genuine hiſtory. Public buildings, inſcriptions, and ſtatues, are more durable monuments; but theſe are generally obliged, from the nature of things, to remain in particular countries, ſo that medals alone have the qualities of giving infallible teſtimony to truth, of poſſeſſing the capacity of being diffuſed over all countries, and of remaining through the lateſt ages; aſcertaining dates, and arranging the order of events. Geography ſometimes receives light from medals, their inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

On many of the Greek medals are repreſentations of ſeveral uncommon plants, as well as animals: thoſe of Tyre, in particular, preſerve the form of the ſhell-fiſh, from which the famous purple was procured. The architect receives advantage from the ſtudy of medals, by the exact delineation of many noble edifices, that no longer exiſt, which are ſeen upon ſome of them. It is eaſy to comprehend their general uſe, upon many ſubjects connected with a knowledge of ancient events and times.

                  <p>I will endeavour to recal them to my memory. Happineſs has ſometimes the Caduceus, or wand of Mercury, which was drought to procure whatever was deſired. In a gold coin of Severus, ſhe has the heads of poppies, to expreſs, that the greateſt bliſs conſiſts in the forgetfulneſs of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Hope is repreſented as a ſprightly girl walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quickly, and looking ſtraight forward. With
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:036664_0231_100A613A30C32780"/>
her left hand ſhe holds up her garments, that they may not impede her pace. Whilſt in her right hand ſhe diſplays the bud of a flower, as an emblem of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture good. Abundance is imaged as a ſedate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, ſcattering fruits out of a cornucopia. Security ſtands leaning upon a pillar, by which it ſignifies her being free from all deſigns or purſuits: the poſture in which ſhe appears, correſponds with her name. A ſhip ſailing before a proſperous breeze, was the ſymbol of national happineſs. Much taſte and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity are diſplayed in ſeveral others, but I am not able to recollect them.</p>

                  <p>It was not unuſual to perſonify the provinces of the Roman empire on medals, as well as their principal rivers. There is one colonial medal of Auguſtus and Agrippa, ſo remarkable for the diſplay of poetical imagery, that I cannot reſiſt giving you a deſcription of it. The conqueſt of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica is repreſented, on the reverſe, by the metaphor of a crocodile, an animal then ſuppoſed to be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to that country, which is chained to a palm-tree, at once a native of the country, and ſymbolic of victory.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>Very well anſwered. Money is the general name for that medium which the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants of different nations have agreed to receive in exchange for commodities; and is an invention ſo ancient, that the commencement of its uſe cannot be aſcertained. When mankind ſpread over the face of the earth, and were no longer one family, they were obliged to exchange their poſſeſſions, in order that each one ſhould obtain a ſhare of the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of life. An example will explain the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that reſulted from this plan. I will ſuppoſe that three perſons, A. B. and C. lived in the ſame neighbourhood. A. poſſeſſed an ox, but was in great want of a garment. B. had a coat to ſpare, but was without a houſe, nor did he know how to build one. C. underſtood the conſtruction of ſuch houſes as were
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:036664_0233_100A613E5A3E23C0"/>
then in uſe, and ſtood in need of both food and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Theſe three perſons met, to endeavour to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a bargain, but found it impractible to ſatisfy the wants of each other by exchange. A. offered his ox to B. for his coat, but he refuſed it, becauſe C. would not exert his talent in building, unleſs he could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cloathing as well as food. Charles, tell me by what means this difficulty would have been ſettled.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>CHARLES.</speaker>
                  <p>Money would have rendered it eaſy; A. in that caſe, might have ſold his ox, and purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed B.'s coat with part of the price, whilſt B. might have recompenſed the ingenuity and induſtry of C. with a ſum that would have enabled him to buy food and raiment.</p>

                  <p>Although ſeveral nations of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, Africa, and America, make uſe of ſhells and fruits as ſmall money to this day, yet it is reaſonable to conclude, that as ſoon as metals were diſcovered, they were generally applied to this purpoſe, from their ſuperiority in the qualities of firmneſs, neatneſs, and durability.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>In rude ages, the money they uſed was conſiſtent with their manners, rough and unpoliſhed, both as to the material and the form. It is ſuppoſed, that when metal was firſt employed as an inſtrument of barter, that thoſe who intended to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe goods, carried a maſs of it with them to the place of ſale, and provided themſelves with inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to cut off a ſufficient quantity for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but they ſoon felt the neceſſity of having the pieces ready cut and weighed. As ſociety advanced, fraud obliged the different governments, or rulers of the ſtates, to affix their ſtamp upon theſe pieces of metal, to ſhew that they were genuine. Among other ſubſtances uſed for money in very ancient time, was ſtamped leather; and, in later periods, neceſſity has driven civilized nations to have recourſe to ſubſtitutes of very inferior value. The Hollanders coined great quantities of paſteboard, in the year 1574. Iron bars, quenched with vinegar, ſerved the Lacedemonians for money, and our anceſtors, the ancient Britons, uſed plates and rings, made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Their form, as well as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon them, varies in different countries. In Spain they have coins of an irregular figure. In ſome parts of the Indies they are ſquare, and in others of a globular form. The ſhekel of the Jews was ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on one ſide with the golden pot that held the manna, and on the other with Aaron's rod. The Dardans ſtamped two cocks fighting. The Athenian coins were marked with an owl or an ox. Thoſe of Aegina with a tortoiſe. The Romans ſometimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed theirs with the image of perſons who had been eminent; but this compliment was never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the living, till after the fall of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, when flattery induced them to ſtamp their coin on one ſide with the head of the reigning em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and ſince that time the cuſtom has become univerſal among civilized nations, that of the Turks and other Mahometans excepted; who, on account of their diſapprobation of images, inſcribe only the name of their prince, with the year of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration of Mahomet, their prophet.</p>

                  <p>Guineas were firſt coined in King Charles the Second's reign, and had their name from the gold, of which they were made, being brought from that part of Africa called Guinea. The firſt coinage of ſhillings was made by Henry the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, in 1503. Halfpence and farthings were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly ſtruck in ſilver by Edward the Firſt, in 1280. The coinage of gold was not generally adopted by the ſtates of Europe before the year 1320, when it was introduced into England by Edward the Third:</p>

                  <p>I ſuppoſe the diſcovery of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can continent contributed greatly to increaſe the gold and ſilver coin circulated in Europe.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>The profuſion of the precious metals that flowed into Europe from the mines of South-America, reduced their value, and rendered a greater quantity of them requiſite to purchaſe the
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:036664_0235_100A614383D1EBA8"/>
neceſſaries of life. Had the Europeans received no other advantages from this diſcovery, it might have been queſtioned, whether it had not produced more evil than good. Agriculture, manufactures, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, form the true riches of nations; theſe are promoted by a due proportion of gold and ſilver, uſed as a medium in barter; but corn and wool, and other commodities, are the real ſources of wealth to a community.</p>

                  <p>Since nothing can be purchaſed without money, I wonder why poor people do not learn the art of making it, eſpecially when they are in great diſtreſs, and want every thing to make them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</p>

                  <p>It is a capital crime to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the coin of the realm. The privilege of coining is one of the royal prerogatives; but if an individual, who poſſeſſes a maſs of either gold or ſilver, has an inclination to convert it into money, he may take it to the Tower, where the Britiſh coinage is now wholly performed, and it will be returned to him in coin, weight for weight, without incurring any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. Charles, as I lately carried you to the Mint, which is the office for coining, I expect you will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain us with a recital of the manner in which this art is performed.</p>

                  <p>After they have taken the laminae, or plates of metal, out of the mould into which they are caſt, they make them paſs and repaſs between the ſeveral rollers of the laminating engine, which by being brought gradually cloſer to each other, give the plates an even and exact thickneſs. The work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man then makes uſe of a ſteel inſtrument called a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan; it is hollow, and of a roundiſh figure, with ſharp edges, to cut out as many planchets or circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pieces of metal as the plate contains. In order to prepare theſe planchets for receiving the deſigned im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, they are compared with ſtandard pieces, to ſee that they are of proper weight; then the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous part of the metal is filed or ſcraped off; and laſtly, they are boiled and made clean, before they
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:036664_0236_100A37098553C118"/>
are conveyed to the machine for marking them upon the edge. The principal pieces of this machine are two laminae, or thin plates of steel, about a line thick. One half of the inſcription is engraved on the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of one of the laminae, and the other half on the thickneſs of the other. Theſe ſheets of ſteel, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minae, as they are called, are ſtraight, although the planchets to be marked with them are circular. One of theſe laminae is fixed tight with ſcrews, whilſt the other ſlides by means of a dented wheel. When they ſtamp a planchet, it is placed between the laminae in ſuch a manner, that the edge of the planchet may touch the two laminae on each ſide, and that each of them, as well as the planchet, lies flat upon a cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per plate, which is faſtened upon a very thick wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en table. The ſliding laminae cauſes the planchet to turn ſo, that the edge receives the impreſſion, when it has made one turn. Crown and half-crown pieces, only, are thick enough to bear inſcriptions on their edges. The coining engine, or mill, puts the finiſhing ſtroke to the piece. This machine is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, that a ſingle man may ſtamp twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand planchets in one day. Gold, ſilver, and cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, are all of them coined with a mill, to which the coining ſquares, commonly called dies are faſtened; that of the face beneath, in a ſquare box faſtened with ſcrews, and the reverſe above; in a little box fixed in a ſimilar manner, the planchet is fixed upon the ſquare of the effigy, ſo as to receive an impreſſion on both ſides, in the twinkling of an eye, by turning the mill once round. Thus completed, the coin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes an examination of the mint-wardens, who are officers appointed for that purpoſe, and then is uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into circulation. I fear my account is ſcarcely clear enough to be underſtood, but it is the plaineſt I can give you, unleſs you could ſee the machine.</p>

                  <p>The ſame proceſs is obſerved in the coining of medals, but with this difference, that money, requiring but a ſmall relievo, is perfected at a ſingle ſtroke of the engine; but for medals, it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:036664_0237_100A6145619ADC08"/>
to be repeated ſeveral times for the ſake of heightening the relievo; between each ſtroke the planchet is taken out from between the dies, heated, and returned again, ſometimes fifteen or twenty times. Medallions, and medals of a high relievo, are frequently caſt firſt in ſand, becauſe of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of giving them a full impreſſion in the mill, where they are put only to receive a delicate finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which the ſand ſeldom gives them.</p>

The method then adopted was leſs commodious, not ſo expeditious, and in every reſpect inferior to that now in uſe. The perfection of this art has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for Mr. Boulton of Soho, near Birmingham, where he has conſtructed a moſt ingenious apparatus, at a large expence, capable of performing all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent operations of coining, as Sophia, who has ſeen it, will explain mere particularly.</p>

                  <p>The whole machinery is moved by an improved ſteam-engine, which rolls the copper for halfpence finer than copper has ever been rolled for the purpoſe of making money; it works both the coupoirs, or ſcrew-preſſes, for cutting out the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pieces of copper, and coins both the faces and edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the money at the ſame time, with ſuch ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or excellence and cheapneſs of workmanſhip, as muſt prevent every attempt to imitate the coin in a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine manner; and conſequently may prove a means of ſaving the lives of many unhappy perſons from the hand of the executioner. By this machine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry four boys of twelve years old, are capable of ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thirty thouſand guineas in an hour, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine itſelf keeps an unerring account of the number of pieces which are ſtruck.</p>

                  <p>It was believed to be ſo, till the diſcovery of a metallic ſubſtance called platina, which is as ponderous as gold itſelf. Gold is more than nineteen times as heavy as its own bulk of water; ſilver nearly eleven times; copper between eight and nine times; iron ſomething more than ſeven, and
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:036664_0239_100A614A5CEE24A8"/>
leſs than eight times; lead eleven; and tin but ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. By comparing gold with the reſt, you will be enabled to judge of its ſuperior weight. The next quality I ſhall remark in this valuable metal, is the coheſion of the particles which compoſe it; ſo firmly do they adhear to each other, that it is extremely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to ſeparate them. A wire of gold, one tenth of an inch in diameter, will ſupport a weight of five hundred pounds without breaking. From this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty ariſes another, which is its ductility, or capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of being beaten, preſſed, drawn, or ſtretched out to a ſurpriſing degree of thinneſs.</p>

                  <p>Yes; the expanſion of the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in that proceſs is almoſt beyond imagination. M.

                  <p>A block of black marble, of ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral hundred pounds weight, with a ſquare ſurface, about nine inches each way, fixed into a wooden frame, ſerves for a table to beat the gold upon. Three of its ſides are guarded by a high ledge, and the front, which is open, has a leather flap faſtened to it, this the gold-beater uſes as an apron to preſerve the fragments of gold that fall off. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the pureſt gold is melted in a crucible into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, or pieces of ſix or eight inches long, and three quarters of an inch wide. This bar of gold is made red hot, and forged on an anvil into a long plate, which is farther extended, by being paſſed repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly between poliſhed ſteel rollers, till it becomes a riband as thin as paper. This is divided into equal pieces, which are again forged till they are an inch

The whole is then beaten with the heavieſt hammer, till the gold is ſtretched to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the vellum. In this ſtate, the ſheets of gold are then taken out, and cut in four with a ſteel knife. Theſe pieces are now interſected with leaves of the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They are again beaten till they are extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſize of the pieces of ſkin; the ſame opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of dividing and beating are repeated the third time. Nothing remains to finiſh the proceſs, but cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the edges even with a machine adapted to the purpoſe, and fixing the leaves of gold in books, the paper of which is well ſmoothed, and rubbed with red bole, that it may not ſtick to them.</p>

                  <p>There are gold leaves not thicker in ſome parts than the three hundred and ſixty-thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth part of an inch; but that is inconſiderable when compared with the extreme thinneſs of gold ſpun for laces and embroidery. Gold thread is only ſilver wire gilt, or covered with gold. An ingot of ſilver, uſually about thirty pounds weight, is rounded into a cylinder, or roll, about an inch and a half in diameter, and twenty-two inches long. Two ounces of gold leaf are ſufficient to cover this cylinder; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is effected with little more than one. But this thin coat of gold muſt be yet vaſtly thinner. The ingot is repeatedly drawn through the holes of ſeveral irons, each ſmaller than the other, till it be finer than a hair; every new hole diminiſhes its thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but what it loſes in circumference it gains in
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:036664_0241_100A614EAF1690C0"/>
length, and conſequently increaſes in ſurface: yet the gold ſtill covers it, it follows the ſilver in all its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, and never leaves the minuteſt part bare, not even to the microſcope. How inconceivably muſt it be attenuated, when the ingot of ſilver is drawn into a thread, the ſize of which is nine thouſand times leſs than it was at firſt.</p>

                  <p>As inconceivable as it appears, the ingot is not yet extended to its full length. The greateſt part of our gold thread is ſpun, or wound on ſilk; and, before they ſpin it, they flatten it, by paſſing it between two rolls, or wheels of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly well poliſhed ſteel, which operation lengthens it one-ſeventh, and, of courſe, diminiſhes its thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as increaſes the extenſion of the gold, which covers it, to ſuch an exquiſite thinneſs that M. Reaumur calculates, that it is reduced to leſs than the three millionth part of an inch!</p>

                  <p>Several other ſubſtances poſſeſs a degree of ductility, but very inferior to that of gold. Gums, glues, reſins, and ſome other bodies, may when ſoftened by water, be drawn into threads. Silver we have juſt proved to be ductile; the reſt of the metals have this property more or leſs. Gold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes the operation of fire without the ſmalleſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution. Platinia and ſilver are the only metals beſides, which do not loſe their metallic appearance, and either evaporate in flume, or change into an earthy or glaſſy form.</p>

                  <p>This power of reſiſting the action of fire, peculiar to theſe metals, has given them the denomination of perfect, in oppoſition to the reſt, which are called imperfect, becauſe they are reduced, by being kept long in a fierce fire, to a calx, which you may recollect, is uſed by the enameller.</p>

                  <p>This happens more frequently in Guinea than elſewhere. There are many European rivers alſo which roll particles of gold among their ſand. Thoſe rivers yield the greateſt plenty whoſe courſe is ſlow and uninterrupted, and where the ſand is of a reddiſh or blackiſh hue, which, being heavier than the white ſand, carries the gold along with it to the bottom.

                  <p>Experience and ingenuity have invented a more expeditious method than that. The ſand is received into a long, ſloping trough, lined at the bottom with flannel, or coarſe cloth; upon ſtirring the water about with the hand, the ſand is
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:036664_0244_100A6156438A6EE0"/>
waſhed off, and the ſmall particles of gold ſubſide into the wooly matter of the flannel; they are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carefully waſhed out. Gold is ſometimes found, in mines, in ſmall pieces, of different forms and ſizes, though but ſeldom in maſſes ſo large as an ounce. At other times, it is dug up in the ſtony glebes or clods, which are called the mineral, or ore of gold. Theſe clods generally contain a mixture of other metallic matter, particularly ſilver. They are of various colours, and generally lie at leaſt one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty fathoms deep. In order to ſeparate theſe glebes from the gold they contain, they are at firſt broken into ſmall pieces with iron mallets, and then carried to the mills, to be ground to a very fine powder, which is infuſed, in a ſolution of common ſalt, in wooden troughs; it is afterwards refined, from the mixture of foreign ſubſtances and droſs, by mercury.</p>

                  <p>Mercury, or quickſilver, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the quality of uniting with the other metals in the form of a paſte, which chemiſts call an amalgam. An amalgam of gold may be procured by heating it red hot, and then pouring heated quickſilver upon it. After which the mixture is to be ſtirred with an iron rod, till it begins to riſe into ſmoke. To finiſh the proceſs, it is thrown into a veſſel full of water, where it hardens, and becomes fit for uſe. Gilders and goldſmiths avail themſelves of this means, to render gold more applicable to their purpoſes. Suppoſe they have occaſion to gild a piece of copper, as the lid of a ſnuff-box, for example, or any other toy, they cover it with a layer of the amalgam, and then place it in a proper veſſel over the fire, the quickſilver evaporates by the heat, and the gold only is left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſurface of the copper.</p>

                  <p>Silver is the moſt precious, the fineſt, the pureſt, and moſt ductile of all the metals after gold, and poſſeſſes many of the ſame properties, though not in ſo great a degree: its ductility, or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of extention has already been inſtanced, in the fineneſs to which the wire is drawn, that is to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with gold. It is as fixed and indeſtructible as gold, bearing the action of fire, without a diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its weight. It contracts no ruſt, but is very apt to tarniſh, as you may have often obſerved. It is harder than gold, and if you take the ſilver mug, and ring it, you will perceive that it has a ſono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous quality. Charles, I ſhall not infringe upon your office, of pointing out the countries, whoſe ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mines are the moſt productive.</p>

                  <p>Every quarter of the globe contains ſome veins of this metal, nor is our own iſland deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of it, for although we cannot boaſt of any ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mines, properly ſo called, yet ſeveral of our lead-mines yield a conſiderable proportion of ſilver. It is ſaid that Sir Hugh Middleton, the projector of bringing the New River from Ware to London, was enabled to proſecute his uſeful deſign, by which a great part of the inhabitants of the metropolis is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with water, from the ſilver produced by his lead mines in Wales. The mines of Peru, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts of South-America, are much the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant of any known; particularly thoſe of Potoſi, which continue to repay the labour of the miners, notwithſtanding the immenſe quantities that have been dug out of them. Inſtead of finding the ore

near the ſurface, as they formerly did, the workmen are now obliged to deſcend to prodigious depths, in order to obtain it. So poiſonous are the exhalations which iſſue from them, that many thouſands of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians have periſhed in them, and prodigious numbers are ſtill ſacrificed by avarice there, every year. The cattle which graze upon the outſide are affected by the pernicious fumes; but ſo great is their power over the miners within ſide, that none of them can reſiſt their influence above a day together. As a means of prevention, theſe poor people drink an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of an herb called paraquay.</p>

                  <p>Mining is in many reſpects a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and diſagreeable employment, but views of preſent advantage will induce the ignorant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate to undertake any taſk, however objection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Silver is found in different ſtates. It is called virgin, or native ſilver, when it occurs naturally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyed with copper and gold; but this is but rarely to be met with. When it does happen, it is uſually in fibres, grains, or cryſtalizations, lying in different ſubſtances, as flint, ſpar, ſlate, &amp;c. but it is generally found in a mineral ſtate, by which I mean, united with matter foreign to itſelf. Silver is capable of being alloyed with all metals, and forms different com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds with them, according to the nature of the mixture.</p>

From what motive it is difficult to ſay, but chemiſts have named each of the metals after one of the planets. Thus gold is called Sol, after the ſun, perhaps from the brilliancy of its colour. Silver is called Luna, or the moon,
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:036664_0249_100A6161B2693278"/>
to the beams of which its whiteneſs bears an alluſion, hence the name of this experiment, as Diana was a figurative repreſentation of that planet. Copper is Venus, and iron Mars, which is very ſuitable, as Mars is the god of War. The activity of Mercury is adapted to quickſilver. Tin is called Jupiter, and lead Saturn.</p>

to a dulliſh red, you are all undoubtedly acquainted with. This metal is procured in ſeveral parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, but moſt abundantly in Sweden. It is found in glebes, or ſtones of various forms and colours; which are firſt beaten ſmall, and waſhed, to ſeparate them from the earthy particles with which they are mixed: after waſhing they are ſmelted, and, when in a ſtate of fuſion, the melted matter is run into a kind of moulds, by which it is formed into large blocks. The operation of melting is repeated more than once, which, with the addition of a certain proportion of tin and antimony, renders it more pure and beautiful.</p>

Many perſons have been ſeverely indiſpoſed from the effect of the poiſon of copper, though it might be expected, that the nauſeous taſte of the verdegreaſe would be a warning of the danger.

                  <p>Braſs is a compoſition of copper, fuſed with lapis calaminaris, by which it is rendered harder, and becomes of a yellow colour. It is rather lighter, harder, and more ſonorous than pure cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and melts eaſier; but, if heated even a little, is apt to crack and fall in pieces under the hammer, for which reaſon it is generally caſt into the form re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and poliſhed afterwards. The beauty of its colour, and being leſs ſubject to ruſt than copper, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it for the purpoſe of many domeſtic uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils. A gold colour may be imparted to braſs, by firſt burning it, then diſſolving it in aquaſortis, and laſtly reducing it to its metalline ſtate: or it may be
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:036664_0251_100A616728B4EDD0"/>

                  <p>Perhaps we may enlarge upon that topic at ſome future opportunity. It is time now to turn our thoughts upon iron, which is the hardeſt of all metals, and the moſt extenſively uſeful of any of them; next to gold, it has the greateſt tenacity of parts, or difficulty of being broken, is very
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:036664_0252_100A61694665D910"/>
elaſtic, and requires a great degree of heat to put it in a ſtate of fuſion. The hardneſs, brittleneſs, and capacity of yielding to the hammer, varies in iron, according to the nature of the ore from which it is obtained, and the operation it has undergone. Caſe iron is that which is run from the ore, and, from a mixture of crude earth, is ſo hard, as generally to reſiſt the file or the chiſſel; it is likewiſe brittle and unmalleable in this ſtate; but is rendered tough by the operation of forging, which is performed by heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it red hot, and then ſtriking it with large ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, which force a quantity of vitreous matter out of it. Steel is only a more perfect kind of iron, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by fuſing bars of the pureſt iron in an earthen crucible, with a cement of charcoal, wood-aſhes and different animal ſubſtances, ſuch as bones, horns, ſkins, or hair. The metal, in conſequence of this change, acquires a more compact and cloſe-grained texture, and becomes harder, more elaſtic and tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as well as more fuſible. Different degrees of elaſticity and brittleneſs may be given to ſteel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſes for which it is deſigned.</p>

                  <p>It is a ſpecies of iron ore, which is both hard and heavy; it poſſeſſes extraordinary powers, attracting iron to itſelf, and communicating this property to any piece of iron that is rubbed with it; but what renders it of moſt important advantage in civil life, is a peculiar propenſity which it has of pointing to the poles of the earth; the ingenuity of man has applied this unaccountable quality to the

conſtruction of the compaſs, by which ſhips are guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their courſe over the trackleſs ocean. Iron is the produce of all mountainous countries: the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of Europe ſupply us with great quantities of this moſt uſeful metal. The tops of ferruginous mountains are frequently crowned with reſinous trees, ſuch as the pine, the fir, and the cedar, the charcoal of which is particularly adapted to melting the iron. Theſe trees are often covered with moſſes, ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of which catch fire from the ſmalleſt ſpark. Thus nature has placed thoſe materials on the ſame ſpot, which require the aſſiſtance of each other to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them ſubſervient to the uſes of man.</p>

The tinned wares, in common uſe, are plates of iron covered with tin. The plates are firſt ſteeped in an acid water, till they are a little corroded; they are then ſcoured with ſand, by which they are made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſmooth and fine.

                  <speaker>Mr. HARCOURT.</speaker>
                  <p>Its colour is a little like it. Lead is a coarſe, ſoft, impure metal, but a very uſeful one. It is ſo ſoft and flexible, that it is eaſily cut with a knife, ſhaved with a plane, grooved for windows, by being drawn through the glazier's vice, or flatted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to large thin ſheets, by paſſing it between wooden roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. It has leſs malleability than the other metals we have already deſcribed; and no capacity of being drawn into wire, which ariſes from a want of tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Lead is eaſily fuſed, and melts long before it becomes red hot: as ſoon as it becomes fluid, it cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and greyiſh aſhes are formed upon its ſurface. When in a middle ſtate between heat and cold, it is readily formed into ſmall round grains. Thus ſhot is made of it, by infuſing a due proportion of yellow orpiment in it, and then pouring it through a plate of copper, bored with holes, of a ſuitable ſize, like a cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lender, through which the liquid metal paſſes, and ſubſides in round balls or grains.</p>

                  <p>Red lead is a preparation of the metal whoſe name it bears, by calcination, and long expoſure to a ſtrong flame. White lead is formed of its calx, obtained in the fume of vinegar. All acids have the power of diſſolving it. This laſt is of great ſervice to the painters, both in oil and water colours. The diſcovery of a ſubſtitute for it, in houſe-painting eſpecially, is much to be deſired, on account of its extremely pernicious qualities to the health of the workmen who uſe it. It is alſo an ingredient in coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metics, for beautifying the complexion.</p>

The lead, intended for large ſheets to cover the roofs of houſes and churches, is melted in a huge cauldron or furnace, and poured with ladles upon a table of extenſive dimenſions, covered with fine ſand, and guarded with ledges.

                  <p>That ſubſtance, for it is not a metal, is produced in England, particularly in Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland.

The gradations of being, from a polype to a man, are numerous; the diſtinctions between a ſavage and a philoſopher are likewiſe great, though individuals of the ſame ſpecies. The advantage we enjoy of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born in a ſtate of civilization, enables us to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to a degree of improvement, characteriſtic of the latter. Do not let us be deprived of this ſuperiority by ſloth or inattention, but by a daily exertion of the talents beſtowed upon us, let each of us endeavour to acquire uſeful knowledge, which is at once the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and companion of virtue.</p>
