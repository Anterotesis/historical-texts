            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>And there aroſe not a prophet, ſince in Iſrael, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Moſes, whom the Lord knew face to face;</p>
                  <p>In all the ſigns and wonders, which the Lord ſent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his ſervants, and to all his land;</p>
                  <p>And in all that mighty hand, and in all that great terror, which Moſes ſhewed in the ſight of all Iſrael.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>TO praiſe ſuch as have lately died, is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive conduct of ſorrow. From thoſe who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the bed of a departed friend, the firſt accents, which ſucceed the involuntary burſt of anguiſh, are enumerations of his real or ſuppoſed virtues. Even in the mouths of the intelligent, and in the chambers of the refined and delicate, the praiſe is warm and unqualified, and nature overleaps every bound, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by artificial decorum. Among nations leſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, open and ſtrong commendations of the dead are inwoven in the eſtabliſhed manners, and demanded by common decency; while, among ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, funeral ſongs, replete with paſſionate ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, glowing imagery, and exceſſive panegyric, are prominent features of national character, and ſplendid parts of public celebration.</p>
            <p>TO this general voice of nature Revelation has added its ſupreme ſanction. The text, which I have juſt now read, is an eulogy of the higheſt kind.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037339_0005_100CD72A7834FA20"/>
When we remember the numbers, and the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of the prophets who followed Moſes; when we conſider that of this number were Samuel, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Iſaiah, and Daniel; we cannot but feel, that it would have been difficult to aſcribe to him a more honorable character.</p>
            <p>WHAT then has been the cauſe, that no efforts of the mind have been leſs approved, than funeral eulogies; and that an inſipid panegyric is become proverbial phraſeology? Has it not been, on the one hand, that grief, and not reaſon, has given birth to the praiſe, and that grief alone can admit its truth, or feel its propriety? Has it not been, on the other hand, that the Eulogiſt has come, in form, to make the moſt of his theme; to create a character which has not exiſted, and to ſupply worth which he does not find; to diſplay his ingenuity, rather than the features of the deceaſed; and to gain applauſe for his own talents, rather than reſpect for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his panegyric. For theſe or ſome other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, few attempts of this nature have ſucceeded; and the effort to gain eſteem for the dead has ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in producing contempt for the living.</p>
            <p>BESIDE the difficulties, always attendant on attempts of this nature, the preſent occaſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves ſome, which are peculiar. The ſubject of eulogy at this time is ſo ſplendid, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and authorize, every man to demand all that can be ſaid by the human genius, and to ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late for its nobleſt efforts only; ſo near to the heart of an American, as to warrant an unqualified re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of whatſoever falls beneath its expectations and its wiſhes; ſo often and ſo illuſtriouſly panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized, both at home and abroad, as to have little chance for novelty, or ſucceſs. The very <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Waſhington has become an equivalent to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt human dignity and worth, and all additions to it
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037339_0006_100CEAC8EB204880"/>
have long paſſed rather for the mere unburdening of an American heart, than for the means of honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his character. Where ſo much is demanded, and ſo little will be accepted, temerity only can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh confidence to the ſpeaker, and perſuade him, that he ſhall ſatisfy the wiſhes of his fellow citizens.</p>
            <p>TO ſome perſon, however, the taſk, aſſigned to me, muſt have fallen; and to none could it have fallen without anxiety. I have ventured upon it, with an intention to perform a duty, not with a hope to fulfil expectation. Funeral panegyric I have always ſhunned; and would more willingly have avoided it on this occaſion, than on any other.</p>
            <p>THIS apology, which may probably ſeem long, and uſeleſs, will, it is hoped, nevertheleſs prove of ſome uſe to the ſpeaker. It is hoped, that it will, in ſome degree, juſtify the undertaking, and explain and vindicate the manner in which it will be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that it will lead my audience to expect, and ſhew the reaſons why I ſhall exhibit, a plain and chaſtized account of my ſubject; and that it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to conſider what I ſhall aſſert, however it may differ from their opinions and feelings, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and felt by me.</p>
            <p>HUMAN greatneſs is of many kinds, and appears under many forms; but the diverſities of perſonal greatneſs have their foundation in the intellect, and in the heart. How far this is, in either caſe, the reſult of the original ſtructure of the mind, and how far of effort and acquiſition, it is probably impoſſible for man to determine. We ſee ſome actually great; but the cauſe, and the means, have in a degree been, hitherto, in a ſtate of uncertainty.</p>
            <p>IN all caſes, in which this diſtinction has been atchieved, whether intellectual, or moral, there muſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037339_0007_100CEACAAD8073E8"/>
to ſuperior endowments and attainments, be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added, by Providence, a happy field, in which they may be advantageouſly diſplayed. Some object ſeen, and felt, by the mind, to be of ſufficient im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to juſtify high and ardent efforts, and to repay the labours, and the ſufferings, which attend them, muſt be preſented to the underſtanding, and lay hold on the heart. In this ſituation, if ever, the man riſes above himſelf, feels his powers in a new manner, exerts talents of which he was before unconſcious, and virtues which had hitherto been dormant. Himſelf, as well as the world, is aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed at what he is, and at what he does; the fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erman is changed into an Apoſtle; the<note n="*" place="bottom">Mahommed.</note> trader of Mecca becomes the founder of a religion, and an empire, embracing a fourth of mankind; and the <note n="‡" place="bottom">Nadir Kouli Khan.</note>leader of a gang of thieves aſcends the throne of Perſia, and places beneath his feet the ſcepter of Hindoſtan.</p>
            <p>AMONG thoſe occaſions, which have lifted man above his ordinary ſphere, none have diſplayed with more ſplendor, either talents, or virtues, than the revolutions of religion and empire. The conqueſt of nations, and the ſubverſion of governments, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well as exhibited, Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Alexander, Hannibal, Caeſar, Ghengis, Timur-bec, Kouli Khan, Frederic, 2d.

To all theſe the pride of victory, the extenſion of conqueſt, and the increaſe of dominion, roſe in full view; and, with a faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation wholly irreſiſtible, prompted them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive, to dare, and to attempt, beyond the limits of ordinary belief. When we contemplate theſe men, however, our admiration is always mingled with diſguſt; and the few things in their characters, which claim eſteem, are loſt in the multitude of thoſe,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037339_0008_100CEACCAF453240"/>
which force abhorrence. The luſtre ſhed around them is gloomy and diſmal; a glare of Avernus; a "darkneſs viſible;" at which the eye gazes with a mixture of aſtoniſhment and horror. We ſicken, while we read their exploits; and bluſh, that ſuch ſcourges of the world ſhould have claimed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature with ourſelves.</p>
            <p>BUT there have been happier occaſions for call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into action, and into light, the ſuperiour facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of man. Empire and religion have, at times, changed for the better. Men have ariſen, whom the world has not only admired, but revered, and loved; to whom applauſe was not the mere outcry of aſtoniſhment, but the ſilent and ſteady teſtimony of the underſtanding, the cheerful and inſtinctive tribute of the heart. When oppreſſion was to be reſiſted, government to be reformed, or the moral ſtate of mankind to be renewed, the Ruler of the Univerſe has always ſupplied the means, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. Where to the human eye the whole face of things has worn an uniform level; where every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was loſt in inſignificance, and every citizen was a peaſant, and a ſlave; energy, aſleep under the preſſure of weary circumſtances, and talents, veiled by humble and hopeleſs obſcurity, have been rouſed into action, and puſhed forward to diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and glory.</p>
            <p>AMONG the men, who, at ſuch periods, have riſen to eminence, the Prophet, who is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of my text, is unqueſtionably the firſt. In all the talents which enlarge the human mind and all the virtues which ennoble the human heart, in the amiableneſs of private life and the dignity of a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, in dangers hazarded and difficulties overcome, in ſplendor of deſtination and the enjoyment, and proofs, of divine complacency, he is clearly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a rival. Companions, perhaps ſuperiors, he
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037339_0009_100CEACF09F03468"/>
may find in ſome ſingle walk of greatneſs; but in the whole progreſs he is hitherto alone.</p>
            <p>FOR this preeminence he was plainly fitted by nature, and education, by the manner of his life, and the field of his employment. Born with a ſoul ſuperior to his kind, educated in the firſt ſchool of wiſdom, trained to arms, and to policy, in the moſt improved and powerful court in the world, and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in wiſdom ſtill more ſublime in the quiet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats of Midian, he came forth to his great ſcene of public action, with the moſt happy preparation both for ſucceſs and glory. God was about to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh a more important revolution than had ever taken place, and had formed and finiſhed the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſo illuſtrious a deſign required.</p>
            <p>IN whatever courſe of life, in whatever branch of character, we trace this great man, we find al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing to approve, and love, and ſcarcely any thing to lament, or cenſure. When we ſee him at the burning buſh, ſacrificing his diffidence to his duty, and reſolving finally to attempt the firſt great liberation of mankind; when we accompany him to the preſence of Pharaoh, and hear him demand the releaſe of the miſerable victims of his tyranny; when we behold him laying Egypt waſte, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning all the great engines of terror and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to overcome the obſtinacy and wickedneſs of her monarch; when we follow him to the Red Sea, and behold the waters divide at his command, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a paſſage for the millions of Iſrael; and at the ſame command return, to deluge the Egyptian hoſt; when we trace him through the wonders of Sinai, and of the wilderneſs; when we mark his ſteady faith in God, his undoubting obedience to every divine command, his unexampled patriotiſm, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable by ingratitude, rebellion, and inſult, his cheerful communication of every office of power and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037339_0010_100CEAD0D3EE91D0"/>
profit to others, and his equally cheerful excluſion of his own deſcendants from all places of diſtinction; when we conſider his glorious integrity in adhering always to the duties of his office, unſeduced by power and ſplendour, unmoved by national and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular homage, unawed by faction and oppoſition, undaunted by danger and difficulty, and unaltered by provocation, obloquy, and diſtreſs; when we ſee him meek beyond example, and patient and per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſevering, through forty years of declining life, in toil, hazard, and trial; when we read in his writings the frank records of his own failings, and thoſe of his family, friends, and nation, and the firſt efforts of the hiſtorian, the poet, the orator, and the law-giver; when we ſee all the duties of ſelf government, benevolence, and piety, which he taught, exactly diſplayed in a life approximating to angelic virtue; when we behold him the deliverer of his nation, the reſtorer of truth, the pillar of righteouſneſs, and the reformer of mankind; his whole character ſhines with a radiance, like the ſplendour, which his face derived from the Sun of Righteouſneſs, and on which the human eye could not endure to look. He is every where the ſame glorious perſon; the Man of God; ſelected from the race of Adam; called up into the mountain, that burned with fire; aſcending to meet his Creator; emboſoming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the clouds of Sinai; walking calmly onward through the thunders and lightnings; and ſerenely advancing to the immediate preſence, and converſe, of Jehovah. He is the greateſt of all prophets; the firſt type of the Saviour; conducted to Piſgah, unclothed of mortal fleſh, and entombed in the duſt, by the immediate hand of the Moſt High.</p>
            <p>IN a ſphere, in ſome reſpects leſs ſplendid, but in the eye of wiſdom and virtue ſcarcely leſs honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, Paul, alſo, roſe to finiſhed glory and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as the enlightener, and reformer of mankind.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037339_0011_100CEAD2C8675A18"/>
He was not, like Moſes, the emancipator of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the head of a new church, or the founder of an empire; but he was the moſt illuſtrious follower of the Son of God, in eſtabliſhing Chriſtianity, and in accompliſhing the ſalvation of men. No labours of man claim a higher moral diſtinction, than his; no mind was ever ſo expanded, or elevated, with the nobleſt knowledge; no heart was probably ever warmed with more various, or more exalted virtue. No man ever ſtruggled more firmly with dangers; or roſe more gloriouſly above difficulties; regarded friends with more affection, or enemies with more compaſſion; felt for himſelf leſs, or his fellow men more; or attained a more ſublime and unmingled piety, than Paul. To his labours mankind are, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, more indebted, than to thoſe of any other man, for the moral wiſdom, the virtue, the peace, and the happineſs, which they now enjoy.</p>
            <p>SUCH excellence we are not to look for among thoſe, who have received no ſupernatural aſſiſtance; yet, in ſimilar revolutions of empire, ſimilar eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipations of mankind, and ſimilar renovations of the human character, both talents and virtues have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with high luſtre and dignity. As proofs of this aſſertion, many names of no ſmall celebrity might be recited here, were it neceſſary; but it will be ſufficient for the preſent occaſion, to mention three only, as diſtinguiſhed, in my view at leaſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others. Theſe are the firſt, and ſecond Guſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavus, of Sweden, and Alfred the Great, of England. Were not his character clouded by ſome ſerious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, I ſhould add to this liſt Henry the fourth, of France.</p>
            <p>THE firſt Guſtavus accompliſhed for Sweden what the great man, whoſe character and death we are aſſembled to commemorate, accompliſhed for us; a deliverance from political thraldom, and the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037339_0012_100CEAD4B989A510"/>
eſtabliſhment of political freedom and ſafety. Illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly deſcended, diſtinguiſhed in early youth for a ſeries of honourable actions, and already the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of governmental confidence and public hope, he was trepanned by the treachery of Chriſtiern the third, of Denmark, one of the moſt faithleſs, proud, and bloody tyrants, that ever diſgraced the name of man; was thrown into priſon, and ſecretly order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be put to death; ſolely becauſe his claims of power in Sweden were great, and his worth gave the faireſt promiſe of ſeeing them ſubſtantiated. Releaſed from his dungeon by the good offices of a generous Daniſh Nobleman, he eſcaped through many dangers to his native country. There friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, forſaken, ſeen only to be ſhunned, and known only to excite the dread of death for not betraying him to Chriſtiern, he at length betook himſelf to the mountains of Dalecarlia; a province yet but half ſubdued, and inhabited by a generous band of pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, glowing with the unconquerable love of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Here unknown but by diſtant rumour, without authority, without a friend, without a ſhilling, and hunted by the Uſurper and his creatures through every ſolitude and cell, he wrought in the mines, to procure his daily bread. But ſuch a man cannot be long obſcured. The peaſants of Dalecarlia he found ſtill brave and ſincere, and boldly invited them to victory and freedom. Charmed by his dignity and gracefulneſs of perſon and demeanour, faſcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his eloquence, and ſecure under his conduct and bravery, theſe plain men followed him eagerly into the field of conflict; to any other a field of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; to him, of hope and triumph. At their head, he met the veterans of Denmark, only to defeat them; and ſat down before their caſtles, only to take them. Within a ſhort period, he overran, and redeemed the whole of his native country; every where preſent; the animating, informing, directing
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037339_0013_100CEAD728AE6DC0"/>
principle of the army, and of the nation; and by the unanimous voice of the Eſtates was advanced to the throne. In this high ſtation, enjoying every teſtimony of public reſpect ſhort of adoration, for his diſtinguiſhed wiſdom, gallantry, patriotiſm, and piety, he revived the agriculture, renewed the waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cities and villages, reſtored the commerce, re-eſtabliſhed and improved the juſtice, ſecured the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, reformed the religion, and engroſſed the hearts, of his grateful nation. "In all other reſpects," ſays the Catholic<note n="*" place="bottom">Vertot.</note> writer of his life, "except the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of Lutheraniſm into his kingdom, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the praiſe and admiration of poſterity."</p>
            <p>THE ſecond Guſtavus, having, from the age of 18, reigned in Sweden, with ſingular wiſdom, equity, and glory, for twenty years, appeared in Germany, 1631, in the illuſtrious character of Defender of the Proteſtant religion, againſt the laſt great efforts of the Catholics, in that country, for its deſtruction; and gloriouſly loſt his life in eſtabliſhing the cauſe, for which he died. He is thus deſcribed by a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable modern hiſtorian.<note n="§" place="bottom">Ruſſell.</note>
            </p>
            <p>"NO prince, ancient or modern, ſeems to have poſſeſſed in ſo eminent a degree, as Guſtavus Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, the qualities of the hero, the ſtateſman, and the commander; that intuitive genius which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, that wiſdom which plans, and that happy combination of courage and conduct which gives ſucceſs to an enterpriſe. Nor was the military pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of any leader equally rapid, under circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces equally difficult; with an inferiour force, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt warlike nations, and diſciplined troops, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by able and experienced generals."</p>
            <p>"BUT Guſtavus had other qualities beſide thoſe
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037339_0014_100CEAD8B5E21CF8"/>
of a military and political kind. He was a pious Chriſtian, a warm friend, a tender huſband, a duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſon, an affectionate father. The ſentiments ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all theſe ſofter characters are admirably diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a letter from him to <note n="*" place="bottom">His Miniſter.</note>Oxenſtiern, written a few days before the battle of Lutzen, in which he loſt his life." In this letter is the following memorable paſſage.</p>
            <p>"Conſider me as a man, the guardian of a kingdom, who has ſtruggled with difficulties, and paſſed thro' them with reputation, by the protection and mercy of heaven; as a man, who loved and honoured his relations, and who neglected life, riches, and happy days, for the preſervation and glory of his country, and faithful ſubjects; expecting no other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, than to be declared the prince, who ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the duties of that ſtation, which Providence had aſſigned him in the world."</p>
            <p>"THE merit of Alfred (ſays Hume) both in public and private life, may with advantage be ſet in oppoſition to that of any monarch or citizen, which the annals of any age or nation can preſent to us. He ſeems indeed to be the model of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect character, which, under the denomination of a ſage or wiſe man, philoſophers have been fond of delineating, rather as a fiction of their imagination, than in hopes of ever ſeeing it really exiſting: ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily were all his virtues tempered together; ſo juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were they blended; and ſo powerfully did each prevent the other from exceeding its proper boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries! He knew how to reconcile the moſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing ſpirit with the cooleſt moderation; the moſt obſtinate perſeverance with the eaſieſt flexibility; the moſt ſevere juſtice with the gentleſt lenity; the greateſt vigour in command with the moſt perfect
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037339_0015_100CEADAED20A490"/>
affability of deportment; the higheſt capacity and inclination for ſcience with the moſt ſhining talents for action;" <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note A<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and, let me add, the warmeſt devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and piety with the utmoſt candour and liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. "His civil and military virtues are almoſt equally the objects of our admiration; excepting only, that the former, being more rare among prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as well as more uſeful, ſeem chiefly to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge our applauſe."</p>
            <p>AS a fourth in this dignified groupe, may, with the fulleſt confidence, be placed the hero, ſtateſman, and father, of our own country. I have introduced a ſummary account of theſe great men into this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that by comparing his character with theirs, and ſeeing them ſtand ſide by ſide, my audience may be enabled to form a more accurate eſtimate of his worth. Greatneſs is a term wholly comparative; its true import is, therefore, to be ſeen by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only. On the one hand, ſuperiority to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon maſs, and on the other approximation, equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or eminence, with reſpect to ſuch as have been thus ſuperior, is all that is intended by the word. As Moſes and Paul were the greateſt human cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters among ſuch as have been ſupernaturally aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted; and the three princes, whom I have here characterized, were, if I miſtake not, the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe, who have become great by means mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly natural; to ſuſtain a fair reſemblance to theſe men muſt be highly honourable; to be near them, an enviable diſtinction; to equal them, the crown of the moſt exalted ambition.</p>
            <p>AS the ſphere of Paul's exertions was peculiar, he muſt of courſe be paſſed by in ſuch a deſign. As Moſes was inſpired, and ſuſtained by a peculiar agency of the Moſt High, the compariſon with him
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037339_0016_100CEADD5148A6F0"/>
muſt in many reſpects be unfairly inſtituted. Yet a ſtrong reſemblance between him and the hero of our own country is ſo evident, that the recital of it is become almoſt proverbial. The occaſions, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, the virtues, the divine interpoſitions, and the iſſue, were ſo ſimilar, as to ſtrike the moſt undiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating eye, and to find an eaſy acknowledgment from every tongue. Particularly, the preeminence of Moſes to all the great men in Iſrael, marked ſo ſtrongly in the text, and the like diſtinction juſtly claimed by the American leader, not only over his countrymen, but over all men of the preſent age, form a moſt honourable ground of compariſon.</p>
            <p>THAT General Waſhington is, with propriety, introduced as a proper companion to the three il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious princes, whom I have mentioned above, as a companion, whom, on equal terms, they may be fairly ſuppoſed cheerfully to welcome to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and rank, will, I truſt, appear from a juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his character.</p>
            <p>THERE are two methods, in which ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count may be advantageouſly given; a recital of what he has done, and an exhibition of the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes which he manifeſted.</p>
            <p>IN very early life, he began to be, in a ſenſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically, diſtinguiſhed for wiſdom and conduct ſuperior to his years; and executed ſo ably ſeveral important commiſſions, which he received from the legiſlature of Virginia, as to ſecure their confidence, and command the applauſe of the whole country. Such truſts have been rarely committed to ſo young a man, and have probably been never better lodged in the hands of any man. That in the exiſting cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſucceſs was, in one of the caſes, comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely atchieved, that, in a ſecond, ſo little diſaſter enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037339_0017_100CEADF4BF3FF60"/>
and that, in a third, total ruin was prevented; is plainly and chiefly to be attributed to the ſkill and firmneſs of a youth between nineteen and twenty-three, acting in the laſt caſe only in a voluntary office.</p>
            <p>AFTER acquiring, both in public and private life, the univerſal eſteem, through the following ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of peace, he was choſen, in the year 1774, one of the Repreſentatives in the firſt Congreſs. Here his former reputation, and the proofs which he dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave of ſuperiour wiſdom and worth, induced that body to chooſe him, in 1775, commander in chief of the American armies, employed to reſiſt the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities of Great-Britain. This hazardous office he accepted with a <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note B.</note> modeſty, which always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and announces merit, and with a firmneſs of deciſion, which no future embarraſſment could move. Under a government juſt formed, and marked with infantine weakneſs; in a country com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſeparate and deranged ſovereignties; amidſt a people now firſt ſeriouſly connected; at the head of armies formed of mere militia, a band of ſcouts and yet to be made ſoldiers, and of officers ignorant of the diſcipline which they were to teach, and of the movements which they were to guide; ſtrangers, rivals, and ſometimes enemies; without ammunition, arms, clothes, or money; enliſted for a ſummer; and plunged by inexperience into all the expoſures, diſcouragements, diſeaſes, and miſeries, of unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided military life; he became the body of union to the people, and to the ſoldiery, guided the one to wiſdom, and led the other to victory. In his own letters,<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Note C.</note> not leſs illuſtrious commentaries than thoſe of Caeſar, and on a more glorious war, he is ſeen, through the veil of his modeſty, to have been the pillar, on which the country ſuſpended itſelf; the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037339_0018_100CEAE0E00EB5F8"/>
ſoul, by which the army was formed, quickened, and actuated. In the midſt of the immenſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous concerns, lying alway on his mind, no want, nor its ſupply; no ſuffering, nor its relief; no evil, nor its remedy; no improvement in the affairs of the army, or the country, nor the means by which it might be beſt accompliſhed; eluded his attention. He is there proved, and without intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, to have been the ſource of almoſt every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant meaſure, the origin of the great maſs of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorations, in our ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>IN this war, for which we were ſo unfurniſhed, as to render it, in the eye of ſober judgment, more like Quixotiſm than juſtifiable enterpriſe, his cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wiſdom, more neceſſary, more varied, and more extraordinary, than that of the celebrated Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, juſtly gained him, abroad, as well as at home, the title of the American Fabius. To the minds of unſkilful, ardent, and partial judges, however, this wiſdom, without which we now clearly ſee our country muſt have been loſt, appeared to reſult from imbecility and fear. So far did this opinion, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome concurring circumſtances, operate, as to engender a ſerious attempt to raiſe a foreigner, in every reſpect his inferiour, to the ſupreme com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Had not this childiſh and wretched at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt been ably and ſtrenuouſly oppoſed, had not the great body of officers of diſtinction ſolemnly pledged themſelves to each other never to ſerve, while he lived, under any other commander, there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear, that it would have ſucceeded. Of this glaring attempt againſt him his mind, ſuperior alike to ſavour and to frowns, took no other notice, than what has been buried in ſilence. Satisfied with himſelf, and ſtrong in the attachment of thoſe whom he commanded, he roſe above every attack, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:037339_0019_100CEAE284694D90"/>A country, an army, ſituated as were ours, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried misfortune in their face. The country was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilled and unfurniſhed; and its councils, compoſed indeed of great and good men, were yet in no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree verſed in the buſineſs, which they were now called to direct. The army was formed of brave and hardy ſoldiers, and of gallant and ſenſible offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; but it was gathered, and diſperſed, in a day; and, when moſt neceſſary, and preſented with the faireſt opportunities of ſucceſsful enterpriſe, had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared. Never did he appear greater, than in theſe ſeaſons of trial and depreſſion. No enterpriſes of his ſhine with more luſtre, than his decampment from <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note D</note>Long-Iſland, his retreat from General Howe through New-Jerſey, his deſcent upon Trenton, <note n="†" place="bottom">See Note E.</note> his eluſion of Lord Cornwallis at Trenton, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent march through New-Jerſey, in which he defeated the Britiſh corps at Princeton, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, with which he preſerved the appearance of a conſiderable force at Morriſtown, where, through the winter, he had only eleven or twelve hundred men, and theſe under a ſucceſſive inoculation, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the whole Britiſh army.</p>
            <p>BUT his military life had alſo its ſeaſons of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. His ſucceſſes were, however, almoſt always obtained at the head of a force, inferior to that of his enemy, and of conſequence were, in an eminent degree, the reſult of his own efforts. Like the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious men, to whom I have compared him, he had the happineſs of ending the great controverſy, in which he had engaged, and in which his country was the ſtake, with a final and complete triumph. All that, for which he fought, and that the greateſt prize, which excites human contention, he gained; and lived long enough to reap a glorious reward of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037339_0020_100CEAE4949D7B28"/>
his labours in the peace and ſafety, the veneration and bleſſings, of his countrymen.</p>
            <p>HIS political, was not leſs honorable than his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, career. When, under the weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efficiency of the Confederation, theſe States were falling aſunder, and tumbling into anarchy and ruin, he contributed, at the head of the General Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, more, by his wiſdom, virtue and influence, than any other man, to the final adoption of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral Conſtitution; and thus ſaved his country a ſecond time. Twice ſummoned by the unanimous voice of the nation to the Preſidency of the General Government, he there, in a ſeries of wiſe, firm, and generous meaſures, ſtepped often between the State and deſtruction. His Proclamation of Neutrality, particularly, was the hinge, on which, at that time, the whole well being of our country turned. No public meaſure was ever more neceſſary, more happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly timed, or more prudently conducted. To that meaſure is it probably owing, that we are allowed thus peaceably to aſſemble, this day, in honour to his memory.</p>
            <p>THE luſtre of all his military and political actions, and the glory of his whole character, apparently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of addition, he has nevertheleſs enhanced by two ſingular traits of diſtinction; his refuſal to accept of a compenſation for his ſervices; and has repeated, voluntary reſignation of his high offices, whilſt in the entire poſſeſſion of univerſal veneration, and perfectly aſſured of the unanimous public ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage. I do not here intend, that great men ought of courſe to decline pecuniary rewards; or to retire, in all circumſtances, from public to private life. It could not have been the duty of either of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whoſe character I have given. But no duty forbade him to do both; and in doing both he has
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037339_0021_100CEAE707BDB080"/>
ſecured a glory, which is ſingular. Nothing could have ſo diſcovered his ſelfpoſſeſſion, evinced his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority to ambition, or proved his mind to be the reſidence of patriotiſm and principle.</p>
            <p>IN private life he was the ſame dignified charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. All his affairs were ſuperintended by himſelf, and were of courſe always in exact order and proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thrift. To his neighbours, to the public, to all men, he was juſt, generous, and humane; to the <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note F.</note> poor a ſteady, and conſpicuous benefactor; and to his family whatever is found in the fulleſt and moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable diſcharge of the domeſtic duties.</p>
            <p>THROUGH the plantation, on which he reſided, ran a ſtream, ſtored with fiſh. This fiſhery two days in the week he made, together with his own boats and nets, the property of the ſurrounding poor; and frequently directed his ſervants to aid them in taking and curing their booty.</p>
            <p>IN the courſe of the war, he wrote, as I have been well informed, to his friends in Virginia, a propoſal to free his ſervants, ſhould the Legiſlature think it conſiſtent with the general welfare. This plan he has realized in his will; and the public are already informed, that it will be ſpeedily executed by his moſt reſpectable Executrix.</p>
            <p>AFTER the ſurrender of Yorktown, he returned, at the end of eight years abſence, to viſit his family. His ſervants had voluntarily arranged themſelves in two lines, from his manſion houſe to the creek which runs before the door. When he came in ſight, theſe humble and affectionate domeſtics ſent up a ſhout of joy, and uttered an extravagance of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; the women by ſhrieking, beating their breaſts, and rending their hair; and the men by cries and tears, and all the geſticulations, with which nature,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037339_0022_100CEAE932B35AD8"/>
in uninformed and unpoliſhed ſociety, gives vent to exceſſive paſſion. When he had croſſed the creek, he delayed his progreſs to his beloved abode, to ſhake all the adults by the hand, and to ſpeak ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and affectionately to the children. "Never," ſaid the gentleman, from whom I received this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, "was I ſo delightfully affected, except at the ſurrender of Yorktown; and then, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I conſidered the independence of my country as ſecured."</p>
            <p>ON the attributes, manifeſted by this great man in his conduct, I beg leave to make the following obſervations.</p>
            <p>GENERAL WASHINGTON was great, not by means of that brilliancy of mind, often appropriately term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed genius, and uſually coveted for ourſelves, and our children; and almoſt as uſually attended with qualities, which preclude wiſdom, and depreciate or forbid worth; but by a conſtitutional character more happily formed. His mind was indeed inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and full of reſources; but its energy appears to have been originally directed to that which is practical and uſeful, and not to that which is ſhewy and ſpecious. His judgment was clear and intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive beyond that of moſt who have lived, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtinctively to diſcern the proper anſwer to the celebrated Roman queſtion; <note n="*" place="bottom">What good purpoſe will it anſwer?</note> Cui bono erit? To this his inceſſant attention, and unwearied obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which nothing, whether great or minute, eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, doubtleſs contributed in a high degree. What he obſerved he treaſured up, and thus added daily to his ſtock of uſeful knowledge. Hence, although his early education was in a degree confined, his mind became poſſeſſed of extenſive, various, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act information. Perhaps there never was a mind,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037339_0023_100CEAEB0D188230"/>
on which theoretical ſpeculations had leſs influence, and the deciſions of common ſenſe more.</p>
            <p>AT the ſame time, no man ever more earneſtly or uniformly ſought advice, or regarded it, when given, with more critical attention. The opinions of friends and enemies, of thoſe who abetted, and of thoſe who oppoſed, his own ſyſtem, he explored and ſecured alike. His own opinions, alſo, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his proper counſellours, and often to oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; with a demand, that they ſhould be ſifted, and expoſed, without any tenderneſs to them becauſe they were his; inſiſting, that they ſhould be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as opinions merely, and, as ſuch, ſhould be ſubjected to the freeſt and moſt ſevere inveſtigation.</p>
            <p>WHEN any meaſure of importance was to be acted on, he delayed the formation of his judgment until the laſt moment; that he might ſecure to himſelf, alway, the benefit of every hint, opinion, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, which might contribute either to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, or change, his deciſion. Hence, probably, it in a great meaſure aroſe, that he was ſo rarely committed; and that his deciſions have ſo rarely produced regret, and have been ſo clearly juſtified both by their conſequences and the judgment of mankind.</p>
            <p>WITH this preparation, he formed a judgment finally and wholly his own; and although no man was ever more anxious before a meaſure was adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, probably no man was ever leſs anxious after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. He had done his duty, and left the iſſue to Providence.</p>
            <p>TO all this conduct his high independence of mind greatly contributed. By this I intend a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which dares to do its duty, againſt friends and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037339_0024_100CEAEE041A4718"/>
enemies, and in proſperous and adverſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, alike; and which, when it has done its duty, is regardleſs of opinions and conſequences.</p>
            <p>NOR was he leſs indebted to his peculiar <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note G.</note> firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He not only dared to act in this manner, but uniformly ſuſtained the ſame tone of thought and feeling, ſuch, as he was at the deciſion, he ever after continued to be; and all men deſpaired of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating on him unleſs through the medium of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. The ſame unchanging ſpirit ſupported him through every part of his aſtoniſhing trials, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the war; and exhibited him as exactly the ſame man after a defeat, as after a victory; neither elated nor depreſſed, but always grave, ſerene, and prepared for the event.</p>
            <p>FROM other great men he was diſtinguiſhed by an exemption from favouritiſm. No man ever ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed his attachment, as to be ſafe, for a moment, from deſerved reproof, or cenſure; nor was any man ever ſo diſreliſhed by him, as, on that account, to fail of receiving from him whatever applauſe, or ſervices, his merit could claim. Hence his friends feared, and his enemies reſpected him.</p>
            <p>HIS moderation and ſelf government were ſuch that he was always in his own power, and never in the power of any other perſon. Whatever paſſions he felt, they rarely appeared. His conduct, opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and life, wore unuſually the character of mere intellect. Hence he was never found unguarded, or embarraſſed; but was always at full liberty to do that, and that only, which expediency and duty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. A ſtriking inſtance of this trait in his character is ſeen in the well known fact; that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037339_0025_100CEAF011612C48"/>
exculpated himſelf from any charge, nor replied to any calumny. His accuſers, for ſuch he had, had opportunity to make the moſt of their accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; his calumniators, if their conſciences permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to ſleep in peace.</p>
            <p>HIS juſtice was exact, but tempered with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt humanity, <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note H.</note> which the occaſion would ſuffer. His truth no ſober man, who knew him, probably ever doubted. Watchful againſt his own expoſures to error, he was rarely found erring; jealous of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injuſtice, if he has done injuſtice, it is yet, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, unrecorded.</p>
            <p>HIS reſervedneſs has been at times cenſured. To me it appears to have been an important and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary characteriſtic of a perſon ſituated as he was. In familiar life a communicative diſpoſition is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally pleaſing, and often uſeful; in his high ſtations it would have been dangerous. One unguarded or ambiguous expreſſion might have produced evils, the remedy of which would have been beyond even his own power. No ſuch expreſſion is recorded of him.</p>
            <p>HIS punctuality was extreme. He roſe always with the dawn; he dined at a given minute; he attended every appointment at the moment. Hence his buſineſs public and private was always done at the proper time, and always beforehand.</p>
            <p>NO perſon appears to have had a higher ſenſe of decorum, and univerſal propriety. The eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his public and private life, traces an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable propriety, an exact decorum, in every action; in every word; in his demeanour to men of every claſs; in his public communications; in his convivial entertainments; in his letters; and in his
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037339_0026_100CEAF1A2FDA058"/>
familiar converſation; from which bluntneſs, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, witticiſm, indelicacy, negligence, paſſion, and overaction, were alike excluded.</p>
            <p>FROM theſe things happily combined, always ſeen, and ſeen always in their native light, without art, or affectation, it aroſe, that, wherever he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, an inſtinctive awe and veneration attended him on the part of all men. Every man, however great in his own opinion, or in reality, ſhrunk in his preſence, and became conſcious of an inferiority, which he never felt before. Whilſt he encouraged every man, particularly every ſtranger, and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly every diffident man, and raiſed him to ſelf-poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, no ſober perſon, however ſecure he might think himſelf of his eſteem, ever preſumed to draw too near him.</p>
            <p>WITH reſpect to his religious character there have been different opinions. No one will be ſurpriſed at this, who reflects, that this is a ſubject, about which, in all circumſtances not involving inſpired teſtimony, doubts may and will exiſt. The evidence concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it muſt of courſe ariſe from an induction of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Some will induce more of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and others ſewer; ſome will reſt on one claſs, or collection, others on another; and ſome will give more, and others leſs, weight to thoſe which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; according to their ſeveral modes, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, of judging. The queſtion in this, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſes, muſt be finally determined before another tribunal, than that of human judgment; and to that tribunal it muſt ultimately be leſt. For my own part, I have conſidered his numerous and uniform public and moſt ſolemn declarations of his high ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for religion, his exemplary and edifying at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to public worſhip, and his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> devotion, as proofs, ſufficient to ſatisfy every
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037339_0027_100CEAF3C5359A58"/>
perſon, willing to be ſatisfied. I ſhall only add, that if he was not a Chriſtian, he was more like one, than any man of the ſame deſcription, whoſe life has been hitherto recorded.</p>
            <p>AS a warrior, his merit has, I believe, been fully and readily acknowledged; yet I have doubted whether it has always been juſtly eſtimated. His military greatneſs lay not principally in deſperate ſallies of courage; in the daring and brilliant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits of a partiſan: Theſe would have ill ſuited his ſtation, and moſt probably have ruined his cauſe and country. It conſiſted in the formation of exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and maſterly <note n="*" place="bottom">See Note I.</note> plans; effectual preparations, the cautious prevention of great evils, and the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſeizure of every advantage; in combining hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous materials into one military body, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a ſyſtem of military and political meaſures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concentering univerſal confidence, and diffuſing an <note n="‖" place="bottom">See Note J.</note> influence next to magical; in comprehending a great ſcheme of war, purſuing a regular ſyſtem of acquiring ſtrength for his country, and wearing out the ſtrength of his enemies. To his conduct, both military and political, may, with exact propriety, be applied the obſervation, which has been often made concerning his courage; that in the moſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous ſituations no man ever ſaw his countenance change.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS, I ſhall be thought to have dwelt too long, and too minutely, on his character. I hope I ſhall be juſtified, partially at leaſt, when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that I have been ſeizing the beſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, which I ſhall ever enjoy, of teaching, in the moſt affecting manner in my power, the youths committed to my inſtruction, and forming a part of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037339_0028_100CEAF671328B20"/>
this audience, the way to become great, reſpectable, and uſeful.</p>
            <p>SUCH, my friends and fellow citizens, was the man, whoſe death we are aſſembled to lament, and whoſe worth we commemorate. Like the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubject of my text he ſtands alone in his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Like him he was great in the ſplendor of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, in wiſdom, in effort, in ſucceſs, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of his talents, virtues and labours, to the nation over whom he preſided in war and peace; in the eſtimation, the love, and the tears, of his country. On this reſemblance I have dwelt leſs, becauſe I ſuppoſe others have dwelt more; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear to add, that in the death of theſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed men there is a ſimilarity not a little ſtriking. Both died in advanced years, but without any previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous decay of faculties, or glory; both left their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective nations, not indeed eſtabliſhed, but ſo far advanced, as not abſolutely to demand a continuance of their ſuperintendency; and both were honored by a national and ſpontaneous mourning, as the laſt tribute of public veneration. Miraculous ſupport our nation could not hope for under any leader; but the ſignal interpoſitions of Heaven in our behalf, while under his guidance, ought never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
            <p>TO Americans his name will be ever dear; a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſweet incenſe, deſcending to every ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generation. The things, which he has done, are too great, too intereſting, ever to be forgotten. Every object which we ſee, every employment in which we are engaged, every comfort which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy, reminds us daily of his character. The general peace, liberty, religion, ſafety, and proſperity, ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impreſs, in every place, what he has done, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and atchieved. When a Legiſlature aſſembles
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037339_0029_100CEAF8A781AD90"/>
to enact laws; when Courts meet to diſtribute juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; when Congregations gather to worſhip God; they naturally, and almoſt neceſſarily, ſay "To Waſhington it is owing, under God, that we are here." The farmer purſuing his plough in peace, the mechanic following the buſineſs of his ſhop in ſafety, aſcribes the privilege to Waſhington. The houſe which, uninvaded, ſhelters us from the ſtorm, the cheerful fireſide ſurrounded by our little ones, the table ſpread in quiet with the bounties of Providence, the bed on which we repoſe in undiſturbed ſecurity, utters, in ſilent but expreſſive language, the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the praiſe, of Waſhington. Every ſhip bears the fruits of his labours on its wings, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultingly ſpreads its ſtreamers to his honour. The ſtudent meets him in the ſtill and peaceful walk; the traveller ſees him in all the proſperous and ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcenes of his journey; and our whole country in her thrift, order, ſafety, and morals, bears, inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in ſunbeams, throughout her hills and her plains, the name and the glory of Waſhington.</p>
            <p>FROM a ſubject ſo ſingular, and ſo edifying, it is not eaſy to fail of gaining uſeful practical inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Particularly, the ineſtimable benefits which we have derived from the efforts of this great man. cannot but prompt every ingenuous mind to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with unceaſing gratitude, the goodneſs of God in beſtowing upon us ſuch a bleſſing; God, who formed and furniſhed him for labours ſo uſeful, and for a life ſo glorious. In what a manner muſt the late war have cloſed, had the ſupreme command of our armies fallen to a weak or unprincipled man? What would have been its iſſue, had the powerful attempt to diſplace him, and to ſubſtitute a foreigner, ſucceeded? Think, I beſeech you, of the uniform condition of a conquered nation; a nation too, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as rebels by their conquerors. Think what
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037339_0030_100CEAFA4BF29BE8"/>
it would have been to have had your armies betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your lands ravaged, your houſes burnt, your beſt citizens brought to the halter, your wives and daughters diſhonoured, and your children houſeleſs, naked, and famiſhed. Think of the long and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs period, through which the broken ſpirit, the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined morals, the wide-ſpread ignorance, and the loſt energy, of your country would have perpetuated your miſeries, and prevented your poſterity from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merging again to the character of men, and the bleſſings of freemen.</p>
            <p>TO theſe wretched ſcenes contraſt your preſent freedom, peace, ſafety, glory, and felicity. To whom are they owing? The heart ſpontaneouſly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, "Firſt to God, and next to Waſhington." I mean not to detract from the wiſdom, bravery, or worth, of his generous companions in the council, and in the field. Cheerfully do I render to them the illuſtrious honours, which they have merited, and won; and heartily do I rejoice to ſee thoſe, who ſtill live, ſuſtaining and increaſing, in ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the high eſtimation, which they had ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply deſerved of their country. But in all that I have ſaid of their illuſtrious Chief they will be the firſt to unite, becauſe they have known him more intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than others. With them will all their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men inſtinctively accord; for his labours have been ſo great, ſo good, ſo endearing, that they cannot but be ſeated in every American heart. May our grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the Author always accompany, and totally tranſcend, our admiration of the inſtrument; let it inſpirit every reflection, and mingle with every joy.</p>
            <p>BY him, alſo, are our rulers, at the preſent and at every future period, taught how to rule. The ſame conduct will ever produce ſubſtantially the ſame effects; the ſame public well being, the ſame
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037339_0031_100CEAFCE97FA458"/>
glory, the ſame veneration. To be wiſe and good; to forget, or reſtrain, the dictates of paſſion, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey thoſe of duty; to ſeek ſingly the public wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and loſe in it perſonal gratification; to reſiſt calmly and firmly the paſſions, and purſue only the intereſts, of a nation, is the great ſecret of ruling well. When theſe things are exhibited in the ſtrong light of example, and crowned with ſucceſs and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, they are taught in a manner beyond meaſure more impreſſive, than can be found in rules and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. Here they are already tried, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Here they are ſeen ſurrounded by all their delightful attendants, and followed by all their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conſequences. The conviction produced is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, the impreſſion ſupreme. From this great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample all rulers may learn wiſdom, and our rulers more than any other. They are rulers of the very people, who loved and reverenced him, and who will, of courſe, love and reverence them, ſo far as they tread in his footſteps. They, alſo, know and feel his character, and ſucceſs, more than is poſſible for others. Wiſdom, therefore, and duty demand of them, and in a peculiar degree, ſtudiouſly to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſo glorious a pattern.</p>
            <p>THE youths, alſo, of our country, who wiſh to become great, uſeful and honourable, will here find the beſt directions, and the moſt powerful incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. To be great, uſeful, and honourable, they muſt reſemble him. The very actions, which he performed, they may indeed not be called to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; the ſufferings, which he underwent, they may not be obliged to undergo; but the attributes, which he poſſeſſed and diſplayed, muſt, in a good degree, be poſſeſſed and diſplayed by them alſo.</p>
            <p>LET them particularly remember, that greatneſs is not the reſult of mere chance, or genius; that it
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037339_0032_100CEAFF01F4BF68"/>
is not the flaſh of brilliancy, nor the deſperate ſally of ambition; that it is, on the contrary, the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reſult of ſtrong mental endowments, vigorous cultivation, honourable deſign, and wiſe direction. It is not the glare of a meteor; glittering, dazzling, conſuming, and vaniſhing; but the ſteady and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſplendour of the ſun; a ſplendour which, while it ſhines with preeminent brightneſs, warms alſo, enlivens, adorns, improves, and perfects, the objects, on which it ſhines: glorious indeed by its luſtre; but ſtill more glorious in the uſeful effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by its power. Of this great truth the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant example before us is a moſt dignified ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition. Let them imitate, therefore, the inceſſant attention, the exact obſervation, the unwearied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, the ſcrupulous regard to advice, the ſlowneſs of deciſion, the cautious prudence, the nice punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, the ſtrict propriety, the independence of thought and feeling, the unwavering firmneſs, the unbiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed impartiality, the ſteady moderation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the exact juſtice, the unveering truth, the univerſal humanity, and the high veneration for religion, and for God, always manifeſted by this great man. Thus will future Waſhingtons ariſe to bleſs our happy country.</p>
            <p>AS a nation we may derive from him many kinds of inſtruction and profit. This occaſion will, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, allow me to inſiſt on one only: The ſteady purſuit of that policy, which he ſo uniformly and ſucceſsfully purſued, and has ſo forcibly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In his farewell to the country which he ſo lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and defended, we have his laſt, and to us his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words; a moſt impreſſive recommendation of the beſt means of our national welfare; the ſum of all the political wiſdom, which he had imbibed from his vaſt experience; the ſubſtance of that policy, by which alone our ſafety and happineſs can be enſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In it we are moſt affectingly taught to preſerve
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037339_0033_100CEB01B98645C8"/>
our union; to deſpiſe trifling diſcriminations; to reverence our conſtitution; to reject watchfully all aſſociations and factions, formed to oppoſe it; to preſerve a well balanced adminiſtration; to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage literary inſtitutions; to promote, as of primary importance, morality and religion; to cheriſh public credit; to obſerve juſtice and good faith towards all nations; to cultivate harmony and peace with all; to indulge antipathies and favouritiſm towards none; to reſiſt, as dangerous and deadly, all foreign influence; to connect ourſelves, politically, as little as poſſible; and to hold, as much as maybe, a ſtrict and perpetual neutrality towards powers at war. Here all the national intereſts of America are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted; here all its political wiſdom is ſummed up in a ſingle ſheet. Nothing can be added, nothing without injury taken away. How greatly are theſe precepts recommended by the character of their author, and by the ſucceſs with which they have been followed in practice. How ſtrongly are they enforced by his labours for our country, by the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which he attained while ſteadily purſuing them, and by the manner, and the time, in which they were delivered. Happy, beyond meaſure, is it for theſe States, that he purſued them ſo long; that they have been ſo cloſely followed by his able and virtuous ſucceſſor; that they are now the only poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our government, and the efficient policy of our country. Happy, beyond meaſure, will it be, if our nation ſhould henceforth make them its great political creed, and the only rule of its political meaſures, at home, and abroad. Faction, party, diſſention, will then ceaſe; murmurs be loſt in peace and proſperity; intrigues be rendered infamous and hopeleſs; foreign influence no more lift up its ſnaky head; the danger of invaſion vaniſh; the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our country totter no more; the great politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal problem, Whether a free and happy Republic can be durable, be finally and propitiouſly ſolved;
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037339_0034_100CEB04396EBE58"/>
and Americans find leſs reaſon to lament, that Waſhington is dead; becauſe they will ſtill ſee him live in the policy and glory, the ſafety and peace, the virtue and felicity, of his beloved country.</p>

               <p>There have been many doubts concerning the character of General Waſhington, as a writer. Various perſons have denied, that he was at all, or in any reſpectable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the author of the ſeveral compoſitions, which are preſented to the public, as his. It may be a ſatisfaction to my readers to be informed, that the addreſs to the officers of the army in reply to the letters of Major Armſtrong, was penned by his own hand, and never ſeen by any perſon, until after it was publicly delivered. The originals of his anſwers, alſo, to the addreſſes preſented to him, in his laſt tour through the Eaſtern States, are now on file (as I am informed from high authority) in his own hand.</p>
               <p>When he began to read the abovementioned addreſs to the officers, he found himſelf in ſome degree embarraſſed by the imperfection of his ſight. Taking out his ſpectacles, he ſaid, "theſe eyes," my friends, "have grown dim, and theſe locks white, in the ſervice of my country, yet I have never doubted her juſtice."</p>

               <p>Upwards of 9000 men, together with the great body of artillery, ammunition, horſes, carriages, cattle, proviſions, &amp;c. were conveyed from Long-Iſland to New-York, while the Britiſh army was ſo near, that their men were diſtinctly heard at work with their pick-axes and ſhovels. The river is near a mile wide, and the decampment laſted thirteen hours; yet the enemy were perfectly ignorant of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, until it was completed. It ought here to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, about 2 o'clock in the morning, a thick fog pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially favoured the retreating army.</p>

               <p>The firſt knowledge, which Lord Cornwallis had of the retreat of General Waſhington, was in the morning; a few minutes before the noiſe of the cannon at Princeton was heard at Trenton. Sir William Erſkine, it is aſſerted, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Lord Cornwallis to place a ſtrong body of troops at the bridge over Sanpink Creek; apprehending, that General Waſhington would retreat into the heart of New-Jerſey rather than attempt to croſs the Delaware. This, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, was refuſed. Very early in the morning, Lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis, while in bed, was informed, that Gen<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap> Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton had decamped. Sir William at that moment came in. His Lordſhip aſked him, whither he believed the American General to be gone. At that inſtant, the artillery was heard from the neighbourhood of Princeton. "My Lord," ſaid Sir William, "General Waſhington tells you where he is. Do you not hear him calling to you to come after him?"</p>
               <p>So ſilently was this retreat conducted, that the American centinels at the bridge knew nothing of it, until themſelves were ordered to quit their poſt.</p>

I am warranted to declare, that he felt and exhibited the tendereſt compaſſion for that unfortunate young man, and that Major Andre often expreſſed to an American officer, of high reſpectability, the very polite and humane treatment, which he received from General Waſhington.]</p>

               <p>Among the plans deviſed by General Waſhington for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary operations, and expreſſive of his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of mind, I beg leave to mention the plan for attacking the Britiſh on the Delaware, in three points at once, of which only the attack on Col. Rahl at Trenton ſucceeded, the others being prevented by the ice; the plan of attacking the troops at Princeton; the plan of croſſing the Brandywine to attack Lord Cornwallis; the plan of attack at Germantown; the plan of the bold and ſucceſsful attack on Stoney Point; and the great plan of capturing the Britiſh force at Yorktown, involving the complete illuſion of Sir Henry Clinton.</p>
               <p>To theſe ought to be added a bold and maſterly deſign of attacking the whole Britiſh force on New-York Iſland, near the cloſe of the campaign in 1782. In this deſign Col. Talmadge was to have attacked the enemy on Long-Iſland, the preceeding night, with a body of 750 choice troops, and thence to have marched on horſeback to Hell-Gate, where boats, ready to receive him, were to have tranſported the corps to the oppoſite ſhore. Another body under the command of a General Officer was to have marched to Kingſbridge, to attack the enemy in front, and to keep them in full expectation of being aſſaulted there only: while the main body of the army was to have gone
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:037339_0037_100CEB0A91D62598"/>
in boats down Hudſon's River, and, landing below the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the night, was to have made the principal attack on their rear. The American army was at this time in great force, and perfectly diſciplined and ſupplied. Had this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign been attempted, there is every reaſon to believe, that, attacked at one moment, in front, flank and rear, at day-break, and with total ſurpriſe, the triumph over them muſt in all probability have been complete. It was prevented by a circumſtance wholly providential. Two Britiſh frigates moved up the North River the preceeding day, anchored directly oppoſite to the American army, and thus prevented the intended embarkation. There is not a reaſon to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the Britiſh commander had a ſuſpicion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign formed againſt him. It is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>[In no period of General Waſhington's military life did his talents and commanding influence appear more conſpicuous than at the battle of Monmouth. The flower of the army under General Lee were retreating before the enemy, and almoſt without having made any reſiſtance. When they were thus thrown back upon General Waſhington, at the head of his fatigued and illſupplied army, it is ſurpriſing, that the panic did not become general. General Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton brought his own troops forward, checked the Britiſh, and ſoon convinced Lee's flying troops, not only, that there was no occaſion for their retreat, but that they could defeat the enemy. General Waſhington never had full credit for this heroic exploit; and it has been thought, that if full juſtice had been done by the Courtmartial, General Lee would have been caſhiered.]</p>
               <p>[His aſtoniſhing power of commanding the minds of men was often exemplified in quieting mutinies, of which he had too many during his military courſe. But no writer has done him justice for his Fabian conduct when the army was on the borders of diſbanding. Some well written inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory pieces were addreſſed to the army, after the prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary articles of peace had been ſigned, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

He convened and addreſſed the officers; the hurricane of paſſion ſubſided; and reaſon, duty, and peace reſumed their dominion.

            </opener>
            <p>THE period for a new election of a Citizen, to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the executive government of the United States, being not far diſtant, and the time actually arrived, when your thoughts muſt be employed in deſignating the perſon, who is to be cloathed with that important truſt, it appears to me proper, eſpecially <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> may conduce to a more diſtinct ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the public voice, that I ſhould now appriſe you of the reſolution I have formed, to decline being conſidered among the number of thoſe, out of whom a choice is to be made.</p>
            <p>I beg you, at the ſame time, to do me the juſtice to be aſſured, that this reſolution has not been taken, without a ſtrict regard to all the conſiderations appertaining to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of ſervice which ſilence in my ſituation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future intereſt; no deficiency of grateful reſpect for your paſt kindneſs: But am ſupported by a full conviction that the ſtep is compatable with both.</p>
            <p>The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which your ſuffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform ſacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what appeared to be your deſire. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly hoped, that it would have been much earlier in my power conſiſtently with motives, which I was not at liberty to diſregard, to return to that retirement, from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The ſtrength of my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do this, previous to the laſt election, had even led to the preparation of an addreſs to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical poſture of affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:037339_0040_100CEB11B8636CC0"/>
perſons entitled to my confidence, impelled me to abandon the idea.</p>
            <p>I rejoice, that the ſtate of your concerns external as well as internal, no longer renders the purſuit of inclination in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the ſentiment of duty, or propriety: And am perſuaded whatever partiality may be retained for my ſervice, that in the preſent circumſtances of our country, you will not diſapprove my determination to retire.</p>
            <p>The impreſſions with which I firſt undertook the arduous truſt, were explained on the proper occaſion. In the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this truſt. I will only ſay, that I have with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the government, the beſt exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not unconſcious, in the out-ſet, of the inferiority of my qualifications, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in my own eyes, perhaps ſtill more in the eyes of others, has ſtrengthened the motives to diffidence of myſelf: And every day the increaſing weight of years admoniſhes me more and more, that the ſhade of retirement is as neceſſary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have given peculiar value to my ſervices, they were temporary, I have the conſolation to believe, that while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political ſcene, patriotiſm does not forbid it.</p>
            <p>In looking forward to the moment, which is intended to terminate the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to ſuſpend the deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country, for the many honors it has conferred upon me; ſtill more for the ſtedfaſt confidence with which it has ſupported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifeſting my inviolable attachment, by ſervices faithful and perſevering, though in uſefulneſs unequal to my zeal.—If benefits have reſulted to our country from theſe ſervices, let it always be remembered to our praiſe, and as an inſtructive example in our annals, that under circumſtances in which the paſſions, agitated in every direction, were liable to miſlead, amidſt appearances ſometimes dubious—viciſſitudes of fortune, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten diſcouraging in ſituations, in which not unfrequently want of ſucceſs has countenanced the ſpirit of criticiſm—the conſtancy of your ſupport was the eſſential prop of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and a gurantee of the plans by which they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:037339_0041_100CEB134A3766F8"/>
Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I ſhall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it with me to my grave, as a ſtrong incitement to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing vows, that Heaven may continue to you the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt tokens of its benificence—that your union and brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection may be perpetual—that the free Conſtitution, which is the work of your hands, may be ſacredly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained—that its adminiſtration in ever department may be ſtamped with wiſdom and virtue—that, in fine, the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the people of theſe States, under the auſpices of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may be made complete, by ſo careful a preſervation and ſo prudent a uſe of this bleſſing, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applauſe, the affection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a ſtranger to it.</p>
            <p>Here perhaps, I ought to ſtop. But ſolicitude for your welfare, which cannot end but with my life, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, of danger natural to that ſolicitude, urge me on an occaſion like the preſent, to offer to your ſolemn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, and to recommend to your frequent review, ſome ſentiments; which are the reſult of much reflection of no inconſiderable obſervation, and which appear to me all-important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. Theſe will be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only feel in them the diſintereſted warnings of a parting friend, who can poſſibly have no perſonal motive to bias his counſel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your indulgent reception of my ſentiments on a former and not diſſimilar occaſion.</p>
            <p>Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is neceſſary to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>tify or confirm the attachment.</p>
            <p>The unity of Government which conſtitutes you one peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is alſo now dear to you. It is juſtly ſo; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real Independence, the ſupport of your tranquility at home, your peace abroad; of your ſafety; of your proſperity; of that very liberty which you ſo highly prize. But, as it is eaſy to foreſee, that from different cauſes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your political <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, againſt which the batteries of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and external enemies will be moſt conſtantly and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, (though often covertly and inſidiouſly) directed, it is of infinite moment that you ſhould properly eſtimate the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:037339_0042_100CEB1654F39238"/>
immenſe value of your National Union, to your collective and individual happineſs; that you ſhould cheriſh a cordial, habitual, and immoveable attachment to it; accuſtoming yourſelves to think and ſpeak of it as of the palladium of your political ſafety and proſperity, watching for its preſervation with jealous anxiety; diſcountenancing whatever may ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt even a ſuſpicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the firſt dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the reſt, or to enfeeble the ſacred ties which now link together the various parts.</p>
            <p>For this you have every inducement of ſympathy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Citizens, by birth or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of AMERICAN, which belongs to you in your national capacity, muſt always exalt the juſt pride of patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm, more than any appellation derived from local diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. With ſlight ſhades of difference, you have the ſame religion, manners, habits and political principles. You have in a common cauſe, fought and triumphed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Independence and Liberty you poſſeſs are the work of joint councils, and joint efforts, of common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, ſufferings and ſucceſſes.</p>
            <p>But theſe conſiderations however powerfully they addreſs themſelves to your ſenſibility, are greatly outweighed by thoſe which apply more immediately to your intereſt. Here every portion of our country finds the moſt commanding motives for carefully guarding and preſerving the union of the whole.</p>
            <p>The <hi>North,</hi> in an unreſtrained intercourſe with the <hi>South,</hi> protected by the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of the latter, great additional reſources of maritime and commercial enterpriſe, and precious mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of manufacturing induſtry. The <hi>South</hi> in the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe, benefiting by the agency of the <hi>North,</hi> ſees its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griculture grow, and its commerce expand. Turning part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into its own channels the ſeamen of the <hi>North,</hi> it finds its particular navigation invigorated—and while it contributes, in different ways, to nouriſh and increaſe the general maſs of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime ſtrength, to which itſelf is unequally adopted. The <hi>Eaſt</hi> in a like intercourſe with the <hi>Weſt,</hi> already finds,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:037339_0043_100CEB180FB57818"/>
and in the progreſſive improvement of interior communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by land and water,—will more and more find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or manufactures at home. The <hi>Weſt</hi> derives from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> ſupplies requiſite to its growth and comfort—and what is perhaps of ſtill greater conſequence, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity owe the <hi>ſecure</hi> enjoyment of indiſpenſable <hi>outlets</hi> for its own productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime ſtrength of the Atlantic ſide of the Union, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an indiſſoluble community of intereſt as <hi>one nation.</hi> Any other tenure by which the <hi>Weſt</hi> can hold this eſſential advantage, whether derived from its own ſeparate ſtrength, or from an apoſtate and unnatural connection with any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power, muſt be intrinſically precarious.</p>
            <p>While then every part of our country thus feels an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and particular intereſt in Union, all the parts combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned cannot fail to find in the united maſs of means and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, greater ſtrength, greater reſource, proportionably greater ſecurity, from external danger, a leſs frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of their peace by foreign nations; and what is of ineſtimable value! they muſt derive from Union an exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from thoſe broils and wars between themſelves, which ſo frequently afflict neighbouring countries, not tied toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ſame government; which their own rivalſhips alone would be ſufficient to produce, but which oppoſite fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign alliances, attachments and intrigues would ſtimulate and imbitter. Hence likewiſe they will avoid the neceſſity of thoſe overgrown military eſtabliſhments, which under any form of government are inauſpicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hoſtile to Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican Liberty: In this ſenſe it is, that your Union ought to be conſidered as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preſervation of the other.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations ſpeak a perſuaſive language to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Union as a primary object of a patriotic deſire. Is there a doubt, whether a common government can em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, ſo large a ſphere?—Let experience ſolve it. To liſten to mere ſpeculation in ſuch a caſe were criminal. We are authoriſed to hope that a proper organization, of the whole, with the auxiliary agency, of governments for the reſpective ſubdiviſions, will afford a happy iſſue to the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:037339_0044_100CEB1A6EFF5F40"/>
experiment. 'Tis well worth a fair and full experiment. With ſuch powerful and obvious motives to Union, affecting all parts of our country, while experiment ſhall not have demonſtrated its impracticability, there will always be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to diſtruſt the patriotiſm of thoſe, who in any quarter may endeavour to weaken its bands.</p>
            <p>In contemplating the cauſes which may diſturb our Union, it occurs as matter of ſerious concern, that any ground ſhould be furniſhed for characteriſing parties, by <hi>Geographical</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminations—<hi>Nothern</hi> and <hi>Southern—Atlantic</hi> and <hi>Weſtern;</hi> whence deſigning men may endeavour to excite a belief, that there is a real difference of local intereſts and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in particular diſtricts, is to miſrepreſent the opinions and aims of other <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. You cannot ſhield yourſelves too much againſt the jealouſies and heart burnings which ſpring from theſe miſrepreſentations: they tend to render alien to each other thoſe who ought to be bound together by fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal affection.—The inhabitants of our weſtern country have lately had a uſeful leſſon on this head: They have ſeen, in the negociation by the Executive, and in the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous ratification by the Senate, of the Treaty with Spain, and in the univerſal ſatisfaction at that event, throughout the United States, a deciſive proof how unfounded were the ſuſpicions propagated among them, of a policy in the general government and in the Atlantic ſtates unfriendly to their intereſts in regard to the Miſſiſippi; they have been witneſſes to the formation of two treaties, that with Great-Britain and that with Spain, which ſecure to them every thing they could deſire, in reſpect to our foreign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, towards confirming their proſperity. Will it not be their wiſdom to rely for the preſervation of theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages on the UNION by which they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to thoſe adviſers, if ſuch they are, who would fever them from their brethren, and connect them with aliens?</p>
            <p>To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for the whole is indiſpenſable.

<pb n="46" facs="unknown:037339_0045_100CEB1C8203A000"/>
a government better calculated than your former for an intimate Union, and for the efficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the offspring of your own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full inveſtigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the diſtribution of its powers, uniting ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with energy, and containing within itſelf a proviſion for its own amendment, has a juſt claim to your confidence and your ſupport. Reſpect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquieſcence in its meaſures, are duties en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The baſis of our political ſyſtems is the right of the people to make and to alter their conſtitutions of government. But, the conſtitution which at any time exiſts, till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is ſacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of the people to eſtabliſh government, pre-ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the duty of every individual to obey the eſtabliſhed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>All obſtructions to the execution of the laws, all combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and aſſociations, under whatever plauſible charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with the real deſign to direct, controul, counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the conſtituted authorities, are deſtructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They ſerve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force—to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a ſmall but artful and enterpriſing minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public adminiſtration the mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the ill concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of conſiſtent and wholeſome plans digeſted by common councils and modified by mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts.</p>
            <p>However combinations of aſſociations of the above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, may now and then anſwer popular ends, they are likely in the courſe of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men, will be enabled to ſubvert the power of the people, and to uſurp for themſelves the reins of government; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying afterwards the very engines which have lifed them to unjuſt dominion.</p>
            <p>Towards the preſervation of your government, and the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:037339_0046_100CEB1E861D27B0"/>
permanency of your preſent happy ſtate, it is requiſite, not only that you ſteadily diſcountenance irregular oppoſition to its acknowledged authority, but alſo that you reſiſt with care, the ſpirit of innovation upon its principles, however ſpecious the pretexts. One method of aſſault may be to effect in the forms of the conſtitution, alterations which will impair the energy of the ſyſtem, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit are at leaſt as neceſſary to fix the true character of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as of other human inſtitutions that experience is the ſureſt ſtandard, by which to teſt the real tendency of the exiſting conſtitution of a country—that facility in chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon the credit of mere hypotheſis and opinion, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to perpetual change, from the endleſs variety of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis and opinion; and remember, eſpecially, that for the efficient management of your common intereſt, in a country ſo extenſive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is conſiſtent with the perfect ſecurity of liberty, is indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Liberty itſelf will find in ſuch a government, with powers properly diſtributed and adjuſted, its ſureſt guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. It is, indeed, little elſe than a name, where the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is too feeble to withſtand the enterprises of faction, to confine each member of the ſociety within the limits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the ſecure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of perſon and property.</p>
            <p>I have already intimated to you, the danger of parties in the ſtate, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical diſcriminations. Let me now take a more comprehenſive view and warn you in the moſt ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner againſt the baneful effects of the ſpirit of party, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
            <p>This ſpirit, unfortunately, is inſeparable from our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, having its root in the ſtrongeſt paſſions of the human mind. It exiſts under different ſhapes in all governments —more or leſs ſtifled, controled, or repreſſed; but in thoſe of the popular form, it is ſeen in its greateſt rankneſs and is truly their worſt enemy.</p>
            <p>The alternate dominion of one faction over another, ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by the ſpirit of revenge, natural to party diſſention, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the moſt horrid enormities, is itſelf a frightful deſpotiſm—But
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:037339_0047_100CEB20DC626738"/>
this leads at length to a more formal and permanent deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.—The diſorders and miſeries, which reſult, gradually incline the minds of men to ſeek ſecurity, and repoſe in the abſolute power of an individual; and ſooner or later the chief of ſome prevailing faction more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this diſpoſition to the purpoſes of his own elevation, on the ruins of Public Liberty.</p>
            <p>Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheleſs ought not to be entirely out of ſight) the common and continual miſchiefs of the ſpirit of party are ſufficient to make it the intereſt and duty of a wiſe people to diſcourage and reſtrain it.</p>
            <p>It ſerves always to diſtract the Public Councils and enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Public Adminiſtration. It agitates the community With ill founded jealouſies and falſe alarms; kindles the animoſity of one part againſt another, foments occaſionally riot and inſurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated acceſs to the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment itſelf through the channels of party paſſions. Thus the policy and will of one country are ſubjected to the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icy and will of another.</p>
            <p>There is an opinion that parties in free countries are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful checks upon the adminiſtration of the government, and ſerve to keep alive the ſpirit of Liberty. This within cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain limits is probably true, and in governments of a monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical caſt, patriotiſm may look with indulgence, if not with favour upon the ſpirit of party. But in thoſe of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a ſpirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency it is certain there will always be enough of that ſpirit for every ſalutary purpoſe. And there being conſtant danger of exceſs, the effort ought to be by force of Public opinion, to mitigate and aſſuage it. A fire not to be quenched; it demands uniform vigilance to prevent its burſting into a flame, leaſt inſtead of warming, it mould conſume.</p>
            <p>It is important likewiſe, that the habits of thinking in a free country, ſhould inſpire caution, in thoſe entruſted with its adminiſtration, to confine themſelves within their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective conſtitutional ſpheres, avoiding in the exerciſe of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The ſpirit of encroachment tends to conſolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:037339_0048_100CEB2304473318"/>
the form of Government, a real deſpotiſm. A juſt eſtimate of that love of power, and proneneſs to abuſe it, which predominates in the human heart is ſufficient to ſatisfy us of the truth of this poſition. The neceſſity of reciprocal checks in the exerciſe of the political power; by dividing and diſtributing it into different depoſitories, and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting each the guardian of the public weal againſt invaſions by the others, has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern; ſome of them in our country and under our own eyes. To preſerve them muſt be as neceſſary as to inſtitute them. If, in the opinion of the people, the diſtribution or modification of the conſtitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way, which the conſtitution deſignates—But let there be no change by uſurpation; for though this, in one inſtance, may be the inſtrument of good, it is the cuſtomary weapon by which free governments are deſtroyed—The precedent muſt always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or tranſient benefit which the uſe can at any time yield.</p>
            <p>Of all the diſpoſitions and habits which lead to political proſperity, Religion and Morality are indiſpenſable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. In vain would that Man claim the tribute of Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm, who would labor to ſubvert theſe great pillars of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man happineſs, theſe firmeſt props of the duties of men and Citizens. The mere Politician, equally with the pious man ought to reſpect and to cheriſh them.—A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it ſimply be aſked where is the ſecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if the ſenſe of religious obligation deſert the oaths which are the inſtruments of inveſtigation in Courts of Juſtice?—And let us with caution indulge the ſuppoſition, that morality can be maintained without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Whatever may be conceded of the influence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined education on minds of peculiar ſtructure; reaſon and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in excluſion of religious principle.</p>
            <p>Tis ſubſtantially true, that virtue or morality is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſpring of popular government. The rule indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends with more or leſs force to every ſpecies of free gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. Who that is a ſincere Friend to it can look
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:037339_0049_100CEB24FB932CC8"/>
with indifference upon attempts to ſhake the foundation of the Fabric?</p>
            <p>Promote, then as an object of primary importance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions for the general diffuſion of knowledge. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the ſtructure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is eſſential that public opinion ſhould be enlightened.</p>
            <p>As a very important ſource of ſtrength and ſecurity, cheriſh public credit. One method of preſerving it is to uſe it as ſparingly as poſſible; avoiding occaſions of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence by cultivating peace, but remembering alſo that timely diſburſements to prepare for dangers, frequently prevent much greater diſburſements to repel it: Avoiding likewiſe the accumulation of debt, not only by ſhunning occaſions of expence, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to diſcharge the debts which unavoidable wars may have occaſioned, not ungenerouſly throwing upon poſterity the burthen which we ourſelves ought to bear. The execution of theſe maxims belongs to your repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, but it is neceſſary that public opinion ſhould co-operate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is eſſential that you ſhould practically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue;—that to have revenue there muſt be taxes—and none can be deviſed which are not more or leſs inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and unpleaſant—that the intrinſic embarraſſment inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from the ſelection of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties)—ought to be a deciſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for a candid conſtruction of the conduct of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in making it, and for a ſpirit of acquieſcence in the meaſures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.</p>
            <p>Obſerve good faith and juſtice towards all nations; cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate peace and harmony with all—Religion and Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enjoin this conduct; and can it be, that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and (at no diſtant period) a great nation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple always guided by an exalted juſtice and benevolence. Who can doubt that in the courſe of time and things, the fruits of ſuch a plan would richly repay any temporary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which might be loſt by a ſteady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:037339_0050_100CEB27676A4178"/>
felicity of a Nation with Virtue? The experiment, at leaſt, is recommended by every ſentiment which enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles human nature.—Alas! is it rendered impoſſible by its vices?</p>
            <p>In the execution of ſuch a plan, nothing is more eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al than that permanent, inveterate antipathies againſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Nations, and paſſionate attachments for others ſhould be excluded; and that in the place of them, juſt and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable feelings towards all ſhould be cultivated. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondneſs, is in ſome degree a ſlave.—It is a ſlave to its animoſity or to its affection, either of which is ſufficient to lead it aſtray from its duty and its intereſt. Antipathy in one nation againſt another diſpoſes each more readily to offer inſult and injury, to lay hold of ſlight cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental or trifling occaſions of diſpute occur.</p>
            <p>Hence frequent colliſions, obſtinate, envenomed and bloody conteſts. The Nation, prompted by ill will and reſentment, ſometimes impels to war the government, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the beſt calculations of policy. The government ſometimes participates in the national propenſity, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopts through paſſion what reaſon would reject; at other times, it makes the animoſity of the nation ſubſervient to projects of hoſtility inſtigated by pride, ambition, and other ſiniſter and pernicious motives. The peace often, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perhaps the liberty of Nations has been the victim.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe, a paſſionate attachment of one Nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Nation, facilitating the illuſion of an imaginary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt, in caſes where no real common intereſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, and infuſing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or juſtification. It leads alſo to conceſſions to the favorite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the Nation making the conceſſions; by unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily parting with what ought to have been retained; and by exciting jealouſy, ill will, and a diſpoſition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld: —And it gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote themſelves to the favorite Nation) facility to betray, or ſacrifice the intereſts of their own country, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:037339_0051_100CEB28FB09F3E0"/>
odium, ſometimes even with popularity; gilding with the appearances of a virtuous ſenſe of obligation a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the baſe or fooliſh compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.</p>
            <p>As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, ſuch attachments are particularly alarming to the truly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened and independent patriot. How many opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do they afford to tamper with domeſtic factions, to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the arts of ſeduction to miſlead public opinion, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence or awe the public councils; ſuch an attachment of a ſmall or weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the ſatellite of the latter.</p>
            <p>Againſt the inſiduous wiles of foreign influence (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you to believe me, fellow citizens) the jealouſy of a free people ought to be <hi>conſtantly</hi> awake; ſince hiſtory and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience prove that foreign influence is one of the moſt baneful foes of Republican Government. But that jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to be uſeful muſt be impartial; elſe it becomes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the very influence to be avoided, inſtead of a defence againſt it. Exceſſive partiality for one foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and exceſſive diſlike of another, cauſe thoſe whom they actuate to ſee danger only on one ſide, and ſerve to veil and even ſecond the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may reſiſt the intrigues of the favorite, are liable to become ſuſpected and odious; while its tools and dupes uſurp the applauſe and confidence of the people to ſurrender their intereſts.</p>
            <p>The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations, is in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little <hi>political</hi> connection as poſſible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled with perfect good faith.—Here let us ſtop.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Europe</hi> has a ſet of primary intereſts, which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence ſhe muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in frequent controverſies, the cauſes of which are eſſentially foreign to our concerns. Hence therefore, it muſt be unwiſe in us to implicate ourſelves, by artificial <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es, in the ordinary viciſitudes of her politics, or the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary combinations and colliſions of her friendſhips, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
            <p>Our detached and diſtant ſituation, invites and enables us
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:037339_0052_100CEB2AF38FF768"/>
to purſue a different courſe. If we remain one people, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an efficient government, the period is not far off, when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take ſuch an attitude as will cauſe the neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality, we may at any time reſolve upon, to be ſcrupulouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpected; when belligerent nations, under the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of making acquiſitions upon us, will not lightly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the giving us provocation; when we may chooſe peace or war, as our intereſt, guided by juſtice, ſhall counſel.</p>
            <p>Why forego the advantages of ſo peculiar a ſituation? Why quit our own, to ſtand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our deſtiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and proſperity in the toils of Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ambition, rivalſhip, intereſt, humour or caprice?</p>
            <p>'Tis our true policy to ſteer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world; ſo far, I mean, as we are <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> liberty to do it; for let me not, be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

I hold the maxim no leſs applicable to public than to private affairs, that honeſty is always the beſt policy. I repeat it, therefore, let thoſe engagements be obſerved in their genuine ſenſe. But in my opinion, it is unneceſſary, and would be unwiſe to extend them.</p>
            <p>Taking care always to keep ourſelves, by ſuitable eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments, on a reſpectable defenſive poſture, we may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truſt to temporary alliances for extraordinary emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies.</p>
            <p>Harmony, liberal intercourſe with all nations, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by policy, humanity and intereſt. But even our commercial policy, ſhould hold an equal and impartial hand; neither ſending or granting excluſive favours or preferences—conſulting the natural courſe of things; dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing and diverſifying by gentle means the ſtreams of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, but forcing nothing; eſtabliſhing, with powers ſo diſpoſed, in order to give trade a ſtable courſe to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the Government to ſupport them; conventional rules of intercourſe, the beſt that preſent circumſtances and mutual opinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or varied as experience and circumſtances ſhall dictate; conſtantly keeping in view, that 'tis folly in one nation to look for diſintereſted favours from another; that it muſt

pay with a portion of its Independence for whatever it may accept under that character; that by ſuch acceptance, it may place itſelf in the condition of having given equivalents for nominal favours, and yet of being reproached with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude for not giving more.—There can be no greater error than to expect, or calculate, upon <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eal favours from nation to nation. 'Tis an illuſion which experience muſt cure, which a juſt pride ought to diſcard.</p>
            <p>In offering to you, my countrymen, theſe counſels of an old affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the ſtrong and laſting impreſſion I could wiſh—that they will controul the uſual current of the paſſions, or prevent our nation from running the courſe which has hitherto marked the deſtiny of nations: But if I may even flatter myſelf, that they may be productive of ſome partial benefit, ſome occaſional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party ſpirit, to warn againſt the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard againſt the impoſtures of pretended patriotiſm; this hope will be a full recompence for the ſolicitude for your welfare, by which they have been dictated.</p>
            <p>How far in the diſcharge of my official duties, I have been guided by the principles which have been delineated, the public records and other evidences of my conduct muſt witneſs to you and to the world.

            <p>In relation to the ſtill ſubſiſting war in Europe, my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of the 22d of April, 1795, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice, and by that of your Repreſentatives in both Houſes of Congreſs, the ſpirit of that meaſure has continually governed me; unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.</p>
            <p>After deliberate examination, with the aid of the beſt lights I could obtain, I was well ſatiſfied that our country, under all the circumſtances of the caſe, had a right to take and was bound in duty and intereſt to take a neutral poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            <p>The conſiderations which reſpect the right to hold this conduct, it is not neceſſary on this occaſion to detail. I will only obſerve, that according to my underſtanding of the

            <p>The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without any thing more, from the obligation which juſtice and humanity impoſe on every nation, in caſes in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.</p>
            <p>The inducements of intereſt for obſerving that conduct will beſt be referred to your own reflections and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. With me, a predominant motive has been to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to gain time to our country to ſettle and mature its yet recent inſtitutions, and to progreſs without interruption, to that degree of ſtrength and conſiſtency, which is neceſſary to give it, humanly ſpeaking, the command of its own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
            <p>Though in reviewing the incidents of my adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I am unconſcious of intentional error: I am neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs too ſenſible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently beſeech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils, to which they may tend. I ſhall alſo carry with me the hope that my country will never ceaſe to view them with indulgence; and that after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its ſervice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be conſigned to oblivion, as my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt ſoon be the manſions of reſt.</p>
            <p>Relying on its kindneſs in this as in other things, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by that fervent love towards it, which is ſo natural to a man who views in it the native ſoil of himſelf and his progenitors for ſeveral generations; I anticipate with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing expectation that retreat, in which I promiſe myſelf to realize, without alloy, the ſweet enjoyment of partaking, in the midſt of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws under a free government—the ever favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward as I truſt, of our mutual cares, labours and dangers.</p>
