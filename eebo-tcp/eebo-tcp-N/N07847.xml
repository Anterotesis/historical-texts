            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I THANK you very kindly for the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets and news-papers, you was ſo obliging as to ſend me. I will, according to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, give you a few miſcellaneous ſtrictures on that pamplet wrote by Mr. <hi>H—p—s,</hi> your governor, entitled, "The rights of colonies exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined."</p>
            <p>His honour reminds me of the <hi>Roman</hi> poet.
<q>
                  <l>"Eſt genus hominum, qui eſſe primos ſe omnium rerum volunt,</l>
                  <l>"Nec ſunt.—"</l>
               </q>
He ſeems to give a ſolemnity to his performance, as if the ſubject had not been ſufficiently handled by
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010011_0003_0F7B98B9F0DC4148"/>
any other before him, but I am of opinion he falls very ſhort of Mr.—, who, though unhappily miſled by popular ideas, and at the head of the <hi>tribunitian veto,</hi> yet appears to be a man of knowledge and parts: Whereas <hi>the rights of colonies examined,</hi> is a laboured, oſtentatious piece, diſcovers its author to be totally unacquainted with ſtile or diction, and eagerly fond to paſs upon the world for a man of letters.</p>
            <p>I cannot forgive the honourable author in adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his motto the three lines from <hi>Thompſon,</hi> ſo little applicable are they to the preſent times. I might challenge all the ſons of diſcontent and faction, in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions, to ſhew the leaſt ſimilitude between the years one thouſand ſix hundred and forty-one, and one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty-four. How cruel and invidious is it to inſinuate the moſt diſtant likeneſs between the two periods? How much like ſedition does it ſeem, to aſſociate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tranſactions of the nation with thoſe of one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſix hundred and forty-one, which ſoon after kindled into a civil war, and in the end overturned the <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſtitution?</p>
            <p>The honourable author might perhaps flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that, in future editions of <hi>Thompſon</hi>'s liberty, commentators may inſert <hi>variae lectiones</hi> of the text, and the three lines run thus:
<q>
                  <l>"Mid the low murmurs of ſubmiſſive fear,</l>
                  <l>"And mingled rage, my <hi>H—p—s</hi> rais'd his voice,</l>
                  <l>"And to the laws appeal'd."</l>
               </q>
Or perhaps ſome future bard may ſing the preſent times, and HE be made the hero of the ſong. The aptneſs is eaſy and ſtriking, and the idea too pleaſing
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010011_0004_0F7B98BABAF6E110"/>
to be reſiſted. <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> in contemplating his own image, was turned into a daffodil. Who can think of this, and feel no pity for the pride and weakneſs of <hi>man that is born of a woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>"So have I ſeen, on ſome bright ſummer's day,</l>
               <l>"A calf of genius, debonnair and gay,</l>
               <l>"Dance on the brink, as if inſpired by fame,</l>
               <l>"Fond of the pretty fellow in the ſtream."</l>
               <bibl>LOVE OF FAME, THE UNIVERSAL PASSION.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>I would fain hope that his honour's motto is not a true portrait of the general temper and conduct of the <hi>Americans;</hi> I would rather think <q>
                  <hi>the low mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs of ſubmiſſive fear, and mingled rage,</hi>
               </q> delineate only a few diſappointed traders. It were to be wiſhed that ſome friend of the colonies would endeavour to remove any unfavourable impreſſions this, and other pamphlets of the like kind, may have occaſioned at home; leſt thoſe in power form the general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the colonies from ſuch notices as theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, and from thence be inclined to increaſe their dependance, rather than to emancipate them from the preſent ſuppoſed impoſitions. Depend upon it, my Friend, a people like the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> arrived to the higheſt pitch of glory and power, the envy and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of ſurrounding ſlaves, who hold the balance of <hi>Europe</hi> in their hands, and rival in arts and arms every period of ancient or modern ſtory; a nation who, for the defence and ſafety of <hi>America</hi> only, ſtaked their all in the late war; this people, I ſay, juſtly conſcious of their dignity, will not patiently be dictated to by thoſe whom they have ever conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as dependant upon them. Happy will it be for the colonies, yea happy for the honourable author,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010011_0005_0F7B98BB97AE83E8"/>
if his pamphlet ſhould meet with nothing more than contempt and neglect; for ſhould it catch the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of men in power, meaſures may be taken to ſtifle in the birth <hi>"the low murmurs of ſubmiſſive fear,"</hi> and cruſh in embryo <hi>"the mingled rage,"</hi> which now ſo prettily adorns the head of his honour's pamphlet.</p>
            <p>However diſguiſed, poliſhed or ſoftened the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of this pamphlet may ſeem, yet every one muſt ſee, that its profeſſed deſign is ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent throughout, namely, to prove, <hi>that the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have rights independant of, and not controulable by, the authority of parliament.</hi> It is upon this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and indiſcreet poſition I ſhall communicate to you my real ſentiments.</p>
            <p>To ſuppoſe a deſign of enſlaving the colonies by parliament, is too preſumptuous; to propagate it in print, is perhaps dangerous. Perplexed between a deſire of ſpeaking all he thinks, and the fear of ſaying too much, the honourable author is obliged to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench himſelf in obſcurity and inconſiſtency in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of his performance: I ſhall bring one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>In page eleven, he ſays, <q>It is the indiſpenſible duty of every good and loyal ſubject chearfully to obey, and patiently ſubmit to, all the laws, orders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that may be paſſed by parliament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I do not much admire either the ſpirit or compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this ſentence. Is it the duty <hi>only</hi> of good and loyal ſubjects to obey? Are the wicked and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal ſubjects abſolved from this obligation? elſe why is this paſſage ſo marvellouſly penned: <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levtherus Lipſienſis</hi> would directly pronounce this a figure in rhetorick, called nonſenſe.—Believe me, my friend, I did not quote this paſſage to ſhew my ſkill
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010011_0006_0F7B98BCD4780168"/>
in criticiſm, but to point out a contradiction between it, and another paſſage in page twenty, which runs thus: <q>It muſt be abſurd to ſuppoſe, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> have a ſovereign and abſolute authority over their fellow ſubjects of <hi>America, or even any ſort of power whatſoever over them;</hi> but it will be ſtill more abſurd to ſuppoſe, they can give a power to their repreſentatives, which they have not themſelves,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here it is obſervable, that the firſt cited paſſage expreſſes a full ſubmiſſion to the authority of parliament; the laſt is as explicit a denial of that authority. The ſum of his honour's argument is this: The people of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> have not any ſort of power over the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans;</hi> the houſe of commons have no greater autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than the people of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> who are their conſtituents; <hi>ergo,</hi> the houſe of commons <hi>have not any ſort of power over the</hi> Americans. This is indeed a curious invented ſyllogiſm, the ſole merit of which is due to the firſt magiſtrate of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> colony.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to inveſtigate the true natural relation, if I may ſo ſpeak, between colonies and their mother ſtate, abſtracted from compact or poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inſtitution, but here I can find nothing ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; till this relation is clearly defined upon a rational and natural principle, our reaſoning upon the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the colonies obedience will be deſultory and inconcluſive. Every connection in life has its reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal duties; we know the relation between a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and child, huſband and wife, maſter and ſervant, and from thence are able to deduce their reſpective obligations; but we have no notices of any ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe natural relation between a mother ſtate and its colonies, and therefore cannot reaſon with ſo much
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010011_0007_0F7B98BD613995B0"/>
certainty upon the power of the one, or the duty of the others. The ancients have tranſmitted to us nothing that is applicable to the ſtate of modern colonies, becauſe the relation between theſe is formed by political compact; and the condition of each variant in their original, and from each other. The honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able author has not freed this ſubject from any of its embarraſſments: Vague and diffuſe talk of rights and privileges, and ringing the changes upon the words liberty and ſlavery, only ſerve to convince us, that words may affect without raiſing images, or affording any repoſe to a mind philoſophically inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive. For my own part, I will ſhun the walk of metaphyſicks in my enquiry, and be content to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the colonies rights upon the footing of their charters, which are the only plain avenues, that lead to the truth of this matter.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral <hi>New-England</hi> charters aſcertain, define and limit the reſpective rights and privileges of each colony, and I cannot conceive how it has come to paſs that the colonies now claim any other or greater rights than are therein expreſly granted to them. I fancy when we ſpeak, or think of the rights of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> we confound thoſe rights which are perſonal, with thoſe which are political: There is a diſtinction between theſe, which ought always to be kept in view.</p>
            <p>Our perſonal rights, comprehending thoſe of life, liberty and eſtate, are ſecured to us by the common law, which is every ſubject's birthright, whether born in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> on the ocean, or in the colonies; and it is in this ſenſe we are ſaid to enjoy all the rights and privileges of <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi> The political rights of the colonies, or the powers of government commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010011_0008_0F7B98BDAE6D7B98"/>
to them, are more limited, and their nature, quality and extent depend altogether upon the patent or charter which firſt created and inſtituted them. As individuals, the coloniſts participate of every bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſtitution can give them: As cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations created by the crown, they are confined within the primitive views of their inſtitution. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore their indulgence is ſcanty or liberal, can be no cauſe of complaint; for when they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of their charters, they tacitly ſubmitted to the terms and conditions of them.</p>
            <p>The colonies have no rights independant of their charters, they can claim no greater than thoſe give them, by thoſe the parliamentary juriſdiction over them is not taken away, neither could any grant of the king abridge that juriſdiction, becauſe it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon common law, as I ſhall preſently ſhew, and was prior to any charter or grant to the colonies: Every <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> therefore, is ſubject to this juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and it follows him wherever he goes. It is of the eſſence of government, that there ſhould be a ſupreme head, and it would be a ſoleciſm in politicks to talk of members independant of it.</p>
            <p>With regard to the juriſdiction of parliament, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that it is attached to every <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubject, wherever he be: And I am led to do this from a clauſe in page nine of his honour's pamphlet, where he ſays, <q>That the colonies do not hold their rights, as a privilege granted them, nor enjoy them as a grace and favour beſtowed; but poſſeſs them, as an inherent, indefeaſible right.</q> This poſtulatum cannot be true with regard to poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical rights, for I have already ſhewn, that theſe are derived from your charters, and are held by force of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010011_0009_0F7B98C1587E9D58"/>
the king's grant; therefore theſe inherent, indefeaſible rights, as his honour calls them, muſt be perſonal ones, according to the diſtinction already made. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to ſay, that inherent and indefeaſible as theſe rights may be, the juriſdiction of parliament, over every <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubject, is equally as inherent and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſible: That both have grown out of the ſame ſtock, and that if we avail ourſelves of the one, we muſt ſubmit to, and acknowlege the other.</p>
            <p>It might here be properly enough aſked, Are theſe perſonal rights ſelf-exiſtent? Have they no original ſource? I anſwer, They are derived from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>England,</hi> which is the common law; and from the ſame fountain is alſo derived the juriſdiction of parliament over us.</p>
            <p>But to bring this argument down to the moſt vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar apprehenſion: The common law has eſtabliſhed it as a rule or maxim, that the plantations are bound by <hi>Britiſh</hi> acts of parliament, if particularly named: And ſurely no <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> in his ſenſes, will deny the force of a common law maxim. One cannot but ſmile at the inconſiſtency of theſe inherent, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feaſible men: If one of them has a ſuit at law, in any part of <hi>New-England,</hi> upon a queſtion of land property, or merchandize, he appeals to the common law, to ſupport his claim, or defeat his adverſary; and yet is ſo profoundly ſtupid as to ſay, that an act of parliament does not bind him; when, perhaps, the ſame page in a law book, which points him out a remedy for a libel, or a ſlap in the face, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him that it does.—In a word, The force of an act of parliament, over the colonies, is predicated upon the common law, the origin and baſis of all thoſe inherent rights and privileges which conſtitute the boaſt and felicity of a <hi>Briton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:010011_0010_0F7B98C222AF97C8"/>Can we claim the common law as an inheritance, and at the ſame time be at liberty to adopt one part of it, and reject the other? Indeed we cannot: The common law, pure and indiviſible in its nature and eſſence, cleaves to us during our lives, and follows us from <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> to <hi>Cape Horn.</hi> And therefore, as the juriſdiction of parliament ariſes out of, and is ſupported by it, we may as well renounce our alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, or change our nature, as to be exempt from the juriſdiction of parliament: Hence, it is plain to me, that in denying this juriſdiction, we at the ſame time, take leave of the common law, and thereby, with equal temerity and folly, ſtrip ourſelves of every bleſſing we enjoy as <hi>Engliſhmen:</hi> A flagrant proof this, that ſhallow draughts in politicks and legiſlation confound and diſtract us, and that an extravagant zeal often defeats its own purpoſes.</p>
            <p>I am aware that the foregoing reaſoning will be oppoſed by the maxim, <q>That no <hi>Engliſhman</hi> can be taxed but by his own conſent, or by repreſentatives.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is this dry maxim, taken in a literal ſenſe, and ill underſtood, that, like the ſong of <hi>Lillibullero,</hi> has made all the miſchief in the colonies: And upon this, the partizans of the colonies rights chiefly reſt their cauſe. I don't deſpair, however, of convincing you, that this maxim affords but little ſupport to their argument, when rightly examined and explained.</p>
            <p>It is the opinion of the houſe of commons, and may be conſidered as a law of parliament, that they are the repreſentatives of every <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubject, whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be. In this view of the matter then, the aforegoing maxim is fully vindicated in practice, and the whole benefit of it, in ſubſtance and effect, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and applied to the <hi>colonies.</hi> Indeed the maxim
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010011_0011_0F7B98C28F2ED358"/>
muſt be conſidered in this latitude, for in a literal ſenſe or conſtruction it ever was, and ever will be, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable. Let me aſk, is the iſle of <hi>Man, Jerſey,</hi> or <hi>Guernſey,</hi> repreſented? What is the value or amount of each man's repreſentation in the kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which contains near two millions of people, and yet not more than three thouſand have votes in the election of members of parliament? But to ſhew ſtill further, that, in fact and reality, this right of repreſentation is not of that conſequence it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought to be, let us take into the argument the moneyed intereſt of <hi>Britain,</hi> which, though immenſely great, has no ſhare in this repreſentation; a worthleſs freeholder of forty ſhillings <hi>per annum</hi> can vote for a member of parliament, whereas a merchant, tho' worth one hundred thouſand pounds ſterling, if it conſiſt only in perſonal effects, has no vote at all: But yet let no one ſuppoſe that the intereſt of the latter is not equally the object of parliamentary attention with the former.—Let me add one example more: Copyholders in <hi>England</hi> of one thouſand pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>per annum,</hi> whoſe eſtates in land are nominally, but not intrinſically, inferior to a freehold, cannot, by law, vote for members of parliament; yet we never hear that theſe people <hi>"murmur with ſubmiſſive "fear, and mingled rage:"</hi> They don't ſet up their private humour againſt the conſtitution of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but ſubmit with chearfulneſs to thoſe forms of government which providence, in its goodneſs, has placed them under.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe that this <hi>Utopian</hi> privilege of repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould take place, I queſtion if it would anſwer any other purpoſe but to bring an expence upon the colonies, unleſs you can ſuppoſe that a few <hi>American</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:010011_0012_0F7B98C2F324D988"/>
members could bias the deliberations of the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> legiſlature. In ſhort, this right of repreſentation is but a phantom, and, if poſſeſſed in its full extent, would be of no real advantage to the colonies; they would, like <hi>Ixion,</hi> embrace a cloud in the ſhape of <hi>Juno.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In addition to this head, I could further urge the danger of innovations; every change in a conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in ſome degree, weakens its original frame; and hence it is that legiſlators and ſtateſmen are cautious in admitting them: The goodly building of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution will be beſt ſecured and perpetuated by adhering to its original principles. Parliaments are not of yeſterday, they are as antient as our <hi>Saxon</hi> anceſtors. Attendance in parliament was originally a duty ariſing from a tenure of lands, and grew out of the feudal ſyſtem; ſo that the privilege of ſitting in it, is territorial, and confined to <hi>Britain</hi> only. Why ſhould the beauty and ſymmetry of this body be deſtroyed, and its purity defiled, by the unnatural mixture of repreſentatives from every part of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> dominions. <hi>Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and the dwellers of Meſopotamia, &amp;c.</hi> would not, in ſuch a caſe, ſpeak the ſame language. What a heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous council would this form? what a monſter in government would it be?—In truth, my friend, the matter lies here: The freedom and happineſs of every <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubject depends, not upon his ſhare in electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but upon the ſenſe and virtue of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and theſe depend reciprocally upon the ſenſe and virtue of the whole nation. When virtue and honour are no more, the lovely frame of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution will be diſſolved. <hi>Britain</hi> may one day be what <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> now are; but may heaven long protract the hour!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:010011_0013_0F7B98C3C7BF8928"/>The juriſdiction of parliament being eſtabliſhed, it will follow, that this juriſdiction cannot be apporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; it is tranſcendant and entire, and may levy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal taxes as well as regulate trade; there is no eſſential difference in the rights: A ſtamp duty is confeſſedly the moſt reaſonable and equitable that can be deviſed, yet very far am I from deſiring to ſee it eſtabliſhed among us, but I fear the ſhaft is ſped, and it is now too late to prevent the blow.</p>
            <p>The examples cited by his honour, with regard to ancient colonies, may ſhew his reading and erudition, but are of no authority in the preſent queſtion. I am not enough ſkilled in the <hi>Grecian</hi> hiſtory to correct the proofs drawn from thence, though they amount to very little. If the <hi>Grecian</hi> colonies, as his honour ſays, <q>took ſuch forms of government as themſelves choſe,</q> there is no kind of ſimilitude between them and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> colonies, and therefore to name them is nothing to the purpoſe. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> colonies take their forms of government from the crown; hold their privileges upon condition, that they do not abuſe them; and hold their lands by the tenure of common ſocage, which involves in it fealty and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the king: Hence it is plain, his honour's argument is not ſtrengthened by the example of the <hi>Grecian</hi> colonies; for what likeneſs is there between independant colonies, as thoſe muſt be, which <q>took ſuch forms of government as themſelves choſe,</q> and colonies like ours, which are in a manner feudatory, and holden of a ſuperior.</p>
            <p>With regard to the <hi>Roman</hi> colonies, I muſt beg leave to ſay, that the honourable author, either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly or wilfully, miſtakes the facts: A little more enquiry, or a little more candour, would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010011_0014_0F7B98C4748F3EF8"/>
him, that the <hi>Roman coloniae</hi> did not enjoy all the rights of <hi>Roman</hi> citizens; on the contrary, they only uſed the <hi>Roman</hi> laws and religion, and ſerved in the legions, but had not the right of ſuffrage, or of bearing honours. In theſe reſpects, our <hi>Engliſh</hi> colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies exactly reſemble them; we enjoy the <hi>Engliſh</hi> laws and religion, but have not the right of fuffrage, or of bearing honours in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and indeed our ſituation renders it impoſſible.</p>
            <p>If the practice of the ancients was of any authority in this caſe, I could name examples to juſtify the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving of colonies. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were a free people, yet they, to render the <hi>Sardinians</hi> and <hi>Corſicans</hi> more dependant, forbad their planting, ſowing, or doing any thing of the like kind, under pain of death, ſo that they ſupplied them with neceſſaries from <hi>Africa:</hi> This was indeed very hard. But there is ſomething extremely weak and inconcluſive in recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> hiſtory for examples to illuſtrate any particular favourite opinion: If a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the ancients ſhould direct the practice of the moderns, we might ſell our children to pay our debts, and juſtify it by the practice of the <hi>Athenians.</hi> We might lend our wives to our friends, and juſtify it from the Example of <hi>Cato,</hi> among the <hi>Romans.</hi> In a word, my dear Sir, the belly of a ſow, pickled, was a high diſh in ancient <hi>Rome;</hi> and I imagine, as you advance in the refinements of luxury, this will become a capital part of a <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> feaſt, ſo fond you ſeem of ancient cuſtoms and laws.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of wandring in the labyrinth of ancient co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, I would adviſe his honour to read the debates in parliament in the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and thirty-three, when Mr. <hi>Partridge,</hi> your agent,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010011_0015_0F7B98C54116BF60"/>
petitioned the commons againſt the then ſugar-bill; he will there find more ſatisfaction upon the ſubject of colonies, than in <hi>Thucydides's hiſtory of the Pelopenneſian war.</hi> It was declared in the courſe of that debate, that the coloniſts were a part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> and, as ſuch, fully repreſented in that houſe. The petition then preſented by Mr. <hi>Partridge,</hi> was of a very different temper from thoſe now ſent home by the colonies; it was extremely modeſt, and only intimated that the ſugar bill, if paſſed into a law, might be prejudicial to their charter; at the bare mention of this Sir <hi>William Yonge</hi> took fire, and ſaid, <q>It looked like aiming at an independency, and diſclaiming the juriſdiction of that houſe, as if <hi>(ſays he)</hi> this houſe had not a power to tax the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</q> Mr. Winnington, <hi>with equal warmth, added,</hi> 
               <q>I hope they have no charter which debars this houſe from taxing them, as well as any other ſubject of the nation.</q> Here you have the opinion of two of the moſt eminent members of that time; they ſpoke the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the whole houſe, and theſe ſentiments ſtill continue the ſame. And from hence you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how little proſpect there is of the colonies gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any point upon the footing of theſe new ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious rights; broaching ſuch opinions will excite the jealouſy of the parliament, and you will be looked upon with an evil eye. The promoters of ſuch doctrines are no friends to the colonies, whatever may be their pretenſions. Can his honour be ſo vain as to imagine, that ten thouſand ſuch pamphlets as his, will influence the parliament, or that they will be perſuaded, by the force of his elocution, to give up their ſupremacy, and right of taxing the colonies. What purpoſe then can be ſerved by theſe pamphlets, but to embitter the minds of a ſimple, credulous, and hitherto loyal peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010011_0016_0F7B98C5F08710B0"/>
and to alienate their affections from <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> their beſt friend, their protector, and <hi>alma mater.</hi> A different behaviour would be much more prudent and politick. If we have any thing to aſk, we ſhould remember that diffidence and modeſty will always obtain more from generous minds, than frowardneſs and impertinence.</p>
            <p>The act of the thirteenth of his late majeſty, entitled, <hi>An act for naturalizing of foreign proteſtants,</hi> had better have been omitted by his honour; for if that act is to be the meaſure of the coloniſts rights, they will be more circumſcribed than he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly chuſe. In that act, there is a proviſo, that no perſon, who ſhall become a natural born ſubject by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that act, ſhould be of the privy council, or a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of either houſe of parliament, or capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying, in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> any place of truſt, civil or military, &amp;c. This ſtatute confirms the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction I have ſet up between perſonal and political rights. After naturalization, foreign proteſtants are here admitted ſubjects, to all intents and purpoſes; that is, to the full enjoyment of thoſe rights which are connected with the perſon, liberty or eſtate of <hi>Engliſhmen;</hi> but by the proviſo, they are excluded from bearing offices or honours.</p>
            <p>Enlarging the power of the court of admiralty, is much complain'd of by the honourable author. I ſhall open my mind to you freely on this head.</p>
            <p>It is notorious, that ſmuggling, which an eminent writer calls a crime againſt the law of nature, had well nigh become eſtabliſhed in ſome of the colonies. Acts of parliament had been uniformly diſpenſed with by thoſe whoſe duty it was to execute them; corruption, raiſed upon the ruins of duty and virtue, had almoſt grown into a ſyſtem; courts of admiralty, confined
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010011_0017_0F7B98C6E55DB068"/>
within ſmall territorial juriſdictions, became ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to mercantile influence; and the king's revenue ſhamefully ſacrificed to the venality and perfidiouſneſs of courts and officers.—If, my friend, cuſtoms are due to the crown; if illicit commerce is to be put an end to, as ruinous to the welfare of the nation:— If, by reaſon of the intereſted views of traders, and the connivance of courts and cuſtom-houſe officers, theſe ends could not be compaſſed or obtained in the common and ordinary way; tell me, what could the government do, but to apply a remedy deſperate as the diſeaſe: There is, I own, a ſeverity in the method of proſecution, in the new eſtabliſhed court of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, under Doctor <hi>SPRY,</hi> here; but it is a ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we have brought upon ourſelves. When every mild expedient, to ſtop the atrocious and infamous practice of ſmuggling, has been try'd in vain, the government is juſtifiable in making laws againſt it, even like thoſe of <hi>Draco,</hi> which were written in blood. The new inſtituted court of admiralty, and the power given to the ſeizer, are doubtleſe intended to make us more circumſpect in our trade, and to confine the merchant, from motives of fear and dread, within the limits of a fair commerce. <q>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſtrain the merchant, but it is in favour of commerce,</q> ſays the admired <hi>Secondat.</hi> This is the ſpirit of the new regulations, both with regard to the employing of cutters, and the enlarged power of the admiralty; and both meaſures are juſtifiable upon the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as is the late act for preventing murder, which executes and diſſects the murderer at ſurgeons-hall in twenty-four hours after conviction.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the ſeverity of this act, let me add, that no harm can accrue to the honeſt and fair
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010011_0018_0F7B98C7763DDD40"/>
trader, ſo long as the crown fills the admiralty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment with an upright judge; ſuch a one is Doctor <hi>SPRY,</hi> an able civilian, and whoſe appointments place him above any kind of influence; yet the honourable author of the pamphlet before me, has told us to this effect; That it is very well known this judge <hi>can be prevailed on, very eaſily,</hi> to certify, upon the acquittal of a ſeizure, that there was a probable cauſe for making it.—So ſhamefully intemperate is his honour's zeal and oppoſition to every meaſure adopted by the government at home, that he ſpares not even private characters, however worthy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable. I fear he knows not the high value of a good name, and how dear it is to men of ſentiment and honour.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"He who filches from me my good name,</l>
               <l>"Robs me of that, which not enriches him,</l>
               <l>"But makes me poor indeed."</l>
               <bibl>SHAKESPEAR.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>To ſuſpect the integrity of others, is not the effuſion of a virtuous mind. Thoſe who have been long uſed to traffick with judges and juries, are, from the depravity of their own hearts, eaſily led to believe others even as themſelves.</p>
            <p>This libel upon Doctor <hi>SPRY,</hi> contained in a pamphlet <hi>publiſhed by authority,</hi> may ſpread over the <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions, and, however falſe and ſcandalous it be, yet may leave a ſhade upon his character which can never be effaced. With what grace, let me aſk you, do ſuch reflections as theſe come from the governor of a colony, where, all the world agree, the law has ſcarcely yet dawned, and where all your legal rights are decided by the ſtrength of that faction which happens to be uppermoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:010011_0019_0F7B98C909E56AB0"/>I am not enough ſkilled in trade to know whether the act, ſo much complained of, will do moſt good or moſt harm; and I wiſh others were as diffident of their knowledge in this particular. To compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the general trade of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> nation, much exceeds the capacity of any one man in <hi>America,</hi> how great ſoever he be. Trade is a vaſt, compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ſyſtem, and requires ſuch a depth of genius, and extent of knowledge, to underſtand it, that little minds, attached to their own ſordid intereſt, and long uſed to the greateſt licentiouſneſs in trade, are, and muſt be, very incompetent judges of it. Sir <hi>Andrew Freeport</hi> is no inhabitant of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> colony. For my own part, I am ſtill willing to leave the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of trade with that people, who, according to the ſame admired author juſt quoted, <q>know better than any other people upon earth, how to value at the ſame time theſe three great advantages, religion, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and liberty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here I would juſt obſerve, that, from the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence I have gained, the beloved article of melaſſes is now plentier and cheaper, in all the <hi>New-England</hi> colonies, than when it was avowedly ſmuggled; and ſo far is the linen manufacture of <hi>Ireland</hi> from being ruined, as his honour intimates, that never was a greater demand for flax-ſeed than during the laſt fall, notwithſtanding the clauſe in the act relating to lumber. How ſenſeleſs is it to imagine that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting a few dunnage ſlaves to be carried to <hi>Ireland,</hi> will ruin the manufactures of that kingdom.</p>
            <p>Believe me, my Friend, it gives me great pain to ſee ſo much ingratitude in the colonies to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country, whoſe arms and money ſo lately reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued them from a <hi>French</hi> government. I have been told, that ſome have gone ſo far as to ſay, that they
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010011_0020_0F7B98C9AE5C4D28"/>
would, as things are, prefer ſuch a government to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> one.—Heaven knows I have but little malice in my heart, yet, for a moment, I ardently wiſh that theſe ſpurious, unworthy ſons of <hi>Britain</hi> could feel the iron rod of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> inquiſitor, or a <hi>French</hi> farmer of the revenue; it would indeed be a puniſhment ſuited to their ingratitude. Here I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but call to mind the adder in one of the fables of <hi>Pilpay,</hi> which was preparing to ſting the generous traveller who had juſt reſcued him from the flames.</p>
            <p>You'l eaſily perceive, that what I have ſaid is upon the general deſign of his honour's pamphlet; if he had divided his argument with any preciſion, I would have followed him with ſomewhat more of method; The diſpute between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and the colonies conſiſts of two parts; firſt, the juriſdiction of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,—and, ſecondly, the exerciſe of that juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His honour hath blended theſe together, and no where marked the diviſion between them: The firſt I have principally remarked upon: As to the ſecond, it can only turn upon the expediency or uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of thoſe ſchemes which may, from time to time, be adopted by parliament, relative to the colonies. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this head, I readily grant, they are at full liberty to remonſtrate, petition, write pamphlets and news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers, without number, to prevent any improper or unreaſonable impoſition: Nay, I would have them do all this with that ſpirit of freedom which <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> always have, and I hope ever will, exert; but let us not uſe our liberty for a cloak of maliciouſneſs. Indeed I am very ſure the loyalty of the colonies has ever been irreproachable; but from the pride of ſome, and the ignorance of others, the cry againſt mother country has ſpread from colony to colony;
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010011_0021_0F7B98CD54B95FC8"/>
and it is to be feared, that prejudices and reſentments are kindled among them which it will be difficult ever, thoroughly, to ſooth or extinguiſh. It may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neceſſary for the ſupreme legiſlature of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to frame ſome code, and therein adjuſt the rights of the colonies, with preciſion and certainty, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Great-Britain</hi> will always be teazed with new claims about liberty and privileges.</p>
            <p>I have no ambition in appearing in print, yet if you think what is here thrown together is fit for the publick eye, you are at liberty to publiſh it: I the more chearfully acquieſce in this, becauſe it is with real concern I have obſerved, that, notwithſtanding the frequent abuſe poured forth in pamphlets and news-papers againſt the mother country, not one filial pen in <hi>America</hi> hath, as yet, been drawn, to my knowledge, in her vindication.</p>
