            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is well known that a Cauſe oftentimes ſuffers more from the Unſkilfulneſs of its Advocates, than from the Strength and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of its Enemies. For this Reaſon, it has been a Method with ſome Perſons to diſguize themſelves under fictitious Names, and appear outwardly in Defence of that which, in their Hearts, they are endeavouring to deſtroy. And theſe, by a <hi>deſignedly</hi> weak and injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Management of the Controverſy, have many times with eaſe, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected that which it would have coſt them much Labour and Pains to do by an open and avow'd Oppoſition.</p>
            <p>Upon reading a Pamphlet ſubſcribed <hi>William Hobby,</hi> entitled, <hi>A Defence of the Itinerancy, and the Conduct of the Rev. Mr. Whitefield,</hi> which was the laſt Week ſhov'd into the World, I readily imagin'd it to be a Stratagem of this Kind; and ſhould have thought it tolerably well executed, had I not diſcovered too much <hi>Rancour</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> in ſome Paſſages of it, and too much <hi>Profaneſs</hi> in others.</p>
            <p>In this my Miſtake I ſhould probably have continued, had I not been informed, that there was <hi>really</hi> a Perſon of the Name ſubſcribed to the Pamphlet; that he was Paſtor of a Pariſh in a ſmall Town ſome few Miles from <hi>Boſton,</hi> and that he was far from any <hi>Deſign</hi> to hurt Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Intereſt by the Publication of his Piece, though it might <hi>in reality</hi> have that Effect. Upon this Information, I could not help pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> whoſe Cauſe I now look'd upon as at the laſt Gaſp, ſince it ſtood in Need of ſuch wretched Stuff to keep it alive. But at the ſame Time, <hi>Sir,</hi> I muſt own, I felt ſome Indignation againſt the <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Preſumption</hi> you have diſcovered, by engaging in a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy for which you are ſo little qualify'd, and with the very Grounds
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005563_0003_101869A243C992F0"/>and Foundation of which, your Letter plainly ſhows you are altogether unacquainted.</p>
            <p>GOD, we are told, requires no more of us than we are able to perform. His Expectations from us are in Proportion to the Talents he has given us. So that, it ſeems, <hi>your</hi> Stage of Duty is incloſed in a very ſmall Circle, in which, if you had confined yourſelf, and been content to have remained unknown beyond the Limits of your own Pariſh, you might, like many others, have ſilently paſs'd through the World unnoticed and uncenſured. But alas, the Vanity of ſome Men! who had rather be known to be bad, than not known at all. Since therefore you have broke through your Bounds, and thus openly proclaimed your Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Wickedneſs to the World, it may not be improper, in this public Manner, to tell you of your Faults, and give you ſome gentle Reproof.</p>
            <p>I know very well, the general Opinion of your Performance is, that it rather deſerves the <hi>Chaſtiſement of the Cudgel,</hi> than the <hi>Confutation of the Pen.</hi> But when I conſider that the End of Puniſhment, in this World, ought to be not ſo much to afflict the <hi>Offender,</hi> as to deter others from the <hi>Offence,</hi> I can't but think this Way the moſt likely to have a good Effect, that others may <hi>hear and fear and do no more any ſuch Wickedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would certainly have been not a little for your Credit, ſince it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that you are not yourſelf much ſkill'd in Language, to have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſome Perſon who underſtood <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and was acquainted with the <hi>Rules of Grammar,</hi> to overlook and correct your <hi>Letter</hi> before you offered it to the Public; for I think no Man has a Right to trouble the World with any thing ſo stuff'd with Blunders as this Performance of yours. You tell us in pa. 4. "The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did not, <hi>nor would not</hi> preach."—But do you not know the Force of two Negatives, and that the Meaning of this Expreſſion is directly contrary to what you deſign? So in p. 11. ſpeaking of the <hi>Itinerancy</hi> you ſay, <hi>Mr. Whitefield is peculiarly form'd for ſuch a Deſign.</hi> But how does the <hi>Itinerancy</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a <hi>Deſign?</hi> There may, for ought I know, be a Deſign in it; but that the Thing itſelf is a <hi>Deſign,</hi> we ſhould, perhaps, never have found out, if you had not told us. Again, pa. 24. you ſpeak of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body <hi>having been all the Week o'running Goods,</hi> and afterwards tell us of <hi>three Hogſheads of Sugar</hi> that <hi>weigh heavy with Guilt.</hi> But what the poor Hogſheads had done, that ſuch a heavy Load of Guilt ſhould hang upon <hi>them,</hi> you have not been kind enough to tell us. I have heard of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005563_0004_101869A3FAF6E4F8"/>many Sorts of Sugar, but never heard of <hi>Guilty Sugar</hi> till now. But to repeat all the Inſtances of falſe Grammar and bad <hi>Engliſh,</hi> would be to tranſcribe the whole Book; a Taſk which I am ſure it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to impoſe upon any one who has already undergone the Penance of reading it. Should a <hi>School Boy</hi> commit ſuch Blunders, we know well enough, what his Puniſhment would be. A little <hi>Birch</hi> duly apply'd would bring him to a Senſe of his Faults, and make him more careful for the future. But you, <hi>Sir,</hi> are like to eſcape with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, ſince your <hi>Rev. Breech</hi> is exempt from this Kind of Correction, and it is highly probable you will be inſenſible to any other. I will only add here, that if the Rev. Mr. <hi>M.—d</hi> deſigns ever again to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the World with any of his Labours, <hi>now is his Time,</hi> or <hi>never;</hi> for if he lets this Opportunity eſcape, he can never hereafter hope to meet with another Pamphlet to keep his own in Countenance. I ſhall go on now, and take Notice of <hi>ſome</hi> of your Faults of another Kind.</p>
            <p>You ſet out with endeavouring, in the firſt place, to deſend <hi>Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy.</hi> But it ſeems you have been ſo unlucky here, as <hi>intirely</hi> to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Queſtion in Diſpute. For who has ever affirmed, that <hi>Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> Preaching is <hi>in it ſelf</hi> ſo unlawful, as not to be allow'd <hi>upon any Account at all?</hi> or, that a Miniſter ought <hi>never</hi> to preach out of his own Pulpit? Upon this Suppoſition, however, you beſtir your ſelf moſt notably for about a dozen Pages, to prove what nobody ever yet thought of denying. The greateſt Oppoſers of Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Itinerancy will readily allow, that there <hi>may be</hi> and often <hi>are</hi> Reaſons and particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that will make <hi>Itinerant</hi> Preaching not only lawful but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; and ſhould <hi>he</hi> direct his Zeal where theſe Circumſtances take Place, they would never either condemn or oppoſe his Conduct. Should he <hi>journey to Maryland, Virginia</hi> or <hi>Carolina,</hi> where Preachers are <hi>ſcarce,</hi> and the Inhabitants <hi>ſcatter'd,</hi> or take a Voyage to ſome Parts of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> where Religion is little known and leſs practiſed, he might not only <hi>eſcape Cenſures</hi> but <hi>deſerved Applauſe.</hi> By this he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the <hi>Gain-ſayers,</hi> that his Deſign was the ſame with his Profeſſion, the Glory of his Maſter, and the Good of his Neighbour, without any worldly Conſiderations of his own. So that it is not Itinerancy <hi>barely as ſuch,</hi> that is condemned, but Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s <hi>Itinerancy:</hi> And unleſs <hi>this</hi> can be defended, you do nothing; for you have as yet only beat the Air, and ſweated hard to defeat a Phantom of your own raiſing.</p>
            <p>You go on <hi>to enquire whether the Itinerancy,</hi> by which I ſuppoſe you mean Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s, <hi>may not probably ſubſerve ſome good and valuable
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005563_0005_101869A5E92C4C68"/>Ends?</hi> And if ſo, you aſk, <hi>why it ſhould not be countenanced?</hi> I anſwer, becauſe it <hi>certainly</hi> diſſerves <hi>more</hi> and <hi>better</hi> and <hi>more valuable</hi> Ends. Of this there are as many Witneſſes as there are mournful Spectators of the Diſſentions and Diſorders that have torn ſo many Towns, Churches, and even private Families in pieces. We have ſeen <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> treading upon the Neck of <hi>Charity,</hi> and every Man's <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Tongue</hi> ſet againſt his Brother. We have ſeen <hi>Religion's lovely Form</hi> metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſed into the <hi>moſt ugly Monſter, Religious Aſſemblies</hi> turn'd into <hi>frantic Tumults,</hi> and the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs</hi> into the <hi>Confuſion of Bedlam.</hi> And are theſe no Evils? Or are they Evils ſo <hi>light</hi> as to be overbalanced by the throwing a few ſilly Girls into <hi>Hyſterics?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſometime after ſay, you <q>really believe, that the Goſpel is as faithfully preached in <hi>New England,</hi> as in any part of the World, in the Generality of our Churches.</q> What Value the Clergy may ſet upon this Teſtimony, I know not; but for my own Part, conſidering from whence it comes, I cannot look upon it as any great Complement, You add, <q>tho' God knows it is preached but poorly enough in many of them.</q> I am apt to think that the People of <hi>Reading</hi> know this too; otherwiſe they would not have diſcovered ſo great a Readineſs to part with their Paſtor, as they did <hi>on a late Occaſion.</hi> A little on ward you come to lament, that <q>proper Watchſulneſs over the Pulpits of <hi>New-England</hi> has been greatly decaying—In Conſequence of which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſneſs many have admitted into the Miniſtry, of inferior Knowledge,</q>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This, I am of Opinion, is not Matter of ſo great Lamentation to you, as to many others, ſince you have been ſo great a Gainer by <hi>the Conſequence.</hi> For had this Watchfulneſs over the Pulpits of <hi>New England</hi> been kept up, and none <hi>admitted into the Miniſtry of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Knowledge, looſe Principles or of poor Lives,</hi> you might, beyond all doubt, have engaged in the preſent Expedition, provided you had eſcaped the laſt, without the <hi>Formality of applying for the Conſent of a Pariſh.</hi> You purſue this Subject, and add, <q>or rather ſhall I ſay, that ſome have been admitted into Chriſt's Pulpits, who perhaps were not fit to be received into his Church? Inſtances of this Nature might eaſily be produced in too great Plenty, and I need not go far for ſome of them neither.</q> Here indeed you have ſpoken the Truth; for if we may judge of the Tree by its Fruit, every Page of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is an ample Proof that you were furniſhed with ONE Inſtance of this, without ſtirring a Step for it.</p>
            <p>But it ſeems, the Expediency and Lawfulneſs of the <hi>Itinerancy</hi> further
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005563_0006_101869A8935E2528"/>appears from this, <hi>that ſome of the greateſt Oppoſers of it have themſelve been benefitted by it.</hi> And it it ſuch a ſtrange Thing that good Men ſhould be benefitted by the Faults and Miſcarriages which they obſerve in the World? They may and will reap Advantage to themſelves from the Wickedneſs of others. This puts them upon lamenting the Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Weakneſs of Human Nature, and excites in them a greater Vigilance over their own Conduct. It ſhows them the Need they have of divine Reſtraints, and raiſes up their Soul in Gratitude to that God <hi>who maketh them to differ.</hi> Every Inſtance of Perjury or Murder that comes within their Notice, works theſe good Diſpoſitions in them; but who, for this Reaſon, ever argued that Perjury and Murder were either <hi>expedient</hi> or <hi>lawful?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You go on to tell us another good Effect of the <hi>Itinerancy,</hi> that <q>Things that were <hi>weak</hi> in many Places have been <hi>ſtrengthened,</hi> and thoſe which were <hi>ready to die</hi> are in a Meaſure <hi>revived.</hi>
               </q> This alas! is a melancholy Truth. The Fueds and Contentions that had ſo long reigned among us were ſubſiding, and Brethren began to look kindly one upon another. That cenſorious, uncharitable Spirit which had raged with ſo much Fury was ſickning apace, and would, in all Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, before now have given up the Ghoſt, had not this ſecond Itinera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>revived</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthned</hi> it. For, whether you <hi>know</hi> it or not, every Man who views things with an unprejudiced Eye, and is able to trace <hi>Effects</hi> up to their <hi>Cauſes,</hi> will eaſily diſcover <q>that theſe things neceſſarily, in the Nature of Things, flow from the <hi>Itinerancy,</hi> and that this is properly <hi>cauſal</hi> of them.</q> You however are bold enough to ſay, <q>whatever be the Judgment of others, I ſhall EVER give it as <hi>mine,</hi> that 'tis not the <hi>Itinerancy</hi> but the <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to it, that has made the Confuſions of the preſent Day.</q> Well determin'd for a youngſter, truly! But how do you know that this will <hi>always</hi> be your Judgment? Wiſer and better Men have changed their Opinions, as to <hi>this very Matter;</hi> and may it not be poſſible for you to do ſo too? Is your impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable Scull Proof againſt the Force of the ſtrongeſt Arguments? Or does the <hi>triple Braſs round your Heart</hi> make it impoſſible for Conviction to enter? But if ſo, have you ever learned, with all your Divinity, that <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> and <hi>a ſeared Conſcience</hi> are <hi>chriſtian Graces?</hi> Why then do you make this public Boaſt? Why do you thus glory in your Shame?</p>
            <p>A little onward you adviſe us to <hi>a Conduct with Regard to Itincrants,</hi> which is indeed highly reaſonable. "Thy, ſay you, the <hi>Spirits</hi> by the Word of God."—Agreed—This is the very Teſt to which the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005563_0007_101869AAF7E3DC80"/>Oppoſers would bring them; and by the Deciſions of this they are willing to ſtand or fall. You add, "and the everlaſting Reaſon of Things." How theſe Words came into your Mouth, I cannot imagine. Why do you thus <hi>toſs upon your Tongue Terms</hi> of which you have no Underſtanding? For knoweſt thou not, O vain young Man, that if the <hi>everlaſting Reaſon of Things</hi> is once appeal'd to, thy Cauſe muſt vaniſh in a moment, like a thin Vapour before the Noon-day Sun?</p>
            <p>I cannot forbear taking Notice, how manfully you beat down an Objection raiſed againſt Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> that he has appropriated Money which he has collected, to other Uſes than thoſe for which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. This you tell us cannot be, becauſe he has not bought either Houſes or Lands; and run on with this Argument with wonderful Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubility for about half a Page. But here you really ſeem, if poſſible, to ſink <hi>even beneath yourſelf.</hi> For it is no more than ſaying, Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> can't be ſuppos'd to have embezzled any Money, becauſe he has not been weak enough <hi>himſelf</hi> to prove to all the World that he has done ſo. For my own Part, I never thought there was ſufficient Ground for this Objection againſt Mr. <hi>Whitefield;</hi> but if this is all that can be ſaid in his Defence, I may, perhaps, change my Opinion for the future, ſince to me it looks more like <hi>owning</hi> the Charge, than <hi>vindicating</hi> him from it.</p>
            <p>Another Objection againſt Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> which you have thought fit to encounter, is the injurious Reflections he has thrown upon the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.</hi> And here having given your Opinion of the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> which the Heads of that Society have publiſhed againſt him and his Conduct, you add, <q>I cannot find that <hi>Circumciſion availeth</hi> much, <hi>or Uncircumciſion,</hi>  to the Proof of the Charges alledged againſt Mr. <hi>Whitefield;</hi>
               </q> by which you have diſcovered no great Regard for that Goſpel you profeſs to preach; otherwiſe you would never have ſacrificed it to ſuch a <hi>pitiful low Pun,</hi> and proved to the World, that you are equally deſtitute of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Wit.</hi> You go on, however, and <q>declare, that Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>'s Expreſſion has been ever diſagreeable to you, as it tended to diſcourage the Growth of the College;</q> and yet preſently after give us to underſtand, that it might be <q>a Piece of <hi>Service</hi> beneficial to the College.</q> But how that which tends to diſcourage the Growth of the College, can be ſaid to be <hi>beneficial</hi> to it, I confeſs I am not able to comprehend. In like Manner you ſay, <q>that unleſs real and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial <hi>Godlineſs</hi> was better underſtood and practiced within a few Years after I left the <hi>College,</hi> than when I was there, the <hi>College</hi> in general
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005563_0008_101869ACF4DFC440"/>might juſtly be ſaid to be in <hi>Darkneſs.</hi>—We dwelt much upon the <hi>Shell</hi> of Religion, but little regarded <hi>the Pearl of great Price.</hi>—All this is to be underſtood of the Society in general.</q>—And preſently after, "Religion was at a <hi>low Ebb</hi> among the Students <hi>in general.</hi>" And was this ſame College <hi>at this Time</hi> one of the Glories of the Land? You had juſt before declared, that it <hi>ever was,</hi> and you hoped ever would be ſo. "However, cry you, I am no Judge in this Matter," and then very modeſtly proceed to give Judgment, and pronounce Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> "greatly excuſable, if not intirely juſtiſiable." Really, <hi>Sir,</hi> here is a Cluſter of Inconſiſtencies, which it will require the utmoſt Skill of ſome new <hi>Apologiſt</hi> to reconcile.</p>
            <p>In order to prove the Truth of the Charge Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> has brought againſt the College, you ſay, <q>
                  <hi>for my own part,</hi> had I no more Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>after</hi> I left the <hi>College</hi> than I had <hi>there,</hi> I might have <hi>ſold my Right</hi> to Heaven <hi>for a Meſs of Pottage,</hi> and been a Gainer by the Bargain.</q> I am very ſorry we have ſo much Reaſon to judge, from the Spirit and Temper of your Pamphlet, that you might make the ſame Bargain <hi>now,</hi> and be no Loſer by it. But, becauſe you was a <hi>graceleſs wicked Wretch</hi> when you was at College, does it therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the generality of the Students muſt be ſo too? If this be juſt Reaſoning, you have it <hi>equally</hi> in your Power to prove, that the College was likewife overwhelm'd with <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Stupidity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Argument you bring to prove the <hi>dark State</hi> of the College, is, that "one <hi>Tutor</hi> and one <hi>Profeſſor</hi> were diſcarded for <hi>Immoralities.</hi>" Here you have unluckily blabb'd out a Truth againſt yourſelf, which in a great Meaſure overthrows all you have ſaid upon this Subject. Had the College encouraged theſe Perſons in their <hi>Immoralities,</hi> and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hug them in her Boſom, this indeed would have been a ſad Symptom of her Degeneracy. But the caſting them out from her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Account, ſurely is a ſtrong Proof, that Diſcipline was not at ſuch a very <hi>low Ebb,</hi> nor the College immerſed in ſuch <hi>thick Darkneſs</hi> as you would have us believe. To theſe two Inſtances, which you have brought, in Favour of the College, however you deſigned them to the contrary, I will add a Third. That when a <hi>young Man</hi> made Application for the Place of a Tutor, which was then vacant, and was ſupported by the Recommendation of no lefs a Perſon than a Governour, the College re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him with Diſdain, well knowing that his <hi>inferior Knowledge, looſe Principles, and to ſay no worſe, poor Life,</hi> render'd him altogether unfit for ſuch a Station. This Inſtance ſurely you have not forgot. I rather
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005563_0009_101869AF1A0CCED8"/>think it was <hi>freſh</hi> in your Mind while you was writing, and that it was the Remembrance of it that puſh'd you on to your irreverent and ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Behaviour towards the College. You go on and ſay, <q>another <hi>Tutor</hi> declares himſelf a Stranger <hi>at that Time</hi> to any true vital Piety.</q> Here, tho' you do not mention his Name, it is well known who you mean. And much Good may <hi>his</hi> Teſtimony do you. He once <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,</hi> and now again has run into ſuch wild Freaks and Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> himſelf dare not countenance him.</p>
            <p>But endeavour, if you can, <hi>impartially</hi> to recollect the State of the College while you was there; and then, if <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> will ſuit a Conſtitution like your's, be covered with <hi>Confuſion</hi> for, what you have wrote. The Gentleman at the Head of the Society, when you entered, was a <hi>ſtanch Calviniſt</hi> in Principle, of ſtrict Morals, and exerciſed the <hi>ſevereſt</hi> Diſcipline. His <hi>Succeſſor</hi> was renowned thro' the whole Land for his Piety; his Name is, upon that Account, mention'd among us with the utmoſt Honour, and his Memory will live for ever. The <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> and <hi>Profeſſors</hi> were, while you belonged to the Society, of virtuous Lives and Converſations, and of unblemiſh'd Characters; and all of them, except the two <hi>diſcarded</hi> by the College, do at this Day make a diſtinguiſh'd Figure in <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State.</hi> Morning and Evening Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers wee <hi>conſtantly</hi> kept up; the holy Scriptures read, and a ſtrict At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance required. None were allow'd to abſent themſelves from the public Worſhip on Lord's Days, without ſome neceſſary Hindrance. Vice and Immorality of all Kinds were forbidden upon the <hi>ſevereſt</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, and when detected, were <hi>ſure</hi> to be puniſhed. And now, what Sign of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> in all this? Why, ſay you, <q>we dwelt much upon the <hi>Shell</hi> of Religion, but little regarded <hi>the Pearl of great Price.</hi>
               </q> That is, in other Words, the Students did not, as the Faſhion is among ſome ſort of People at this Day, tell one another how often they ſaid their Prayers, and how good they felt themſelves. What Pity is it, that a Practice, ſo ſuited to gratify a vain Temper, was not then in Vogue? If it had been, I doubt not we ſhould have had a much <hi>earlier</hi> Date to <hi>your</hi> Converſion.</p>
            <p>I ſay nothing of the <hi>preſent</hi> State of the College, becauſe you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined your Reflections to your own Time, and the Gentlemen now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Government there, have their Characters too well eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fear any Injury from ſuch Pens as yours.</p>
            <p>If an Attempt upon the Life of a Parent, could once untie the Tongue of a dumb Son, it may perhaps ſeem ſtrange to ſome, that the <hi>Sons</hi> of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005563_0010_101869B1FB5E68F8"/>the College ſhould all ſit ſo long ſilent, when they ſee ſuch vile Aſſaſſins ſtabbing at the Reputation of their <hi>venerable Mother.</hi> But when we conſider the Obſcurity of theſe Perſons, for Mr. <hi>Whilefield,</hi> it la allow'd, had his Information from ſome <hi>ſecret</hi> Whiſperers, I ſay, if we conſider their <hi>Obſcurity,</hi> and the <hi>Feebleneſs</hi> of their Attack, it will really be doing them too much Honour to take the Alarm. Would a Man draw a Sword againſt a Louſe, or think it neceſſary to diſcharge a Cannon to kill a Fly? Whenever any ſhall appear againſt her, whoſe Character may ſeem to give Credit to their Cauſe, it will ſoon be found, that among her Sons there are wanting neither <hi>Tongues</hi> nor <hi>Pens</hi> ſufficient for her Defence. She will and <hi>muſt</hi> flouriſh as long as Religion, Vertue and Learning have Charms to attract our Eſteem. Supporting theſe, and ſupported by them, ſhe may ſit ſafe and unconcerned amidſt all the <hi>leaden</hi> then, ye <hi>ſpightful Curs,</hi> do ye <hi>look up</hi> and <hi>bark</hi> and <hi>howl,</hi> the Object of your Malice is placed <hi>high</hi> above your Reach, nor <hi>ſhines</hi> the leſs bright for all your <hi>Yellings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Head you paſs to conſider another Article againſt Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> which is, his having repreſented the <hi>Generality</hi> of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of this Land as <hi>unconverted Men.</hi> Upon this you ſay, <q>Has Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> and where pronounced this the <hi>real State</hi> of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry? No, but has only ſaid, that he <hi>fears</hi> it, as (if I miſtake not) the Expreſſion is.</q> But you <hi>do</hi> miſtake, young Man; for the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not, that he <hi>fears</hi> it, but that he is VERILY PERSUADED of it; which, however you underſtand it, I take to be a pretty round Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that all you have ſaid here, to excuſe him as tho' he had only <hi>juſt hinted</hi> his Fears, being built upon a falſe Suppoſition, muſt of it ſelf fall to the Ground. You go, on, <q>But if Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> has <hi>inſinuated</hi> any thing as if many Miniſters were <hi>unconverted,</hi> what need they by the Umbrage taken at the Inſinuation, pave the Way to the Proof of it?</q> A moſt extravagant Piece of Arrogance this! Here we have a new Standard ſet up, whereby we may judge of our own State, and that of others. But ſhall the taking Umbrage at the moſt exceptionable Step in Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Conduct, a Step which very few of his <hi>warmeſt</hi> Advocates would pretend to juſtify, and which <hi>he himſelf</hi> has condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as raſh and unwarrantable, I ſay, ſhall the <hi>bare taking Umbrage</hi> at ſuch a Step be ſufficient to <hi>prove</hi> a Man's Unconverſion? Alas, poor deluded young Man! if the <hi>not taking Umbrage</hi> at this Behaviour of Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> be all the Evidence you have of your own Converſion,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005563_0011_101869B706C283B8"/>and I greatly fear you have no other, you are in a very miſerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition indeed.</p>
            <p>You come now to tell us in your 24th. pa. about <hi>o' running Goods,</hi> and <hi>three Hogſheads of Sugar weighing heavy with Guilt.</hi> This, as I have already obſerved, being rank <hi>Nonſenſe,</hi> may be neither <hi>true</hi> nor <hi>falſe.</hi> But the baſe Inſinuation that you would couch under it, and the Temper and Spirit viſible in it, evidently diſcover that it proceeded from a Heart ſwoln with Malice. What is now become of your <hi>Paſſage of Scripture</hi> that could <hi>give ſuch a fatal Blow, or rather blaſt like a Flaſh of Lightning?</hi> Has it ſo ſuddenly loſt all its Force? Or, have you not ſince you wrote your Pamphlet, ever once look'd into your Bible?</p>
            <p>You go on and inform us, that you <q>have ſaid nothing about the <hi>Inconſiſtency</hi> of Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Conduct with his Obligations as a Miniſter of the <hi>Church of England.</hi>
               </q> And, it ſeems, the Reaſon of it is, becauſe <q>this Objection is cruſh'd to Death by the late Apology for Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> againſt the Exceptions of <hi>L. K.</hi>
               </q> But alas! un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily for you, this Apology has been long ſince confuted, and ſo <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally</hi> exploded, that he <hi>fecret Contrivers</hi> of it, to ſave their ſinking Reputation, have been obliged to diſown it. But it ſeems you have been ſo buſy in writing your Letter, and ſo wrapt up in the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Applauſe it would heap upon you, that you knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this. The <hi>Maul,</hi> heavy as it is, has not been able, in the leaſt, to blunt the Edge of the <hi>Razor;</hi> no, this remains keen and bright as ever, and is like to do ſo, while <hi>the other,</hi> with us owr Weight, is ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a-pace into the Earth.</p>
            <p>You are willing, however, after all, <q>to allow Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> has his Foibles and Imperfections, and that he is <hi>a Man of like Paſſions with others.</hi>
               </q> Wonderful Condeſcention indeed! You go on and ſay, <q>I would do by him as God himſelf doth by ſinful Man, damn the Sin and glorify the Sinner.</q> Alas, to what a Height of Impiety are you arrived! The Parallel has often been run beteen our Saviour and Mr. <hi>Whitefield:</hi> You yourſelf have done it ſeveral Times in your Letter; and it is now become ſo familiar to us, that our Ears ſeem to be no longer ſhock'd at it. But here you riſe a Step higher. And do you know, poor young Man, the Meaning of theſe Expreſſions you ſo wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly throw out? Surely if you did, you would never talk thus of <hi>your damning</hi> the Sin, and <hi>GLORIYYING</hi> the Sinner. In ſhort, nothing but the moſt profound Ignorance can acquit you from the Guilt of the higheſt Prophaneneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005563_0012_101869B8EE04AB90"/>
There is one Thing more I will juſt take Notice of, as a Proof of your exquiſite Faculty of Diſcernment. Speaking of Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Deſign of bringing over a Number of Miniſters from <hi>Scotland</hi> and other Places to ſettle among us, and having told us there can be no Harm in this, you go on to aſk, "Are there not two Pulpits at <hi>Boſton</hi> ſupply'd and adorned with the Produce of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland?</hi>" Had theſe two Pulpits been thus coupled together by any Body elſe, we ſhould immediately have known it was done with a Deſign that they ſhould ſet off each other by way of <hi>Contraſt:</hi> But as it comes from <hi>you,</hi> it muſt be looked upon as a ſtrange confounding of Characters, a motly Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> and you might as well have jumbled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Ornaments of the Mathematics, Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> and <hi>Whittemore the Almanack maker.</hi> And is the Rev. Mr. <hi>M.—d</hi> ſuch an Ornament to the Pulpit? This, among many others, is one Inſtance of the Solidity of your Judgement, which may hereafter be remember'd to your Honour. It is no unuſual Thing for Perſons, from their general Character, or ſome particular Circumſtance of their Lives, to have prefix'd to their Names ſome honourable Epither, without which they are ſeldom or never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. Thus we ſay, the <hi>wiſe Solomon,</hi> the <hi>venerable Bede,</hi> the <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable Newton;</hi> and who knows but that future Ages may add you to the illuſtrious Roll by the Name of the JUDICIOUS HOBBY?</p>
            <p>But it would be <hi>endleſs</hi> as well as <hi>needleſs</hi> to enumerate all the Faults of your Letter. I have ſpent too much Time with you already, and ſhall therefore only add, that if you are wiſe enough, from this gentle Rebuke, to ſhrink back again into that Obſcurity, for which <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> ſeem to have deſigned you, it is probable you may eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape any further Correction for your paſt Folly; as the <hi>Snail</hi> (for I would not be too unequal in my Compariſon) from the lighteſt Touch, retires into its Shell, and lies there ſafe and unſeen. But if you are ever hereafter caught out of your Line, or ſhall again preſume to trouble the World with your <hi>Malice, Profaneneſs</hi> and <hi>Nonſence,</hi> know, <hi>young Man,</hi> that there are thoſe, who want neither <hi>Inclination</hi> nor <hi>Power</hi> to chaſtiſe you with the utmoſt Severity your Offences ſhall deſerve.</p>
