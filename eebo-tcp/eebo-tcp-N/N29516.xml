            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But to the Certificates my intent is to speak, &amp; chiefly to that sent from a Monthly Meeting at <hi>Burlington</hi> the 6t. 6 m. 1694. which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends most of the rest, I shall first show how it was obtained (as I had it as well from some that signed it, as from others which refused to sign it) and <hi>next,</hi> I shall sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>When News came from <hi>England</hi> that <hi>S.

And having framed a Certificate, it was read in the Meeting, and some readily signed it, but some others, (more willing to see with their own Eyes) made some scruple; and one or two, it seems, questioned the truth of what was written about <hi>D.

               </abbr> to write it over again, and for one man to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Devonport</hi> hasted with it next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the River, to send it for <hi>England,</hi> where being printed, and returned hither again, is now come under consideration; which before they endeavoured to prevent me and others of: For, I having an account, as aforesaid, went to their next Monthly Meeting for a Copy of the Judgment they had drawn up against me, and sent to <hi>England,</hi> wherein (I told them) I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood I was defamed. They answered, <hi>They had not defamed me, nor wrote any untruth of me.</hi> To which I replyed, <hi>If you have not wronged me, I hope you will be the more willing to do me justice, in granting me a Copy; I'll pay for the writing of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> &amp;c. These and many more words passed, but at last the result was [having none of their Ministers there] <hi>That I could have no answer till next Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:039315_0005_10141D3EE9D8A580"/>
I went again next Meeting, but no Copy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could I obtain, &amp; <hi>J. Wilsford</hi> gave me an answer in these words, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> G.

            <p>But the Certificate being printed in <hi>England,</hi> as aforesaid, and returned to <hi>America</hi> having missed the hands of <hi>S.

to <hi>S.

            <p>And whereas <hi>S. J.</hi> tells <hi>Elias Far,</hi> in his Letter printed with the Certificates, <hi>That all the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

J.</hi> for there was no more Meadow in that place, but what was surveyed and recorded to <hi>Matthews</hi> seven years before, which Meadow terminated in a small run of water at the lower and, where grew some Bushes, and there's a markt Tree or two still to be seen, only the Bushes being burnt root and branch, it shews like Meadow further; but the number of Acres would have determined the matter, which was to be 25. our Law allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so much to 500 Acres of Land. And this was all that was wanting in the wording the survey, which if that had been, (which it seems was by some means omitted) the survey had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And therefore if it be printed over never so often, <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi>

            <p>In the <hi>Burlington</hi> Certificate they tell of a Warrant they have by them, insinuating as if <hi>J. Skeen</hi> took a course at Law with <hi>S.

to say, their <hi>differences</hi> were quickly ended, is but daubing; for I know that at the next Monthly Meeting after J. S'<hi>s</hi> Death some of S.

            <p>And whereas they tell of <hi>Henry Beck</hi> and and <hi>J.

               </abbr> That on a time when <hi>S Jenings</hi> was going to <hi>England,</hi> the said B.

            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> I find among the Certificates, That <hi>Benj. More,</hi> jun. charges <hi>Joh. Silver</hi> and <hi>J. Smith</hi> of stealing Oats, Powder, Shot, Wool, Eggs, and the like; but I leave them to answer for themselves, that are defamed, by it; for I judge it a <hi>Defamation,</hi> if true, because 'tis divulged many years out of time; and tho' it be like the bundles of stuff in the rest of the Certificates, yet <hi>I</hi> should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> is there any such person in these parts, therefore forgery in S. J. to make two where there's but one.</p>
            <p>Then again, whereas G. K. had occasionally related how S. J. in a Monthly Meeting called one of his fellew Members <hi>Non-sensical Puppy,</hi> to wipe off this, he says, p. 41. when he met with it in print, he made e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>T. Tress,</hi> but <hi>R. Ward</hi> also, that did then, and do now evidence to the truth thereof.

But now they are come to hand another way, &amp; his Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine way of spreading them is to no purpose.

            <p>There is one passage more which I cannot well pass by without detecting the notorious Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood thereof, and that is in pag. 24. of <hi>S. J.</hi>'s Book, where he insinuates, That G. K. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
