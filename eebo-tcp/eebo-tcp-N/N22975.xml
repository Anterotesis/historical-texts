            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS 10 of the month I went to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours iſeland to bring up bruſh for to kiver my <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to ſpread fiſh on to dry, it being the Sabbath day, contrary to law or goſpell, in a littell ſchooner who was loded with codfiiſh But when we got down on the beech ſomebody called out Indian! whome appeared with their muſgets loaded and primed to our great ſurpriſe: for my own part I James Derkinderen run into the ſea, the ſalt water as I opened my mouth went into my belly, calling to my Maker to have mercy on me: whome methinks heares the cryes of the poor and diſtreſſed now, as in old times, and will not leave us or forſake when we humble cry to him, who has all power both in heaven and earth. Thoſe ſavages or Indiens pointing their muſkets at us, and commanded us to cum into the wood, 2 of them fired at us. and Chriſtoper Dyer of Caſco bay was ſhott and an other man, with buck ſhott, many in them, and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very faſt: thoſe Indians came to them and ſtruck the little ax in there heads, and ſculped them before my eyes; O dredfull to

behold! as for the boy he run a way, but one Joſeph ketched him and brought him back, and then ſtripped thoſe dying men: preſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I heard the other Indiens fire, and brought the other ſculps to us, and their cloaths, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them on the ground, whome I had to beg for quarters as I had of the others; now thos thre and the other two made 5 ſculps a bloody conqueſt endeed. Loaded their muſquets and ſo ſat of I knuw not whither, as it appered for their wigwoms; their 2 cunnoas being halled up into the woods—3 in one, and my ſelf and the boy in the other, thoſe ſculps in the bottom of the connoa to ſitt on, a bloody carpett indeed, both ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and fritefull—a time of mourning. Presently we landed on an iſeland, kitched ſome birds egs but no appetite to eate—they gave me and the boy ſome—Lying on our bellyes and mourning much, and weeping bitterly; about an hour after we went on the ſea, padling along untill we came to a run of water, waided and got over. We herd there was ſome Inglish connoes therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts—our lndens loaded their guns, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me if they ſaw thoſe connoas they would kill me, but we ſeed them not—Sometime they cought ſome trowts, they gave me ſome, a little left for our ſupport more than they could eate. Parting the trees and bruſhes to get thru, and ſo 4 days before we gott to their wigwoms. Setting up a ſtrong current
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:030336_0005_0FE5C424CDCD8608"/>
then they fireed of their guns, ſot up a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loing to let their people know off the blody conqueſt. Their wigwoms appeared and a number of Indians on a point of land. They took me to the Indians wigwam my maſter, and the boy to an other, about 2 days after they ſold the boys unto the French; ſo left alone they herd there was an Englis frigate there in the gut of Cancer, but was not. As for my ſelf I was obliged to ſcrap their ſcins—being conſtantly employed. And in a guſt obliged with my burch hatt to ſtand under the trees, and very wett untill I gott a little furder, where we made a fier and ſo got ſome ſleep. We came to a little town of Indians, who ſot me down dancing and ſinging againſt the ſun expecting to or not knowing how ſoone the little ax would com upon my head. But bleſſed be the Lord that can deliver by a ſmall thing as well as a big: a ſmall ſhower coming on they went into their wigwoms; but it ſeemed to me the buchers were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by an inviſable power, and did not ſculp me: bleſſed be my mercifull preſerver. So thoſe Indians came about 20 in number and toock me away by fors, but the old In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians would have me ſculped, as ſone as I got over I kiſſed the old Indians hand to ſhow my thankfullnes: but it was the kind preſervor that ſhowed mercy on me, thanks and praiſes be to his holy name. We got to there wigwams about 20 in number 
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030336_0006_0FE5C42595B2CB58"/>
and full of Indiens, I was takeen to mr. Joſephs and their boy unto cap. John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſto. I muſt remark the way of keching ſalmon, an Indian and ſqua would go with theire connow and a flamboy to give light in the water and ſtrike their ſpeer in the ſalmon and ketch 20 or 30 ſalmon, and ſo divide them amongſt their familyes &amp;c. When don and koocked them hollowing and rejoycing much I ſuppose by the way of thankſgiving. O dear friend many that is rich forgets the poor, fairing ſumptuoſly every day, what will become of thoſe rich? A woman &amp;c. came padling a long ſhore, I walked up to them and talking to her in Ingliſh, my Indien miſtreſs came behind me and box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ears ſevarely. O the juſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my God, juſt and equall in all his diſpenſations towards us. Two of the Indiens went to make a bargain for us—we went on board to fit out the ſchooner. When we were at their town the Indiens adviſed me to rite to St. Johns which I did, commanded by Adlam, a coppy of a letter ſorrowing for me much, and adviſed the French to take me to cape Britton, which they did and ſo gott clear for the bargain the French with the Indians was about £10 ſterling, but the French demanded £35 for me and the boy, which ſum Adlam would not pay them and ſo came home—his adviſe to carry us to cape Brittoon and then the governor would 
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030336_0007_0FE5C42AA4F30F88"/>
pay for us, in the gut of Cancer the Indians had killed one man and like to have taken a ſloop, thoſe Indians lay as a decay in the gutt of Cancer but got clear with the ſloop into cape Britton giveing them 6 months proviſions to bring in thoſe Indians and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb peaſable. Dearly beloved take notes and ſee how that Almighty can work for the deliverance of his poor cretures man rather than deliver him to everlaſting deſtrucktion O thou beloved of my ſoul praiſe ye the Lord and all that is within prays ye the Lord—O my ſoule praiſe the Lord for his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever amen.</p>
            <p>Telling me to go over to our Indiens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the water and ſo I kiſſed the captains hand as if he reſqued me, the old Indien women thurſted I veryly believe for my blod preſently the connows went into the ſea and ſo thru the gutt leaving the high bluff of lands untill we got into a beech where we got over, keched lobſters and flat fiſh and crabs ſo got proviſions; fireed of their guns and prepeared them if they ſhould ſee any of the Ingliſh counoes, but no appearance of them, which I was very thankfull off; got to the Indians and then appeared on the land or on the point of land, a number of them meakeing me fetch water and lay down the braſs kittle on my—by me while at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plycating for mercy O my dr. friend the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the diſtreſs I was in both in boddy
