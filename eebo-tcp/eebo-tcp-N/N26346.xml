         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ON my firſt ſetting out in life, I poſſeſſed no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable ſhare of what I ſuppoſe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all at the ſame age,—a high opinion of my own abilities. The world was new to me; I knew nothing of the difficulties I had to encounter in it, nor imagined there was to be found in it all a wiſer lad than myſelf. But time, and intercourſe with my own ſpecies, have totally reverſed my opinion; and taught me, that it requires a very large ſhare of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035035_0007_0FFFF4EDDE1EE830"/>
to ſteer through the tempeſtuous ocean of life with any tolerable degree of ſafety; and no inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree of fortitude, to encounter the various evils to which human life is expoſed. Of theſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions the following ſimple narrative will fully demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the truth.</p>
               <p>I was born in <hi>Ayreſhire,</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> of reſpectable parents in their ſtation, which was of the middle rank in ſociety. Having acquired an education ſuitable to my years and expectations, I was given up by my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a neighbouring ſurgeon, who had taken a fancy to have me, at eleven years of age. My worthy maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and all his family, gave me every indulgence my tender years required. Rigidly virtuous, and regular in his morals, my maſter took every opportunity of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning my young mind with the beſt advice, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing me in every religious and moral obligation. Both he and my good old miſtreſs, often expreſſed their delight at ſeeing the attention and reſpect I paid to their injunctions; and in order to preſerve me from the contagion of vice, and keep me under their own eye, they conſtantly took me along with them wherever they went.</p>
               <p>It was the intention of my maſter to inſtruct me in his own profeſſion, and happy had it been for me if I had been ruled by his advice. But I had got an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bias for a ſea faring life, and the more than parent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035035_0008_0FFFF4EF8338A178"/>
kindneſs of my maſter and miſtreſs was totally loſt upon me; for while they made it their daily ſtudy to promote my happineſs at home, I was eagerly watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every opportunity of diſengaging myſelf from a yoke, which to me ſeemed intolerable. A mind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined will ſeldom be long at a loſs for an excuſe. A ſlight quarrel with my maſter's ſon effected my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and though the blame was wholly on my ſide, I told him, I never would ſtay another day in his father's houſe. The young man reported this to his mother, who inſtantly ſent for me, and in the moſt earneſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, laid before me the hardſhip and danger of a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring life: and often, when I have thought of her kind remonſtrances, have I regretted the fatality, that they ſhould have only ſerved to confirm me the more in my reſolution. Taking therefore a haſty leave of this good family, I paid a viſit to my father, who, though much enraged at the part I had acted, was, in a few days, prevailed on to rig me out after the manner I wiſhed: and as I ſtill dreaded a more ſerious oppoſition to my favourite ſcheme from my parents, than I had met with from my maſter and miſtreſs, I ſet out one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the family were out of bed, for <hi>Por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long at a loſs for want of employment. A ſon-in-law of the doctor's, my late maſter, was the only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance I had in the town; and as he was the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſeveral ſhips in the Weſt-India trade, I thought him the moſt likely perſon to whom I could apply. He
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035035_0009_0FFFF4F5694D0368"/>
eagerly embraced my offer, as at that time they were much at a loſs for hands, and deſired me to lodge at his houſe for a few days, till ſome of his veſſels return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I ſhould go in the firſt that came. I inſtantly wrote to my father, informing him of every thing that had paſſed; who ſeeing no better could be done, ſent me my clothes, and ſuch neceſſaries as he judged pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for my new occupation.</p>
               <p>Next day my indentures were made out; and in fourteen days a veſſel arrived. Never did the heart of a bridegroom exult more on the morning of his nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, than did mine at the ſight of a fine large ſhip, in which I was to make my firſt voyage to ſea. The world I had left behind me never coſt me a ſigh; the wooden world was all to me: But alas! I had not yet ſeen the dark ſide of the picture. Few repairs were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and in a ſhort time we began to take in our loading for the Weſt-Indies, where we were to diſpoſe of it in the iſlands of Barbadoes, Antigua, and St. Kitts. On the firſt of May we completed our cargo, and on the 10th of the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onth, 1781, we weighed anchor. Our crew conſiſted of forty men, beſides fifteen paſſengers of both ſexes; among the latter was a Mrs. Murray, of a remarkable ſize: ſhe had lived the greater part of her time in the Weſt-Indies; but the warm climate ſo far from reducing her to a ſkeleton, as is the caſe with many Europeans, ſeemed to have agreed very well with her, as ſhe meaſured in height five feet five in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035035_0010_0FFFF4F6F10CEA50"/>
and round the ſmalleſt part of the waiſt, ſix feet and an half. When the boat that brought her came along ſide, ſhe called out to the mate, in a voice like thunder, deſiring him to be ſure every thing was right, and the tackles ſtrong enough to hoiſt on board twenty-two ſtone, as that ſhe ſaid, was her neat weight two days ago. It required ſome ſtrength to hoiſt her on board; but the difficulty did not end here, for upon my ſhewing her the room appropriated for her, ſhe could not, with all her art, get herſelf ſqueezed in at the door, till the carpenter was obliged to widen it. There was likewiſe a young paſſenger of the name of <hi>Kemp,</hi> who had been bred a weaver, but had given up his loom with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of puſhing his fortune in the Weſt-Indies, as a clerk. This young adventurer, from a total ignorance of the world, added to an ardent deſire to appear a gentleman, furniſhed the crew and paſſengers with daily entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, during the whole voyage.</p>
               <p>At the mouth of the Clyde, lies the rock of Ilay, remarkable for the vaſt number of ſolan geeſe, and other ſea-fowls, which continually reſort to it. A propoſal was made by the captain to ſend the boat on ſhore, as the weather was moderate; and ſeveral of the hands arming themſelves with muſkets, Mr. Kemp enquired into the buſineſs. The captain pointed out the rock, telling him, it was a deſert uninhabited iſland, where lions and tygers abounded in great numbers; and that if he had courage for an attack, he would furniſh
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035035_0011_0FFFF4F879F6BEC0"/>
him with a gun. Accordingly he put into his hands an old ruſty muſket, bayonet, and hanger, and on his head a grenadier's cap; he likewiſe adviſed him to exchange cloaths with ſome of the ſailors, as the ſight of a ſailor's dreſs, he ſaid, would fright the moſt ferocious wild beaſt in the world. Thus accoutred, Mr. Kemp joined the party that were going aſhore, declaring himſelf ready to attack the firſt wild beaſt that came in his way. The ſailors began on their paſſage aſhore, to propoſe bets who ſhould kill the firſt game. Mr. Kemp immediately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted a wager of half a guinea, that the firſt ſhould be killed by himſelf: but upon loading their pieces, Mr. Kemp, for the firſt time, made the diſcovery that his gun wanted a lock; he therefore inſiſted the bet ſhould be drawn; but the captain willing to entertain himſelf a little longer at his expence, accommodated him with his own. The firſt object that preſented our adventurers upon their landing, was a few ſheep, which the captain perſuaded the credulous paſſenger, were ſo many white boars. Kemp creeping upon his knees till he got within gun-ſhot of them, let fly among them; the affrighted ſheep fled at the report of the gun, but one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little lame, could not run ſo faſt as the reſt: Our ſportſman called out with great ſelf-complaſency, that he had got the wager, as he had hit one of the boars. His companions, after indulging the laugh at his expence, told him that his game was no other than a ſheep. "But," ſays the captain, "if you will go to the top of the rock you will find plenty of game," and at the ſame time
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035035_0012_0FFFF4FA1E0E2B08"/>
pointing out the neareſt road to him. The credulous young man mounted the rock, but no ſooner was he got out of fight, than his companions made off in the boat, and left him to find game as he could. Upon miſſing the boat, he fell into a ſtate little ſhort of diſtraction: nor did the captain for ſome hours, think proper to relieve him; and when he ordered the boat aſhore for him, the ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors found him ſitting on the rock in a ſtate of abſolute deſpair. After he got on board, the wind ſpringing up from the ſouthward, we intended going out of the North channel, and this we rather would do, as there was leſs likelihood of meeting with any of the enemies' ſhips. I need not inform my reader, that at this period, Great Britain was engaged in a war with America, and three of the greateſt maritime powers in the world.</p>
               <p>May 15th, at 3 o'clock, A. M. we diſcovered a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel crowding all the ſail ſhe could to come up to us. All hands were inſtantly called; the decks were cleared; muſkets put into the hands of the paſſengers, and every thing ready for an engagement; but about 8 o'clock ſhe hailed us, when we diſcovered her to be the Hinde ſloop of war, then ſtationed in that channel. The wind blowing ſomewhat freſh, we parted, and proceeded on our voyage. The weather for ſome days continuing favourable, and every thing ſucceeding to our wiſhes, our captain returned to the malicious amuſement of roaſting Mr. Kemp. He had obſerved this young ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer pay much more attention to his dreſs, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035035_0013_0FFFF4FED3198E90"/>
waſh himſelf more frequently than is commonly done at ſea; and one day he told him, he would furniſh him with a waſh for his face and hands, that would totally take away the appearance of the mechanic, and give his ſkin a ſmoothneſs and delicacy equal to any lady's. As nothing was more agreeable to Mr. Kemp than the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a gentleman-like appearance when he got to the Weſt-Indies, he loaded the captain with a profuſion of thanks, and told him he could not do him a greater favour. I was ordered to prepare the waſh; which was a panful of oatmeal and water, mixed without ſalt, which, when going to bed, he was to ſpread upon his handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and apply to his face; and fill his ſtockings, into which he was to put his hands, and in that manner to ſleep all night. Kemp begged my aſſiſtance in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it, and went to bed in high ſpirits, expecting to appear an <hi>Adonis</hi> in the morning. Next day the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain had prepared the company for his appearance, and as he had not been ſeen till the whole of the paſſengers were aſſembled to breakfaſt, I was ordered to call him. He inſtantly obeyed the ſummons, and placing himſelf at the table, preſented to the company the appearance of an old man of ninety, or an hundred. The applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the poultice had contracted the ſkin, and purſed it to ſuch a degree, that it would have been impoſſible for any of his over-night acquaintances to recollect the ſmalleſt traces of his former face. The laugh againſt him was long and loud, without his being able to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the cauſe, till riſing from the table, and applying to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035035_0014_0FFFF5025D9A5A98"/>
a looking glaſs, it preſented to him a hideous form with which he had not the ſlighteſt acquaintance. Enraged to the higheſt degree at the loſs of his beauty, he began in the bittereſt terms to revile the captain; ſwearing, he would make him pay dearly for his uſage on their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at Barbadoes. He then went upon deck, aſking every one he met, if they knew any method of reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to his natural complexion: One of the ſailors, who was as much the wag as the captain, told him, he knew of an infallible method; and gathering up a kind of blob, common in thoſe ſeas, known to the ſailors by the name of the <hi>Portugueſe-man-of-war,</hi> deſired Mr. Kemp to rub his face with it. The poor ſimpleton took his advice, and immediately his face was all over in a flame. This drove poor Kemp almoſt to diſtraction; but as the laugh, at his expence, had been general all over the ſhip, and no means of revenge occurring to him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, ſullen and diſguſted, to indulge his private thoughts in his own apartment. In this manner our time paſſed, our captain ever fertile in expedients, to entertain one part of his paſſengers at the expence of another.</p>
               <p>The day at laſt arrived when we were to croſs the line, and as this day is ſpent, time immemorial, in a ſpecies of humour peculiar to a ſea-faring life, I ſhall give a ſhort account of it, for the benefit of thoſe who never were at ſea. The great bug-bear of the ocean is <hi>Davie Jones.</hi> Whence this old gentleman had his origin, I cannot certainly ſay. It muſt be granted, that we ſons
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035035_0015_0FFFF504E9103CD0"/>
of Neptune have no inconſiderable ſhare either of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition or credulity; and it is moſt probable one or both had the principal hand in bringing him into exiſtence. However that may be, at the croſſing of the line, he has often been found an exiſtence not merely ideal. The day before, great preparations are made for paſſing this old gentleman in the moſt reſpectful manner. Mats, ſwabs, ſkins, or whatever comes firſt to hand of dark co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, are laid in readineſs to dock out two of the ſailors, who are to repreſent him and his wife, who muſt be preſent on the occaſion. The paſſengers are, if poſſible, kept below at the approach of the ſuppoſed boat, when the farce is to be acted; and when every thing is in readineſs, one of the hands runs up and down the deck making a great noiſe with a trumpet, and calling out, that Davie Jones and his wife are coming on board, and that every thing muſt be made ready for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Every paſſenger, who knows no better, is made to believe that this good old couple keep a kind of turnpike-gate here, which it impoſſible to paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paying ſomething to ſecure their friendſhip. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, or ſailors, who can afford it, pay a ſmall ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and are free; but ſuch as will not, undergo a very rigid diſcipline. They are firſt of all brought upon the deck blindfolded, then led to a large tub full of water, acroſs which is placed a ſtick, upon which they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſit down. Old Davie then makes his appearance in the character of a barber, a tub being placed by his ſide full of tar, greaſe, and lampblack, into which he
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035035_0016_0FFFF506744F28B8"/>
dips a bruſh, and with this compound lathers the face of the unfortunate paſſenger, and then proceeds to apply a razor to his face, which is generally a piece of an old hoop, or ſome ruſty iron. The devil is ſaid once to have ſhaved a pig, and after the operation, to have obſerved, there was <hi>more moiſe than wool.</hi> So it generally force with old Davie, and thoſe upon whom his operations are performed. My reader will eaſily conceive the wry faces, and horrid exclamations made on this occaſion. After the ſhaving operation is over, it is neceſſary to waſh them, and for this purpoſe, the ſtick upon which they ſat is pulled away, the conſequence of which is, they are ſouſed over head and ears into the tub of water over which they were placed, and immediately a ſcramble takes place for all the water on deck, every one throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much as he can upon his neighbour, till all are completely drenched; and the buſineſs ends in a hearty cann of grog. Such has heretofore been the manner of croſſing the line.</p>
               <p>The bad conſequences, however, attending this rough procedure, paſſengers ſometimes ſuffering ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the experiment, has of late years, made the captains of ſhips diſcourage this ſpecies of humour; and the fine of half a crown, or even a ſhilling, is now deemed ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for Davie and his wife, without having recourſe to the ſhaving operation at all. On the 22d of June, in the morning, we made the iſland of Barbadoes; but were under the greateſt apprehenſions about landlag, as
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035035_0017_0FFFF5090A25D6E0"/>
a number of war-ſhips were lying in Carliſle-bay, and we were afraid of having our men preſſed into the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Our fears were not groundleſs. The fleet lying here, conſiſted of twenty-ſix ſail of the line, which in a few days expected to attack the French fleet then lying at Dominica, and hands were much wanted. From one of the ſhips we were ſaluted by a gun, and ordered to come to anchor; which we had no ſooner done, than we were boarded by all the boats belonging to the fleet; every one ſtriving who ſhould get moſt of our men. They took from us nine, and departed, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us barely as many as were ſufficient to navigate the ſhip. Next day we put aſhore our paſſengers, and begun to unload ſo much of our cargo as was configned to this iſland, which we accompliſhed in ſix days. Barbadoes is the moſt eaſterly of all our Weſt-India iſlands, lying in 59 degrees weſt longitude, and 13 degrees north latitude. It is about 21 miles long, and 14 broad. The capital of the iſland is Bridgetown, ſituated at the head of Carliſle-bay. Here the governor reſides. The bay will contain a very great number of ſhips, which can anchor in from ten to thirty fathoms water, and a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bottom. Two large fortreſſes command the harbour. The iſland produces ſugar, cotton, and coffee. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port likewiſe large quantities of rum; though it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably inferior to that of Jamaica, or even of Antigua. The climate is healthy; and the native of Britain, of which a conſiderable number are ſettled here, ſeem to be lively, active, and happy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:035035_0018_0FFFF50D9BF7E598"/>A fleet being preparing at this place to ſail to the leeward, we made all imaginable haſte for the benefit of their convoy; and on the firſt of July, every thing being in readineſs, we ſet ſail for Antigua, being in all thirty merchant ſhips, under convoy of the Boreas, Sable, and La-fortune frigates. The fifth of July we parted from our convoy, their deſtination being for St. Lucia, and on the ſixth we made the iſland of Antigua.</p>
               <p>This iſland is ſituated in 60 degrees weſt longitude, and 17 degrees north latitude. It is of a circular form, being nearly 20 miles in diameter, and the country ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mountainous, though the ſoil is in general very good. It produces ſugar, cotton, and coffee, and on the iſland a conſiderable quantity of rum is made, but a little inferior to that of Jamaica. The climate is healthy, and the inhabitants, in general, live to an old age. The negroes, of which there are a great number, appear hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, notwithſtanding the wretchedneſs of their condition. They are, in general, allowed a ſmall lot of ground, and have one day in the week, namely Sunday, for its culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and their maſters ſometimes indulge them with a ſmall morſel of pork, or a ſalt herring, but theſe are luxuries they are not every day accuſtomed to.</p>
               <p>Engliſh Harbour, ſituated on the ſouth ſide of the iſland, is well adapted for the accommodation of ſhips of war for repairing; but St. John's is the capital for trade. There is only another ſmall harbour, on the north-eaſt
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035035_0019_0FFFF50F25E96DD8"/>
ſide of the iſland, called Param: but as the entrance is dangerous and difficult, few ſhips of any conſiderable burden attempt it, but commonly ſend their boats for what loading they take in there. This iſland is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally kept in an excellent ſtate of defence; and in time of war, when the alarm is made, every fortification can be in readineſs in the ſpace of an hour. The greateſt difficulty under which the inhabitants of Antigua labour, is a ſcarcity of water: there is not a ſpring upon the iſland, the only ſupply therefore they have, comes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the clouds.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-ſeventh of July we weighed anchor, and on the twenty-ninth we made St. Kitts, or St. Chriſtopher's, ſo called from the famous Criſtopher Columbus, who firſt diſcovered it. This iſland is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in 62 degrees weſt longitude, and 17 degrees north latitude. It is about fourteen or fifteen leagues diſtant from Antigua, and is twenty miles long, and nine broad: the weſt end of the iſland is very mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the woods abound with vaſt numbers of apes and monkies, which the negroes lay hold of very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, by the following ſtratagem:—They have cocoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut ſhells prepared on purpoſe, with a hole in each, ſo large as to admit the paw of the animal: into the ſhell they put a lump of ſugar, of which the monkey tribe are ſo exceedingly fond, that when they once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their prize, they make various efforts to get it out, and will ſooner allow themſelves to be taken, than
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035035_0020_0FFFF510AD5EE228"/>
leave it before they made good their purpoſe. For a monkey or baboon ſome of the ſailors will perhaps give a bottle of rum, or ſomething of equal value, and this a negro deems an ample compenſation.</p>
               <p>If no men of war are in the harbour here, the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of the merchant ſhips generally lies guard. On the twentieth of September it was our turn, when we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the weſtward a brig, which we ſuſpected to be French, or American, wanting to cut ſome of the fleet out of the harbour. Having alarmed the fleet, we lay that night upon our guard, bringing on board a number of men out of the ſmaller veſſels that lay to the ſhore of us. About twelve o'clock at night ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the harbour, when we diſcovered her to be a ſloop of war, belonging to Britain. Her lieutenant came on board our ſhip, and requeſted the favour of our boat for a few hours, to go through the other ſhips with a view of impreſſing men, aſſuring our captain at the ſame time, he would take none of his. This was readily granted, and in a ſhort time he returned with about forty-men, after which they immediately left the harbour. There are in St. Chriſtopher's ſeveral harbours, but the moſt commodious for trade is Baſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre, in which we now lay. Notwithſtanding this harbour is the moſt frequented, it is very inconvenient for loading and unloading: a continual ſurf, or ſwell, making it very unſafe, on ſome occaſions, to venture aſhore. The negroes, however, who are by no means
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035035_0021_0FFFF5144713B0F8"/>
afraid of dying by water, perform, upon theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, what would be very difficult to any other perſon. They are very dextrous in the management of their canoes, which though ſo ſmall as to contain only one hogſhead or two puncheons, will live almoſt in any ſea. When they get them aſhore, a number of them ſeize upon them, and haul them out of the way of the ſurf, where they take in their loading, and wait the ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſea; and the moment they have a proper opportunity, they all join in puſhing them into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Each canoe is manned by two negroes, who, in an inſtant leap on board of her, and proceed to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhip they are deſtined.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-eighth of September we ſailed from St. Kitts, and proceeded to the northward, with a brig under our convoy. We ſet out with a very fine breeze, which carried us acroſs the Trades, but which was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a violent gale of wind, in latitude 29° longitude 50°, which greatly diſabled us: in the courſe of the gale we had parted from the brig, and did not ſee her till the ſecond day after.</p>
               <p>On the 25th of October, in the morning, we deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried two brigs ſtanding to the ſouthward, and we ſoon found them to be Americans, and entertained the moſt ſanguine hopes of making them prizes. We fired a gun at the firſt, which ſhe not ſeeming to mind, we gave her a broadſide at once, upon which ſhe hoiſted an
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035035_0022_0FFFF515CE5261C0"/>
American flag. We made a ſignal for our brig to cut her off, and were preparing to give chace to the other; but inſtead of obſerving our ſignal ſhe ſtill kept under our ſtern: ſeeing this, we inſtantly put about, but a ſhort chace ſoon convinced us, that we were by no means a match for the enemy at ſailing, and by the obſtinacy of the brig, we loſt both our expected prizes.</p>
               <p>When we found this we ſtood on our courſe, and the wind being fair for a few days, we expected to make our port without any further interruption. But on the ſecond of November, we were overtaken by a very heavy gale of wind, which obliged us to heave our ſhip, as we could no longer carry any ſail. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition we lay for the ſpace of fourteen days, the wind conſtantly blowing from the north weſt. The ſixth day after the gale came on, our captain judged it proper to put us all upon ſhort allowance, as there were on board ſixty two perſons, and but a very moderate quantity ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of water or proviſions. Our ſhip's company was made up of men from different nations; among others we had eight Dutchmen, who diſliking the allowance aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them, determined upon raiſing a mutiny; and in all probability would have effected their purpoſe, had they not been detected by a ſoldier who was our paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and who over-heard the whole of their plot. They had determined firſt to make themſelves maſters of the arms which were on the quarter deck, after which they were to proceed to the cabin, and murder all who would
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035035_0023_0FFFF51755DE7708"/>
not join their party; then they were to ſeize upon the ſhip, and ran her into the firſt American port. The ſoldier who over-heard them, took the firſt private op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of reporting what he had heard. The captain was determined to try them to the laſt, and at the ſame time to take ſuch precautions as ſhould prevent the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects they intended. When night came on, he had the reſt of the hands diſpoſed of in ſuch a manner as to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them with the greateſt poſſible caſe. The hour ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived when their operations were to commence, when proceeding to the arm cheſt they found it empty, and going down to the cabin, the men who were waiting to give them a proper reception, ſeized upon them and brought them upon deck. They were chained two by two for the ſpace of ſeven days; but being unable to work our ſhip without their aſſiſtance, we were at laſt obliged to releaſe ſix, leaving the two ring-leaders, to ſuffer a puniſhment little ſhort of death: for ſo incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the ſeaſon, that any water that happened to waſh the deck, was ice in a moment. Our captain, of whoſe barbarity and inhumanity every day brought freſh inſtances, would not, during the ſpace of fourteen days, allow them to change their cloaths, though they were often drenched over head and ears: but I ſhall have occaſion ſoon to mention other inſtances of his cruelty, and ſhall for the preſent proceed with my narrative.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-ſecond of November we were chaſed by a large Dutch-built ſhip, which appeared to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035035_0024_0FFFF51BF6D71BB8"/>
up to us very faſt. At the ſight of her, the eyes of the two Dutchmen chained to the fore-caſtle, ſparkled with joy. Upon this occaſion however their aſſiſtance was wanted, and our captain very <hi>generouſly</hi> ſet them at liberty. The paſſengers were all furniſhed with ſmall arms, and every man ordered to his poſt. At this time I acted in the capacity of cabin-boy, and the captain cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to me to bring him a ſpeaking trumpet, in the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidation and hurry I was in, I unluckily appeared in his preſence without remembering to pull on my cap; but he ſoon gave me reaſon to repent my forgetfulneſs, by dealing me a few hearty blows, which cut me moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully, and laid me almoſt ſpeechleſs at his feet. After the ſhip that had ſo alarmed us came up, ſhe prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a Britiſh veſſel from New-York, bound to the Weſt-Indies. After diſcourſing with one another for a little, we parted, wiſhing each other a good paſſage. We directed our courſe for the port of New-York, whither we were bound; and having a briſk gale, on the twenty-fifth of November, we diſcovered land, which proved to be <hi>Never Sink;</hi> but night coming on, obliged us to heave too, till the morning of the following day, when we found ourſelves in leſs than ten fathoms water, but the wind abating and veering to the north-weſt, we then came to anchor, to prevent our being drove farther off the ſhore. On the twenty-ſeventh, at four o'clock, A. M. four men of war ſhips coming out of the harbour, one of them made right to us; and making a demand of men, our captain delivered up the whole of the Dutchmen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035035_0025_0FFFF51D826A5110"/>
in the late plot. But this not ſatisfying the lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, who had boarded us, he took ſo many of our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hands, as rendered it impoſſible for us to navigate the ſhip into port. The captain found it neceſſary to apply to the commodore, who ordered the ſame ſhip to ſend men to conduct us; the lieutenant quarter maſter, and ſixteen hands therefore coming on board, took the command of our ſhip, and on the morning of the twenty-eighth brought us ſafe into Sandy Hook. The men how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, willing to indemnify themſelves for their trouble, had, in the courſe of the ſeven or eight hours they were on board of us, made free with twelve caſes of our gin. When they were about to leave us, the lieutenant, to whom I had rendered ſome little menial ſervices, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed an intention of taking me along with him; but the captain, who was unwilling to part with me, offered him another in my ſtead. We were all obliged to range ourſelves on the deck, when the lieutenant made choice of a boy who had been in the ſervice before, and to our great ſatisfaction bade us adieu.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-ninth we weighed anchor and ſtood for New-York; but as the ice in large quantities was coming down the river, we were obliged to bring to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor again till the tide flowed, when we expected to meet with leſs oppoſition. Next morning at two o'clock we again weighed anchor, and at four, A. M. we arrived at the port.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:035035_0026_0FFFF5200E3D1C70"/>A few days after our arrival, die brig we parted with at ſea, arrived alſo, in a very leaky ſhattered condition, having loſt a part of her ſails, one of her maſts, and part of her rigging. There was at this time a very great demand for our cargo, and we began to unload with all poſſible ſpeed.</p>
               <p>As the city of New-York ſtands at the mouth of Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's river, its ſituation for trade is admirable; a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is thereby opened with Albany, and many other inland towns towards Canada, and the Lakes; and as the conveyance is ſo commodious and eaſy for all ſort of goods, the quantities that paſs through this city, are immenſe. The houſes, in general, are elegant; and the city, though irregularly built, forms a beautiful proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from the river. The export trade of New-York, conſiſts of wheat, flour, ſkins, and furs, and a variety of other articles. Its markets are well ſupplied, as it has in all ſeaſons of the year, a ſhort and eaſy paſſage to the ocean; and commands the inland trade of a great proportion of the beſt ſettled, and beſt cultivated part of the United States. Hudſon's river is navigable for veſſels of 80 tons, as far up as Albany, which is one hundred and ſixty miles north of New-York; and for ſhips of any ſize to Hudſon, which is about one hundred and thirty miles. To a perſon fond of angling, a ſail up this river affords excellent paſt time. In the Mohawk river, which emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties into the Hudſon, there is a large cataract, where the water falls thirty feet perpendicular; but including
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035035_0027_0FFFF521972235F0"/>
the deſcent above the fall, ſixty or ſeventy feet. The rock over which the water pours, extends almoſt in a line acroſs the river.—But I return to my narrative, hoping the reader will excuſe this digreſſion reſpecting a country for which I entertain the greateſt partiality.</p>
               <p>Before we left the harbour of New-York, our cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ordered me one day to have an hundred oyſters ready for him by nine o'clock in the evening. I took care to have every thing ready at the appointed hour, when he entered, handing into the cabin two ladies of the <hi>Cyprean corps,</hi> who without any ceremony ſat down with him to ſupper. During their repaſt, he ordered me to bring him a pair of candle-ſnuffers: I went to find them, but not immediately ſucceeding, he took his watch out of his pocket, and ſwore a moſt tremendous oath, that if I did not bring them in five minutes, he would ſhoot me dead on the ſpot. Still I continued my ſearch, and the time expired without my being able to find then. He inſtantly ſeized me, and leading me to one ſide of the cabin, ordered me to ſtrip. I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hard neceſſity to comply, and fixing me to a ring, drove into one of the beams, he gave me a flog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, which had nearly deprived me of life: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he drew me upon deck, naked as I was, where he left me in a very inclement ſeaſon, in a ſtate which I am unable to deſcribe. In this ſtate I was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for two full hours, when the captain's voice again ſtruck horror to my heart. With many horrid oaths
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035035_0028_0FFFF526274B8A30"/>
and imprecations, he ordered me down to the cabin, threatening to toſs me overboard if I did not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately obey. This however was not in my power; the ſtripes he had given me, and the exceſſive cold, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deprived me of ſenſe and motion. My tyrant was not yet ſatisfied, but coming upon deck, found me out, and kicked me from one end of it to the other with his feet. The noiſe brought all hands upon deck; but though every one pitied me, no one durſt interpoſe, well knowing if they did, he would ſoon ſend them on board a man of war. At laſt, having glutted his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, he pulled me upon my legs, and giving me a quarter-dollar, ordered me to go on ſhore and buy him a pair of ſnuffers. Glad to be relieved on any terms from his barbarity, I made every exertion my little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtrength would admit of, and got aſhore, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to ſee him no more: but alas! I was a ſtranger, without money or friends, and at ſo late an hour, no houſe would admit me, ſo that I had no alternative but to return to the ſhip. A man in the ſtreet directed me to a brazier's, and having purchaſed a pair of ſnuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, I once more went on board, firmly determined to make my eſcape in the morning.</p>
               <p>By the time I returned, the ladies propoſed taking their departure, when I was ordered to ſet them aſhore, after which I retired to my hammock, with a bruiſed body and aching heart. Next morning I took the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt opportunity of going aſhore, and getting on board
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035035_0029_0FFFF528B5A4DD48"/>
a ſhip where I had ſeveral acquaintances, paſſed that day and the next night with them; but I had left my cloaths, and ſeveral articles on board my own ſhip, which I was unwilling to loſe, and I could deviſe no method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering them without returning myſelf. I was in hopes of obtaining my object without the knowledge of the captain, but one of the men ſuſpecting my intentions, would not permit my going aſhore again; and the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain over-hearing our altercation, ordered me inſtantly into the cabin; he aſked me in the ſterneſt manner my reaſon for quitting the ſhip: I told him the reaſon was, a dread of looſing my life, and in the ſtate to which he had reduced me, I was good for nothing, and my loſs could not be felt. The captain, whoſe paſſions were all ſubſervient to his intereſt, finding that, while we were in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he harbour at leaſt, harſh meaſures would not anſwer his purpoſe, immediately began to footh and coax me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himſelf ſorry for what he had done, and aſſuring me I ſhould never have reaſon for the future to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. By ſuch flattering promiſes I was eaſily induced to forget the injuries he had done me, and once more to repair to my poſt, in hopes of more humane uſage dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the remainder of the voyage. We were in hopes of being freighted in the tranſport-ſervice, but, upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, our ſhip was found unfit for it, being old and incommodious. We were therefore obliged to return to the Weſt-Indies, as one of our owners lived in Antigua, who would find us a loading for Britain. Leaving the wharf therefore on the 13th of Jan. 1782, we went into
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035035_0030_0FFFF52A42571B18"/>
the river Mohawk; where we were to take in our ballaſt. About ſix hours afterwards, the tide beginning to ebb, brought the ice down in ſuch large quantities, as made us tremble for the ſafety of the ſhip. All hands were employed with large poles to ward it off, but in ſpite of every effort, the large ſheets of ice cut our cables, and drove us on ſhore among the rocks. All hopes of ſaving the ſhip, where now almoſt at an end; the Chatham and Experiment lying in the river, obſerving our diſtreſs, ſent their boats with twelve men, and a lieutenant in each, to offer their aſſiſtance, but to no purpoſe, till the tide returning, raiſed us up again, and brought us off without any material damage. We then proceeded to a creek on Long-Iſland ſide of the river, about one mile above New-York; but having loſt our anchors, we were obliged to run our hawfer on board the priſon-ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The froſt at this time, ſet in very intenſe; the river was frozen over, and we, as well as all the victuallers, and tranſports, which generally lie here, were for ſome weeks blocked up. Our captain, during this interval, was very much out of humour with every one around him; and was daily giving proofs to every perſon on board, of a capricious temper. It went much againſt his nature to feed the men without giving them plenty of work. One day he would ſend a party to the woods to bring fuel, which they were obliged to drag upon the ice, or to carry on their backs; next day he would employ them in cutting a paſſage through the ice, for the boat to go aſhore; but as the diſtance was about a mile, and the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035035_0031_0FFFF52BE03FB108"/>
ice of an amazing thickneſs, they could only make ſmall progreſs in one day; and what they did was to no purpoſe, as it was ſure to be hard frozen again before next morning. Thus during five weeks which we lay here, did this reſtleſs unhappy man, make every man's life as miſerable as poſſible; till at laſt, on the 17th of February, the ice began to break, and the priſon-ſhip letting go our hawſer, we drifted out of the creek; and being drove into the ebb tide of the Mohawk river, we got happily down to New-York again, where we took on board the remainder of our ballaſt; and having got all clear for ſea, we only waited for a fair wind.</p>
               <p>On the firſt of March, we weighed anchor, and ſet ſail, and the day being pleaſant, afforded us a moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting proſpect of the beautiful country we were leaving behind. Between New-York and the ocean, lie Governor's-Iſland, Staten-Iſland, and Sandy-Iſland. During the war, the ſick and wounded of the army and navy, were kept on Governor's-Iſland, on account of its healthy ſituation, and the ready ſupply of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they had from Long-Iſland. After you paſs San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-Iſland, the ſea opens into a large ſound, having Long-Iſland on the one ſide, and New-Jerſey on the other. Sandy Hook is a low point of ſandy ground, which runs into the ocean: from this point we took our departure the ſecond of March, directing our courſe for the iſland of Antigua.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:035035_0032_0FFFF52FA3115350"/>During three weeks nothing material happened, and wind and weather favouring, we were likely to make a very pleaſant voyage; but the captain was determined to make it very unpleaſant to me; for when we got as far as 23 deg. lat. a number of whales were playing around us, and having never ſeen one, I was reſolved to ſatisfy my curioſity; and going up the ſhrouds a little for this purpoſe, the captain coming on deck eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied me. From the time I had left the ſhip at New-York, he had taken every opportunity of revenging himſelf, and I was certain my preſent curioſity, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever natural, would coſt me dear. I was not deceived: the captain ordered me to be called, and when I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him, I ſaw him prepared with a rope's-end, which he began to make uſe of with all his might for a conſiderable time. He continued his diſcipline till he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me incapable of moving, and when he let me go, he ordered me to quit his preſence; which I being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do, he laid hold of a log of wood, and ſtriking me over the head with it, I fell upon the deck as ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as the wood with which I received the blow. In this ſituation I remained for a conſiderable ſpace; the blood which flowed faſt from my wound, overſpread a part of the deck, and not one of the hands durſt ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize with, or lend me the ſmalleſt aſſiſtance. Whilſt I lay in this wretched condition, a captain Campbell of the ſixty-ninth regiment, one of our paſſengers, coming upon deck perceived me, and imagining me to be dead, enquired into the buſineſs: and being informed by one
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035035_0033_0FFFF5335B2781F0"/>
of the hands, of my crime and puniſhment, he kindly made up to me, and taking me by the hand, raiſed me on my feet, and endeavoured to reſtore me to my ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſenſes. It was ſometime before his endeavours were ſucceſsful, and when they were, he adviſed me to lock up my cloaths, bloody as they were, till we got to Britain, where I might produce them as evidence againſt the captain, and get ample ſatisfaction. With a kindneſs and humanity, which I ſhall ever bear in grateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, did this gentleman aſſiſt in dreſſing my wounds; and when I was ſomewhat recovered, he put a guinea into my hand, and ſpoke the firſt conſolatory words I had ever heard from any one ſince my firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out.</p>
               <p>At this time I was only thirteen years of age, and the voice of tenderneſs by degrees reconciled me to life: I made the beſt acknowledgments I was able to my benefactor, and told him, I ſhould in every reſpect fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his advice. He afterwards went to remonſtrate with the captain about the uſage he had given me, and told him it would be remarkable if none of my friends brought him to puniſhment on our arrival in Britain. The other anſwered, he did not believe they ſhould, for he certainly would kill me before ever I reached them; adding, "Had any one given me, as much as I have done him, I ſhould have been dead myſelf." From what captain Campbell had ſeen and heard, he had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle doubt of his putting the threat in execution; and in
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035035_0034_0FFFF534E33440B8"/>
the evening he took an opportunity of charging me, as I valued my own life, to ſtudy every method of pleaſing him, and to bear his uſage with all the patience I could muſter, as a little time would bring us to the end of our voyage, and put it in my power to take ample revenge. Encouraged by theſe hopes, I reſolved to conduct my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtrictly by the advice I had received, and my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy benefactor leaving me to reſt, I the next day, though extremely weak, attended at the call of my tyrant.</p>
               <p>On the 28th of March we paſſed Deſeada, an iſland belonging to the French, lying in 59 deg. weſt longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and 17, 30 deg. north lat. It is diſtant from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua about 30 leagues, E.S.E. is ſeventeen miles long, and at the part that is broadeſt, about twelve miles. It produces cotton, and ſome ſmall quantity of ſugar; but little of the latter is ſent out of the iſland. Running down the north-ſide of Antigua, we paſſed the iſland of Barbuda: this is a ſmall flat iſland, about twenty miles long, and from ten to twelve broad. The only ſervice derived from this iſland, is a ſupply of freſh proviſions and fuel, for Antigua, eſpecially for the town of St. John's. Upon the firſt of April we arrived at Antigua, and getting into harbour we began to repair our rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, which with getting out our lumber, and making other preparations, kept us employed till the twentieth of May. The evening of that day we were ſurprized with the appearance of a remarkable light from the head of the town, which gradually increaſed, till at laſt, with
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035035_0035_0FFFF5366CAB93D0"/>
a tremendous noiſe, it burſt out, and the flames aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the clouds: it had broke out in a gentleman's rum ſtore, and as the wind happened to blow from the end of the ſtreet, where the ſtore was, it reduced in a ſhort ſpace of time one of the fineſt ſtreets in the town, to a heap of aſhes. Here the houſes are only built of wood, and the ſtores very plentiful. The conflagration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was beyond all deſcription, rapid and dreadful; and the ſhrieks of men, women, and children, running about in a ſtate of diſtraction, to ſave their relations, their property, and their lives, added to the horrors of the ſcene. A few of the ſtores, to which the flames were directing their courſe, were emptied of their contents, and the caſks rolled into the ſea. But as the conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was making rapid ſtrides towards the harbour, all the ſhips were obliged to hold themſelves in readineſs. Very luckily however, it ſtopped at the water's edge, without doing any damage to the ſhipping. Never was I witneſs to a more awful ſpectacle, than the morning preſented to our view; nor perhaps did ever any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try produce a more wretched group of diſtracted, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable mortals, than preſented themſelves upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion.</p>
               <p>On the eighth of June, another melancholy accident happened to a brig, lying along ſide of us. She was that day to ſet ſail for the iſland of Newfoundland, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleared out of the harbour, they only waited for the captain and ſome paſſengers, to come on board. A
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035035_0036_0FFFF53A02675370"/>
quantity of powder which they had that day got on board, was careleſly lying on the cabin floor, till they got time to put it into the magazine; and the two mates, going down to the cabin, began to examine ſome piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols which lay beſide them; and ſnapping one of them, the fire unhappily caught hold of the powder, and in a moment blew the veſſel into the air. The dreadful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploſion alarmed the whole harbour, and caſting our eyes to whence it proceeded, we diſcovered the ſmoke riſing in a vaſt cloud, but the veſſel was gone, all but the bottom. There were twelve men on board, and five of them being on the fore-yard, were taken up, without receiving any material damage, the reſt were never ſeen more. Some minutes after the exploſion, a large piece of her fell near the place where ſhe lay; other parts of her were carried to the diſtance of a mile. What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, the captain, with a lady, her maid, and a young gentleman, who were going paſſengers, were within a piſtol ſhot of her, going on board, when the accident happened. A boat, in attempting to pick up a dead body, ſuppoſed to be one of the unfortunate ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, was purſued cloſely by a ſhark, and almoſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſet by it. The ſhark was allowed to be about fourteen feet long, which for that fiſh is a remarkable ſize.—By this time we had got the half of our cargo on board; and as it was reported the fleet would ſail by the firſt of July, we made all imaginable haſte to be ready to ſail in it. This fleet was to comprehend all the ſhips from the Weſt-India iſlands, from Barbadoes to Torto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la:
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035035_0037_0FFFF53D97E89EE8"/>
and was to be protected by one ſeventy-four gun ſhip, one of fifty, and three frigates.</p>
               <p>During our ſtay here, nothing more happened parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and by the time appointed, we were ready for ſea. Our cargo conſiſted of ſugar, rum, and cotton, which we were to diſcharge at Liverpool, and Glaſgow. Our ſupply of water here, was ſcanty, and bad as can be imagined; it was taken from a pond, full of mud, and dirt, and ſold at the enormous price of ſix dollars a caſk; we therefore took in only ſo much as would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us down to the leeward. On the tenth of July our convoy arrived from St. Lucia, and brought with them thirty ſail; they were joined by forty more from this port, and on the fourteenth, we all ſet ſail from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua, for St. Chriſtopher's, where we were joined by twenty-five ſail more; and here we took in a plentiful ſupply of water. Leaving St. Chriſtopher's, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Virgin-Iſlands; and in going to the lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we had a view of St. Euſtatia, which lies about three leagues to the weſtward of St. Chriſtopher's; we likewiſe paſſed St. Bartholomew's, St. Martin's, and the Dog and Prickly-Pear; theſe two rocks are remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſteep and bold, and lie cloſe together. Some veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels through curioſity, paſs between them, which in mild weather they may do without danger. St. Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew is a low iſland, about twelve miles long, and five broad, and produces ſome ſmall quantity of cotton, and conſiderable quantities of ſalt are made, by the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035035_0038_0FFFF53F20E2F9D0"/>
heat of the ſun. There are ſettlers here, from different nations, but the principal part are Danes. St. Martin's is ſomewhat better than the former; it is about ten miles long, and ſeven broad; it produces ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſugar, cotton, and coffee; and exports a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quantity of ſalt. The Virgin-Iſlands, which are numerous, lie to the eaſtward of Portorico, but two of them only are of any note; namely, Tortola and St. Thomas's. Tortola produces only a ſmall quantity of ſugar, but it is the mart of all Britiſh goods for the other iſlands; and they take in return, ſugar, coffee, &amp;c. Hence the trade of this iſland is pretty conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The whole produce of the iſland of St. Thomas is trifling, and their trade carried on chiefly with the Spaniards; the town and harbour lie on the ſouth ſide of the iſland, where there is a large bay, commanded by a fort and battery: their trade conſiſts chiefly of mahog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any, logwood, &amp;c. which come from Portorico, and Hiſpaniola, in the Spaniſh main, and is carried on at a conſiderable riſk, on the part of the ſailors; for if taken they are committed for life to the mines, the trade being prohibited. St. John's, a ſmall iſland, in length eight miles, and in breadth two, lies on the eaſt of St. Thomas's. Crab-Iſland lies on the ſouth of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tola: theſe two iſland form the eaſtern entrance into what is called the Virgins. In ſailing through this, and approaching towards St. John's, the paſſage becomes very narrow, and there is conſtantly a ſtrong cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Our fleet being ſo very numerous, required par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035035_0039_0FFFF540A92E9E28"/>
attention to keep the veſſels clear one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and night comings on, every one crowded all the ſail he could, by which means conſiderable damage was done to ſeveral of the ſhips. However, about ſeven that evening we got clear of the iſlands; and next day, being the eighteenth of July, we took our departure from them; our fleet, conſiſting of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty ſail, was commanded by the honourable captain Croſby, of the Robuſte; an officer who, by his care and attention, ſhewed himſelf worthy of ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a charge.</p>
               <p>We proceeded acroſs the trade-winds, directing our courſe to the eaſtward, for the ſpace of eight days, when we got into the variables. We had, among other paſſengers, one of the owners of the ſhip, with his wife and brother-in-law. One day as I ſtood attending them at dinner, the captain began to quarrel with me about his fork; telling me, with many oaths and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations, that it was not clean. I anſwered nothing, remembering the advice given me by captain Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell; and the aſſertion he had made him, that he would never let me ſee my friends. The captain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately got up, and aiming a blow with the fork in his hand, ſtruck it into my body: every one ſeemed alarmed, and the owner eſpouſing my cauſe, I told him, that was but a ſmall ſpecimen of his bad uſage, and that if he would ſtep to the ſteerage with me, I could give him proofs of his barbarity. His wife roſe from

the table, and pulling the fork out of my breaſt, gave the captain a ſevere reprimand, charging him, while ſhe was on board, never to let her ſee ſuch another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of cruelty.</p>
               <p>About this time another incident happened, which ſhewed his diſpoſition in a juſt light. One of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers had a negro maid ſervant, who having in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or another diſobeyed her miſtreſs, was ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primanded by her: the captain ſaid, that if ſhe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, he would certainly give her a good flog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; her miſtreſs told him, ſhe would be much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him if he would. Now it happened a few even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings before, that the captain had aſked a certain favour of this ſame negro wench, which ſhe had thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to refuſe; this had turned the love he bore her into the moſt violent hatred: glad of an occaſion of reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, he embraced the opportunity which the ſanction of her miſtreſs afforded him; and getting her upon deck, he tied her to one of the pumps, and was going to proceed. The paſſengers were all aſſembled to ſee the operation, and none of them could forbear execrating the cruelty of a man, who in cool blood, and without any provocation, could ſo deliberately think of inflicting ſuch a puniſhment: one of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers ſtepping forward, charged him at his peril to touch the girl, and ordered me to take her down. I proceeded to obey him, and the captain running to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent me, was laid hold of by the paſſenger, and a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035035_0041_0FFFF547F8BC5290"/>
ſcuffle enſued, in which the paſſenger was victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and gave him a hearty drubbing. Upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of better behaviour the paſſenger let him go.</p>
               <p>On the twentieth of Auguſt we were met by a heavy gale of wind, in which two ſhips of the fleet, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to London, ſteering different courſes, ran foul of each other, by which accident one of them was ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly damaged; the men during the whole night labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the pumps, and with the utmoſt difficulty kept her from ſinking. Next morning the Lizard frigate got along ſide of her, to the great joy of the crew, who by that time had almoſt given up all hopes of life, and were in a ſituation truly deplorable. In a few minutes after they left her ſhe ſunk. The gale continued ſeven days, and at the end of it we found ourſelves near the coaſt of Ireland.</p>
               <p>September the firſt, we fell in with a frigate, ſent out from England, to order us to take the north chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, as the French fleet was ſuppoſed to be in the mouth of the ſouth channel; but on the ſeventh, a lugger, which had likewiſe been diſpatched to meet us, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to ſteer for the ſouth channel, which we did, and and on the twelfth we diſcovered land, and found it to be Cape Clear: while we were four leagues diſtant from land, ſeveral boats were ſent off with freſh proviſions, ſuch as butter, eggs, potatoes, &amp;c. which proved very acceptable to the paſſengers. On the thirteenth, the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035035_0042_0FFFF54985CF8898"/>
commodore made a ſignal for all the fleet to proceed to their reſpective ports. One of the frigates was to go to the Briſtol channel, the other to the North, or St. George's channel, and the commodore to the King's channel. We parted from the commodore on the fourteenth, along with ſix other merchant ſhips, and proceeded up St. George's channel, under convoy of the Lizard. We mounted ſixteen guns, and had on board between thirty and forty men. On the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fourteenth we were ſaluted by a ſtrange ſhip, who run up along ſide of us, and fired a gun. All hands were immediately called to quarters, and we gave her a whole broad ſide, which made her ſheer off; but in the courſe of a few minutes, ſhe returned, when we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that we had been engaged, not with an American privateer, for ſuch we imagined her to be, but with a Britiſh ſloop of war, the Bonetta mounting eighteen guns, and then in the impreſſing ſervice. On the fifteenth we had got as far in the channel as the banks of Dublin, when the commodore made a ſignal for us all to heave too, which we obeyed; and having gone through all the ſhips, and taken ſome men out of each of them, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us to proceed.</p>
               <p>On the ſeventeenth we got as far as Beau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ris, where we took a pilot on board, and arrived at Liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool. At our entrance, the cuſtom-houſe officers find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſpirituous liquors than the legal allowance, on board, ſeized the ſhip, and prevented us from entering
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035035_0043_0FFFF54D23A248B0"/>
the dock; but the owners upon application to the board, got the veſſel cleared, by paying a ſum of money, and looſing all the ſtores. During the time we lay here, diſcharging our cargo, the captain was become as mild and gentle in his treatment of me, as before he had been tyrannical. He ſeldom went aſhore that he did not take me with him: in all his tranſactions he conſulted me, and was now quicker ſighted in diſcovering virtues, than he had hitherto been in finding faults. Every day brought me ſome freſh preſent from him; cloaths, ſhirts, ſhoes, every article of wearing apparel, he now loaded me with, and in every reſpect behaved with ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſervility, and meanneſs, as would have aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, had I not known perfectly how to account for it. He ſuſpected, and juſtly, that I had preſerved my bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cloaths, to produce as evidence againſt him. And one day after he had expreſſed a wonderful degree of affection for me, he deſired me to ſhew him all my cloaths, and ſhirts, that he might ſee, what I wanted, and have me properly equipped. I ſhewed him all I had on board; but upon our firſt landing, I had carried thoſe he wanted to lay hold of, aſhore, and placed them out of his reach. Thus by his cruelty, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, had this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:035035_0044_0FFFF54EAA9DE1B0"/>On the twenty-eighth of October, we were ready for ſea, having unloaded ſo much of our cargo, as was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for Liverpool, and as the reſt was conſigned to Port-Glaſgow, we ſet ſail for that place. The extreme kindneſs of the captain, during this voyage, had entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliterated the remembrance of his former uſage; and in conſequence I had ſeriouſly determined to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give him. He had however, bribed the other appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices to diſcover my bloody cloaths, and one of them ſucceeding, carried them on board to him. He had no ſooner laid his hands upon them, than calling me to him, deſired me to take a laſt look of them, and in the greateſt triumph, threw them into the ſea. From Liverpool to Port-Glaſgow, we had on board only ſeven men, and nine boys, who had left the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter port with us, when we firſt ſet out, and had eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being preſſed; with theſe, however, we made out to navigate the ſhip, and on the fifth of November we landed at Port-Glaſgow, after a voyage of near eighteen months, diſagreeable on account of the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and caprice of our captain.</p>
               <p>The moſt abſolute monarch on earth, has not his ſubjects more completely in his power, than the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a veſſel thoſe under his command, when in his own element: he can render them happy or miſerable at pleaſure. And ſurely never man abuſed this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to greater exceſs, than did <hi>James Clarke,</hi> (for that was our captain's name): he underſtood the art of

tormenting in perfection; and no doubt I fell into his hands, as a juſt puniſhment for my headſtrongneſs, in engaging in this way of life contrary to the wiſhes and injunctions of all my friends. Should this account fall into his hands, (for he is I believe ſtill in exiſtence) he will, if he chooſes to recollect himſelf, find that I have done him no more than juſtice.—But, reader, this was but a ſmall portion of what I had to ſuffer— only the beginning of ſorrows, as you will ſee by and by: however, having given you a faithful account of my ſetting out, I ſhall cloſe the narrative of my firſt voyage.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WHEN we landed at Port-Glaſgow, I obtained leave of the gentleman, to whom I was bound, to viſit my friends; whom I found all well, and rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſee me once more at home. I enjoyed their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety only about a fortnight, when I was ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my maſter to repair to my poſt; and upon my viſiting him, I was informed, that he had purchaſed a ſchooner of 100 tons burden, which he intended to ſend to New-York. As the war ſtill continued, and hands were uncommonly ſearce, he ordered all the appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices who had been in the ſhip I laſt ſailed in, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the voyage. We were nine in number, and with the addition of a captain, mate, and carpenter, were to conſtitute the crew. At Greenock, we took in a loading of coals, which we were to diſcharge at Cork,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035035_0047_0FFFF557A5B10C40"/>
and to take in a cargo of butter, beef, pork, &amp;c. for the Briſtol army at New-York. Every perſon reprobated the idea of ſending ſo ſmall a veſſel deep loaden, manned as ours was, acroſs the Atlantic, at ſo late a ſeaſon of the year; for it was on the twenty-ſixth of November, 1782, that we weighed anchor, and got under way; but the wind coming contrary, we were obliged to put in to Fairly-road, a harbour on the eaſt ſide of the mouth of the Clyde. On the twenty-ninth, the wind coming fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, we put to ſea, and proceeded ſo far as the Mull of Galloway, when we were again obliged by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wind, to put about for the harbour of Campble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town. This harbour is about two miles long and one and a half broad, to the eaſt ſide of the Mull of Kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre.</p>
               <p>Here we remained till the third of December, when we again ſet ſail, and getting through the channel with a ſteady breeze, we arrived at the Cove of Cork on the tenth, where we came to anchor. Next morning, with the firſt of the tide, we proceeded to the town of Paſſage; and on the twelfth, began to diſcharge our cargo into lighters, which carried the coals up to the city. I need ſcarcely inform my reader, that Cork is the ſecond city in Ireland, for magnitude, grandeur, and trade; it lies one hundred and twenty miles ſouth weſt of Dublin, and contains upwards of eight thouſand houſes; its haven is deep and well ſheltered, but ſmall veſſels only can get to the city, which lies ſeven miles up the river Lee.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035035_0048_0FFFF55967F54B38"/>
Large veſſels load and diſcharge their cargoes at Cove Paſſage, and the Rock. The ſmall craft, of courſe, are very numerous upon the river, every merchant having one or more for his own uſe. As this is the chief port in the kingdom, for victualling ſhips, their trade in this way is immenſe: almoſt every veſſel, bound from Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to America, the Weſt-Indies, or the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranian, takes in the greateſt part of its ſtores here. Cork is well built, and ſtands upon a riſing ground: the principal ſtreets are broad and elegant; but like moſt of the houſes, have a mean appearance at the extremities. There are ſeven eſtabliſhed churches, ſix Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic chapels, one ſociety of Quakers, and two Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian meeting houſes. The peaſantry are very healthy, athletic, and ſtrong, and embrace every opportunity of trying their ſtrength one againſt another, eſpecially if they have had a ſufficient doſe of their favourite liquor, wiſkey: but to ſtrangers they are generous, humane, and hoſpitable, to a proverb. It was not till the twenty-eighth of January, that we finiſhed our lading, and were ready to ſail; on that day we left Cork, and having a favourable breeze from the northward, we got as far ſouth as cape Finiſtere on the fifth of February; that day however the wind veering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the ſouth-weſt, began to blow a hurricane, which ſoon obliged us to heave our ſhip too; and on the ſixth, we were ſtruck by a ſea, which totally diſabled us, and rendered it impoſſible for us to proceed, having ſprung our foremaſt, and bow-ſprit, and carried away the cabin ſcuttle, raf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er, binna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035035_0049_0FFFF55C0C8667D8"/>
and companion, and almoſt foundered our little veſſel. We had no time for heſitation, but repairing our damage, in the beſt manner our ſituation would admit off, we bore away before the ſea, for Liſbon, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the greateſt apprehenſions of going to the bottom before we reached the port, the water being four feet deep in the hold. On the eighth we fell in with a large cutter from Guernſey, in a pitiable condition, as ſhe could not run for any port, the ſea ran ſo high; and being extremely low in the ſtern, ſhe was not capable of ſounding. Our condition was ſo extremely bad, we were incapable of affording her any relief. During all that day, the gale continued to increaſe, and night brought with it the moſt dreadful apprehenſions; nor was it till the morning of the tenth, that we made the Rock of Liſbon. The entrance into this harbour is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, on account of a number of ſand-banks, which lie at the mouth of the river, and frequently vary their poſition; as we were all ſtrangers, and no pilot boat durſt venture out, our ſituation was ſufficiently preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. There remained nothing for us but to make a bold puſh on a venture, which we did, and were lucky enough to get ſafe over the bar. The Rock of Liſbon, remarkable for its height, ſtands at the mouth of the river Tagus. Upon entering the river, a beautiful view of the city preſents itſelf, together with the different fortreſſes, that guard the paſſage up to it; one of them, called <hi>Fort-Petre,</hi> ſtands upon the left hand, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains near one hundred pieces of cannon, placed in
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035035_0050_0FFFF55E992EFDB0"/>
three rows, one above another; we paſſed this and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of leſs note, and went up as far as Beliſle-Caſtle, when we were obliged to bring to anchor, till we got a permit. Here we lay for three days, and having obtained our object, we proceeded to the harbour to repair our damage.</p>
               <p>Liſbon, the capital of Portugal, ſtands upon the river Tagus, and before the year 1755, when it was almoſt deſtroyed by an earthquake, it was a large, magnificent, and ſtrong city. It is ſituated about ten miles above the mouth of the river; and the harbour, when once the ſhips get over the bar, is perhaps as good as any in Europe, and capable of containing ſeveral thouſand veſſels. The city ſtands upon ſloping ground, which riſes gradually from the river, and preſents to the eye the whole of it at one view, where palaces and churches, ſquares and public buildings, form a moſt beautiful proſpect. Though the city is far from being ſo large as it was before the earthquake, yet that dreadful viſitation has had the effect of rendering it more beautiful; as the ſtreets, in that part of the city which was deſtroyed, are conſiderably widened, and the houſes built in a very ſuperior ſtile. They are moſtly four or five ſtories high, remarkably uniform, and all built of a kind of white ſtone, which has the appearance of marble, at a little diſtance. The church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are numerous, and have excellent bells, which are almoſt continually ringing. The royal palace ſtands
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035035_0051_0FFFF56020B67F18"/>
conſpicuous, on a beautiful eminence, and has a moſt delightful appearance. Strangers are readily admitted to ſee both the houſe and gardens, on giving a ſmall gratification to the keepers. The climate is mild; and numbers from the northern countries of Europe, carry hither a broken conſtitution to get it repaired, and return with a new leaſe of life. Here the earth ſpontaneouſly produces all kinds of vegetables, fruits, and flowers; but whether it be that the ſoil, or the extreme indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the inhabitants, prevents the growth of corn, certain it is, that it is always a ſcarce article in Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, unleſs imported from foreign countries. Indeed agriculture, and all the uſeful arts, are eſteemed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther below the dignity of the rich and the noble; and the poorer ſort are ſo cramped by the deſpotiſm of the government, and their minds ſo debaſed by the ſhackles of ſuperſtition, that every thing noble or uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is loſt in the will of the ſovereign, or the influence of the prieſt. To divert their minds from reflection or ſtudy, public entertainments are tolerated and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged, which tend only to ſink them ſtill deeper in the abyſs of brutality and inſenſibility. One of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſquares in the city is ſet apart for the inhuman amuſement of bull-baiting, from which they go with the greateſt devotion to a religious proceſſion, and fall ſquat in the dirtieſt part of the city, at the image of our Saviour, the Virgin Mary; or indeed ſo little ſparing are they of their cloaths, that they ſcruple not to dirty them for the meaneſt ſaint in the calendar. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035035_0052_0FFFF563DE8A38D8"/>
their devotions, no country in the world, perhaps, abounds with more ſlagitious crimes. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is ſo common, that in its moſt aggravated ſenſe, it excites but little emotion. Strangers in particular run the greateſt riſk: if found in the ſtreets at night, they are diſpatched without noiſe, plundered of any thing valuable they have in their cuſtody, found dead in the morning, and buried without any further enquiry. Night ſeems to be the only time they are capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; liſtleſs and indolent during the day, they doze away the hours in ſloth and inactivity, and even frequently lay themſelves down to ſleep in corners of the ſtreets. The ſame liſtleſs ſpirit, ſeems to pervade every department of ſociety, and even their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeems half aſleep. It is true, when they do pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, their puniſhments are inflicted with the utmoſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity; but this happens ſeldom, and has very little ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the morals of ſociety. Indeed the holy fathers of the Inquiſition form one exception to the general character of the Portugueſe; for did their ſalvation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon their exertions, they could not be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in puniſhing evil doers: but ſo long as the people meddle not with the religion as eſtabliſhed, attempt no philoſophical experiments, and ſpeak with reverence of that <hi>venerable</hi> body, they may break the whole deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, without coming under that denomination.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we continued at Liſbon, an Engliſh frigate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived with the news of a peace between England and
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035035_0053_0FFFF56782A80208"/>
the other powers, with which ſhe had been at war, and though the Portegueſe had no hand in the quarrel, the intelligence was received with a general joy. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh merchants, reſiding here, and captains of trading veſſels in the harbour, were loud in expreſſing their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; and all ranks and degrees ſeemed unanimous, in hailing the return of tranquility and peace. Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was immediately diſpatched to the queen, who was then at Braga, and who inſtantly came back to the metropolis, to join in the public rejoicings. She per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her journey, which was about one hundred and eighty miles, by water. She was attended by a number of barges, decorated in a very elegant manner; but the barge which contained the royal paſſenger, was grand beyond deſcription. It was beautifully painted, and gilt, and conſiderably larger than the reſt, with an elegant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment raiſed over it for the accommodation of the queen and her ſuit. The reſt of the barges were filled with the principal nobility and gentry, and were in general about one hundred feet long. Each of them had from ſixty to eighty oars, rowed by men, all dreſſed in white cloaths, with black caps upon their heads. The whole city was in a buſtle, and the people aſſembled in crowds, in all the public places, where there was any chance of ſeeing their ſovereign. She landed a little below the palace; all her guards were ready to receive her, every ſhip in the harbour hung out colours, ſhips of war gave her the royal ſalute, as did alſo the caſtle, and fort. She was received by a guard of one thouſand
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035035_0054_0FFFF569093479D0"/>
horſe, and three thouſand foot, in the middle of which ſhe took her ſtation, and the proceſſion marched ſlowly on to the palace. The calvalcade was joined by coaches and horſes, and an immenſe multitude of both ſexes, and all denominations, followed in the rear; and from the curioſity expreſſed by the crowd, one would have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined they had never beheld their ſovereign before.</p>
               <p>After witneſſing this ſcene, I was about to return to the veſſel, along with ſome of my meſs-mates, who like myſelf, had come aſhore to gratify our curioſity. But we had not proceeded far, when our ears were ſaluted by ſomething like the ſound of muſic; turning round we ſaw about two hundred men, dreſſed in the clergical habit, marching along the ſtreet. As they approached us, we diſcovered the crowd fall poſtrate; and when they came up to us, all our neighbours were lying among our feet. As none of us had ever been in the country before, we were at a loſs to aſſign a reaſon for this extraordinary humiliation, and we did not think proper to follow the example. The proceſſion was preceded by twelve flambeaux, which were followed by twenty prieſts, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one carrying an image in his hand. The Virgin Mary, with a number of attendants, and three flambeaux, followed next, and after all, our Saviour upon the croſs, ſurrounded by a number of flambeaux, all carried by young men. Hitherto we retained our upright poſture, but had ſoon reaſon to repent our ſingularity; for a few ruffiian-like fellows came up to us, and knocked
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035035_0055_0FFFF56A920DFE78"/>
us all down. They ſtripped our jackets off, made free with our hats, and left us to bewail our misfortunes, and ſcramble to our boat in the beſt manner we were able. For my own ſhare I received ſuch a blow, as I would not have had ſeconded, for a ſight of the Virgin Mary, and all the other ſaints in the calendar. Upon our relating our miſadventure to the captain, he told us we might think ourſelves extremely lucky, in getting off at ſo cheap a rate, and that the wonder was we were not ſacrificed, to appeaſe the fury of the offended ſaints.</p>
               <p>The natives of Portugal, are of a dark ſwarthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and few of them grow to what an Engliſhman would call the middle ſize. They are in general, proud, vindictive and cruel; and though the women have a greater degree of liberty here, than in Spain, the men are not a little addicted to jealouſy.</p>
               <p>Soon after we arrived here, our captain and mate, upon ſome ſlight difference, had come to high words, and the mate had left the ſhip, to the great grief of the other hands, with whom he was a particular favourite. Our captain finding he could not well do without him, or perhaps afraid the owners would blame him for part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a man of conſiderably greater experience than himſelf, determined to find him out, and make conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to him; in this he ſucceeded, before the neceſſary repairs were finiſhed. On the fourth of March we
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035035_0056_0FFFF56F452DE5B0"/>
weighed anchor, and bade idieu to this land of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, with a fine eaſterly wind, which brought us as far as the iſland of Madeira, on the fourteenth. This iſland is of a triangular form, and was diſcovered, as it is ſaid, by an Engliſh gentleman, in the year 1344, and conquered by the Portegueſe in 1431. The latter kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling a fire in a foreſt to warm themſelves, it continued to burn for a conſiderable number of years, by which means the iſland was much fertilized. The air is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and ſerene; and no kind of venomous animal is to be found in it. Here are produced oranges, lemons, pomegranates, corn, wheat, honey, &amp;c. But what ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this iſland moſt famous, is the wine it produces, which takes its name from that of the iſland, and is much reliſhed in Europe, eſpecially after it has been carried to the Weſt-Indies. There is only one town on the iſland, called Funchal, ſituated at the bottom of a large bay, on the ſouth ſide of the iſland. It is defended by batteries, and is the only place where even a boat can go aſhore; and that itſelf is not practicable at all times, as there is a continual ſurf beating upon the ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are in general Portugueſe, and the iſland is ſubject to the crown of Portugal. In the neighbourhood of this iſland lies Porto-Sancho, about fifteen miles in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, where are plenty of wild hogs, and a vaſt

number of rabbits. It has excellent mooring in the road, in which ſhips to and from India generally ſtop.</p>
               <p>Leaving Madeira, we directed our courſe weſtward, for the coaſt of America, and being for ſome days fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with pleaſant weather, we amuſed ourſelves by ſtriking fiſh, particularly the porpoiſe, great numbers of of which daily ſurrounded us. But upon the twenty-eighth we diſcovered a veſſel ſteering to the weſtward, at ſome diſtance a ſtern of us, and being a remarkable faſt ſailor, we found ſhe muſt ſpeedily come up to us. Upon her nearer approach, we ſuſpected her to be an American privateer. Our captain being a very young man, with rather more valour than diſcretion, wanted to have a bruſh at her, though he had heard of the peace at Liſbon; and a very pretty battle we ſhould have made of it, three or four men, and nine boys, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thirty ſtout ſeamen, and fourteen guns. Upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to us we hailed her, and to our great ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, found her to be a brig belonging to the ſame own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with ourſelves, and bound to the ſame port. She had it ſeems, been purchaſed after we ſailed from the Clyde, and ſent to Cork to take in a cargo, ſeven weeks after our departure. With this veſſel we kept company till we reached our port. On the thirteenth of April, we made the coaſt of America, but found ourſelves ſouth of New-York. As we ſtood to the northward, we were met by an American privateer who had been from her port about eight weeks: ſhe
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035035_0058_0FFFF5735558DBE8"/>
had heard nothing of the treaty of peace, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſhe boarded us, and in ſpite of all our remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, made us her prize; till another privateer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, told her they had the intelligence of peace from an Engliſh privateer of much ſuperior force, who would have made a prize of them, if the information had been falſe. The frigate which boarded us, was the Aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, captain Evans, who put us all on board his own ſhip, and uſed us with the utmoſt civility during our captivity. Upon receiving the above intelligence, he made a ſignal for our veſſel to heave too, and putting us on board of her, wiſhed us a good voyage. When we began to examine our own veſſel, we found ſeveral things miſſing, ſuch as cloaths and ſtores, and not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the American ſailors had made free with them, we complained to captain Evans, who immediately cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſtricteſt ſearch to be made, and every thing to be reſtored to the rightful owners. On the fifteenth of April we arrived at our intended port, and came to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor near the place where we were to diſcharge, and next day put into a wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The unconquerable deſire I had always entertained of ſeeing the world, was not yet gratified. I had no wiſh to return to my own country, without having a more extenſive view of the new world; and without imparting my intention to any of my meſs mates, I I began to mediate a deſign of making my eſcape. As
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035035_0059_0FFFF574DEF2A350"/>
I was ſtill very young, I had but little hopes of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any encouragement from a ſtranger; but I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to make many words about the article of wages. One day as we were getting ſome lumber out of a ſmall veſſel, from New-London, I aſked the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what wages would be given in that country, to ſuch a lad as I was: he anſwered without heſitation, that he would give me eight dollars per month. This gave me all the encouragement I wiſhed, and made me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly reſolve, the firſt favourable opportunity that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, to become my own maſter. After our cargo was diſpoſed of, our captain had orders to expoſe the ſhip to ſale; but not meeting with a purchaſer, his next orders were, to proceed to Antigua. I had delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſcheme of eloping, till the evening before the ſhip was to ſail. The maſter of the little American veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel who offered to engage me, proffered his aſſiſtance, and getting as many of my cloaths ſmuggled out of the ſhip as I conveniently could, I left her in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and next morning, to my great ſatisfaction, ſaw her ſet ſail for Antigua. During the day, as I was patroling the ſtreets, I met with three of my ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, who told me they had left the ſhip immediately after me. Our meeting was joyful: only one thing ſat heavy upon our ſpirits—among us all we had not two dollars. The little we had, however, was common, and enabled us to ſpend the evening together; but a new day brought with it new wants, and we were all obliged to be as expeditious as poſſible in finding em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035035_0060_0FFFF5787956D540"/>
Hands were now very plentiful, the peace having thrown numbers out of employ; and for three days no one would have any thing to ſay to me. By this time I began to repent my raſhneſs, in leaving my own veſſel. The American captain, who had proffered me ſuch handſome wages, was ſailed I knew not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I began to think my caſe deſperate enough.</p>
               <p>On the morning of the fourth day, I went along ſide of a brig, which was taking in ballaſt, and inquired of one of the men, if the captain wanted a hand. He told me he did, and he believed I would anſwer his purpoſe. As the captain was gone aſhore, I reſolved to wait till his return, and the more to recommend myſelf, I began with all my might to heave in ballaſt. It was not long till the captain came on board, and inquiring who I was, I told him I wanted to go a voyage with him, and ſhould make no terms with him, but take whatever he choſe to give me. He liked my propoſal, and told me I ſhould not fare the worſe for my diffidence in aſking. —Mr. Seaton, for that was our captain's name, had ſomething in his appearance and manners, inexpreſſibly engaging. He was about ſixty years of age; his looks and behaviour to his crew, had more of the parent than the maſter in them. Every word he ſpoke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded reſpect, and in all his actions he diſplayed the integrity and ſimplicity of the honeſt uncontaminated American. From the firſt moment I ſaw him, he drew from me ſomething like a filial reverence. This made
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035035_0061_0FFFF57C0FCD8070"/>
me aſſiduous to pleaſe, and I found myſelf extremely happy in being told my endeavours were ſucceſsful. The veſſel he commanded, had, during the war, been captured from the Americans, and ſold at New-York, about ſix months after ſhe had been built, and at this time ſhe was not above a year at ſea: the gentleman who had bought her lived at Alexandria, in Virginia, and thither we were bound. During our paſſage the captain treated me with marks of diſtinction, which were highly flattering. He would often call me into the cabin, and chat away whole hours with me; or make me read to him, when we found nothing to ſay; and, in ſhort, made me as happy as I poſſibly could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be, in the line of life I had choſen.</p>
               <p>One day as we were chatting together, he told me, he had taken a particular fancy to me, and the reaſon was, that I reſembled a ſon of his ſo much, that every time he ſaw me, he thought he was riſen from the dead. He told me, this ſon, though but very young, had diſſuaded him with all the rhetorick he poſſeſſed, from the only action of his life of which he was aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which would embitter all his future days. In the courſe of his converſation, I learned that he had been entruſted with the command of a ſhip in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the American States, but that in the courſe of the war he had become ſo violent a royaliſt, that he had ſettled an account with his conſcience, and run the veſſel into New-York, where ſhe was delivered to
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035035_0062_0FFFF57EA6F874A8"/>
the Britiſh by his particular deſire; and now he was entruſted with the command of this preſent ſhip, only to navigate her to Alexandria. The owner of this brig intended her for a coaſting trade, from Virginia to Philadelphia, and the above-mentioned circumſtance had put it out of our captain's power to go to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place, or even to make a public appearance in the former. Towards the end of our voyage he had me conſtantly with him, and often aſked me, if I would conſent to remain with him, aſſuring me at the ſame time, that I would meet a kind reception from his wife, and in every reſpect be put upon the footing of a ſon. I had no intention of complying with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and therefore made no poſitive promiſes. My extreme deſire of ſeeing the world, did not at all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with his plan of ſettling in America; and though I am certain I loſt the whole of his fortune by not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, which was not inconſiderable, I perſevered in my reſolution of ſeeing more of the world.</p>
               <p>He told me he was to return no more to New-York, as that town was now to be given up to the Americans; but was to go to the Britiſh ſettlements, where he was allotted a portion of land, as a refugee, and that to the laſt moment of his life, he ſhould regret the unlucky tranſaction, that rendered a reconciliation with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer friends impractable. On the fourteenth of May, we paſſed the two points of land, called Capes, which open a paſſage into the bay of Cheſapeak; into which
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:035035_0063_0FFFF5804A9EEAF8"/>
many large navigable rivers empty themſelves, ſuch as the Potomak, James' river, York river, &amp;c. which are all navigable for many miles up the country. On the fifteenth we got as far up the bay as the Wind-mill Point, which lies at the mouth of York river, and here we came to anchor, and took on board a pilot to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us up the river Potomak. On the ſixteenth we weighed anchor, and had the pleaſanteſt paſſage ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination can paint: the country on either ſide is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; it is moſtly cleared of wood, and furniſhes a moſt beautiful landſcape. Here the banks of the river are interſperſed with country ſeats, ſurrounded by gardens, which produce all the vegitative luxuries of nature. In all my wanderings through this world, I never met with a man, I thought ſo truly happy as an American far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. His looks are the index of health, and his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of independence. The pride and ſoppery of Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean nations are here unknown, but all the ſolid advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of life are enjoyed in the greateſt perfection. The earth bountifully rewards the toil of the huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; his farm ſupplies him with food, his orchard with drink. A moderate ſhare of labour only is neceſſary— nature does much. He is looked upon as the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable member of ſociety. At home he commands a kind of patriarchal reverence, and abroad he neither is obliged to give, nor receive that fulſome adulation, that language of art, which reduces men below the dignity of nature; and a moderate ſhare of application and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, enables him to leave the world, with the pleaſing
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035035_0064_0FFFF583D52E9798"/>
proſpect of bequeathing to his children, a competency to enable them to ſet out in life, when he ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p>In our paſſage from the Capes to Alexandria, we paſſed ſeveral towns in miniature, both in Virginia and Maryland. Alexandria, the principal trading town, is diſtant from the Capes about three hundred miles. It is built upon a bank, riſing gradually from the river. The plan intended ſeems to reſemble that of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, the ſtreets interſecting one another, at right angles. On our landing here, the captain renewed his ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for me to go into exile with him, for ſo he termed the ſettlement allotted him in Britiſh-America; but as I continued firm in my reſolution, he gave over preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing me; and after giving me a pecuniary mark of his reſpect, and many wholeſome advices in private, with a heavy heart he bade us all adieu. We were now left without a captain, but the mate aſſuming the command, we began to take in our cargo, which conſiſted of tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co and wheat; and in a little time after our cargo was completed, a captain came on board. The gentleman proved to be good-natured, and agreeable. The beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of my commanders, ſince I entered into the trade of America, had made me ſtill fonder of the life I had choſen, and had made me totally forget the miſeries of my firſt ſetting out; I determined therefore not to be in haſte to leave this country. We ſailed from Alexandria on the eighteenth of May, and proceeded for Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035035_0065_0FFFF5865E81EFC0"/>
After we had paſſed the Capes of Virginia, in the courſe of the night, we ſtruck upon a bank of ſand, which lies fourteen leagues eaſt of Cape-Charles, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twelve miles from the ſhore. The weather being favourable, however, we kept in the veſſel, reſolving to wait the iſſue of the next tide. This anſwered our wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, for next day the tide riſing higher, and the wind ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a favourable direction, ſhe was got off without any material damage. For ſeveral days we were toſſed about by contrary winds, and having only laid in proviſions for eight days, and being twice that number at ſea, we were all put upon ſhort allowance. We paſſed the two points of land called Cape-Henlopen, and Cape-May, which form the bay of Delaware. This bay is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely dangerous, on account of a number of ſhoals, banks, and ridges of rocks, with which it abounds. One of the latter, called the Frying-Pan, extends half acroſs, and is in length about fifteen miles. It is covered at half-tide, and ſhips that have no pilot on board, are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to go by ſoundings. The river Delaware divides the ſtate of Jerſey on the eaſt, and Maryland on the ſouth and weſt, from Pennſylvania; and is navigable one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and fifty miles from the ſea. This river opens an eaſy communication with the inland country.</p>
               <p>On the fourth of June, we came to anchor, at the mouth of the Delaware, till the tide made next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when we weighed anchor, and ſailing up the river we paſſed Ready-Iſland, a ſmall ſpot, which in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035035_0066_0FFFF587E6FB2040"/>
of ſome perſons ſtill alive, was covered all over at low water, and is now from two to three feet above the ſurface of the water in the higheſt tides. It is all covered with reeds, and is every year growing ſomewhat lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Immediately after this, we paſſed the town of Newcaſtle, which ſtands cloſe by the river-ſide. The country on both ſides is cleared of wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, and preſents a beautiful, and rich proſpect. The river at this time was much incommoded by a number of chevaux-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frize, placed by the Americans to prevent the Britiſh fleet from getting up to Philadelphia. Oppoſite to theſe ſtands fort Mifflin, on a ſmall iſland, which is the only place of ſtrength in the river. In the year 1777, the Britiſh were enabled to take this fort by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtratagem:—The iſland was fortified only on the ſide next to the great body of the water, as they had no ſuſpicion of an attack from the other ſide. But as the ſinking of the chevaux de-frize had obſtructed the main current, and diverted the water into a new chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, an American pilot undertook to carry a veſſel of a certain draught of water, up the back ſide of the iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and; and a ſhip of ſixty-four guns being cut down for the purpoſe, ſhe proceeded to the attack, while three ſloops of war began to batter the fort in front, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert their attention. The ſtratagem ſucceeded: the ſurprize of being attacked from a quarter they leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it, and the want of time to remove their artillery to the other ſide, obliged them to ſurrender, though not till after a ſmart engagement, and a conſiderable
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:035035_0067_0FFFF58B8954CF28"/>
number had been killed on both ſides. Paſſing this memorable ſpot, we in a ſhort time made up to the much famed city of <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> This metropolis of the American States, has ſo often been deſcribed, that I ſhall be very brief in my account of it, and with this ſhall conclude the preſent chapter.</p>
               <p>Philadelphia is ſeated between the rivers Delaware and Schuylkill. Its form is an oblong ſquare, being two miles in length, and one in breadth. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſtreet is in the centre of the city, and is one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirteen feet wide. Parallel to this, from north to ſouth, run twenty-three ſtreets, croſſed by nine at right angles, all of them fifty feet wide. This is its original plan, laid out by William Penn; but the inhabitants, finding it more convenient for trade, have extended the buildings north and ſouth on the river Delaware, far beyond this plan. In the midſt of the city is a public ſquare of ten acres, in the front of which ſtands the State-houſe <note n="*" place="bottom">Here the account has been conſiderably ſhortened, as has alſo that of ſeveral other places in America. The work was originally intended to have been publiſhed in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, where a minute deſcription of Philadelphia would have been very acceptable; but here ſuch deſcriptions are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be met with, and would prove unintereſting in this place. Indeed, its elegant public and private buildings, numerous humane and uſeful inſtitutions, places of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, &amp;c. erected both before and ſince the peace, would far exceed our limits to detail.</note>. The market place is the moſt convenient and beautiful of any in America,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035035_0068_0FFFF58E1818E260"/>
or perhaps in the world. It is extremely commodious, and is abundantly ſupplied with all the neceſſaries and luxuries of life. The wharves are commodious, and veſſels of five hundred tons burden can lie at them quite ſecure. The country above Philadelphia is well cultivated, and peopled with ſettlers from many Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean nations, particularly from Germany; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſecutions of that country, having formerly induced many colonies to emigrate to this land of milk and honey; and as they are very induſtrious, and the ſoil productive, they are every year enabled to export vaſt quantities of grain to all parts of the world. The population of Pennſylvania, and eſpecially of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, has had a more rapid increaſe than that of any other of the States, owing to the amazing multitudes which flock to it from Europe. Scotland and Ireland furniſh a very ample ſhare. Many of the emigrants from theſe places are <hi>redemptioners,</hi> that is, they agree with the captain in their own country for a certain ſum, to have a paſſage to America; who carries them over, and if they can find any perſon upon their land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to indemnify the captain, they agree to ſerve their new maſter for a limited time, till the money he paid for them be made up. If they cannot find any ſuch
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035035_0069_0FFFF58FA0A7ECA0"/>
themſelves, they are at the captain's diſpoſal, till he can indemnify himſelf. The inhabitants are ſober, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, and frugal, and of conſequence wealthy and ſubſtantial. As the country produces abundance of all kinds of materials and food, they have very few demands from abroad.—A Pennſylvania farmer keeps but one table, at the head of which is placed his wife and himſelf, next to them their children, and at the foot of the table their ſervants place themſelves, who all ſhare of the ſame food, and are entertained in the ſame manner as their maſter and miſtreſs. Whether or not this kind of levelling behaviour be proper, I take not upon me to determine; but certain I am, no people in the world are ſerved more faithfully, or obeyed more punctually.—The ſky is clear and ſerene: the winter continues from December to March; the froſt being often ſo ſevere as to freeze the Delaware over. In the months of July and Auguſt, the heat is ſo intenſe, that in the year 1763, twenty perſons drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped dead upon the ſtreets of Philadelphia <note n="*" place="bottom">This could only have happened by an imprudent uſe of cold water.</note>. Various kinds of fevers begin their ravages during the hot months, but vaniſh at the approach of the more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſeaſon; and the winter commonly finds and leaves the inhabitants of Pennſylvania in a ſtate of health and happineſs.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ON the eleventh of June we left Philadelphia, and without any material accident arrived at Virginia. Before our arrival, our owner had determined to ſend the veſſel with a cargo to Spain: for which purpoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing was got in readineſs, with all poſſible expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. July 9th, 1784, our ſhip's company, conſiſting of captain, mate, and ſeven men, received pay in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, at our merchant's houſe, and took a part of our cargo on board at Alexandria<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from whence we were to proceed down the river Potomak to Dumfries, and take in the remainder. Our cargo conſiſted of flour, fiſh, tar, and oil, with which we were to proceed to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz. Our ſtay at Dumfries was ſhort, as the cargo was in readineſs. Five other ſhips lay at anchor here at this time; one from France, one from Glaſgow, and the other three from England. The ſecond day after our arrival at Dumfries, I went on board the Glaſgow veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, where I ſpent ſome time very agreeably with my
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035035_0071_0FFFF594CFBAB008"/>
countrymen, who had ſome caſks of liquor for ſale, with ſeveral other articles which I ſtood in need of, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them off their hands, I gave them tobacco in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, of which I had a ſmall quantity. On the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth we went aſhore, and laid in a plentiful allowance of freſh ſtock, ſuch as pigs, turkeys, geeſe, and various kinds of poultry; and having obtained ſtores of all kinds ſufficient for our voyage, we only waited for a fair wind to proceed to ſea. In the mean time, I had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of viewing this little town.</p>
               <p>The town of Dumfries is, like many other of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican towns, ſtill in its infancy. It is delightfully ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated, at the head of Quantico creek, and the country is clear of wood, to a conſiderable diſtance from the town. In the neighbourhood are many rich planters, who ſend the greater part of their produce, to be ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at Alexandria, as the water ſcarcely ever riſes to more than ſeven feet, ſo that only ſmall boats can get up to the town; conſequently, the trade of this place is inconſiderable; their principal traffic is in fiſh, of which they take great quantities, as they have nets and wiers placed in ſuch a manner, as to make ſure of all that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the creek. They will draw their nets two or three different times during an ebb, and are always ſure of a great draught. The drum fiſh and ſturgeon are very plentiful here, as are alſo rock and perch. The noiſe of the drum fiſh to a perſon unacquainted with it, appears very ſtrange. A veſſel once arrived here from Bermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035035_0072_0FFFF597D610C5F0"/>
and after getting a pilot on board, the captain went to take a little reſt, but he had not repoſed long before a ſhoal of theſe noiſy animals aſſembled about the bottom of the veſſel, and began in their uſual method to make a drumming and thumping, which exceedingly alarmed the captain; upon which he immediately flew to the deck, with many hearty imprecations on the pilot, for letting the ſhip get a ground: nor could he be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that all was well, till he ordered one of the men to heave the lead overboard. The ſturgeon is larger than our ſalmon, and has the largeſt ſcales of any other fiſh that ever I have ſeen, every one of them being about an inch in diameter.</p>
               <p>Seven miles above this ſtands the ſeat of the great WASHINGTON, at a little diſtance from the river Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomak. It is ſeated on a riſing ground, having an eaſy deſcent to the river, and is ſurrounded by groves of trees, delightful gardens, and enchanting walks; and furniſhes a beautiful proſpect from the river. To the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the proprietor, whoſe merits command the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of a world, my ſlender tribute of praiſe can add nothing. If it be true, however, what ſome author ſays, that ſervants and near neighbours, are beſt qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give a man's real character, his will ſuffer nothing from being brought to the teſt; for <hi>General Waſhington,</hi> at the head of his army, or <hi>Preſident Waſhington</hi> at the head of the American Congreſs, never commanded the admiration of the world in a greater deg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Waſhington,</hi> on the banks of the Potomak, does the love and admiration of his neighbours and dependents. At the foot of an avenue, which leads from the houſe to the river, is erected a fort, defended by twelve pieces of braſs cannon: this during the war was manned by the general's own negroes, who had been carefully trained for the purpoſe. I ſpent a day in viewing the reſidence of this truly great man, and returned very much pleaſed, that the contrary wind had afforded me ſo good an opportunity.</p>
               <p>On the ſeventeenth, our captain's patience began to exhauſt, and he reſolved to tide it down the river. The firſt tide we made Port-Tobacco creek, at the diſtance of eighteen miles. This creek, which lies on the Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſide of the river, is ſeven miles long, and naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for ſmall veſſels to the town of Port-Tobacco, which ſtands at the head of it. Conſiderable quantities of tobacco, wheat, Indian corn, &amp;c. are annually exported from this creek, and vaſt quantities of Britiſh, French, and Dutch manufactures are imported here. On the eighteenth we had a fine breeze of wind, which brought us as far as the cliffs of Noman, and on the nineteenth we got into the bay; but on a ſudden the wind coming round, blew a hurricane, attended with thunder and lightening, and forced us to think of making for a port; and as Little-Yeockomaeo was at no great diſtance, we made for it with all expedition, and came to anchor about three o'clock. Here we lay till the twenty-firſt, when the tempeſt abating, we hove up, and ſtood down the
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035035_0074_0FFFF59D065892A0"/>
bay, in company with the Congreſs, of Philadelphia, from Baltimore to France, laden with tobacco.</p>
               <p>On the coaſt of America, this is generally the worſt month in the year, for thunder and lightening, ſudden guſts, whirlwinds, and water-ſpouts; at preſent however, appearances were favourable, and we ſtood to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with a fine breeze. We kept company with the Congreſs till the ſecond of Auguſt, when we were obliged to part, as ſhe was going more to the northward. At night it became almoſt calm, and the wind veering to the ſouth-eaſt it began to blow and rain, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with lightening, and tremendous peals of thunder. The gale increaſed, and blew violently, and before we could get our ſails taken in we loſt both our jib and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top-ſail. On the third it became more moderate, and the wind getting back to the ſouth-weſt, permitted us to purſue our courſe. The wind continued with us till the ninth, when according to our reckoning, we found ourſelves in lat. 38° north, longitude 39° weſt; but at two o'clock a man at the fore-top-maſt-head, called out <hi>land,</hi> when according to our captain's reckoning, there was no land within four hundred miles of us: upon going up the rigging, however, every one could plainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, and lucky it was that we diſcovered it in day light, as we were ſteering right upon it, and muſt have got on ſhore in the dark. This land turned out to be the Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern-Iſlands, or Azores; which lie between twenty-five and thirty-two degrees weſt longitude, and thirty ſeven
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035035_0075_0FFFF59E90BC6898"/>
and forty degrees north latitude, nine hundred miles weſt of Portugal, and as many eaſt of Newfoundland.</p>
               <p>Theſe iſlands are nine in number; viz. Santa Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, St. Meguel, or Michael, Tercera, St. George, Gracioſa, Fayal, Pico, Flores, and Corvo. They were diſcovered in 1439, by ſome Flemiſh ſhips, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Portugueſe in 1449, who took poſſeſſion of them, and have hitherto retained them. They are extremely fertile, and ſubject to a governor, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides at Angra, in Tercera; where alſo a biſhop reſides, whoſe dioceſs extends over all the iſlands, and whoſe income, which is paid in grain, amounts only to two hundred pounds per annum. On each of the iſlands there is a deputy governor, and a judge in the law depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from whoſe deciſions an appeal may be had to the general court at Tercera, and from thence to the ſupreme court at Liſbon. St. Meguel, the moſt eaſterly, is the moſt populous. In Pico, there is a remarkable promontoray, or peak, which in clear weather, may be diſcerned one hundred miles diſtant at ſea. The natives, like the Iriſh, have an opinion, that no ſerpent or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emous animal will live in any of theſe iſlands, but will expire immediately upon their being landed. One tenth of all the productions of the Azores belong to the crown, and the article of tobacco, which is monopolized by it, brings a very conſiderable revenue. From eighteen to twenty thouſand pipes of the wine called <hi>Fayal,</hi> is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually made in the iſland of Pico, which is the largeſt
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035035_0076_0FFFF5A32203A058"/>
of all theſe iſlands; every pipe of which, when ſold on the ſpot, will bring the proprietor ſeven pounds ſterling. The Azores are bleſſed with a ſalubrious air, though the violent earthquakes, which frequently happen, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them but an unpleaſant reſidence.</p>
               <p>Leaving theſe iſlands, we held on our courſe without interruption till the twelfth, when we diſcovered a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtanding after us, and crowding all the ſail ſhe could to come up. The captain propoſed lying too for her, but all hands oppoſing the meaſure, we crowded all the ſail we could, and altering our courſe, we perceived that ſhe followed our example: we ſuſpected her to be a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and the ſequel proved we were not miſtaken. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four o'clock a breeze ſprung up, and our ſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very ſwift ſailer, we ſoon loſt ſight of her. On the fourteenth we ſpoke with the Antonia, a Spaniſh frigate of thirty-ſix guns, to whom we mentioned this cutter, who told us, he would uſe every endeavour to come up to her. Nothing material happened till the twenty-ſeventh, when we got in ſight of the land, to the eaſtward of Cadiz, and though we came up to the light houſe that evening, we did not chooſe to venture in till day light. Accordingly, on the morning of the twenty-eighth, we came to anchor in the bay, but were obliged to perform quarantine till the firſt of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, then we weighed and came to anchor again off the pier-end; when the captain went aſhore, and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the governor, upon oath, the circumſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035035_0077_0FFFF5A5B4D2C420"/>
pirate being in thoſe ſeas. Several ſhips of war were ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the harbour ready for a cruize, four of which were immediately ordered out in queſt of her. Another veſſel arrived the ſame evening with intelligence, that they had ſeen her likewiſe, and had been ſo near her as to diſcover that ſhe carried eighteen guns; but they had likewiſe outſailed her. The ſquadron ordered out, ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed next morning.</p>
               <p>September the third, we began to unload our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, and continued to diſcharge till the ſeventh, when our merchant ordered us to ſtop for a few days from unloading our fiſh, as he expected in a little time a much better price for them, the ſuperſtition of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards rendering it an article of general uſe. On the tenth, a ſignal for a fleet was made from the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe: they ſoon reached the harbour, and proved to be the four veſſels, ordered out in queſt of the pirate, with their prize along with them, in a very ſhattered condition. They had fallen in with her on the ſixth, and upon ſeeing them, ſhe had made all the ſail ſhe could to get away, but they had given chaſe and come up with her. When they hailed her, to know from whence ſhe came, ſhe told them ſhe came from Leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, and was bound to Dunkirk. When the evening came on, they ordered her to keep cloſe by them during the night, which ſhe promiſed to do; but notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe made ſeveral attempts to give them the ſlip. In the morning, when they found it impoſſible to get
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035035_0078_0FFFF5A742A75628"/>
away, they grew deſperate; and when the commodore ordered their captain on board, he flatly refuſed, and told him, he would never ſurrender ſo long as he had a man able to fire a gun. A ſmart engagement enſued, in which the captain, mate, and ſeveral of the men, had paid for their obſtinacy with the forfeit of their lives. They were at laſt obliged to ſtrike, and the ſurvivers ordered on board the commodore, who gave the following account of themſelves, viz. That they belonged to Dunkirk, and having been unſucceſsful by privateering during the war, they had determined at the cloſe of it, to try their fortunes in this manner. They had ſailed from Dunkirk in April 1783, and had been till then cruiſing in the Spaniſh main, and taken ſome prizes; but before they left thoſe ſeas, they thought proper to ſail towards the weſtern iſles, and try their fortune a little longer; after which they were to ſail for the north of Scotland, and run the veſſel aſhore. It likewiſe appeared that theſe deſperadoes had taken ſome rich Portugueſe veſſels from the Brazils, which they had plundered and ſunk, putting their crews to death. No fewer than ten veſſels, according to their own accounts, had fallen into their hands. When they left Dunkirk, they had on board one hundred and fifty men, commanded by a captain Dodd, a man about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſix years of age, who was born in Guernſey; and the mate, they ſaid, was a native of Ireland. Such was the account the priſoners gave of themſelves. Ten of them ſuppoſed to be officers, were ſent to Madrid, to
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035035_0079_0FFFF5A8CADE9BA8"/>
receive the reward of their demerits, and the reſt, ſixty in number, to the galleys. Upon ſearching the veſſel, goods and money were found to a vaſt amount.</p>
               <p>On the thirteenth, our captain and four of us went aſhore, and as the captain had buſineſs, that we knew would detain him ſome time, we agreed to go and ſee the faſhionable amuſement of Spain, a <hi>bull-fight,</hi> having heard there was to be a great entertainment of that kind, that ſame day. The place appropriated to this purpoſe, ſtands at the outſide of the town, and is of a circular form, and ſeated all round for the accommodation of the ſpectators. The charge at entrance depends upon the ſeat, and like our theatres, the ſeats are accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the different ranks, for at this <hi>polite</hi> amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all ranks attend. We paid a piſtreen each, (about eleven-pence ſterl.) and took our ſeats accordingly. On theſe occaſions, a young cavalier has it in his power to recommend himſelf to his miſtreſs by his proweſs and ſkill. In Britain, a man recommends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the number of females he has ruined; but in Spain he recommends himſelf to his miſtreſs, by the number of bulls he has killed. A young Spaniard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the object of female notice, in proportion to the number and fierceneſs of the animals he has conquered; and is honoured, proclaimed, and rewarded accordingly. Previous to the combat, ſome pains and time are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to adjuſt the weapons, and the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting it. The two-legged combatants take their
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035035_0080_0FFFF5AD61831A00"/>
ſeats in the centre, and with ſeeming eaſe, loll on a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and drink a glaſs of wine and ſugar; the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druped is led to the door, and immediately let looſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. They are generally prepared with darts, which if the bull ſeems of a tame diſpoſition, they ſtick in his ſides to rouſe him up, and enrage him to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt pitch; and having gained this point, they mount their horſes or mules, armed with ſwords or ſpears, and the battle begins. One bull frequently kills two or three horſes, and wounds the rider in a ſhocking man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; if he has agility enough he can prevent this, by getting into a hole made for the purpoſe, and while the bull is in purſuit of one cavalier another combatant attacks him behind, to divert him from his object, and makes him face about. In this manner the combat is conducted, till ſome cavalier more lucky than the reſt, puts him to death, and receives the plaudits and accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of the ſpectators: after which the bull is carried to the market, and ſold at a cheap rate to the poor; and as that claſs of men are very numerous over all Spain, they are ſure to find plenty of cuſtomers. This is an amuſement which a Spaniard doats upon, and I believe there is not a town of any note in all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where there is not a houſe or ſquare ſet apart for the purpoſe: Even in the moſt inſignificant villages, the inhabitants will enter into clubs, to procure an ox or bull, and fight them mounted upon aſſes, when a horſe cannot be got: or rather than want the diverſion, they will venture on foot. Their general fondneſs for this
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:035035_0081_0FFFF5AFEE21B910"/>
amuſement, can only be accounted for from a cauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, namely, procuring them a recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the other ſex; for a ſpirit of gallantry pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails much among them, and it is diſplayed in a more quixotical manner than in any other nation in Europe.</p>
               <p>The Iſland of Cadiz is about eighteen miles long, and nine broad at the one part of it; though it does not exceed one where the town ſtands. Two forts guard the paſſage into the harbour, the one called Puntal, and the other Malagorda. The town is ſaid to have been firſt built by the Phoenicians, and to have been afterwards poſſeſſed by the Romans. Some Roman antiquities are ſtill to be ſeen on the iſland. It is a biſhop's ſee, and has a communication with the continent by means of a bridge. The bay is twelve miles in length, and ſix in breadth. All the Spaniſh veſſels in the Weſt India or American trade reſort to this port, as alſo all trading veſſels from every country in Europe. Though the town is rich, handſome, and populous, the country part of the iſland is extremely barren. There is not a drop of freſh water to be ſound on it, nor any thing like agriculture to be ſeen. An Iriſh gentleman, who was at this time governor, had excited a ſpirit of emulation in garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He had got a piece of ground walled in, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected manure to enrich it, and planted herbs, flowers, and fruit trees, which in a ſhort ſpace of time, had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at great perfection. In the year 1778, he began his work, and in the year 1782, he had a conſiderable
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035035_0082_0FFFF5B1779E24D8"/>
produce of grapes, and other kinds of fruit; and in the year 1783, he had oranges in abundance. The gentlemen upon the iſland, fired by his example, began every one to encloſe a ſpot of ground, who could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it; and this year, there was not leſs than twenty gardens in the neighbourhood of the town, all in great forwardneſs. Water is here a very ſcarce, and ſometimes a very coſtly article. It is all brought from the continent in boats, and the Levant winds frequently prevent them from paſſing for a conſiderable time. The town ſtands on the weſt end of the iſland. The ſtreets are ſo narrow, that two wheeled carriages can with difficulty paſs each other in the broadeſt of them; and till the preſent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor came upon the iſland, they were always kept ſhamefully dirty. The town is ſurrounded by a wall, which is at the loweſt parts of it twenty feet high, and in ſome places almoſt forty; the thickneſs of it, two thirds of the circumference, is from thirty to forty feet, and it is one entire battery. The pier is about two thouſand feet long, all built with large ſquare ſtones, and is about thirty feet wide. Here lie all the guard-ſhips and boats, the ſmall craft that trade to the coaſt of Barbary and the Mediterranean. In the wall are only two gates, by one of which people enter into the town, and by the other go out. Upon enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, officers appointed for the purpoſe ſtrictly ſearch them, if ſtrangers, for prohibited goods; and as no one is allowed to take Spaniſh money out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, people diſpoſing of their goods here, muſt either
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035035_0083_0FFFF5B305798CE0"/>
take goods in return, or bills of exchange. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place is a large ſquare, tolerably ſupplied with beef, mutton, and veniſon, none of them of the beſt quality; but they have fiſh and poultry in the greateſt perfection. The inhabitants of Cadiz are a ſtrange mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of French, Portugueſe, Italians and Moors, Iriſh adventurers and Engliſh ſmugglers. Pride, lazineſs, and filth, are their characteriſticks. They have much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſanctity, and on ſome occaſions are very devout. Here are ſeven churches, one of which has been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of fifty years in building, and is not yet near finiſhed; it is of an octagonal form, and is about ſixty feet high, all built of a kind of marble. Upwards of five hundred clergymen, of different denominations, are in this town, many of them mendicant friars, who are more troubleſome to ſtrangers, than our ſtreet beggars in England. I was one day accoſted in Engliſh by a man well advanced in years, and upon entering into converſation with him, he told me he was a native of Leith, in Scotland; that at an early period of life he had come to Cadiz, in the capacity of a common ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor; and that an old lady had taken a fancy to him, and found means to ſignify her wiſhes. That he had been induced to become Roman Catholic, and marry her; and that ſhe had left him in excellent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I obſerved to him, that I had no objections to any part of his conduct but the change of his religion. "As to the matter of that, ſays he, I give myſelf no manner of trouble. I had made but ſmall proficiency in
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035035_0084_0FFFF5B5A5373CA8"/>
any religion when I came to this country, and had but little to renounce; and ſo far as I can yet judge, two hundred per annum, which I received by my marriage, will make up for the difference between the two reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions." As I found we ſhould not agree in our ſentiments about religion, I wiſhed him good morning, and we parted.</p>
               <p>September twentieth, our cargo being diſcharged, we began to prepare for ſea; and taking in ſome ſalt for ballaſt, with ſome boxes of ſilk, and a few pipes of wine, we ſet ſail on the 10th of October for the iſland of Teneriffe, where we were to take in the reſt of our cargo. But a dead calm prevented us from proceeding farther than the mouth of the harbour that evening. About three o'clock next morning, however, a gale ſprung up, when we weighed anchor and ſtood on our courſe. At five o'clock, Cadiz light-houſe bearing N. E. diſtant about three leagues, we diſcovered a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to windward lying too; who upon ſeeing us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to crowd all her ſail and come down upon us. The captain had heard before we left Cadiz, of an Engliſh ſhip lying off the harbour, and taking it for granted that this muſt be her, he made not the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt effort to get out of her way; on the contrary, as he had ſome particular meſſage to ſend to England, he rather waited for her coming down. The ſun was riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and as ſhe was in a line between us and the eaſt, we could not make out her colours, till coming within
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035035_0085_0FFFF5BA447B85A0"/>
gun-ſhot, we received two ſhots from her, and could plainly perceive Turkiſh colours. We all inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our captain to run, but by ſome ſtrange infatuation, he delayed it till we were totally in her power. We were ordered to hoiſt out the boat and go on board of her, which, though much againſt our wills, the captain, three other men, and myſelf, were obliged to do; and no ſooner had we ſet our foot on board, than the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain declared our ſhip a prize, and ourſelves priſoners of war. We now, to our ſorrowful experience, found ourſelves in the power of a maſter, from whom we had nothing like mercy to expect. Slavery for life was all we could promiſe ourſelves, and death alone could ſet us free. With ſuch proſpects before us, my reader will eaſily imagine, that this day, and many that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, were miſerable in the extreme.—As the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of our captivity will take many pages to relate it, I ſhall reſerve it for another chapter.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WE were now in the hands of ſavages, belonging to a country where mercy was never ſhewn to Chriſtians—doomed to we knew not what—to ſuffer, perhaps, immediate death—to be reſerved for the moſt debaſing ſpecies of ſlavery—to drag out a life of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried miſery, far from our own country, where our friends could never more receive intelligence of our being in the land of the living. Alas! conjecture was vain; we dreaded the worſt that could poſſibly befall us, and the rapid ſucceſſion of diſmal apprehenſions brought with it laſt complete ſtupefaction.</p>
               <p>They placed us upon the breaſt of the quarter deck, giving a negro the charge of watching us, while our captain, along with twelve of their men, went on
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035035_0087_0FFFF5BF95854ED0"/>
board of our veſſel. They ſoon returned, bringing along with them our two mates: the reſt of our men they left on board the prize to navigate her, for the conducting of a brig was what they were unacquainted with themſelves, that being rather beyond the abilities of a Moor; and after giving ſtrict charge to the prize to keep company with us, they ſet ſail for the coaſt of Barbary. Soon after, the boatſwain, or countermaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (as the word in their language ſignifies) along with two others, came up to us, and diveſted us not only of every thing that was in our pockets, but of the pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets themſelves. They ſtript us of all our cloaths that were good for any thing, and as the operation was laſt performed on me, I had reaſon to be convinced, that no ſituation is ſo dreadful, that the proſpect of immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate death will not add to its horrors; for juſt as they had ſtripped off my handerchief from my neck, a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of Herculean appearance, and a terrible counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, came upon deck with a hatchet in his hand, and ſtood for ſome time eyeing us with the moſt <hi>Jack-Ketch</hi> like face I ever beheld in my life; and bad as my ſituation was, I confeſs I never felt greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, than when I ſaw him, inſtead of applying his hatchet to our necks, take up a log of wood to ſplit it for fuel. After we had got time to ruminate on our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy condition for about the ſpace of an hour, the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain accoſted us, and talked to us for ſome time in his own language, which we neither underſtood nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to; at laſt the boatſwain beckoned us to follow
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035035_0088_0FFFF5C221173CB8"/>
him, and taking us to his own apartment, preſented us with oil-olives and bread, neither of which could we taſte; we were too full of grief to think of any kind of food, and the boatſwain having left us, we threw our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the floor, and in the moſt ſorrowful accents bewailed our wretched condition.</p>
               <p>Nature at laſt became exhauſted, and all of us ſunk down to ſleep. This happy interval of care laſted till morning, when we awoke, and found ourſelves in a moſt ſhocking ſituation, being all covered over with vermin; but as the Turks had not left them many cloaths to take ſhelter in, we ſoon diſengaged ourſelves from ſuch diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable companions, and went upon deck. We were anxious to ſee if our own veſſel was ſtill in company, but ſoon found ſhe was not in ſight. We were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely impatient to know what was become of her, but could not fall upon any method of receiving infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, nor durſt we ſhew any anxiety about her, as we imagined our men, who were left on board of her, had been too many for the Moors, and carried her off to ſome other port, and we dreaded the conſequences that might reſult to ourſelves. At all rates we gave up the hopes of ſeeing our companions again, and could not but regret the unlucky fate, that ſingled us out of all the ſhip's company for ſlavery, whilſt they, as we conjectured, were enjoying the ſweets of liberty. The call of hunger is irreſiſtible, and now we began to feel it make powerful demands. We had taſted nothing
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:035035_0089_0FFFF5C3A7CBC268"/>
from the time we came on board; the boatſwain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acroſs us, we made ſigns to him for ſomething to eat; he ſet down the bread and oil-olives we had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly refuſed, and I never remember to have made a more ſatiſfactory meal on roaſt beef and plumb pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, though it was the firſt time any of us had fed on ſuch fare. Soon after the captain called us all on deck, and taking our mate by the hand, led him to the helm, and made a ſignal for him to ſteer. After he had been at the helm about ten minutes, he made another take it, and ſo on till he had tried us all. Finding us all better qualified than his own men, he gave us the charge of the helm, and became very kind to us, every now and then offering us food and tobacco. We ſoon began to think our ſituation was not ſo deſperate as we had at firſt imagined, and by degrees became ſomewhat better reconciled to our fate.</p>
               <p>On the fourteenth we made the Barbary coaſt, to the ſouthward of Salee, and ſtanding to the northward all that day, we came up to the port of Larache, to which port we were bound. We were obliged to come to anchor, as no veſſel can enter this port but upon one tack, it being exceedingly narrow, and the entry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. On the ſixteenth, however, we got into port, not without ſome danger of the ſhip's being daſhed to pieces by the unſkilful management of the Mooriſh ſailors. As ſoon as we came to anchor, the captain and ſome of the other officers went aſhore. Two of our
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035035_0090_0FFFF5C63935A910"/>
number projected a ſcheme of running away with the boat, which we might eaſily have accompliſhed, but for the ſecond mate, who had a brother on board the prize, and as we did not know for certain that ſhe had got clear of the enemy, the mate reſolved at all events to ſtay and ſhare his fate. The ſucceſs he ſaid was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ſhould we ſucceed, he dreaded that his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's life might pay the forfeit. As we could not bring him to our mind, therefore, we reſolved unanimouſly to ſubmit to our fate, whatever it might be, with fortitude. The port of Larache is ſituated in north lat. 35° longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 7° weſt of London. When we entered the port, we were ſaluted by a fort with nine guns, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment was returned with ſix. The entrance into this port is extremely narrow, inſomuch that two ſhips can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſs each other. On the one ſide is a low point or neck of land, which forms a ſemi circle, in which is a baſon or harbour, which perhaps might contain one hundred ſail of ſhips, though there are ſeldom in it at one time above five or ſix, which, together with two which conſtantly lie at Mogodore, form the whole of the Mooriſh navy, and excepting one veſſel which mounts twenty-ſix guns, not one of them carry more than ſixteen. The town of Larache is defended by this ſmall battery of nine guns, already mentioned. It is of a ſquare form, with a wall round it, having two gates in each ſquare</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="unknown:035035_0091_0FFFF5CA00316870"/>On the nineteenth in the morning, we were put into the boat and ordered to go on ſhore. As ſoon as we were got ſeated in the boat, the ſhip fired all her guns, and when we reached the ſhore, we found the governor, with all the officers and ſoldiers of the fort, ready to receive us. They were in number about ſix hundred, all under arms. The governor and officers were all mounted on fine Arabian horſes, and led the van in a kind of proceſſion, which was immediately begun. The crews of the ſhips which were in the harbour, formed a circle round us. They were again ſurrounded by the military. If we ſeemed objects of wonder to them, they were no leſs ſo to us. For what purpoſe we were thus guarded, we could by no means conjecture. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 100 yards we marched ſlowly on, the multitude in a kind of muſical tone crying out, <hi>Laca laca la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e fide Mahomed;</hi> or, "Long live king Mahomed." Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this we made a full ſtop, when they opened the ranks, and twelve men with loaded muſkets in their hands, pointed to our faces, came running up to us with an intention, as we imagined, to blow out our brains; when they came within two yards of us, they lowered their pieces, pointing them to the ground, and fired them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the eaſt, and in a very devout manner offered up ejaculatory prayers. They led us all round the town, making a full ſtop, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:035035_0092_0FFFF5CC8E7C1970"/>
at each of the gates, till we arrived at the gate we ſet out from, when the ſoldiers opening to the right and left, lined on each ſide the paſſage to the governor's houſe, and we were marched up between the ranks till we came to the governor, who with ſeveral other great men, was ſtanding in the outer court, before his own door. He ſat down when we approached him, croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legged, as the Mooriſh cuſtom is, having only a kind of mat or ſopha ſpread underneath him; and an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being called, he, with great dignity in his manner, began to queſtion us; and as we did not know but he was going to paſs ſentence of death upon us immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, we made rather an aukward appearance. The following dialogue paſſed between us. Of what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are you? We anſwered from America. What kind of a country is America? A woody country. What is your religion? but I ſuppoſe you worſhip the trees. We anſwered we were Chriſtians. Are you connected with England? Our country is principally peopled from thence. Is the king of England your king? No, but he lately was. Why is he not now? He now gives us leave to govern ourſelves. How do you like this country? It is a very good country. Will you embrace our religion, and prevent yourſelves from being ſlaves? We are not yet acquainted with it. After putting a number of ſimilar queſtions, he aſked us, If we would eat any thing? We told him we were very hungry; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he ordered each of us a piece of bread, and riſing with great ſtatelineſs, walked into the houſe.
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035035_0093_0FFFF5CE17646740"/>
Immediately we were led to a jail, with the portion of bread aſſigned us in our hands, and here, if we had no other comfort, we had at leaſt the uninterrupted ſociety of one another. The jail in which we were lodged was dark, dirty, and every way uncomfortable. We did not ſee a human face till late in the evening of the day in which we entered it, when a man made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, bringing us a diſh in great eſtimation in that country, called <hi>cuſcoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> It is made of flour, wet in the manner we do it to make bread; after which they rub it between their hands, till it forms itſelf into ſmall portions like barley corns, they afterwards ſpread it on the bottom of a pot, made on purpoſe with holes in it. Underneath it they flew a fowl, mutton, or beef, with onions, pepper, ſalt, and a pumpkin, the ſteam of which gives a nice reliſh to the ſmall particles above, and make them very delicious. They were delicious at this time, to us all at leaſt, and we made a very comfortable meal; after which the keeper took away the diſhes, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully locked the door. We then began to look about for beds, but nothing of that kind being to be found, we ſtretched ourſelves on the cold ſtones, and ſlept as well as our cares would let us. Next morning a man entered with a cake for each of us, and a ſmall portion of butter and honey, which he ſet down and diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We made an excellent breakfaſt of this delicious fare, not without thanking Providence, that our treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hitherto had ſo much exceeded our expectations. At noon the ſame perſon entered the priſon with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:035035_0094_0FFFAE7BCD5AC320"/>
diſh of cuſcoſoo, and placing it upon the floor, withdrew to the door. We had never ſeen either a knife or ſpoon, and when he was gone, we began to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout for a piece of wood to make ſomething to anſwer our purpoſe as a ſubſtitute. We began to ſplit it, when the jailor appeared and made ſignals for us to eat our victuals. We gave him to know what we wanted. He took up the diſh, and gathering up a handful, threw it into his mouth, giving us to underſtand that this was the method of eating it. We could by no means reconcile ourſelves to this method, and with a great degree of obſtinacy, more than prudence, perſiſted in preparing our wooden ſpoons, upon which he ordered our provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be taken away, and we neither received any more viſits from him, nor any more food during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of that day.</p>
               <p>Next morning, after paſſing a night of complete mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, we received from a beautiful young woman, a viſit upon ſpiritual buſineſs. She was, it ſeems one of the ſaints, or enthuſiaſts of that country, who had given up the pleaſures of the preſent world, with a view of preparing herſelf and others, for the enjoyments of the next. She had in her hands a piece of bread, which when ſhe had ſpit upon ſhe divided among us, and we were very glad to ſee it, and devoured it greedily. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhe wet her fingers with her ſpittle, and rubbed our temples, frequently breathing upon us as ſhe did it. She had brought a negro as an interpreter, who told us,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:035035_0095_0FFFF5D22F4541E0"/>
ſhe wanted to make us proſelytes to the religion of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and that all the geſtures and abſurdities ſhe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, were done with this view. She made him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe us great honour and preferment, both in this world and the next, if we would acknowledge and embrace the religion of the prophet; but finding us obſtinately determined to adhere to our own faith, ſhe gave us up for loſt, and went away greatly diſappointed. During all this day we got nothing to eat, we had indeed plenty of tar water, and that was all our drink. Next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man coming in, brought us each a ſmall cake, not much larger than a ſea-biſcuit, and left about a farthing's worth of tobacco, to be divided amongſt us. Night came on without bringing us any more viſits or victuals; and next morning the ſame man entered, bringing us the ſame quantity of bread, and at the ſame time gave to underſtand this was to be our daily allowance. We had the liberty of five rooms, and in one of them, we had with chalk, made an imitation of a chequer-board, on the floor, and cutting ſome corks into ſmall pieces, amuſed ourſelves in the beſt manner we could, by play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this game.</p>
               <p>This morning we agreed to reſerve the half of our cakes till the evening, and left them behind when we went to our game. Whilſt we were amuſing ourſelves with this diverſion in another room, the guard, who had us in charge, came into the one which we had left, and made off with the remainder of our cakes, which
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:035035_0096_0FFFF5D6EF2342C0"/>
we had preſerved for our evening's repaſt. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was a miſerable day with us, and to add to our grief, we had to ſuffer cold in the extreme, for it was now the moſt inclement ſeaſon of the year, and as I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved, we had been ſtript of all our cloathing that was worth taking. The little we had left was all over vermin, and next morning we were obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the water that was brought us to drink to waſh our ſhirts: after which we cut off our hair to prevent them from finding ſhelter among it, ſo that the figure we cut was truly ridiculous. On the twenty-fifth our ſecond mate, who was naturally of a very happy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>gan to ſing, and all the reſt of us fell to dancing. This brought a great aſſemblage of Moors to ſee us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Our woe-worn faces excited compaſſion in ſome, who brought us bread <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> tobacco. We tried the ſame experiment for ſome days with the ſame ſucceſs, but they ſoon became accuſtomed to it, and by its looſing the charm of novelty, it ceaſed to produce any good effects.</p>
               <p>Thus we were obliged to drag out a miſerable exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence till the twenty-ninth of November, when the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor gave orders to have us taken out to get a little freſh air, and this day, for the firſt time, we received accounts of the reſt of our crew. A caravan had juſt arrived from Tangiers, and one of the men who guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, came to us, and in broken Engliſh began a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, in the courſe of which we learnt, that the
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035035_0097_0FFFF5D98553F3E0"/>
prize had been carried in there ſometime before, that the reſt of the crew were all to be ſent here in a few weeks, when we were to go to Morocco, and be kept priſoners, till the United States ſhould ſend over an ambaſſador to make a treaty of alliance with the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. The only comfort we derived from this intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, was the hope of ſeeing our companions: as to gaining our liberty, the proſpect was as diſtant as ever, for it was uncertain when the Congreſs would ſend an ambaſſador to Barbary, or whether one might ever be ſent. Patience is a cure for all diſtempers, to this, therefore, we were forced to have recourſe, and leave the event to the Supreme Diſpoſer of all.</p>
               <p>On the twelfth of December, the ſame female devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, who had viſited us before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gain made her appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, bringing with her two others of her own ſex, and the ſame negro interpreter. She began to anoint our temples in the ſame manner as before. They then buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted us with their hands, and each of them pulling out a ſhort dagger, threatened as if they meant to ſtab us, and, at every interval, made the negro aſk us, if we were yet willing to embrace the religion of Mahomet. When they found their threats ineffectual, they began to coax, flatter, and promiſe, and made uſe of every argument they could ſuggeſt, with as much earneſtneſs as if their own ſalvation had depended on their ſucceſs. They told us, if we complied, we would immediately be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to liberty, that we would be advanced to honour and
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035035_0098_0FFFF5DB0D6F9EF8"/>
dignity in the country, and receive from the hands of the emperor, the moſt beautiful wives. This laſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they repeated ſo earneſtly and ſo often, as convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us, they thought it one of the greateſt bleſſings that could be conferred. Finding us obſtinate, they left us to our own meditations.</p>
               <p>The next day a meſſage was ſent to me from the captain who had taken us priſoners, to go to his houſe. He had, it ſeems, laid up his veſſel for the winter, and as he expected to go to Morocco, he wanted to have ſome tents in readineſs, to ſhelter him and his men du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> long and tireſome journey. The reaſon of my being ſent for, was, that I might give him ſome aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in finiſhing them, having obſerved me when at ſea, ſewing ſails with more dexterity than his own men. I was obliged to obey the order, not without ſome apprehenſions, as I was not made acquainted with his intentions till I went to the houſe. When I arrived I was obliged to ſtop in an outer court, till they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized him of my coming, and got the women all put out of the way; for they will not ſuffer them either to ſee Chriſtians, or be ſeen by them. I was at length permitted to enter, when the captain, who was an old man, received me with a ſmiling countenance, ſitting upon a ſtraw matraſs. He aſked me in Spaniſh, to ſit down. I knew a little of that language, and was glad to hear him ſpeak it. He then told me the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he wanted me to perform; and accordingly I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:035035_0158_100019B5CEFDEBD0"/>
upon my taſk immediately. I had not been long at work, when the captain ſent me a diſh of maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roone and milk, and after I had finiſhed my day's la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, he again ſent me two cakes to carry with me to the jail. Theſe I accepted with a joyful heart, happy to be the inſtrument of a ſmall relief to my fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferers. On the twentieth of December our work was finiſhed, and I was remanded back to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-ſecond, we were allowed to take an airing on a riſing ground between the town and the ſea, where we had a moſt delightful proſpect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> both. In a little time we perceived two veſſels crowding all the ſail they could, the one flying and the other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, and heard the report of ſeveral guns. Next day we learned from ſome fiſhermen, that they were a Spaniſh merchantman and an Algerine cruiſer; that the latter had been for two days in chace of the former, but that a breeze of wind had luckily ſprung up, and enabled her to make her eſcape. In our return to our priſon, we were met by the governor, who aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us by an interpreter, how we liked his country, and that if it was not the beſt we had ever ſeen? We told him we liked it much; though our hearts gave the lie to our tongues, for in our ſituation, paradiſe itſelf would have been diſagreeable. He deſired us to make ourſelves as happy as we could, and ſaid he hoped all would be well. We returned to our priſon, and in a
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:035035_0099_100019C7D44FDC10"/>
ſhort time the governor ſent us about one pound of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, which was a very acceptable preſent, as our ſcanty allowance of food required ſuch a ſubſtitute. In this country, acorns and nuts of all kinds are very plentiful, and extremely large, and for ſome days we had a ſlender relief from the children, who threw hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of theſe in at our windows, and entertained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſeeing us ſcramble for them in a very raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner. Had we not been ſupported by good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and ſtout hearts, we muſt inevitably have ſunk under the extreme cold and hunger we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to undergo, for all the cloathing we could muſter among ſix of us, was not ſuffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>t for the comfort of two; but we danced to keep ourſelves warm, we chewed tobacco to allay our hunger, and we comforted ourſelves with the reflection, that whatever might be our future fate, we could not well be worſe.</p>
               <p>On the twentieth of January, we were informed, that our meſſmates were on their way from Tangiers to join us, and that we were all to be ſent off to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco, by a caravan, which was ſoon to leave this place. The thoughts of this journey almoſt diſtracted us. At this ſeaſon of the year it blows the moſt dreadful hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes in Barbary, attended with thunder, lightning, and rain; and accoutred as we were, it was likely to be a very uncomfortable journey, through a deſert country, without the conveniency of an inn to reſt or refreſh at.
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:035035_0100_1000196323DE9630"/>
We caſt many a wiſhful look towards the ſhore, never expecting after our removal to ſee it again.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-fifth we were made happy by the ſight of the captain and the reſt of the crew, and whilſt we were recounting to one another the hardſhips we had undergone ſince we parted, an order was ſent for us to appear before the governor. He deſired us to hold ourſelves in readineſs, for next morning the cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van was to ſet out for Morocco, and we muſt go along with it. We returned to our priſon; but as horſes and mules could not be got in the morning, we were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to put off our journey to another day. During this day our captain wrote a letter to the American conſul at Cadiz, which all of us ſigned, acquainting him with our captivity, and preſent circumſtances and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects; and requeſting him to apply to the Congreſs, to take meaſures in our behalf. The conſul, whoſe name was Mr. Harriſon, was part owner of our brig, and upon receiving our letter, he took the readieſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of relieving our neceſſities, by ſending fifty dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; which the captain afterwards receiving, applied it to his own purpoſes, without giving us any ſhare of it; a conduct which was the more unpardonable, as his folly had been the original cauſe of all our misfortunes.</p>
               <p>On the morning of the twenty-ſeventh, at an early hour, a vaſt concourſe of men and women, horſes and mules, were aſſembled in the ſtreet, oppoſite to our
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:035035_0101_100019694F25CAD8"/>
place of confinement. The governor, the captain of the ſhip which had captured us, with ſeveral officers of inferior rank, came into the priſon, and aſked us what we thought of an excurſion through the country as far as Morocco; and without waiting for an anſwer, they ordered us out, and mounted us upon camels, when our march began for the city of Morocco, and we bade adieu to Larache, with hearts full of anxiety and grief.</p>
               <p>The caravan conſiſted of about two hundred horſe-guards, ſeventy camels, and thirty mules. The firſt day we travelled about twenty miles, when we came to a valley called Zedith, and pitched our tents for the night. The form of our encampment was this: The grand baſhaw, who commanded in chief, pitched his tent in the middle, and all the other tents, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thirty, were pitched in a circle round him, at a little diſtance. The proviſions, baggage, &amp;c. were brought into the centre, and the cattle let looſe to feed. One half of the ſoldiers mounted guard, and during the night patrolled round the tents, calling out every now and then in their own language, "All is well." About four o'clock next morning, we ſtruck our tents, and were ready by five to continue our march, which we did till about ten, when coming to a ſpring of water, (an invaluable luxury in this country) we ſtopped to refreſh ourſelves and horſes. After we had received our ſmall portion of bread, which was ſoon diſpatched, we began to look out for ſome wild fruit. About one
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:035035_0102_1000196B009D3618"/>
hundred yards from the road, we eſpied a little grove, and two of the ſoldiers accompanying us, we found it produce grapes, pomegranates, figs, and oranges, but only the laſt were ripe. We took as many along with us as we could carry, and found them of infinite ſervice to us upon the road. Joining the calvacade, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued our march, and that night halted at a place called <hi>Moſſata,</hi> which is named after a ſaint of that name, who lived and was murdered here, as it is ſaid, and to whoſe memory a tomb is erected. Next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſtarted at the uſual hour, and travelled through a delightful country, exceeded perhaps by no part of the globe. At every little interval we paſſed a grove, where all ſorts of delicious fruits grew wild, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us to taſte; and cattle, ſheep and horſes were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered all over the plains. This evening we pitched our tents by the ſide of a wood: we did not ſtart next morning till ſeven o'clock, and by twelve we reached Mamora, a ſmall town, one hundred and fifty miles north of Salee, conſiſting of about one hundred houſes, and defended by a ſmall fort of ſix guns. Paſſing this place, we arrived about ſix in the evening at Zeriff, a river which takes its riſe in the kingdom of Fez, and empties itſelf into the weſtern ocean. The banks of this river abounding with all ſorts of ferocious animals, ſuch as lions, tygers, leopards, and wolves, it was judged improper to form an encampment here, on account of ſuch dangerous neighbours; we therefore marched on five miles farther, till we came to a ſmall plain, where
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:035035_0103_1000196EE9EEE8B8"/>
we pitched our tents till next morning. At nine o'clock, we again ſet out, and about ten came to a place called Fedela, where the foundation of a fortreſs was laid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſince by Sidi Mahomed the reigning emperor, but on account of a war breaking out between him and his ſon, it never was finiſhed. We travelled on till five in the evening, when we came to the only freſh water lake in all that country. Its water has a taſte ſomewhat like our Engliſh Spa-waters, owing to the vaſt quantities of ſalt-petre, with which the country abounds. It is only about a mile and a half in circumference, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with a variety of fiſh. We had ſeen many large flocks of ſheep in our journey, but I never in all that country ſaw a ſhepherd, but upon the ſide of this lake. Here, however, they think their flocks worth the tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and their mode of living deviates as little from the original ſimplicity of nature, as the manners of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds in the patriarchal ages.</p>
               <p>On the morning of the thirty-firſt, being heartily ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of riding on the camels, we obtained leave of our guards to walk for ſometime, and entertained ourſelves running after the amazing ſwarms of rats, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread all the country. Their numbers are incredible, and one reaſon for their amazing increaſe may be the mode of thraſhing corn practiſed here. After it is out down and bound into ſheaves, they let it ſtand for a few days, after which they lay down the ſheaves in a circular form, in the field where it grows, and tying two horſes
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:035035_0104_1000197195EDD888"/>
together, lead them round and round, till they tread the grain totally from the ſtalk; after which they dig a pit, into which they throw the grain, which owing to the dryneſs of the ſoil, is ſafely preſerved till they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to take it up. The rats therefore can find food in every field, and conſequently reſort but little to the habitation of man. We frequently met them in large bodies, ſome of them of an enormous ſize. They ſtood ſurveying as with great compoſure, ſhewing as little dread of us, as we did of them. When their reſources fail in one field, they will travel in thouſands to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for like the inhabitants of the country, they are every where at home where grain is to be had.—At five o'clock this evening we arrived at a valley, called Kora, where finding water, we filled our pitchers, and got each a large ſupply of excellent fruit, and after travelling ſeven miles further, we pitched our tents. Next day we travelled through a country, beautiful beyond deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription. For this garden of the world, nature has done every thing; and yet a Briton, accuſtomed to arts and induſtry, could not but behold it with an eye of commiſeration. Not leſs than two thirds of the land lies waſte, unoccupied, and uncultivated. A law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs banditti occupy the mountainous parts of the country, who prey upon the induſtrious inhabitants, carry off their cattle, deſtroy their grain, and often leave behind them dreadful traces of brutal ferocity, by murdering whole families or villages. Happy is the

country where life and property are ſecured by wiſe and wholſome laws.</p>

               <p>On the morning of the ſecond of February we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended a hill, where we had a view of Salee and Rabat, and about eleven o'clock we came to the river Guero, on the oppoſite ſhore of which ſtands Rabat. This ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is by the inhabitants ſuppoſed to be one of the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt in the world, though it is only a ſtreamlet, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to moſt of the rivers in America.</p>
               <p>Baſhaw Zeriff, commander of the caravan, ordered the camels and mules we had brought with us, to be ſent back, and freſh ones to be got at Rabat to carry us forward the reſt of the journey. We began to ſend over all our baggage and proviſions, and as there was only two paſſage boats, it was evening before we all got landed on the other ſide. None of our party had taſted food during the day, and had we not had a few oranges in our pockets, we muſt have periſhed with hunger and fatigue.</p>

Within the walls there are only about three hundred houſes. It has long been famous for its pirates, or rovers, which make prizes of all Chriſtian ſhips that fall in their way, unleſs they are protected by a treaty. The harbour, when ſhips get in, is commodious and ſafe, but it is a very difficult matter to get entering it, on account of a bar which lies acroſs the mouth of it, inſomuch, that ſhips of the ſmalleſt burden are obliged to take out their guns before they can get over it. They have docks for building ſhips, but they are ſeldom made uſe of, for want of ſkill and materials. This is a place of no kind of trade, only a few Spaniſh ſloops enter the port, carrying powder, ſhot, and ſome articles of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, which they ſell or barter for the produce of the country.</p>
               <p>After we had croſſed the river, we entered the town of Rabat. Among other ſpectators who were preſent at our landing, was the Sardinian conſul, a native of France, who had for ſome time reſided <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>re. As ſoon as he diſcovered us to be Chriſtians, he haſtened to meet us, bringing with him a Jew interpreter. He firſt ſpoke to us himſelf, in French; but as we could not anſwer him in that language, the interpreter told us, he aſked what countrymen we were? We gave him a brief detail of
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:035035_0107_0FFFF5DC951CDC88"/>
our country and misfortunes, and as we did it, his eyes were moiſtened, and he could not refrain from dropping a tear. He told us, he ſincerely ſympathized with us, and wiſhed he could aſſiſt us, but was ſorry he had ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in his power; what he could do, he told us, he would, and in the mean time we ſhould be his gueſts; for which purpoſe he would ſolicit the baſhaw. This was the firſt Chriſtian face we had ſeen in this country, and his looks, manner, and kind expreſſions, had ſo much of the phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthropiſt, that we were convinced he was poſſeſſed of a warm benevolent heart. He left us not a little ſurprized and pleaſed with his generous offer, and went to the baſhaw, who readily complied with his requeſt. He then came up to us, took us ſeverally by the hand, and deſired us to follow him to his houſe. We ſet out for the habitation of our benevolent friend, and were ſhewn into an elegant apartment, ragged and dirty as we were, where a plentiful ſupper was ſet before us of different kinds of meat, with a variety of fruit, and two large flagons of wine. This was the firſt time we had it in our power to eat a hearty meal in the country, and we indulged appetites, long unaccuſtomed to indulgence, with rather too much freedom; for in a ſhort time every one of us began to be racked with pains, ſo that we could neither ſpeak nor keep upon our ſeats. Our kind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer ſoon came to aſk how we liked our ſupper, when he found ſome of us ſprawling on the floor in the utmoſt agony. He aſked the captain if we had wanted food long before, and being told the truth, he
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:035035_0108_10001979A21A9B28"/>
preſcribed a bumper or two of brandy to each of us, which ſoon had the deſired effect, and reſtored us to tranquility and eaſe. Our ſtay at Rabat was prolonged to four days, owing to a ſcarcity of camels, and during all that time did this generous man entertain us in the ſame ſumptuous manner. He gave us many friendly advices reſpecting our conduct in this country; in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular he begged us to be cautious of having the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt intimacy or connection with the Mooriſh women, whatever advances they might make to us, as the laws of their country made it death to any Chriſtian, found intriguing with them, and the Moors certainly would avail themſelves of this privilege. We did not fail to obſerve his precaution during our reſidence. in this country. One day our benevelent hoſt (who deviſed every method he could to ſweeten our ſtay with him) propoſed to entertain us by a country walk, and taking us along with him, we paſſed through the ſtreets to the gate, the croud ſtaring at us like wild beaſts all the way. He led us to the top of a mount, by an eaſy aſcent, where ſtands a fortification, if one may give it the name, of very little ſtrength. Here we had a view of the town and the moſt enchanting country I ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held—its wall all one garden. The moſt delicious fruits of all kinds every where preſented themſelves. In ſhort, did the induſtry of the inhabitants, in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, ſecond the bountiful hand of nature, this country would be the garden of the world. We pulled as much fruit as we could conveniently carry, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

it home, our landlord, after dinner, made each of us drink a bottle of wine to help to digeſt it. But our happineſs here was too complete to be of long duration. On the evening of the fourth day, captain Rice Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, paid us a viſit and told us, we were to march next morning. All the remaining part of that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did the worthy conſul ſpend in our company, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of every argument his imagination could ſuggeſt to cheer our drooping ſpirits: he told us, he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain we would not long be ſlaves, but as he aſſigned no reaſon for his aſſertion, we imputed it to his good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only. He often expreſſed his wiſh he could ſpeak Engliſh, which made us imagine he had ſome ſcheme for our emancipation, which he durſt not impart through the medium of an intepreter. We left our kind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer next morning with a tear of gratitude in each of our eyes. But his kindneſs was not limited to the time of our ſtay with him; he had got prepared for us four large pots, full of boiled meat, five gallons of wine and one of brandy, together with ſixty pound weight of bread, and each a pound of tobocco.</p>
               <p>After this gentleman's behaviour, no man ſhall ever perſuade me, that diſintereſted benevolence is not a plant of this world, nor that any country is ſo barren that it will not produce it. Full of gloomy thoughts and dreadful apprehenſions, on the eighth of February, we entered again upon our hopeleſs journey. Our ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the language of our companions made every
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:035035_0110_0FFFF5E3E06BFCE0"/>
enquiry fruitleſs reſpecting our future fate. We had ſtill one half of our journey to perform, and whether it ſhould terminate in liberty or ſlavery, life or death, we were totally ignorant. The firſt night we reached a plain, twenty-four miles from Rabat, where we pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our tents; as the wind was eaſterly that evening, we were much infeſted with vaſt ſwarms of locuſts, who flew about our ears, making a kind of humming noiſe. I had the curioſity to kill ſeveral of them, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them minutely. They are generally from two to three inches long, their head reſembling that of a horſe: they have four feet, and a tail gradually taper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the end. They are of a greeniſh colour, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with ſtreaks of black and brown: they have a near reſemblance to the larger kind of our beetles in ſize and form. The following night we pitched at Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodia, ſaid to have been once the fineſt town on the coaſt, but a war breaking out between the emperor and his brother, the army of the latter laid it in rains. It conſiſted of three hundred houſes, and now there is not one left ſtanding to ſhew where the town ſtood. Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean veſſels uſed to trade to this port for grain, but ſince the deſtruction of the town, the harbour is totally deſerted. Still however a great number of families reſort here, at certain ſeaſons of the year, for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement of fiſhing, hunting, &amp;c. It is like our water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places in England, a place of faſhionable reſort, and at this time a vaſt number of tents, were erected, and an incredible number of people had come to enjoy the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:035035_0111_0FFFF5E5688EDBB8"/>
amuſements of the country. Immediately after we had pitched our tents, a young man of a very graceful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, with ſomething in his air and manner above the common rank, came out of a tent, followed by a great retinue. Baſhaw Zeriff Hammond no ſooner eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied him, than he haſtily made up to him, and kiſſing the ground before him, ſoon gave us to underſtand that he was ſome very great perſonage; and in a little we learned that he was ſon to the emperor. He took a walk round all the tents of the caravan, in company with the baſhaw, and the captain of the ſhip who had taken us, ſurveying us with a very inquiſitive eye, and aſking a number of queſtions, as we imagined, at the captain.</p>
               <p>We had the greater part of the gallon of brandy we brought from Rabat ſtill with us, and though we knew the Alcoran ſtrickly prohibits the uſe of ſpiritous liquors, yet as we had ſeen Rice Hammond uſe them with the greateſt freedom, we deſired him to offer a glaſs of our brandy to the prince. He did ſo, and it was accepted with pleaſure. By this time he had ſent for an interpreter, who fell down before him, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ground. He aſked us how we liked the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and whether it was not the beſt we had ever ſeen? We told him we only wanted liberty to make us think it ſo. He then deſired the interpreter to inform us of his rank, and of his connection with, and friendſhip for the Engliſh. The interpreter then proceeded to inform
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:035035_0112_1000197D776A1C88"/>
us, that he was the favourite ſon of the reigning em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, by an Engliſh woman. About thirty years ago, ſays he, a number of Engliſh ſhips were caſt aſhore on the coaſt of Barbary, the crews of which were all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up by the emperor, who having ſo many Britiſh ſubjects in his power, took occaſion to declare war againſt that nation. He marched them all to Morocco, and made ſlaves of the men, expecting them to be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed at a high rate. Among the unfortunate ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, was a beautiful female, whom the emperor no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er beheld, than ſhe entirely gained his affections. He ordered her to be ſent to the ſeraglio, and for many years, her good ſenſe, and unaſſuming behaviour, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the conqueſt which her beauty had gained. By that lady the emperor had this prince, who is generally expected to ſucceed him on the throne. The emperor, who has between eighty and ninety ſons, ſhews a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree of fondneſs for him, than for any of the reſt; and as he is a very great favourite in the empire at large, the emperor's declaration in his favour will be highly reliſhed, and warmly ſupported by every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual in the country. We gave the interpreter thanks for his intelligence, and paid our reſpects to the prince in the Engliſh manner; who deſired the interpreter to tell us, that he looked upon every Engliſhman as his friend, and that he ſhould be happy to have it in his power to be of ſervice to us; upon which he left the tent, and we found means to detain the interpreter for a little, wiſhing to receive every poſſible information
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:035035_0113_0FFFF5EA9365CE18"/>
reſpecting our future deſtination. He told us, if this prince ſhould ever come to the throne, the Engliſh might aſſure themſelves of the beſt treatment from him; that it was happy for us we were in the power of his father, who, he ſaid, was a very humane prince, and that if we had been taken by a ſubject of the dey of Algiers, our fate would have been much harder. When you go to Morocco, ſays he, you will not have much work, if you have any, and I am perſuaded the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror will not ſell you to any other maſter. Perhaps he will grant you your liberty at once. It is fortunate for you that you have ſeen his ſon, who it is more than probable will intercede for you; at all rates, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make yourſelves happy, and whatever your ſentiments may be, let your looks be cheerful.</p>
               <p>We parted with the interpreter, and ſome of our number could recollect the circumſtance of the Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field man of war being caſt on that coaſt, in the year 1755, together with ſeveral tranſports, on an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the iſland of Goree. This corroborated the ſtory we had heard, and convinced us, that the fair ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana muſt have been one of the adventurers in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate expedition. Before we went to ſleep, (bed we had none ſince we left our own veſſel) the prince paid us another viſit, in company with the baſhaw, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rice Hammed, and giving them ſtrict charges to be kind to us on our journey, he bade us adieu. Next morning at ſeven o'clock, we began our march, and
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:035035_0114_0FFFF5F0B9FD1F90"/>
paſſed through a country extremely fertile; we came to a valley, between two hills, where we eſpied a great number of huts, inhabited by a very ſavage-looking race of people. The day following we entered a very ſpacious plain, named Zebra, about nine o'clock in the morning; and when we ſtopped in the evening, we were ſeven miles on the other ſide of it. It is from caſt to weſt thirty miles long, and twenty-five broad from north to ſouth. On the ſouth ſide of it runs the river of Lions, ſo called from the vaſt number of thoſe animals that reſort to the banks of it. We durſt not go nearer than within ſeven miles of this river, to form an encampment, as they generally go abroad in the night to hunt for their prey. We were informed, that near two years before this period, about twelve fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies lived on the plain, at no great diſtance from each other, and that one evening, an aſſemblage of wild beaſts came down, and deſtroyed upwards of ſixty cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, a great number of ſheep, and two or three of the peaſants. We had to croſs part of the foreſt in the day time, and even then were alarmed with the roaring of lions, the barking of wolves, and the ſcreaming of leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards and tygers. The ſoldiers however were all on on their guard, and nothing appeared to moleſt us but one wild boar, which was inſtantly ſhot. On the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, about ten o'clock, we reached the plain of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco, and could diſcover the cloud-capt Atlas, at a very great diſtance, terminating this immenſe plain on
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:035035_0115_0FFFF5F249E7B4A0"/>
the ſouth. From this much famed mountain, or rather chain of mountains, the Atlantic ocean takes its name.</p>
               <p>The vaſt plain upon which we now entered, is ninety miles long and forty broad. On the north it is bounded by a chain of very high hills, called the Valena mountains, and on the eaſt by a part Egypt. In the middle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the mountains of Atlas and Valena, ſtands Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco, the capital of this vaſt empire. We encamped about five miles from the city, at four in the afternoon, when diſpatches were ſent to the emperor, to inform him of our arrival. Next day about ten o'clock we received orders to enter the gates of the city, and were marched through the ſtreets, in the midſt of an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable crowd of ſpectators, till we came to one of the emperor's gardens, where we were ordered to pitch our tents till the emperor's further orders were received. We lodged here for that night, anxious for the light of another day, on the event of which every thing that was dear to us depended. The important day at length arrived, and at eleven o'clock, a guard of ſoldiers came into the garden, and gave orders for us to march. We paſſed through ſeveral diviſions of the garden, and came to the ſide of it next the palace, where was a ſquare of about two miles in circumference, in which were rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome thouſands of ſoldiers, all under arms. Old captain Rice Hammed, with the other officers of his veſſel, marched in our front. Here we were detained for the ſpace of an hour, without exchanging a word
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:035035_0116_0FFFF5F86CEF4FA8"/>
with any one; till at laſt the old captain came and told us, that the ſignal for the emperor's appearance would be a camel drove out before him, that the army might be in readineſs to receive him. In the middle of this large area, was a ſummer ſhade, beautifully painted and adorned, to which the emperor frequently reſorts, to review his troops; and round this were planted all the cavalry. The camel at laſt made its appearance, and was followed by the monarch, riding in a two-wheeled chariot, drawn by four Arabian mules of a jet black co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. He was followed by a body guard, conſiſting of about one hundred men, who beſides their arms, were furniſhed each with a ſtick in his hand. He moved ſlowly along, ſurveying every thing with a quick, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrating eye; the army at every little interval, calling out in their own language, "Long live the emperor Mahomed." When he came to the diſtance of about twenty yards from us, the chariot ſtopped, and about twenty of the footmen came running toward us, and each of them taking one of us by the hand, led us forward, together with the Turkiſh ſailors; the cavalry at the ſame time contracting the circle, and coming as near as they could: when we came to the diſtance of about ſeven yards, all the foot guards and Moors of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, who were in the park, fell down upon their knees, and kiſſed the ground three times. We paid our compliments in the manner of our country, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering our heads, and bowing very profoundly. The emperor, who ſeemed to have his eyes conſtantly fixed
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:035035_0117_1000197EF9562960"/>
on us, returned our compliment with a ſmile, which we (who watched his looks with no ſmall degree of anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety) interpreted as a good omen. An interpreter was called, who aſked us, of what country we were, and and of what religion? where we were bound to when we were taken? and what was our cargo? Our captain who was chief ſpeaker, told him, we were from Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, that we had landed a cargo in Spain, and were hound to Teneriffe, when we were taken. He aſked us, if we did not belong to the Britiſh government? We told him we belonged to that part of America, which had become independent of Britain? How happens it, ſays he, that your nation have not ſecured my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before you attempted to come upon my coaſt? To this (as we knew not what to anſwer) we were totally ſilent. The interpreter then, by his order, aſked if we would conform to the religion of the country? To which we anſwered, Our conſciences would not allow us. He did not ſeem to reſent our anſwer, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, a Mr. Chapman, who was a native of Genoa, and agent to the emperor, afterwards told us, he would have deſpiſed us heartily if we had given him any other anſwer. I do not mean, ſays the emperor, to treat you with ſeverity; the power I have over you ſhall not be abuſed: you ſhall not be ſold to another, nor kept in a ſtate of ſlavery by myſelf; but I muſt detain you in my country till I ſee whether your nation chooſes to ſend an ambaſſador to enter into a treaty with me: you may retire, and I ſhall give orders to the proper perſons to
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:035035_0118_100019808365B0A0"/>
diſpoſe of you. We left his preſence, and retired to to our firſt ſtation, where we ſtood till we ſaw the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror ride round the park, and return to the palace. No ſooner was he gone than Mr. Chapman, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, came to us, and congratulated us upon our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable reception, and the mildneſs of our ſentence. I have orders, ſays he, to prepare a houſe for you, to ſupply you with food and other neceſſaries, and I ſhall endeavour to make your ſtay in Morocco as pleaſant as your ſituation will admit. We returned our warmeſt acknowledgments to this gentleman for his proffered kindneſs, and bidding adieu to old Rice Hammed, and the reſt of the crew, we followed our leader with exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hearts. He led us out of the gardens, and brought us to a houſe, which, he ſaid, had formely been a maſs houſe for the Spaniards, in which were ſeveral apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He made an apology for leaving us for a little, telling us, he would return immediately. And now, for the firſt time, we began to recollect that none of us had eaten a mouthful that day, and to be anxious for Mr. Chapman's entering upon the benevolent part of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. He ſoon returned, followed by a Jew, carrying a large baſket full of bread, and a pot of butter, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many excuſes for having nothing better to offer us, and aſſuring us we ſhould have plenty of beef next day, with coals and utenſils for cooking. After this he ſent for a pound tobacco, and diſtributed it among us, and then left us to our own meditations.</p>

                  <pb n="127" facs="unknown:035035_0119_10001984554AE998"/>We now gave way to the moſt abounded joy; we had anticipated our reception at Morocco with horror, but how very different was our preſent ſituation from what we expected. True, we ſtill were deprived of liberty, but we had a houſe which we could call our own. We had the aſſurance of the comforts of food and fire; and the gentleman to whoſe charge we were committed, was a Chriſtian, and had promiſed to be a friend. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved therefore to enjoy the preſent with cheerfulneſs, and leave the future to the diſpoſal of that kind Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence who had hitherto protected us. We had hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore always a ſcanty allowance of bread, but butter was a luxury we had ſeldom ſeen, and we did not long delay our repaſt. The variety of dainties which load the luxurious table of the epicure, are inſipid to appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites palled with variety; but we had the ſauce which is ever ſure to give a reliſh to the coarſeſt food—we were almoſt periſhing with hunger.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IN every part of this empire there are vaſt numbers of Jews, who have a quarter of every town ſet apart for their reſidence. In the city of Morocco, they are very numerous, and are extremely uſeful to the Moors, eſpecial in money tranſactions, and accounts. A Moor is generally too indolent, or too little informed to tranſact his own buſineſs. A Jew in this, as in all other countries, is ſhrewd, cunning, and well verſed in the management of buſineſs; and renders himſelf neceſſary to a rich African, too fond of eaſe to mind his own concerns. In general, however, they are deſpiſed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:035035_0121_1000198826DDE3E0"/>
and inſulted, without daring to complain, or ſeek for redreſs.</p>
               <p>The houſe allotted to us ſtood in the Jewiſh quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the city, or as it is called, the <hi>Jews'-town,</hi> and we were allowed to aſſociate with them at pleaſure. We found them extremely ready to cultivate our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and oblige us in ſmall matters that coſt them nothing. We had likewiſe permiſſion to walk through every part of the city, Mr. Chapman giving us the ſame caution the Sardinian conſul had formerly done, reſpecting the Mooriſh women. The ninth night of our reſidence in our new habitation, we eat our ſupper and went to ſleep; but we had not been long gone to reſt, when we were rouſed by a very loud rapping at the gate, which continued ſo long that we were forced to get up and enquire what it meant. Inſtead of going to the gate, however, we went up to the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top, where we diſcovered not leſs than twenty Moors, ſtanding and calling out for admittance. We dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they had ſome evil deſign againſt us, and returning to our apartment we found a large log of wood, which we laid at the back of the door, to prevent their breaking it open. They continued knocking for the ſpace of an hour, but at laſt finding they could obtain no anſwer, they retired. They had obſerved us on the top of the houſe, and two of them had, by ſome means or other, got into the yard; for after we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined they were gone, one of our number opening the
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:035035_0122_0FFFF605292B0C18"/>
door, and offering to go up the ſtairs which led to the top of the houſe, was ſuddenly ſeized by them. He called out for aſſiſtance, and we all immediately went up to him, ſeized the Moors, and taking them to our own apartment, detained them till day-light. Mr. Chapman, who made his appearance at an early hour, was not a little ſurprized to find we had made two pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; and enquiring into the buſineſs we gave him a brief account of their behaviour. He immediately or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to be carried to the preſence of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, who made them give up the names of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices, and Mr. Chapman told us, they were all immediately baſtinadoed with great ſoverity, as a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others, not to diſturb us for the future. This however, was an unlucky accident for us; it created us many ſecret enemies; we could ſcarcely walk through any ſtreet in the city without being inſulted, and even the Jews, from a deſire of pleaſing the Moors, did us every injury in their power. We ſuffered, without complaining, as long as we could, but were at laſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make our caſe known to Mr. Chapman, who immediately reported the matter to the emperor. The emperor told him he would order us to be ſent to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godore in a few days, where we could live unmoleſted, and enjoy the ſociety of Europeans and Chriſtians, of whom a great number are ſettled there.</p>
               <p>Previous to our departure, Mr. Chapman obtained liberty for us to viſit all the curioſities of this large city,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:035035_0123_10001989A87C0F38"/>
and appointed a guard of Moors to protect us from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. Our firſt excurſion was to ſee the emperor's col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of wild beaſts, which is I ſuppoſe the largeſt in the world. The place in which they were kept, is very ſpacious. On the right hand were lions, wolves, tygers, cats, bears, &amp;c. on the other ſide were a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of tame beaſts, with a great variety of fowls of various kinds. I was much ſtruck with the appearance of the antelope, which I ſuppoſe, has been called the unicorn, for that animal is not now at leaſt to be found in the world, and this in ſome reſpects reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles what it is ſaid to be, particularly in its having a horn right in the middle of its forehead. It is of a light brown colour, ſomewhat reſembling the deer of this country. The antelope of Barbary is conſiderably ſmaller than that of the ſouth of Africa or Egypt. One of the latter country was likewiſe in this collection, which was of a delicate grey colour, dark on the back, but gradually becoming lighter towards the belly. The horn is in general five or ſix inches long. It would take a volume to deſcribe the great variety of animals contained in this collection. I ſhall not therefore at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, but proceed to our next day's entertainment.</p>
               <p>We aroſe in the morning, and directed our courſe towards the ſeraglio, but our guards were particularly cautious of allowing us to approach it. This large building or ſquare, is ſurrounded by a wall of fourteen feet high, and is inacceſſible to all but the emperor and
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:035035_0124_0FFFF60DDD5EE7D8"/>
his emiſſaries. We were told it contained near one thouſand perſons, but I do not ſuppoſe the man from whom we received our information, could by any means aſcertain the number.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The place where the emperor's women are kept is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the HAREM, and forms a part of the palace, or ſeraglio. LEMPRIERE, in his tour to Morocco, lately publiſhed, has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a particular account of this place. He was ſent by the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor of Gibraltar, in 1789, as phyſician, to attend Muley Abſulem, a favorite ſon of the late emperor, at the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar requeſt of that prince, whoſe health was on the decline. While at Morocco, waiting the emperor's diſpatches to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, he was called to attend one of his principal ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanas, who was labouring under the effects of a doſe of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, adminiſtered to her by ſome of her jealous companions. The admiſſion of an European, and one of the male ſex, into the Royal Harem, is a thing, we believe, unprecedented; but whatever induced the emperor thus to violate Mooriſh decorum, it enabled the writer to furniſh the world with a particular account of this ſeat of eaſtern debauchery; of which we ſhall preſent a brief abſtract.</p>
                     <p>"The public and uſual entrance to the Harem," ſays Lempriere, "is through a very large arched door-way, guarded on the outſide by ten body guards, which leads to a lofty hall, where the captain or alciade, with a guard of ſeventeen eunuchs, are poſted. Upon entering the court into which the women's apartments open, I diſcovered a motley group of concubines, domeſtics, and negro ſlaves, who were variouſly employed. Thoſe of the firſt deſcription had formed themſelves into circles, ſeated on the ground in the open court, and were apparently engaged in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The domeſtics and ſlaves were chiefly employed in preparing their cuſcoſoo. My appearance in the court ſoon attracted their attention, and a conſiderable number of them, unacquainted with the means by which I had been admitted into the Harem, retreated with the utmoſt precipitancy; while others, more courageous, approached, and enquired of my black attendant, who I was, and by whoſe orders he had brought me thither. The moment it was known that I was of the medical profeſſion, parties of them were diſpatched to inform thoſe who had fled, that I was ſent in by order of the emperor, to attend Lalla Zara, [Lady or Mrs. Zara] my intended patient's name, and requeſting them to come back and look at the Chriſtian. Seranio Tibib! Chriſtian Doctor! reſounded from one end of the Harem to the other; and in the courſe of a few minutes I was ſo completely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by women and children, that I was unable to move a ſingle ſtep. Every one of them appeared ſolicitous to find out ſome complaint on which ſhe might conſult me, and thoſe who had not ingenuity enough to invent one, obliged me to feel their pulſe; and were highly diſpleaſed, if I did not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome ailment or other. All of them ſeemed ſo urgent to be attended at the ſame time, that while I was feeling the pulſe of one, others were behind pulling my coat, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating me to examine their complaints, while a third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were upbraiding me for not paying them the ſame attention. Their ideas of delicacy did not at all correſpond with thoſe of our European ladies, for they exhibited the beauties of their limbs and form with a degree of freedom that in any other country would have been thought indecent; and their converſation was equally unreſtrained." But in this "they were not conſcious of treſpaſſing the limits of decency." This was evident on other occaſions, "wherein they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted a ſingular attention to what they conceived to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum;" for "when I requeſted to ſee the tongues of ſome patients who complained of feveriſh ſymptoms, they refuſed to comply, conſidering it as inconſiſtent with their modeſty and virtue.</p>
                     <p>"From the firſt court into which I had been introduced, I paſſed through two or three ſimilar, till I arrived at the chamber of my intended patient. I found the lady ſitting croſs-legged on a mattreſs placed upon the floor, and cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with fine linen, with twelve white and negro attendants, ſeated on the floor alſo, in different parts of the chamber. A round cuſhion was placed for me next to the lady, on which I was deſired to be ſeated." He then proceeds to give ſome account of his patient, who a few years previous to this, had been remarkable for her beauty and accompliſhments; on which account ſhe was then in every reſpect the favorite wife of the emperor. This exciting the jealouſy of thoſe whoſe charms were leſs conſpicuous, they had effected her ruin by mixing poiſon in her food, which, though not ſufficiently ſtrong to take away her life, had completely deſtroyed that beauty, which had been the fatal cauſe of her misfortune. After which, being ſtrongly ſolicited, he viſited ſeveral other ladies, in their own apartments, though at a conſiderable riſk, and without the knowledge of the emperor. Moſt of theſe were exceedingly corpulent, which they conſider as a mark of beauty, and uſe various means to attain. Some of them poſſeſſed conſiderable accompliſhments, and were po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite and attentive in their behaviour. One of them, from her being able to read and write well the Arabic language, was conſidered by the other females as a ſuperior being.</p>
                     <p>"The apartments," continues he, "which are all on the ground floor, are ſquare, very lofty, and four of them encloſe a ſquare court, into which they open by means of large folding doors. In the centre of theſe courts, which are floored with blue and white tiling, is a fountain, ſupplied by pipes from a large reſervoir on the outſide of the palace, which ſerve for the frequent ablutions recommended by the Mahometan religion, as well as for other purpoſes. The whole of the Harem, conſiſts of about twelve of theſe ſquare courts, communicating with each other by narrow paſſages, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> acceſs from one part of it to another, and of which all the women are allowed to avail themſelves. The apartments are ornamented with beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful carved work, much ſuperior to any I have ever ſeen in Europe. Moſt of the rooms are hung with rich damaſk of various colours; the floors are covered with beautiful car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and there are mattreſſes diſpoſed at proper diſtances, for the purpoſes of ſitting and ſleeping. The apartments are alſo furniſhed at each extremity with an elegant European mahogany bedſtead, hung with damaſk, having on it ſeveral mattreſſes, placed one over the other, which are covered with various coloured ſilks; but theſe are merely to orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the room. Some of the rooms were garniſhed with large and valuable looking-glaſſes, hung on different parts of the walls. In others, clocks and watches of different ſizes, in glaſs caſes, were diſpoſed in the ſame manner;" with a variety of other ornaments. "The whole Harem was under the management of the principal ſultana, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any particular control over the other woman.</p>
                     <p>"Each female had a ſeparate daily allowance from the emperor, proportioned to the eſtimation in which they were held by him." This allowance was exceeding ſmall; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their chief dependence was "on the preſents they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from thoſe Europeans and Moors who viſited the court, and who employed their influence in obtaining ſome particular favour from the emperor.</p>
                     <p>"The ladies ſeparately furniſh their own rooms, hire their own domeſtics, and, in fact, do what they pleaſe in the Harem, but are not permitted to go out without an expreſs order from the emperor, who very ſeldom grants them that favour, except when they are to be removed from one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace to another. In that caſe a party of ſoldiers is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a little diſtance before them, to diſperſe the male paſſengers in particular, and to prevent the poſſibility of their being ſeen. This previous ſtep being taken, a piece of linen cloth is tied round the lower part of the face, and afterwards theſe miſerable females cover themſelves entirely with their Haicks, and either mount mules, which they ride like men, or, what is more uſual, are put into a ſquare carriage, or litter, conſtructed for this purpoſe, which by its lattice work allows them to ſee with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap> being ſeen. In this manner they ſet off under the charge of a guard of black eunuchs. This journey, and ſometimes a walk round the bounds of the palace, is the only exerciſe they are permitted to take.</p>
                     <p>"The emperor's Harem conſiſted of between ſixty and a hundred female, beſides their domeſtics and ſlaves, which were very numerous." However it muſt be obſerved here, that the number of females frequently change, ſome dying, and others being repudiated. The emperor only viſited the Harem occaſionally: It was "uſual for him to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to thoſe ladies whoſe company he wiſhed, to attend in his apartment; when they made a point of ſetting off their charms to the beſt advantage. In his preſence they ſhewed him every attention which a common ſlave would do to his maſter, and never attempted to offer their opinion, except by his approbation.</p>
                     <p>"The dreſs of the ladies conſiſts of a ſhirt, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably full and looſe ſleeves, hanging almoſt to the ground, the neck and breaſt of which are left open, and their edges are neatly embroidered with gold.

It is therefore dangerous for any family to think of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the country, and this is one reaſon why ſo much of this beautiful empire is totally deſerted. We had taken ſome refreſhment in our pockets this day, and wandering into the country a conſiderable way, we did not think of returning home till the evening. It was almoſt dark when we entered our habitation, when we were alarmed by the violent ſcreams of a woman. We inſtantly made towards her, aſking what was the matter? She begged us, in Spaniſh, to give her a knife; we did ſo, and ſhe no ſooner received it, than ſhe cut the back of her hand, acroſs, till it bled violently. We attempted to hold her, and to ſtop the blooding, but ſhe begged us to let her alone, telling us, ſhe had been bit by a ſcorpion, and there was no other way of eaſing the pain.

She told us, ſhe was groping in a dark corner for the lamp, which ſhe was going to light, when this vicious animal had ſeized her finger, and if we were not cautious, we might ſometime or other ſhare the ſame fate, as there were thouſands in the houſe. As we never had ſeen any, we were aſtoniſhed

She told us, they never ventured out of their lurking places till it was dark, but that ſhe could eaſily convince us ſhe had told us the truth, if one of us would get the lamp lighted. We did ſo, and ſhe pointed out ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral holes, into which we puſhed our ſticks, when ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral iſſued forth, which we took care to kill as ſoon as they made their appearance. We killed ten ſcorpions, and two ſnakes, the latter from two to three feet long. The knowledge we had gained of our <hi>fellow-lodgers,</hi> made us afraid of ſleeping in the houſe, though we had done it often before with no bad effects: We therefore went upon the houſe-top, and ſlept in the open air, and this we continued to do every night, during our reſidence at Morocco.</p>
               <p>Though the bite of the ſcorpion is often almoſt inſtant death, yet the precaution of this young Jeweſs, who was as ſenſible as ſhe was beautiful, prevented the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from taking effect. After having ſcarified her hand, ſhe bound up her arm very tight, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the poiſon from circulating upwards, and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven days ſhe was entirely freed from its effects, and the wound healed.</p>
               <p>It is indeed ſhocking to ſee this great city, the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of a vaſt empire, ſo dreadfully over-run by all ſorts of venemous animals. It preſents to an European eye, a painful proſpect, to look at a great metropolis, nearly

From the materials of which their houſes are built, one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not not expect to ſee them kept very clean. They have ſtones in abundance, but do not uſe them in the way of building; preferring a mixture of clay, mud, ſand, and lime. The lower orders commonly build their houſes of ſods and clay, which moulder down into heaps of the vileſt rubbiſh, and the inhabitants are too indolent to have it cleared away. This city, upon the whole, preſents a very gloomy appearance, nor is it poſſible for a humane traveller, to view the wretched condition of the inhabitants, without a commiſerating eye. But in a country where liberty, arts, and induſtry, are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly known, what can be expected. The will of the monarch, is the only law known in the country; and whilſt he is gratified with the enjoyment of every lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury his heart can deſire, no matter what becomes of his wretched ſubjects; who, to uſe again the words of Mr. Addiſon,
<q>
                     <l>Are in the midſt of nature's bounty curſt,</l>

               <p>The city of Morocco is built nearly ſquare, incloſed by a wall, which, if poſſible, adds horror to its inſide appearance. It is twenty feet high, and twelve thick, built of the ſame materials as the houſes; having three gates in each quarter, making twelve in all. Round the
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:035035_0135_100019970F3EADF0"/>
wall are three different ditches or entrenchment about twenty feet deep, and ſixteen wide, which were made, like moſt of their public works, by Chriſtian ſlaves. The ſtreets interſect each other at right angles, and on the outſide of each gate are drawbridges over the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treachments. It is indeed impoſſible, at the preſent day, to ſay what the appearance of this place has been, as whole ſtreets are lying in ruins, ſwarming with poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous reptiles. The wall however, is nine miles in circumference, and my reader may form ſome idea of the preſent ſtate of the city, when he is informed, that from upwards of 400,000 inhabitants, which it is ſaid once to have contained, they are now reduced to twenty, or at moſt to twenty-five thouſand. The principal ſtreet conſiſts almoſt entirely of ſhops; many of them belong to the emperor, who is the chief trafficker in the country, as he receives one tenth of all the goods of his Mahom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etan ſubjects, and ſeizes as much from the others as he pleaſes. But as I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of the government of the country, and the manners of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, afterwards, I ſhall at preſent go on with my narrative.</p>
               <p>On the ſecond of February, we were told by Mr. Chapman to hold ourſelves in readineſs in the morning, to march to Mogodore, where he told us we would be much happier, as the ſituation was healthier, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety we would have, would be moſtly Chriſtians. He begged us to live peaceably one with another, and to be

obliging <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the inhabitants of the country. He entreated us not to think of making our eſcape, leſt we ſhould fail in the attempt, in which caſe he gave us to underſtand, that we ſhould ſuffer the moſt cruel death that could be deviſed. He aſſured us, that whilſt we obſerved his injunctions, we might always look upon him as a friend, and he would take care that we ſhould not be put to any kind of ſlavery. After this he gave us a letter, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Venetian conſul at Mogodore, who, he told us, was his own brother, and would befriend us as much as lay in his power. We returned our warmeſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to this worthy gentleman for his kindneſs, when he wiſhed us a good journey, and left us.</p>
               <p>About ſun-riſing next morning, we were ready to proceed on our journey, accompanied by an alcaide, fifty horſemen, and twenty camels, loaded with corn, bread, water, tents, and every other neceſſary for our journey. We ſoon ſet out, and having travelled for four hours, the alcaide, whoſe name was Saliber, gave orders to ſtop, and refreſh the men and horſes. We were ſerved each, with a ſmall cake, about the ſame ſize of that we uſed to receive in the priſon of Larache. We conſoled ourſelves with the hopes of its being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in the courſe of the day, but night came on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bringing us any more food. We were again called to ſtop, in the middle of the day, when the meridian ſun was ſcorching beyond meaſure. We unloaded all our camels, and let them looſe to feed; and a grove
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:035035_0137_0FFFF63724850F60"/>
of figs being in the neighbourhood, we took ſhelter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the branches for ourſelves. Here we found ſome oranges growing, with which we refreſhed ourſelves, taking as many along with us, as we conveniently could. After we had reſted about two hours, we were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to proceed on our march, which we continued till, ten o'clock, when we halted by the ſide of a ſmall riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, called Niffis, which has its ſource in mount Atlas, and runs weſtward from this place, nine leagues, when it joins another river; and after many windings, it falls into the Atlantic ocean, thirty leagues north of Mogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore. One would expect to find plenty of fiſh in ſuch a river, but the Moors informed us, there was nothing but eels and water-ſnakes to be found in any river in the country. Whether ſome of the great variety of metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſubſtances, with which this country abounds, may not prove fatal to the finny tribe, I take not upon me to determine. Certain it is, the rivers in this empire are different from all other running water I ever ſaw. After rain, they are of a high red colour, and in dry weather thick and muddy.</p>
               <p>Next morning, about ſeven o'clock we ſet forward on our journey, and travelled about three miles on the banks of the river, through a beautiful country which the ſpring had begun to decorate with all the ſweets of nature. Before we parted from the river, we ſtopped to refreſh ourſelves, and wandering about the banks of it, we picked up ſeveral oſtrich feathers, and collected from

                  </gap> large quantities of ſilk. One of our men laid hold of a camelion, the firſt I had ever ſeen. This little animal is about ſeven inches long from the top of the noſe to the end of the tail. Its head reſembles that of a frog, and it has four legs, very ſhort, with feet which likewiſe reſemble a frog's. One remarkable property of this animal, is its changing its colour. It is generally found in a woody country, moſt commonly on a buſh or tree, and its colour is ſure to reſemble the fruit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the tree where you take it. It is ſaid to live upon air. Certain it is, it is never ſeen to eat any thing, and it is probable the flies and other inſects that inhabit the air, anſwer all its purpoſes; in the courſe of this journey, we ſhould have been happy in diſcovering the art of making them anſwer <hi>ours;</hi> for our ſtated allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was very inadequate to our wants. About ſix o'clock this evening we came to a village of about twenty houſes, where we were ordered to pitch our tents. The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants came flocking around us, every one ſhewing a degree of curioſity to ſee the Chriſtians; ſome of them gave us ſmall pieces of bread, and others of tobacco, which by this time were very acceptable preſents. Next night we encamped at the foot of a little hill, the moſt beautiful eminence I ever beheld; it is half a mile in circumference, and by an eaſy aſcent of about fifty paces, we got to the top of it. Here we found a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful plain, ſurrounded by a grove of vines, and in the middle of it a well, which we were glad to ſee, and made towards it to drink. But juſt as we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:035035_0139_0FFFF63CC9F197E0"/>
to quench our thirſt, the Moors called us back, telling us, that this was the burial place of ſeveral ſaints, who had bleſſed the water, and none but Muſſelmen were allowed to taſte it, and that if either Jew, or Chriſtian, preſumed to drink of it, the ſaints would be enraged, and muſt put the tranſgreſſor to death. We would very gladly have riſked the anger of the ſaints, but the vengeance of the Moors, was a more ſerious bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and though our thirſt was extreme, we were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſuffer, with the temptation of excellent water before us. We pulled a few bunches of grapes, and returned to the encampment.</p>
               <p>Next day at noon we reſted by the ſide of a rivulet, which no ſaint had meddled with. We took with us a large ſupply of that neceſſary article, as our guides told us, we would not meet with any again for ſome time. In the evening we encamped on a very barren plain, where neither water, nor fruits of any kind were to be found. Here, however, were great numbers of ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopes, one of which a ſoldier ſhot and brought to the camp; but in all this plain we could not find as much wood as would make a fire to roaſt it. The ſoldier therefore cut it up, and putting it in his ſack, reſerved it for the next night, when we were invited to partake of it, and in all my life, I think, I never eat a better ſupper. The fleſh of this animal is delicate beyond any thing I ever taſted, and as it was the only animal food, we received during our journey, it was a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

morſel. Next day we had to travel over a long and dreary deſert; we therefore, ſtarted betimes in the morning, that we might accompliſh our journey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night. This deſert extends about thirty miles on the road we had to go, and about fifty miles along the coaſt, from north to ſouth. It is impoſſible for the imagination to conceive a more dreary waſte, than that which this day preſented itſelf. We had to travel over mountains of ſand, on this extenſive deſert, where the rapid whirlwind ſweeps every thing before it, and where the helpleſs traveller is frequently buried, never more to riſe. Here the wind often raiſes vaſt quantities of ſand, and carries it about, till exhauſting itſelf, the ſand falls down; and not unfrequently, a whole cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van diſappears. As the ſand is perpetually varying its ſituation, it is no eaſy matter to keep in a direct road, ſo that one may travel thirty miles without advancing ten, towards the place of their deſtination. Our guides, who had often travelled through this deſert before, were frequently at a loſs which way to turn, after holding conſultations among themſelves, and often very irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and undetermined; whilſt we, with a burning ſun over our heads, and almoſt fainting with thirſt and hunger, became totally indifferent about the preſervation of lives, which yielded us ſo little comfort. Frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we could not for ſome minutes open our eyes, and when we did, could not ſee ſix yards before us. At laſt, about four o'clock, one of our guides diſcovered the iſland of Mogodore, which is high land, and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:035035_0141_100019A1B381E9C0"/>
at ſome diſtance. This gave hopes that we ſhould reach the end of our journey before dark. This hope was our only ſtay; for we had taſted nothing to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port nature, during that whole day, except an orange or two each, which we had luckily preſerved.</p>
               <p>About ſix o'clock we reached the town, but were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to ſtop on the outſide of the walls, till the al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ide went to the governor to acquaint him of our arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. He did not return for the ſpace of an hour, by the end of which, the little ſpark of life that remained to us, was almoſt extinguiſhed. Whilſt we were ruminating on our wretched condition, we obſerved two gentlemen approach us, in the habit of Chriſtians, and on their coming nearer, could hear them talk Engliſh. The ſight of an European, of whatever country, was a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſcovery; but the moſt delicious muſic could not equal the ſound of the Engliſh language. The two gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen came up to us, and aſked what bad fortune had reduced us to our preſent condition. We gave them a brief detail of our ſituation and ſufferings. One of them, Mr. Bain, a native of Ireland, heard us with an emotion, which he could not conceal. "Alas!" ſays he, "I have been at the ſchool of adverſity myſelf, and moſt ſincerely do I ſympathize with you in your mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. At preſent my circumſtances are eaſy, and happy ſhall I eſteem myſelf, if I can by any means light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the burden you are doomed to bear. Follow me, my Chriſtian friends, my houſe and heart ſhall be open

to you; your misfortunes are the beſt letter of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation you can bring, and if I cannot procure your liberty, I will at leaſt endeavour to make your bondage leſs irkſome." We were endeavouring to find words to expreſs our gratitude, when the other gentleman, whoſe name was Hutchiſon, prevented us. "Mr. Bain," ſays he, "the goodneſs of your heart, hurries you in this inſtance beyond the bounds of prudence. Theſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate men, muſt not upon any account, leave this place, till the alcaide returns, otherwiſe he will be enraged, and perhaps cauſe the governor to puniſh them ſeverely. Let them remain where they are at all events; only take one of the ſoldiers with you, and ſend ſome relief to their preſent neceſſities, which I plainly perceive are very preſſing; and when the governor has aſſigned them their reſidence, we ſhall ſoon know where it is, and be able to give them what ſupport they ſtand in need of." Mr. Bain thanked him for his caution, and aſſenting to his propoſal, immediately went to ſend us the relief we ſtood ſo much in need of; and happy it was for us that he went; for I believe there was not one among us had as much remaining ſtrength, as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

A Jew, who was the meſſenger, ſoon returned, bringing a large piece of beef, with bread ſufficient for a whole day, and a bottle of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent brandy. I am certain I owe it to this worthy perſon that I am at this moment alive, and able to write his name; and never ſhall I write or mention it without the tear of gratitude, while memory holds her

ſeat. The alcaide gave himſelf no trouble about us, as a man poſſeſſed of the leaſt ſpark of humanity, would have done, after the dreadful day we had paſſed; he went away, and returned without offering us a morſel of food, and ſtood very deliberately with the governor ſurveying us, and telling him our hiſtory, for at leaſt, another hour after he returned, before we were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to march to the place aſſigned us. After we had ſtaid long enough to gratify public curioſity, we were at laſt taken to a houſe, which the governor informed us was to be our reſidence, where they left us, and in a ſhort time we were again viſited by our two benevolent friends. Mr. Hutchiſon informed us, he had been with the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor, and made enquiry what was to be done with us; and that he had informed him, he had no particular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders concerning us, further, than that we were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under his care, till the emperor ſhould further ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify his pleaſure. "And now," ſays he, "my dear fellows, conſider you are in the midſt of enemies, who will take every opportunity of working your ruin. On your behaviour much depends. There are many Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in this town, but the moſt independent among us, are obliged to walk with the utmoſt circumſpection. The very name <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> ſounds odious in the ears of a Moor.

He then deſired to know, if any of us belonged to Britain: I told him, I

did, and pointed out another young man, a native of England, and a third who came from Ireland. He then pulled out of his pocket, three dollars and gave it to us to purchaſe, as he ſaid, pipes and tobacco. You will have many dull hours, ſaid he, to paſs by yourſelves, but all of you I hope can read, and ſome of you no doubt can write. I have a large collection of books of all kinds, and ſhall be happy in ſeeing you paſs your time in reading, rather than enter into the company of your enemies, who, from your ignorance of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and cuſtoms of the country, will have many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages over you, of which they will avail themſelves. Employ your leiſure hours in books, you will find them innocent companions; ſuch of you as can write, ſhall be furniſhed with neceſſaries for, that purpoſe. Theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements will both help to make your time paſs agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and be a ſource of improvement for your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, a treaſure no accident can deprive you of in all time coming. If any of you wants any thing elſe, be not backward in letting your wiſhes be known. Mr. Bain and I have it in our power, to add conſiderably to your happineſs, without injury to ourſelves; and while you continue to befriend yourſelves, you ſhall never want our beſt offices.</p>
               <p>We attempted to thank theſe worthy gentlemen, but for my own part language was too imperfect to expreſs my feelings. I had, all my life, accuſtomed myſelf to reading, when my time would permit, but this was a
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:035035_0145_0FFFF64F0FCB03B8"/>
pleaſure I had been totally deprived of ſince I came into this country. I therefore told Mr. Hutchiſon, I would accept his kind offer with the greateſt pleaſure. He went away, promiſing to ſend us a little library next day, with writing utenſils. He punctually obſerved his promiſe, and now I thought my ſituation more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable than it ever had been ſince I ſet my foot on this inhoſpitable ſhore. I had from my firſt going to ſea, kept a journal of the little tranſactions I had wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, and gone through; and as I was now conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly behind, I thought this was the moſt proper time to make up my leeway, as our ſea phraſe is. I continued my journal, therefore, from the day we were taken by the corſair; which, without any material alterations, is the ſame I now offer to the public. Next morning Mr. Hutchiſon called to ſee how we were employed, and taking a look at my work, he encouraged me to go on with it, promiſing me any information I ſhould wiſh for, as my preſent circumſtances put it out of my power, to go abroad into the country for that purpoſe; and to him I am indebted for ſeveral circumſtances I could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe have known. In this manner I continued to amuſe myſelf for about the ſpace of a month, at the end of which, we were joined by ten French ſailors, who were in as bad a plight as ourſelves, and had met with a ſtill harder fate.</p>
               <p>In the year 1783, they had ſailed from Bordeaux for the coaſt of Guinea, but as they drew near it, there
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:035035_0146_100019A7262336D0"/>
aroſe a heavy gale of wind from the weſtward, which forced them upon this dreadful ſhore. The captain no ſooner found his ſhip aground, and like to be loſt, than he flew to his cabin, graſped a piſtol, and lodged the fatal contents in his own brain. This raſh act, which no diſtreſs could juſtify, totally robbed the crew of their remaining ſpirits, and reduced them to a ſtate of ſtupefaction. But the ſhip was going to pieces, and time was precious. They hoiſted out the long boat, and made towards the ſhore, which by that time was crowded with the inhabitants of the country, and though they expected little mercy, they were willing to protract the ſpan of exiſtence to as great length as poſſible. In the moſt beſeeching poſture, therefore, they made their approaches to them; but they had not long reached the ſhore, when a quarrel aroſe among them, the cauſe of which they could not diſcover: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a bloody battle, the victorious party ſeized and bound them, and in that ſituation left them, and went down to the beach.</p>
               <p>By this time the ſhip was gone to pieces, and the wreck coming aſhore. Among other things a puncheon of rum was caſt out, which they ſeized upon, and began to drink, till they were all in a ſtate of complete intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ication: they then continued to rage about for ſome time, after which they all fell faſt aſleep. The unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Frenchmen, who had anxiouſly watched their motions, no ſooner obſerved this, than they diſengaged

themſelves from their ſhackles, and fled to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. By day they hid themſelves, and by night they journeyed through the moſt deſolate uninhabited parts of the country, depending upon nature's ſpontaneous produce, for the ſcanty nouriſhment they received. Thus they exiſted for three weeks, when one day as they were ſeeking for food, they were ſurprized by a party of the mountaineers, who, as I already obſerved, are headed by the emperor's ſon. They kept them in their poſſeſſion for ſome days, and then carried them to the prince, who was glad of ſuch a prize, knowing that his father would purchaſe them at almoſt any price: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he ſent to inform the emperor, and to offer to ſell them to him at the rate of two hundred dollars per man. The bargain was ſtruck, and the men ſent down, by the emperor's orders, to Mogodore. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their ſituation nor ours was enviable at the time when we met, and yet. I ſuppoſe, it gave each party pleaſure to meet with the other. There is a pleaſure in ſociety, even in the moſt wretch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d condition. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party were acquainted with the language of the other, but to make up for this, the greater part of us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood Spaniſh, and in this language we recapitulated our misfortunes, and felt a mutual pleaſure in the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy they excited. It unfortunately happened, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that they had neither ſo much liberty, nor ſo many friends as we had; and as the emperor had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed them at ſo high a rate, they deſpaired of ever
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:035035_0148_0FFFF65BD4C16E48"/>
obtaining their liberty, and expected nothing elſe but to end their days in a ſtate of wretchedneſs.</p>
               <p>Six weeks after their arrival, we had an addition to our ſociety of ten men more. Theſe were the crew of a veſſel, which had been out fiſhing; they belonged to the weſtern iſles, and had been put on ſhore by the heavy gales, upon this coaſt; and being taken up by the inhabitants, were likewiſe made priſoners by the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial order. The Spaniſh language was now become pretty familiar to us, and theſe laſt perfected us ſo much, that in a ſhort time we could converſe with fluency and caſe: and though we were of different countries and religions, both national and religious differences were loſt, in the conſideration that we were all Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>For ſeveral weeks we ſpent our time in the utmoſt harmony, till one day our captain was invited to dine with Mr. Hutchiſon, and returning home in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, heated perhaps with liquor, he began to abuſe a young man, who was a great favourite with us all, to a degree that was inſufferable. He had conceived a diſlike to this young man, which had manifeſted itſelf in many inſtances during our voyage; and now, though they were on a footing, he began to ſpeak to him in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which the high mettled youth could not bear. He told him he was not now ſubject to his authority, that he was as much a ſlave as any of his men, and he
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:035035_0149_0FFFF662134A56D8"/>
ſhould certainly cure him of his impertinence if he heard any more of it. The reſt of the hands all eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed the young man's cauſe, which the captain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſwore he would revenge himſelf on us all, by having us put in chains next day; which, he ſaid, he could eaſily get done by ſpeaking to Mr. Hutchiſon. He did not forget his threat in the morning, but went to Mr. Hutchiſon to complain. This worthy gentleman was much hurt at hearing there was any diſſention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us and diſmiſſed the captain with a ſharp repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; deſiring him, in his preſent ſtate, to conſider himſelf on a footing of equality with his men, and not aſſume a power over them, till he got them again on his own element. He was aſhamed, he ſaid, to hear of Chriſtians in our ſituation quarrelling among themſelves, and if the governor heard of it, we ſhould all be put under the yoke immediately. The captain returned ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much diſſatisfied and out of humour; which the hands perceiving, and partly gueſſing the cauſe, gave him a very hearty drubbing. The French and Spaniſh ſailors, who were preſent, gave an unanimous deciſion againſt him, and the captain led but a very uneaſy life ever after, as the Chriſtian merchants, who had paid him ſome attention before, totally deſerted him, and of all that were in the priſon, ſcarce one would ſpeak to him. One very bad conſequence of this diſpute, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was a ſuſpenſion of Mr. Hutchiſon's friendſhip, who, together with the worthy Hibernian already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, had ſupplied us liberally with food, and many
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:035035_0150_100019ADA07D4A90"/>
other neceſſaries. They did not for many days come near us, and we were obliged to fall upon many ſchemes to get ourſelves ſupported. I loſt my ſupply of paper, and was obliged to give up the buſineſs of writing.</p>
               <p>Neceſſity is the mother or intention—I went to a cooper, and getting ſmall pieces of wood fit for my purpoſe, ſet about making little ſhips, and got them rigged with ſome old rags of linen. I ſoon became a proficient at the buſineſs, inſomuch, that I got a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſubſiſtence by ſelling them. I have ſold my veſſels, ſometimes, at ſix and ſeven dollars each, and even a very indifferent one brought me four or five. Thus I got myſelf plentifully ſupplied with paper and many other things I ſtood need of, and was ſometimes enabled to aſſiſt a neighbour. This too afforded me a little variety, for when I was tired of the carpenter buſineſs; I took to writing, and when I grew weary of ſtudy I again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a mechanic.</p>
               <p>For ſeveral weeks I carried on this traffic, during which time, neither of our good friends had ever cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſee us; at laſt Mr. Hutchiſon ſurpriſed us with a viſit. He found me writing, and began to enquire how I had found materials. I told him of my carpenter ſcheme with which he was highly pleaſed. He promiſed, that for the future, I ſhould be under no neceſſity to rack my invention, for a ſmall ſupply of money. He then gave me three dollars as an earneſt of future fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:035035_0151_0FFFF6639BDA0CF8"/>
and giving us many good advices, and putting a dollar into the hand of each of the reſt, he bade us adieu.</p>
               <p>We were one day availing ourſelves of the liberty granted us of walking in the Jew's-town when we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a large veſſel, making towards the harbour. The hopes of her being an American, for a few minutes raiſed our ſpirits; but we ſoon came to learn, that ſhe brought the Dutch ambaſſador and his ſuit. Upon his landing, he went to a houſe prepared for his reception, and as this was the firſt European veſſel which had arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved during our ſtay in the place, we caſt many a wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful look towards the harbour, and ſighed bitterly for that liberty, which we began to fear we ſhould never regain. One of our number ſuggeſted that the Dutch ambaſſador might eaſily obtain our liberty, if he could be prevailed with to aſk it. It was agreed, at all hands, that an application to the ambaſſador could do no harm; and as he was to ſet out next morning for Morocco, we thought no time was to be loſt. We went to his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and were readily admitted to his preſence; he heard our ſtory with a Dutch indifference, and when we had told it, he promiſed, courtier-like, to do every thing in his power for us: and courtier-like, I ſuppoſe, thought no more about us, for we never heard another word of the buſineſs. Soon after this, the Portugueſe ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor arrived, and to him, we made a ſimilar application, with the like ſucceſs. Still, however, we were in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:035035_0152_0FFFF668CC31A888"/>
of the arrival of ambaſſadors from Britain and America; from either of which we made ourſelves cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of obtaining every thing we wiſhed.</p>
               <p>About this time orders were ſent to Mogodore, to prepare for the reception of the emperor, who meant to pay a viſit to this part of his dominions, which he had never ſeen before. The town for ſeveral days, was all buſtle and uproar, preparing for his reception. At laſt the important day arrived that was to give the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants a ſight of their ſovereign. The road for many miles was lined with ſpectators. Among others, a large body of Jews went out to meet him, but to their great mortification, he ſent orders for them to diſperſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, before they approached him. The hills on every ſide were covered with the impatient multitude, who, with loud and repeated huzzas, hailed his approach. About noon he made his appearance attended by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of fifteen thouſand men, nine thouſand of which were infantry, and the reſt cavalry. This guard, great as it may appear, was but a ſmall part of his forces, for he generally keeps a ſtanding army of one hundred thouſand men, the moſt of them blacks, or ſlaves. The ſtate kept up by an eaſtern monarch appears incredible to ſuch as never have ſeen it. It is cuſtomary for the emperor, when he viſits any town in his own dominions, to do ſome generous act or other, ſuch as giving ſome magnificent preſent, granting liberty to ſlaves, or advancing ſome of his ſubjects to ſome dignity or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:035035_0153_100019B04A7571C8"/>
The wretched lay hold of ſhadows—for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days we indulged a hope that we could be of the number of them who would receive the royal clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but alas! no ſuch good fortune awaited us. The emperor entered the city in the middle of a long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, riding in a chariot, drawn by four beautiful Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian horſes. After him in other chariots followed five of his wives. And when all his guards had entered the gates, the nobility, who had aſſembled from many parts of the empire, with a long liſt of baſhaws, governors, &amp;c. brought up the rear. About four hundred camels, loaded with proviſions, corn, tents, &amp;c. were left on the outſide of the gates. The emperor went ſtraight to a now fortification, where apartments were provided for him.</p>
               <p>After witneſſing this grand diſplay of imperial dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we retired to our apartment. Scarcely could we cloſe our eyes during the whole night for alternate hopes and fears about our freedom, but in the morning, hope began to preponderate, when a meſſage was received for all the Chriſtian ſlaves in Mogodore to hold themſelves in readineſs to appear in the royal preſence. Then we almoſt made ourſelves certain that the happy hour was come. He received us in a garden ſitting croſs-legged in the Mahometan manner, on a rich carpet ſpread upon the ground, with many of his nobles about him, and part of his guard ranged behind him at ſome diſtance. We were marched, up within a few yards of him, and
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:035035_0154_0FFFF66F6AD0F7D0"/>
ſtood in the form of a ſemi-circle. He firſt addreſſed the Spaniards—"An ambaſſador from your country is ſoon expected here, when you will be at liberty to go off with him. You, Frenchman, muſt remain till your king thinks proper to ſend his uſual tribute to me, which has been ſeveral years neglected. As for you, Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, (for ſo he always called us) I have ſuffered you to live at your caſe, and you appear to be healthy and well fed. I have already told you, and I again repeat my promiſe, that you ſhall not be put to any kind of ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but I muſt, and will detain you, till that country of yours ſhall ſend an ambaſſador to treat with me, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure my friendſhip and protection for your trade." He ſat for ſometime ſurveying us, and afterwards riſing and walking towards his guard, we were remanded to the houſe of our captivity, which we again entered with heavy hearts.</p>
               <p>During the emperor's ſtay at Mogodore, he inflicted a moſt cruel puniſhment upon one of his baſhaws. He was commander of the baſhaw's band, and perhaps one of the beſt officers the emperor had. On their way from Morocco hither he had, by ſome irregular ſtep, incurred the emperor's diſpleaſure; for which he was reſolved to puniſh him. Yet the emperor found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to act with caution, and did not attempt this till ſome time after his arrival here. Having ordered him to be ſeized and brought before him, he ſentenced him to have his beard pulled out by the roots. He was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:035035_0155_100019B1F4DF9178"/>
taken from the royal preſence into a large ſquare, which was lined with baſhaws, and there openly expoſed to the cruel operation; after which he was for ever diſcharged from the preſence of his royal maſter.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the emperor remained at Mogodore, two large ſhips entered the harbour with Engliſh colours flying. One of our men who had been out walking, obſerving them, came running in with the news, when we all walked to the harbour, and learnt, to our great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that the Engliſh conſul, or ambaſſador was in one of them. This we looked upon as a joyful event, as we made ourſelves believe our liberty now was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. The guards were drawn up in order to receive this repreſentative of his Britannic majeſty, the ſhip ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the forts returned the compliment, and a great number of the nobility attended to welcome him aſhore, and conduct him to his lodgings. We did not for ſome days think proper to trouble him, till he had time to get a firſt audience of the emperor, and deliver his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents; which were twelve braſs cannons, with a large quantity of powder and ſhot, two eight inch mortars, an elegant time piece, and a muſical inſtrument. The emperor liked no muſic ſo well as the ſound of a cannon, conſequently the muſical inſtrument was given to his wives; and the people obſerved that the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul muſt be a man of conſummate addreſs, who could find out the ſecret of pleaſing, at once, both the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and his wives. After the firſt audience was over,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:035035_0156_0FFFF6782AB61CD0"/>
we made it our buſineſs to pay our reſpects to this great man; and our two worthy friends Meſſrs. Bain and Hutchiſon, did us the honour to accompany us. We gained admittance, after he had kept us long enough at the door to convince us of his dignity; when in the moſt moving terms our imagination could ſuggeſt, we preferred our petition. With all the hems, and haws, which great men make uſe of on little occaſions, he heard our ſtory. "You ſailed in an American bottom, you ſay? Why do you not apply to the great Mr. Waſhington? he is the moſt proper perſon to procure your liberty." One of the Americans anſwered him, that Mr. Waſhington had already convinced the world, that he had too great a regard for liberty to have any human being in ſlavery, if he had the ſame opportunity that he now had of ſetting him free. "Well," ſays he, "you had better apply to him. Had your country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained under the Britiſh government, you might then have had ſome claim upon my friendſhip, but as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters now ſtand, if one word from me would procure you liberty, you ſhould not have it." I then told him, that other two young men and myſelf were natives of the Britiſh dominions, and were willing to enter on board of a man of war, if he would procure liberty for us; but without deigning to anſwer us, he turned round, and with a ſtately air-walked into another apartment.</p>
               <p>Half frantic with grief, rage, and diſappointment, we returned to our own houſe. Our high-built hopes were
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:035035_0157_0FFFF67D495484F0"/>
now levelled with the duſt, and nothing but perpetual bondage could we perceive between us and the grave. In a few days afterwards, the Engliſh conſul left Mogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, and ſailed for Gibraltar; and on the ſame day the emperor took his departure for Morocco. We had been confined to our priſon ever ſince the arrival of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, but were now indulged with the liberty of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as uſual; and going one day to the Quay, to ſee a boat land, a man in a Chriſtian habit came aſhore, and ſurveying us with attention, aſked how we happened to come to this country. We were happy to hear him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs us in Engliſh, and told him our ſtory. "I am heartily ſorry," ſays he, "to find you in a country, where, in all probability, you will be confined for life. I think there is a poſſibility of your eſcaping, and if you do not get off in that manner, you may lie here till you rot. I think it is in my power to effect your eſcape, if you have ſpirit to follow my advice." We heſitated in returning an anſwer, not being certain, on ſo ſhort an acquaintance, whether or not we might truſt him. "Blood!" ſays he, "what are you afraid of? am not I your friend and countryman, a native of Ireland? and before I'd betray you, I would loſe my heart's blood. I am pilot of a Portugueſe ſchooner which lies off this harbour, take a walk and ſhew me where you live, and my life for it, I'll do your buſineſs in the courſe of a few weeks." We ſhewed him our houſe, when he haſtily took leave of us; telling us he would ſee us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. We knew not what judgment to form of this man.
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:035035_0159_0FFFF682614CCF90"/>
His ſcheme he had not told us, conſequently we could be no judges of its practicability; we therefore determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at all rates to ſay but little about the matter, till time ſhould enable us to judge of his honeſty, and the poſſibility of making good his promiſe.</p>
               <p>Next morning he paid as a viſit, and placing himſelf on a ſeat without ceremony, he pulled a bottle of bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy out of his pocket. "Come my boys," ſays he, "this will make us underſtand one another better than a whole days converſation. Here is liberty to all who dare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for it." And putting the bottle to his mouth, took a hearty ſwigg; after which he handed it round, and invited us all to follow his example. In the courſe of converſation, he told us, his name was Griffiths, that he had been ſeveral years in Portugal, but was heartily ſick of the country, and would take an early opportunity of either returning to his own country, or of going to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica. In the mean time he was ſure he had hit upon a ſcheme for obtaining our liberty, which could not fail of ſucceſs; and if we had but ſpirit to undertake it, he would defy either the emperor of Morocco, or the grand Turk himſelf to thwart it. He deſired us, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to be cautious of ſaying a word about it, till we heard farther from him. We told him there would be no danger of that, as he had not yet imparted it to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. He told us, he did not mean to impart it to us till nearer the time of its execution, and pulling another bottle of brandy out of his pocket, drank ſucceſs to
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:035035_0160_100019B751096B70"/>
all good intentions. When he had finiſhed this, he took his leave of us, bidding us keep up our ſpirits and truſt to an Iriſhman for once.—There was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> and honeſty viſible in the countenance and behaviour of this worthy Hibernian, which entirely baniſhed all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of his having any deſigns to betray us, and made us reſolve to truſt ourſelves entirely to his management and directions.</p>
               <p>Next day ſix of us agreed to take a walk into the country, we wiſhed to have ſome Moors of our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance along with us, but not finding any willing to go, we ſet out by ourſelves. We extended our walk to the diſtance of four or five miles from the town, on the road leading to Saffic, and going careleſsly on, were ſuddenly alarmed with the appearance of a caravan of mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eers, to the number of twelve, who had been at the town diſpoſing of their oil and corn. We immediately made off, to avoid them, and getting into a little plain between two riſing hills, reſolved to wait till they ſhould paſs us: but all of a ſudden we were alarmed with a diſmal ſcream, which was ſucceeded by a ſhower of ſtones, and immediately perceived them all running in upon us. We were certain, if they could lay hold of us, they would carry us into the country; and though it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exchanging one ſpecies of bondage for another, we were afraid that their treatment of us might not be ſo mild as that we had hitherto experienced; and what was worſe, our chance of getting out of the country
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:035035_0161_0FFFF68A18F93810"/>
was loſt for ever. We reſolved, therefore, to defend ourſelves to the laſt, and taking up ſtones, began a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle which laſted for an hour. On our part we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a kind of running ſight, till we had got between them and the town, and finding we had gained the point, we attacked them vigourouſly, and, though they were twice our number, they were obliged to make a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate retreat, and leaving their camels behind them, which we immediately drove off, intending to take them along with us to the town. We drove the camels on without interruption till we were within a ſhort diſtance of the town, when we eſpied at a diſtance, another body of the ſame kind meeting us, and not caring to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked in both front and rear at once, we quitted our booty, and made off the road till they paſſed us, when we made the beſt of our way to the town. It was (as Mr. Hutchiſon afterwards informed us,) a fortunate circumſtance that we came off ſo well, for had we been taken, we would in all probability have been carried to Algiers, and ſold to hopeleſs and perpetual ſlavery.</p>
               <p>A few days afterwards, we took a walk on the other ſide of the town, towards the burying ground. In this excurſion we were met by crowds of women, who had been viſiting the ſilent habitations of their deceaſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. Five of them coming up to us, made a ſtand right before us, and taking off their veils, ſhewed us much handſomer faces than we expected to find in that country. They made ſigns for us to ſtop, and though
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:035035_0162_0FFFF68E3074CCE8"/>
they were unable to converſe with us by words, they made uſe of a language univerſally underſtood—the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the eyes—and moſt eloquent and perſuaſive their rhetoric was. We had ſcarcely ſeen a Mooriſh woman's face, ſince we entered the country, and were ſtrongly tempted to take up the gauntlet. But we dreaded the conſequences, and fled from theſe bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Syrens with the utmoſt precepitation. We purſued our rout till we came to the burying ground, where great numbers were ſcattered up and down, bewailing and lamenting in the moſt pitiable manner over their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed friends. On our way home, we had ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters ſimilar to that already mentioned, the women always beginning the attack by taking of their veils and ſhewing their faces; but as we ſuſpected they only meant to lead us into trouble, we withſtood every temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.—The Mooriſh women, ſo far as we could judge, would be beautiful, had they only the delicate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions of our fair country women, to ſet off the moſt regular features in the world. But,
<q>
                     <l>The ſun that rolls its chariot o'er their heads,</l>
                     <l>Brings too much fire and colour to their cheeks.</l>
                  </q>
They are generally tall, ſtraight, and well formed, with a luxuriant crop of black hair, hanging down, almoſt to their heels.</p>
               <p>Returning to our habitation, we found our good friend Mr. Griffith's had got poſſeſſion of it before us.
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:035035_0163_0FFFF692DCAED1B8"/>
He had as uſual, brought an antidote againſt care; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lined his pockets with two bottles of brandy, which, he told us, he had purchaſed of a Jew, who made it himſelf; for, though the laws of Mahomet ſtrictly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the uſe of ſpirituous liquors and wines of all ſorts, the Jews in this country make large quantities of both, and ſell them at a very cheap rate. The brandy is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſold for two ounces, or one Engliſh ſhilling the quart, and wine proportionably lower. Mr. Hutchiſon had enabled us to aſk our new friend to dine with us; and after we had finiſhed our repaſt, we were joined by two Engliſh, who, each of them brought a bottle in his pocket, by the aſſiſtance of which, we were enabled to forget our cares, and to ſpend the afternoon together with the greateſt hilarity.</p>
               <p>Next morning Mr. Hutchiſon paid us a viſit, and informed us, that a conſul or ambaſſador from Sweden, was juſt come into the harbour, and would come aſhore immediately. We all repaired to the harbour to ſee his landing. In about an hour's time he came aſhore, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by thirty other gentlemen, ſome of whom meant to make a tour through Barbary; and others to return with the conſul to their own country. He was received with all the compliments uſually paid upon the like occaſions, and conducted to his lodgings by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of baſhaws, alcaides, &amp;c. attended with a ſtrong guard of cavalry. His coming was a joyful ſight to one of our mates, who being a native of Sweden, began
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:035035_0164_100019B8D29A8708"/>
to entertain the moſt ſanguine hopes of obtaining his liberty. Next morning he took the opportunity of calling at his houſe, and telling him his ſtory. The ambaſſador told him to make himſelf eaſy, as he would certainly apply for his liberty, and had little doubt of obtaining it. He ſet out the next morning for Morocco, and in a ſhort time a guard arrived, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct our companion thither, with intelligence, that the ambaſſador had applied and been ſucceſsful. We parted from him with heavy hearts; but ſorrow was unavailing, and we were obliged to ſubmit to our fate. We had no other hopes but from Mr. Griffith's ſcheme, and what that ſcheme was, we were ſtill ignorant, but we all determined to aſk him ſeriouſly the firſt time he came to viſit us. He did not let us wait long for an opportunity, as he viſited us daily. We told him we were very impatient to know by what means he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to effect our eſcape. "Well," ſays he, "I mean to gratify you,—my ſcheme is this: The ſchooner to which I belong lies in the bay. Some of you, I doubt not, are expert at ſwimming: I will give you notice when we mean to ſail, and the night before our depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you muſt all come down to the ſhore about twelve o'clock. Let the beſt ſwimmer come and take of the long boat, which ſhall be riding aſtern for that purpoſe, and go aſhore for the reſt, and when you get to the ſchooner, confine us all below and run off with the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. I ſhall take care to manage the captain, ſo that no bad conſequences ſhall enſue, and we can run the
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:035035_0165_0FFFF696F0EED330"/>
ſhip into Gibraltar or Cadiz, as circumſtances will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit." And now you have heard my ſcheme, how do you like it? We told him it would do admirably, and agreed to walk by his directions in every reſpect. The ſchooner, however, he told us was not to ſail for a month; and I reſolved to fill up the interim with viewing every thing worthy of notice about this town, and collect what information I could reſpecting the cuſtoms and manners of the country. In one of my rambles I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to paſs one of the churches or moſques, and as I had never ſeen the form of worſhip, I felt myſelf ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impelled to enter, and going up to the door, I learned myſelf againſt it, to deliberate whether or not I ſhould go in, immediately the door opened, and expoſed me to the view of a congregation, many of whom began to make ſignals for me to enter. Whilſt I was heſitating what to do, a Jew with whom I had ſome previous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, came ſuddenly behind me, and pulling me back with all his might, laid me ſprawling on the ground. His mode of attack enraged me to that degree, that I got up with a full intention to chaſtiſe him, but he ſoon pacified me, by letting me know, that if I had entered the moſque, I muſt either have turned Muſſulman, or I would in all probability, never have got out alive. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the chaſtiſement I intended him, I took him by the hand, thanked him kindly for his interference, and inviting him home with me, I repaid his civility with a bumper or two of brandy. Two Engliſh coopers, who were with my companions, hearing the ſtory, were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:035035_0166_0FFFF6A000FD2C80"/>
they had not followed us, and for ſome hours I could ſcarcely perſuade myſelf that I was ſafe in our own houſe.</p>
               <p>About this time a circumſtance took place ſimiliar to that of the young Jeweſs before related, but of a more fatal nature. The Moors from their ignorance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention to all kinds of buſineſs, paſs away their time in ſloth and indolence, indulging themſelves in almoſt every gratification. They are particularly fond of ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the open fields, or among the rocks on the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore. One day a number of them were enjoying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this manner, about a quarter of a mile from the town. Now it is uſual for them on almoſt all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to throw off their ſlippers, or <hi>pampooſes</hi>; and one of them awaking, haſtily thruſt his feet into his ſlippers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unſuſpicious of danger; when he received the fatal ſting of a ſcorpion between two of his toes. Whether the ſting of this had been more venomous than that of the young Jeweſs, or whether the Moor was ignorant of the mode of preventing the poiſon from operating, I cannot determine; but it proved almoſt inſtant death. His ſcreams awakened his companions, who immediately came to his relief, but could afford him none; and in about three minutes he expired, ſwollen to a ſhocking degree.</p>
               <p>We uſed frequently to go to the ſea ſide, in a body to waſh our ſhirts, and after we had performed this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:035035_0167_100019BDED0417F8"/>
and laid them out to dry, we went into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and amuſed ourſelves ſwimming till we could put them on; and as the ſun is very powerful in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they were ſoon as dry as we could wiſh. One day after we had been thus employed we were returning home, when we eſpied a great crowd of people not far from us, and going to ſee what was the matter, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved an idiot ſtanding in the middle of the crowd, holding a large ſnake in his hand. His looks and geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bore evident marks of the moſt complete inſanity; he frequently put the ſnake in his boſom, and took it out again, ſpeaking to it all the while: whilſt the crowd, with the moſt profound veneration in their looks, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ready to worſhip him. At laſt he lifted the ſnake up to his mouth and bit off its head. It muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that in Mahometan countries, a perſon depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <argument>
                  <p>A ſhort Deſcription of the Empire of Morocco—Cuſtoms and Manners of the Inhabitants; Government, Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments, Religion, &amp;c. &amp;c.—The Author and his Companions, by means altogether unexpected, obtain their Liberty and leave the Country in great haſte.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THIS vaſt empire, including Fez, Tablet, Sus, and the province of Dara, extends ſix hundred and twenty miles from north to ſouth, and ſix hundred and fifty from eaſt to weſt. It is bounded on the north by the Mediterranean ſea, on the ſouth by Teſſer, and on eaſt by Segelmeſſa and Algiers. The Algerines inhabit a large extent of country, extending along the coaſt of the Mediterranean four hundred miles, and in breadth from fifty to one hundred. The Turks, who have the government of that country in their hands, are not above ſeven thouſand in number, the Moors, or native Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, have no ſhare in it. It is a kind of ill-formed republic, under the protection of the grand Signior; but the government may be ſaid to be totally in the hands of the Janiſſaries, who advance or depoſe, elect or put to death the viceroy at pleaſure. They lately murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed four, and depoſed two of their deys, and all this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the ſpace of twenty years. Fez, which makes
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:035035_0171_100019C21DFB1068"/>
a part of the empire of Morocco, is two hundred and fifty miles long, and about as many in breadth, bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the eaſt by Algiers, and on the ſouth by Morocco. The air of this country is mild, temperate, and pleaſant, except in the months of July and Auguſt, when it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſultry. This country may be ſaid to have but one harveſt, which continues all the year round, for in every ſeaſon one may find grain or fruits of ſome kind or other growing in full perfection. At the time I was there, the then emperor, father to the preſent, appeared to be a man about ſixty years of age, ſix feet high, majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in his appearance, though mild and gentle in his words and looks. He governed a country, which may be termed the garden of the world; but the nature of the government, and the want of laws, render it a very unpleaſant country to reſide in. Liberty, property, life, and death, every thing dear to man, is in the power of the ſovereign, or his ſubſtitutes. The only reſtraint upon the will of the monarch, is the dread of aſſaſſination, and the vaſt guard that continually ſurrounds him, is by no means a ſecurity againſt ſuch a cataſtrophe; for what can be expected from a guard of ſlaves. A people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the ſweets of liberty, are anxious for the ſafety of the ſovereign, that maintains it, but the ſlaves of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm can hardly alter their condition for a worſe. Like the aſs in the fable, they muſt carry their panniers, into whoſe hands ſoever they fall. The government has a very viſible effect upon the appearance of the country. Nature does much, but nature is no where ſeconded by arts or
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:035035_0172_0FFFF6B4DE23E588"/>
induſtry. Who, indeed, will cultivate fields or plant vineyards under a burning ſun, unleſs he expects to reap the fruits of his labours; beſides the people are the moſt indolent perhaps on the face of the globe. A Moor, in the hot ſeaſon, ſeems to riſe but little above vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive exiſtence, unleſs, indeed, he is mounted on a horſe; but in the exerciſe of riding, he is active to an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon degree. Their horſes, or as they are called in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, <hi>barbs,</hi> are famous over all the world for their beauty and unparrallelled ſwiftneſs, and the riders in the management ſhew the utmoſt ſkill and agility. Few horſes in this country, are put to any kind of drudgery; camels, dromedaries, mules and aſſes, anſwering the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of carrying burdens. As they are, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, exempted from the drudgery to which that animal is ſubjected in other countries, it is leſs to be wondered at, that their breed of horſes has been ſo long famous. Notwithſtanding the extreme lazineſs and indolence of the inhabitants of this country, they are enabled to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port great quantities of corn, oil, hides, fowls, and fruits, ſuch as citrons, lemons, oranges, dates, figs, raiſins, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, &amp;c. &amp;c. to Italy, Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar, and many other parts of Europe. They likewiſe export ſome woolen cloths, leather, which bears the name of the country, indigo, cochineal, oſtrich feathers, flax, and hemp.</p>
               <p>The Mahometan religion, is the religion of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and this ſtrictly prohibits the uſe of wines and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:035035_0173_0FFFF6B7EFE0BAA8"/>
liquors; but this prohibition of the prophet is very little attended to by the rich, who indulge in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, the uſe of them, with the utmoſt freedom; and the Jews, who are the principal diſtillers in the country, and them a plentiful ſupply. Many European manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures have been attempted here, but except the weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing branch, few of them have arrived at any perfection. A merchant is a reſpectable character in this country; perhaps the more reſpected for having the emperor at the head of his claſs; for in every town and village throughout his vaſt dominions, he has ſhops kept open, ſome of which are managed by Moors, and others by Jews, who are very ready in caſe of fraudulent dealing, to inform againſt each other, as a mortal hatred ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts between them.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants are obliged to carry arms, if requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to march wherever the emperor gives orders; but as I already obſerved, the greater part of the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing army conſiſts of ſlaves, and this amounts to one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand men.</p>
               <p>The natives of Morocco are ſwarthy and very dark complexioned. The Arabs, who are the Aborigines of this country inhabit the mountains, and have a kind of government of their own. I have already mentioned the circumſtance of the emperor's ſon having gone to head them, and at this time there was ſomething like diſcipline kept up among them, and a kind of traffic
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:035035_0174_0FFFF6BCA75EEF08"/>
carried on between them and the other inhabitants of the country; but this by no means tends to create friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, on the contrary, they hate, deſpiſe and over-reach one another; and the mountaineers are everlaſtingly pillaging and deſtroying the property of the peaceful inhabitants of the plains, to ſuch a degree, that they have depopulated a great part of this fertile country. The dreſs of the mountaineers is very ſimple. A long coarſe woollen robe, thrown about them in a careleſs manner, conſtitutes the whole of it; but this is ſufficient to gratify the wiſh of unambitious nature; and in this garb, which ſerves them for every occaſion, they are as happy as the moſt foppiſh European, in the coſtlieſt attire that ever was invented. The clothes of the women are as coarſe as thoſe of the men, only they have drawers made of linen, and, theſe excepted, there is but a ſmall differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in their dreſs. The women have moſt delicate features, but the ſun gives them a tawny complexion. They ſpare no pains to pleaſe the lords of the creation; even the art of painting is not left untried. Where three or four women are, each make it the ſtudy of the day, to outvie one another, and to be choſen the companion of the night by the man, whom all wiſh to pleaſe; one need not therefore wonder, that every art ſhould be employed to captivate.</p>
               <p>In gaining this point, two paſſions are gratified, and, perhaps, diſappointing their rivals is not the leaſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of the two. It is only on particular occaſions the
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:035035_0175_100019C5F2CCBED8"/>
women are allowed to aſſociate, or ſit at table with the men, both poor and rich looking upon them as no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ſervants, or merely as toys, made for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement of the other ſex. They ſpend very little of their time with them by day; but ſhould an opulent Moor take a fancy to dine with one of his wives, he gives her previous notice of his intentions; and a viſit from a king would not make her exert her talent of pleaſing more, than a viſit from her lord and maſter. The moſt delicate diſhes are provided, and all the arts of cookery made uſe of to render them palatable. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the higher ranks, a wife is permitted to fit at the table, and partake of the banquet which ſhe has prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but among the lower orders, the wife ſtands at the back of her gormandizing huſband, till he has eat his dinner, and then ſhe will perhaps be admitted to take her own.</p>
               <p>The Jews form a very large body in this country, though they are kept in a ſtate of ſubordination, which would weary the patience of any other people on the face of the globe but themſelves. If any part of a town to is be cleared, the town major ſummonſes the Jews: and however troubleſome the taſk may be, or whatever their avocations are at the time, they are obliged to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; and during the time they are performing their work, they are abuſed and inſulted with the moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious epithets, and often beat unmercifully without any fault. They are obliged to take off their ſlippers
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:035035_0176_0FFFF6C24BBB6B00"/>
upon paſſing a moſque, or the houſe of a governor, baſhaw, or alcaide; and even if they meet any of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned ranks, they are forced to take them off in the ſtreets. The Jewiſh women are generally fair complexioned, open in their countenances, and engaging in their manners. They make conſtant uſe of paint, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that no viſible part of their body wants its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial coat.</p>
               <p>The Mooriſh women go conſtantly maſked, but the Jeweſes expoſe their faces without diſguiſe or ceremony. The men are dreſſed in a long black robe, which covers them from head to foot, with a pair of linen drawers and veſt. Their legs are bare from their knees to the feet, and they wear ſlippers, which they put their feet into, and can throw them off without any trouble; and this they are obliged to do ſo frequently, that they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have them made without any quarters, or never take them up. The dreſs of the Jewiſh women is not unlike the dreſs of an Engliſh woman, only before they are married, they never wear any cap or covering on the head, but have their hair plaited down the back, intermixed with ſilk of various colours; the richer ſort frequently have taſſels of gold or ſilver hanging down with it. They wear upon their feet ſmall ſlippers, which cover the toes, the reſt of the feet are bare, only they take care to bedaub them with a very thick coat of paint.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="unknown:035035_0177_0FFFBB972FBC7580"/>The Jews are the only mechanics in the country; and the greater part of the mercantile buſineſs of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco is likewiſe conducted by them. The genius of a Moor, ſeldom raiſes him to a degree of mediocrity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in buſineſs or mechaniſm. It is to me ſurprizing that they have ever had any kind of ſucceſs by ſea; as their nautical knowledge is ſo limited, that it is by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident only, the greater part of their ſailors find the way to their own ports. The miſeries of the ſoldiers, not in actual ſervice, are great beyond conception. They are let looſe upon the community, with no more than one ducat, or five ſhillings ſterling, per month, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon; and as they are obliged to be ready at a call, they cannot, even if they were qualified, enter upon any kind of buſineſs. Out of this ſmall allowance, they are obliged to buy all their neceſſaries, from one or other of the emperor's brokers, who generally take care to fleece them effectually; and it muſt be obſerved, the emperor almoſt ſolely engroſſes this buſineſs, and has agents in every town to carry it on for him. Some Jews, indeed, carry it on upon their own bottom, but not without paying a large ſum, annually, into the royal coffers; and in this caſe they are allowed to trade with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, till they have made a good round ſum of money; which the emperor no ſooner hears off, than he falls upon ſome method of ſecuring it for his own uſe. An inſtance happened at Mogodore, when I was in the country, which I ſhall briefly mention.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:035035_0178_0FFFF6C98F6AABA8"/>A Jew, pretty far advanced in years, had an only daughter, on whom his fondeſt hopes were built. He had amaſſed a conſiderable ſum of money, as a broker, and for this reaſon was hated by all the Moors who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ſame kind of traffic. They carried daily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to the governor, of the Jew's great riches; and at laſt the governor gave intelligence to the emperor, who immediately ſent to demand his daughter, to be taken to the ſeraglio. The unfortunate Jew could not think of enduring life without the ſociety of his darling child. The governor had her taken to his houſe, and the fond father followed in an agony of grief and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. He reſolved to try the power of money, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the governor one hundred dollars, if he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede with the emperor to have her reſtored to him. The governor was glad to find the Jew fonder of his child than his money, and aſked him how much he would give the emperor to buy her off at once. He ſaid he would willingly give the emperor three hundred, and the governor ſhould have one for himſelf. The young Jeweſs was in the mean time kept in the governor's houſe, and her father's propoſal ſent to the emperor, who agreed to let him have her back again, upon paying one thouſand, at which the governor had eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the whole of his property. The poor old Jew was forced to agree to this inhuman propoſal, which ſtript him of the gains of a whole life time, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to a ſtate little ſhort of diſtraction. After the emperor had received his all, he began to think, that as
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:035035_0179_100019CCDB7962E0"/>
the Jew had ſucceeded ſo well in trade for himſelf, it might be very proper to make him an agent for manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own buſineſs. He therefore, very <hi>generouſly</hi> lent him back three hundred dollars of his own money, to trade under the imperial commiſſion. Indeed the Jews are the only people in the country who ever think of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſing money, and are therefore ſubjected to every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of fraud and oppreſſion that deſpotiſm can invent. A Moor ſeldom lays up for a future contingency; if he finds money to anſwer his preſent neceſſities, he is rich enough, and never thinks of to-morrow.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of the inland parts of the country are a harmleſs, ſimple, inoffenſive people, and extremely hoſpitable to ſtrangers. They are as poor as oppreſſion can make them, but their poverty does not prevent them from enjoying happineſs. Naturally indolent, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the preſent, without allowing one uneaſy thought about the future to ruffle their tempers or embitter their preſent enjoyments. Placed in a luxuriant country, where bountiful nature amply ſupplies their unambitious wiſhes, without much toil or labour on their part, nothing cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates an uneaſy apprehenſion, but the deſpotic exactions of the government, or the dread of a viſit from their enemies, the mountaineers. The men and women dreſs much alike, only the drawers of the latter are longer, and inſtead of the turban, they wear a kind of caul upon their heads. The houſe of a Moor is eaſily furniſhed, a large carpet or mattraſs, ſpread upon the
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:035035_0180_0FFFF6D0341530E0"/>
floor, ſerves them for chairs and bed; and there are neither plates, knives, forks nor ſpoons to be ſeen in the houſe. Their meat is placed in the middle, in a large diſh, and after waſhing their hands, (which is ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoined by the religion of the prophet) they make them anſwer the purpoſes of knives, forks, and ſpoons. Their meat is generally boiled or roaſted to tatters, ſo that it eaſily can be divided without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a knife.</p>
               <p>The woods and deſerts are full of ſavage animals, ſuch as lions, tygers, wolves, leopards, hyenaes, and large wild bears. From the ſervice of the camel, the African derives unſpeakable advantages. This patient uſeful animal, ſeems to have been created on purpoſe for this very country. Through the barren deſert, ſcorched by a burning ſun, where vegetative life is nipped in the bud; the camel performs his painful journey, under a heavy load; the thiſtle or the thorn which he crops as he walks, is all he requires for food. Nature has furniſhed him with a reſervoir within, in which he lays up water to quench his thirſt; and with this ſupply he will travel for thirty days together, through never cooling ſands, which the dew of heaven ſcarce ever moiſtens.</p>
               <p>The cows here are ſmall, and yield but a ſcanty por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of milk; but what they give is uncommonly good. The ſheep are large, but their wool is much inferior to that of Spain. Almoſt every quadruped, found in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:035035_0181_100019CE5DD924D0"/>
is to be-found here, together with many which we have not. They have alſo a variety of fowls, which are unknown to us. Among theſe is the <hi>Caſpa-ſparrow,</hi> remarkable for its beautiful plumage, and the ſweetneſs of its notes. It is allowed to be the moſt melodious of all the winged tribe, but, unfortunately, it cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt but in its natural climate. The bays of Barbary, and all round the coaſt, abound with a great variety of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds of fiſh. I have bought a fiſh, almoſt thirty pounds weight, for a piece of money, equal in value to fix-pence ſterling; and in general, they may be had at the rate of a farthing per pound. The Moors, though poor and oppreſſed, are very numerous round the ſea coaſt. Why they ſhould give a perference to the out-ſkirts of the empire, I know not, unleſs it be to remove themſelves at a diſtance from the ſeat of a government, readier, on every occaſion, to puniſh and oppreſs than to encourage and protect them; trade with other nations cannot be their motive, as that is but trifling, and they have no veſſels of their own, but for plunder and piracy.</p>
               <p>Renegadoes, tho' not ſo numerous here as in Algiers, are not more deſpiſed by the Chriſtians than the natives. They ſeldom arrive at places of public truſt or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but are generally employed in the moſt degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding offices, and in time of war, they are ſure to be placed where there is the greateſt danger. Slaves here are very numerous, and their treatment ſuch as would melt the heart of a ſavage. In Tunis and Algiers they
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:035035_0182_0FFFF6D54F335F68"/>
ſuffer much, but it does not equal their ſufferings here. They are employed in the hardeſt and vileſt kinds of drudgery, almoſt without intermiſſion; and their daily allowance is only a pound of coarſe barley bread, ſteeped in oil, which they are obliged to eat without a moment's reſt, often holding it in the one hand, whilſt they are labouring hard with the other. At night they are loaded with heavy irons, with nothing but cold earth for their bed and pillow. Their dreſs conſiſts of a long coarſe woollen robe, with a hood, which ſerves them for hat, coat, veſt, breeches, and every thing; for they are neither allowed ſhoes nor ſtockings. They are often harneſſed in carts with aſſes and mules, and unmercifully laſhed for the very leaſt intermiſſion from labour. From the readineſs of their cruel taſk maſters, to inflict the laſh, one would be led to imagine it the greateſt pleaſure of their lives.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians of every denomination, are held in the greateſt abhorrence by the Moors; ſcarcely can they mention the word Chriſtian, without adding to it the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithet <hi>dog,</hi> and curſing moſt vehemently. Even Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean ambaſſadors have no ſecurity againſt public inſult, but are ſometimes pelted with dirt and ſtones as they walk the ſtreets. The emperor who has the ſole power of life and death, appoints the time, place and manner of all public executions. Sawing aſunder, either acroſs or dividing the body at length, hanging them up by the feet, and roaſting them before a ſlow fire, are the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:035035_0183_0FFFF6DE131325F0"/>
the emperor frequently inflicts, to the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of the ſavage populace. The renegadoes are put to death in a ſtill more cruel manner; they have a chain faſtened round their waiſt, by which they are dragged from the priſon to the place of execution, where they are anointed all over with boiling tallow, then drawn to a ſtake before a ſlow fire, where they are allowed to roaſt while any ſigns of life appear, and at laſt the breathleſs body is caſt into the fire. From ſuch wanton cruelties the mind ſhrinks back with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. I ſhall therefore change the ſubject for one leſs gloomy, namely, the ceremonial of a Mooriſh wedding.</p>
               <p>In the article of wife, the Koran is very indulgent, and admirably adapted to the voluptuous deſires of men bred in warm climates. It allows to every man as many wives as he is able to maintain; but the generality find two, three, or four at moſt, ſufficient for their purpoſes. As the ſexes are kept at a diſtance from each other before marriage, a Moor knows very little more of his future bride, than a Britiſh king or heir apparent does about his. Some female friend recommends his future help-mate, and he is either obliged to take her upon the word of the go between, or live unmarried. But the latter ſeldom happens—his imagination does every thing—the bargain is ſtruck, and the friends meet to ſettle the preleminaries. The bridegroom ſends preſents of the moſt delicious fruits, or what other entertainments he can afford, and thinks proper. The day before the
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:035035_0184_100019D009924970"/>
wedding, the bride invites and entertains her female friends, and the bridegroom his male ones, according to their rank, with muſic, dancing, and every other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement they can poſſibly command. On the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morning, the bride appears to her friends, (who then renew their viſit) dreſſed out in all the finery her cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will admit of, ſeated on a ſopha or carpet, ſurrounded by bride-maids, all as fine as poſſible. The contracting parties paſs the day, each, with their friends, in their own apartments; but in the evening the bride is conducted to the houſe of her future ſpouſe, under a veil or canopy, or carried in a ſedan, and attended by all her female friends. The bridegroom iſſues forth with his company, to receive them, dancing to the pipe and tabor. The happy couple are immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to a private apartment, the reſt of the company wait till the bridegroom declares himſelf ſatisfied with his bride, when the company parade through every ſtreet in the town, afterwards giving notice, that ſhe went to the arms of her huſband—a maid. But in caſe anti-nuptial incontinency is diſcovered, (which indeed very ſeldom happens to be the caſe) ſhe is ſent back to her friends with infamy and diſgrace, and for ever ſhut up from the ſociety of man.</p>
               <p>The Mooriſh phyſicians confine their preſcriptions entirely to ſimples and charms; and perhaps they do as little harm as any others of their profeſſion. However that may be, no man is allowed to go out of the world
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:035035_0185_0FFFF6DF99574E00"/>
without their aſſiſtance, if it can poſſibly be had. A ſolemn phiz is a neceſſary qualification, for profeſſional men in all countries; and in this qualification the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of Barbary are by no means deficient. They at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and preſcribe with an infinite deal of grimace; and when, in ſpite of all their art, they find their patient will eſcape from a bad world, and unſkilful phyſicians, they turn his face to the eaſt, and apply for ſuperior aid, till he expires. They then waſh the body with ſoap and warm water, and wrap it up in a long coarſe robe; and when the friends of the deceaſed are informed of the event, they aſſemble and carry it on a bier to the bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ground; repeating in this, as in moſt of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, "There is but one juſt God, and Mahomet is his prophet." When the corpſe is let down, every one throws ſomething into the grave, which is generally a ſtone, till it is filled up, calling out in their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, words which ſignify, "Light of God," and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying every jeſture with violent outcries and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations for the death of their friend.</p>
               <p>The emperor of Morocco aſſumes the titles of MOST GLORIOUS, NOBLE AND MIGHTY EMPEROR OF AFRICA; KING OF FEZ, MOROCCO, TIPHELET, SUZ, DARA, AND ALL THE ALGARBE AND ITS TERRITORIES IN AFRICA; GRAND SHARIF AND SUCCESSOR TO THE GREAT PROPHET MAHOMET.</p>

At firſt they are obliged to ſerve in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, and after continuing in it ſo many years, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming ſome action worthy of preferment, they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to a corps of cavalry, which in this country is eſteemed great military preferment. Their education is ſolely confined to the uſe of arms, and the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a horſe. Trained from early life to pay an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit reſpect to the commands of their ſuperiors, they know nothing but to obey. Their ſoldiers are variouſly armed, one part of the cavalry have a gun, piſtol, and ſcymet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> or broad ſwords. The naval force of this country is, as I already obſerved, on a very deſpicable footing, conſiſting only of ſeven badly rigged veſſels, little better than entire wrecks. The admiral-ſhip, which is the largeſt, mounts twenty-ſix guns, and when they are not cruizing, ſhe, with other two, lies conſtantly at Mogodore, four of the reſt winter at Larache, and one at Salce. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are laid up in the month of October, and again begin the buſineſs of piracy, or cruiſing, in March or April. It is perhaps a happy circumſtance for Chriſtian traders, that in all the dominions of Morocco, there is
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:035035_0187_0FFFF6E84F0F7418"/>
not one good port. If their ports were better, they would in all probability, make a much greater figure at ſea, and be a ſtill greater ſcourge upon the reſt of the world; but beſides this, they are extremely ignorant of the art of ſhip building, in want of proper timber, tackling, ſails, and anchors, and have neither powder nor ſhot, except what they receive from England or Holland.</p>
               <p>The Moors are Mahometans of the ſect of <hi>Molech,</hi> and are, perhaps, the moſt ſuperſtitious people in the world. They enforce, by the moſt rigid puniſhments, attendance upon public worſhip. Their moſques are open every day; but the Sabbath, or day of reſt, is Friday. The women are never ſuffered to enter the moſque, as they are ſuppoſed to attract the attention of men, and fill their minds with impure thoughts; and as they imagine they were only created for the pleaſure of man, and the propagation of ſpecies, they have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in the buſineſs of religion.</p>
               <p>The Mahometans enter the moſque barefooted, and are ſaid to behave with the utmoſt decency and decorum during their ſtay there. In ordinary life they are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exemplary in many reſpects. They ſeldom quarrel among themſelves; when they do, they ſeldom come to blows, and almoſt never commit man-ſlaughter, or murder.</p>

                  <pb n="195" facs="unknown:035035_0188_0FFFF6EB5EADB2E0"/>Swearing by the name of God, is looked upon as a crime of the deepeſt die, and is one which a Muſſulman never commits.</p>
               <p>When I have ſaid this much, however, I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned almoſt the whole of their virtues; to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance theſe, rudeneſs, jealouſy, lying, ſuperſtition, hypocriſy, diſhoneſty, and cruelty may be put into the other ſcale. To ſum up the character of the country and the people—nature here deals out her choiceſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings with unſparing hands, yet ignorance, ſuperſtition, and the tyranny of their government, conſpire to render Morocco the moſt unpleaſant reſidence on the face of the globe.</p>
               <p>By this time I ſuppoſe, the reader will imagine I have totally forgot my narrative; and yet I can aſſure him, I had no wiſh to ſtay any longer in this country than I could poſſibly get clear of it. He may remember, I told him of the plan of our liberation ſuggeſted by Mr. Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiths, in the contemplation of which, we were making ourſelves happy. A circumſtance however happened, which thwarted that deſign, and led, if not to a ſpeedier, at leaſt to a ſafer releaſe. We had been about fourteen months in the country, when the Spaniſh am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador arrived, bringing with him fifteen Moors, who had been taken and detained ſome time by the Spaniards. Theſe were not the only preſents he brought to the emperor. He brought a great variety of European cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:035035_0189_0FFFF6EF0B8347E8"/>
which he valued more than men, beſides a large ſum of money. His preſents were graciouſly received by the emperor; and this prince, like ſome of the eaſtern monarchs of old, deſired him, to ASK WHAT HE WOULD AND IT SHOULD BE GRANTED HIM. With a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, which did honour to his feelings, he aſked a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which the emperor could very well ſpare, and which ſhewed that the high character he ſuſtained, had not made him unmindful that he was a man—it was liberty for the Chriſtian priſoners confined at Mogodore, belonging to Frances, Spain, and America. The emperor very readily granted his requeſt, and next day diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a caravan to bring us all to Morocco. The caravan arrived at Mogodore the very day, on the evening of which, we were to ſeize, and run off with the Portugueſe ſchooner, as Mr. Griffiths had directed, and orders were ſent for us to ſet out immediately, as the caravan was to go eighteen miles out of town that day.</p>
               <p>We were totally ignorant of the favourable turn our affairs had taken, and ſuch a meſſage, at ſuch a time, was worſe than death to us. We made ourſelves certain that the emperor had ſold us for ſlaves to ſome other maſter, and gave up all thoughts of ever ſeeing our dear native countries more. Meſſrs. Bain and Hutchiſon had befriended us to the laſt, and now, with heavy hearts we bade them adieu. Mr. Griffiths entered juſt as we were about to depart, we told him our ſorrowful tale, but he very good naturedly told us, he had a preſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:035035_0190_0FFFF6F52F8E4160"/>
that the emperor meant to grant us our liberty. This kind hearted fellow came along with us four miles out of the town, ſaying every thing his friendly heart could ſuggeſt, to remove our ſuſpicions and lighten our ſorrow. We parted from him, not without ſhedding tears, and purſued our journey. For five days we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled through a country already deſcribed, almoſt ſtarved for want of food, and on the ſixth we arrived at Morocco, when we were ſhewn to our former reſidence, and left till next morning to our own unpleaſant reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. About eleven o'clock next day, we were all ſent for to the emperor's preſence, who was that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reviewing a part of his troops, ſeated in an elegant little model of an European houſe, ſent him by the king of Spain, and brought over by the ambaſſador already mentioned.</p>
               <p>It conſiſted of four apartments, in one of which was a bed, elegantly furniſhed. The frame was mahogany, the floor marble, and the roof was covered with a kind of blue marble which ſerved for ſlate; and all round the door and windows was adorned with gilt braſs, which in that country paſſed very well for ſolid gold. Upon this preſent the emperor ſet a high value; and I doubt not, it contributed confiderably to the procuring of our liberty. We approached him with the profoundeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, which we expreſſed by bowing almoſt to the ground. With a half ſmile in his countenance, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed us by his interpreter: "I hope your bondage
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:035035_0191_100019D2B0919418"/>
here has been eaſy—you are now at liberty—I have made a preſent of you to the king of Spain, and to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row you ſhall depart with his ambaſſador. When you go to Rabat, you will receive cloaths, and at Tangiers you ſhall have thoſe that were taken from you—you may depart." Never did I hear ſuch cheering accents, the joy they occaſioned was almoſt too much for me to bear with moderation: I would have danced, ſong, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered like a madman, had not the preſence of this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to Mahomet kept me within ſome kind of bounds. The number of priſoners, upon whom this favourable ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was paſſed, were thirty, and certainly this day was not loſt to Sidi Mahomed, emperor of Morocco, who had in the courſe of it made thirty human beings completely happy. What his feelings were on the occaſion I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine, or whether he thought at all about the matter, I know not; but from what I felt then, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, I could have wiſhed for the ſupreme power of that country, for one day in the year, that I might annually, on that day, have enjoyed the luxury of making the wretched happy.</p>
               <p>We were without ceremony hurried from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the emperor, and ſhewn into that of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane deliverer, who in the moſt cordial manner, took us each by the hand, and congratulated us upon the eſcape we had made from bondage, aſſuring us, at the ſame time, that he would looſe no time in conveying us out of the country, and that till he had accompliſhed this,
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:035035_0192_0FFFF6FCF7D47B00"/>
he did not think us ſafe. The caravan was ordered to be in readineſs at ſix o'clock in the morning, and at that hour we were all prepared; but juſt as we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſet out, a guard arrived from the emperor, with orders to detain all the priſoners belonging to France, as the emperor had determined poſitively, that none from that kingdom ſhould leave his dominions till their king ſent an ambaſſador to ſolicit their freedom. The Spaniſh ambaſſador delayed, for ſome hours, entering upon his journey, wiſhing to inform himſelf, if it was poſſible to perſuade the emperor to revoke his orders; but he found there was no hope on that ſcore, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought it beſt to ſet off, leaſt the emperor ſhould recall us all; and ſo great was the intereſt he took in our behalf, that, during a journey of four hundred miles from Morocco to Rabat, he ſcarce allowed either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or us to have a reaſonable time either to eat or ſleep, leſt the emperor ſhould ſend after us, and deprive him of the pleaſure of carrying us to Europe. Our haſte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived us of the very great pleaſure we promiſed our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in calling upon the Sardinian conſul, who had been ſo much our friend in the time of need; but our preſent chance of freedom was not to be trifled with, and as we had nothing to repay his kindneſs with but words, we followed our leader, who thought it unſafe to ſtop at Rabat, or Salee, but carried us, on the evening of the tenth day after we ſet out, ſeven miles north of the latter. During all this journey we had never, at any one
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:035035_0193_100019D7B414BF98"/>
time, ſtopped ſix hours, the benevolent ambaſſador, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always more afraid for us than we were for ourſelves.</p>
               <p>The caravan conſiſted of about one hundred Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and two hundred Mooriſh cavalry, commanded by a baſhaw and two alcaides. There were likewiſe one hundred Jews ſent with us, to ſtrike our tents, fill our water-pots, &amp;c. and one hundred camels to carry our proviſions. We arrived at Tangiers the nineteenth day after our ſetting out, happy once more to reach a port which contained a veſſel ready to carry us to Europe. The ambaſſador would not allow us to ſtop for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſhore, being ſtill afraid the emperor might change his mind and ſend after us. We therefore went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on board the veſſel, in which we were to ſail for Suto, a Spaniſh ſettlement on the coaſt of Barbary, where we were to perform quarantine for fourteen days, before we ſailed for Spain. After an impriſonment of fifteen months, expoſed to ſo many hardſhips, and with ſcarcely the moſt diſtant hope of ever being releaſed, my reader will eaſily conceive it filled our hearts with the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite pleaſure, to find ourſelves once more at liberty, and likely to reviſit our native lands.</p>

               <p>SUTO is an iſland, or rather peninſula, on the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary coaſt, a little above Gibraltar, in the poſſeſſion of the king of Spain, to which all criminals baniſhed from Spain, are exiled; and indeed few of any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination are to be found on it beſides the baniſhed and their offspring, it is but ſmall, though ſtrongly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. In the middle is a hill, at the foot of which ſtands a town; adjoining to this, there is an excellent bay, at the head of which is a pier about one hundred yards long, which ſmall veſſels can lay their ſides too, but thoſe of a larger ſize lie in the bay. During the fourteen days we had to ſtay here, we were allowed to go aſhore as often as we thought proper, and in every reſpect to be our own maſters, and diſpoſe of ourſelves as we judged proper; the ambaſſador all the while ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying us with plenty of proviſions. We were, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in a wretched condition for want of cloaths, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got no ſupply ſince we entered Morocco. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:035035_0195_0FFFF7072D7CF178"/>
it is true, had promiſed us a ſupply at Rabat, and our own at Tangiers, but we were in too great haſte to be out of his dominions, to ſtop to demand them, and the fate of the French priſoners had made us ſomewhat ſuſpicious, that a regard to his word was not to be nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the catalogue of his virtues. It was very lucky for us that we were in a mild climate, where much cloathing was not abſolutely neceſſary, and the thoughts of having regained our liberty made up for every thing.</p>
               <p>At the end of fourteen days, a frigate arrived from Spain to carry us to Cadiz, on board of which we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked, and performed our voyage in twenty-four hours. On board the frigate, the ſailors all ſtrove who could moſt oblige us, and every one was anxious to get our hiſtory; as we could converſe with them tolerably in their own language, we were able to gratify their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, by relating the moſt remarkable circumſtances. We no ſooner landed than the amboſſador took us aſhore and preſented us to the governor, and the American conſul. Our dreſs, as may eaſily be conceived was not the beſt in the world, and not altogether proper for viſiting. With a deſcription of my own, as it will be very ſhort, I ſhall preſent my reader; and this with a little alteration may ſerve for every one's in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. I had on the body and part of the ſleeves of an old check ſhirt, part of a pair of trowſers which had once been new, but now ſerved more for the purpoſes of modeſty, than for ſhelter from the cold, and this was
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:035035_0196_100019D936105500"/>
all; jackets, hats, ſhoes, and ſtockings, had long ago de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted their ſtations; and this was the wardrobe we brought with us to Europe. The governor ſurveyed us with commiſerating looks, but gave us no cloathing; and after he had converſed ſometime with the ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, apart, he told us, we muſt ſtay at Cadiz till the king was appriſed of our arrival, and ſhould grant us our liberty.</p>
               <p>Diſpatches were ſent off to Madrid, and as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ourſelves the property of the king of Spain, we thought we had no right to take any ſteps without his conſent or orders. We, therefore, reſolved to wait with patience, in hopes that his anſwer, would ſet us at full liberty to purſue our own inclinations. We were aſſigned a houſe for our reſidence, with a piſtareen each, for our daily maintenance, which furniſhed us with two good meals, which we took at eleven and four o'clock, and thought ourſelves extremely happy in having for ſauce to them, the air of a Chriſtian country. Here we had no reſtraint put upon our inclinations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently walked through the town ſeparately or to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether, as we pleaſed.</p>
               <p>One day as I was walking by myſelf in a ſtreet lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the bay, I was accoſted by a man in a ſailor's garb, who told me, he thought my face was familiar to him, and deſired to know my name. As ſoon as I mentioned it, he ſeemed much confounded. "Heavens!" ſays

he, "in what plight do I meet with you? What unkind fortune drove you to this ſhore, in this miſerable ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?" I immediately gave him the outlines of my hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, without recollecting the features of the perſon to whom I directed my diſcourſe. After I had finiſhed, I requeſted he would let me know his name, and when he had gratified me, how ſurprized was I, to find that he was one of my earlieſt acquaintances in life, who had been for ſome years my ſchool-fellow. He aſked me to go on board his ſhip, promiſing me the fight of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of my old acquaintances; I cheerfully complied with his requeſt, and found almoſt every perſon on board ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted either with myſelf or my friends, for the veſſel was from Greenock, and moſt of the hands from that part of Scotland.</p>
               <p>A long abſence from my native country made me anxious to hear news of my relations and acquaintances, and after ſatisfying me on this head to the utmoſt of their power, they went and ſupplied me with ſuch cloaths as they could ſpare, and I ſtood moſt in need of. One brought me a jacket, another trowſers, another a hat, another a pair of ſhoes. In ſhort, in a very little time I was as well rigged out as I could reaſonably have deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and after paſſing a few hours in the company of my benevolent countrymen, I returned to the companions of my adventures, altogether a different man, in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, from what I had left them. They were not a little ſurprized at the figure I cut, and wondered much how I

came by my preſent rigging I ſoon ſatisfied them on that head. Good fortune, ſays ſomebody, ſeldom come by halves. I took a walk to the harbour next day, and ſauntering along in a careleſs manner, I was again ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted.—A ſailor made up to me, and aſked me my name and country. I ſatisfied him in both, and at his requeſt told him part of my misfortunes. Looking ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly in my face, with a ſmile, he aſked me, if I did not know him? I told him I did not. "My name," ſays he, "is Hutchiſon, I was born within a few miles of your father's houſe, and I muſt beg you to go on board our ſhip, and allow me to help to rigg you." We accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly took a boat, and went on board, where I received the kindeſt treatment during my ſtay, which was very ſhort, as they were preparing to get under way.</p>
               <p>My good friend Hutchiſon gave me a jacket, a pair of ſtockings, a ſhirt, and two dollars. This was the firſt time I had been poſſeſſed of ſo much money ſince my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in Europe. I therefore reſolved my companions ſhould ſhare it, and ſending for wine to the amount of it, I told them, I would give them a treat, which they were a little ſurpriſed at, not knowing that I was the richeſt man in the company. Next morning one of our company told me, he meant to be my companion for the day, as he looked upon me to have run away with the good luck of all the company. We accordingly ſet out, but after travelling till five o'clock, we neither met with an acquaintance, nor with any accident worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording.

In the evening, after having fatigued ourſelves in queſt of we knew not what, we were returning home, when a perſon ſurpriſed me by giving me a hearty ſlap on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I never in my life recognized an old acquaintance with more ſincere joy. "You will be a little ſurpriſed," ſays he, "to find me in this country, but I have been in more towns than Tepherary, and botheration to me, if I am not happy to find that you have got out of the hands of the black complexioned emperor by fair means, for if you had made your eſcape by running off with the ſchooner, as I propoſed, and any of his corſairs had laid hold of you afterwards, I would not have given a roaſted potatoe for your chance. But where are your companions? ſhew me to them, and let me welcome them all to a Chriſtian country." We made the beſt of our way to out lodgings, and Griffiths would ſcarce ſpeak to any of my meſſmates, till he ran out and brought us ſix bottles of wine, over which we diſcourſed till towards evening. He told us he was now at liberty to accompany us to America, as he had quitted the Portugueſe ſchooner, and might go where he pleaſed. "But," ſays he, "if it ſhould be long before diſpatches arrive from Madrid, I will go before you, and tell them you are coming." We parted with our good friend in the higheſt ſpirits, and this good-natured fellow continued to viſit us every day du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our ſtay Cadiz.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="unknown:035035_0200_0FFFAFA4A286B6F0"/>It was not long till an order came down from the king of Spain to have us all ſent to America, in the firſt ſhip that ſhould ſail, at his expence, as he wiſhed to pay a compliment to his new allies. Mr. Griffiths had not, during this time, found a paſſage to the New World, and we were daily favoured with more or leſs of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and now we entertained the proſpect of being fellow paſſengers in the ſame ſhip. My countrymen too, who had ſo kindly ſupplied me with cloaths, came one day to viſit us, and told us their ſhip had been ſold the day before, and that they had formed a reſolution of accompanying us to America. A French ſhip was ſoon to ſail, and the governor ſending for us, told us he had orders to find us a paſſage in her, and proviſions for Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia. As we looked upon this province as our home, we were happy to hear of our being landed there, and waited the hour of our departure with ſome degree of impatience.</p>
               <p>In the mean while we ſpent our time very happily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The Britiſh ſailors, who had been paid off when the ſhip was ſold, ſhared with us the fruits of their labours; and this, with our own allowance, made us live comfortable and eaſy. But ſtill we were unemployed; and the bread that is purchaſed at the expence of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, never has ſo ſweet a reliſh in the mouths of men, who have inclination and ability to labour for themſelves, as that which is earned by their own induſtry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="unknown:035035_0201_0FFFF5FFED867310"/>Our ſtay at Cadiz being ten weeks, I was enabled, not only to view every curioſity in this place, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form myſelf of the nature of the country, and of the manners of the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Spain is the moſt weſterly kingdom of Europe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſurrounded by the ſea, except on the ſide adjoining to France, from which it is ſeparated by the Pyrenean mountains. On the eaſt and ſouth it is bounded by the Mediterranean, the Straits of Gibraltar, and part of the Atlantic, and on the north by the bay of Biſcay, and Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus. It is ſituated in the the temperate Zone, between the thirty-ſixth and forty-fourth degrees of north lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and is in length from the tenth degree of weſt longitude, to the third degree of eaſt longitude, being thirteen degrees from eaſt to weſt, and nine from north to ſouth.</p>
               <p>Moſt writers, who have undertaken to deſcribe this country, have, in my opinion, done it very great injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, by repreſenting the ſoil as entirely barren. It muſt be allowed, the exports from it are ſo trifling, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple but little acquainted with the country, may readily conjecture, that there is but little can be got to export, eſpecially if they are natives of Britain or America, where they are accuſtomed to ſee the huſbandman make the moſt of his poſſeſſions. But in fact the fault lies not ſo much with the ſoil as the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="unknown:035035_0202_0FFFF6029DAA7F68"/>It is impoſſible for a perſon, who has never been in Spain, to conceive the liftleſs, indolent appearance of the cultivators of the ſoil. Labour of any kind ſeems to be their greateſt puniſhment. The ruling feature of the Spaniards is pride, or ſtatelineſs of appearance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I really believe has no particular effect upon the heart, for I imagine the duties of humanity are as well underſtood, and practiſed among them, as they are among many of their neighbours: but this ſtatelineſs of appearance, and affectation of grandeur, pervades all ranks and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and even prevents the peaſant from giving that attention to labour which is abſolutely neceſſary, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the cultivation of the country, but for the relief of his own moſt preſſing neceſſities.</p>
               <p>The moſt barren mountain in the country will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſomething for the ſervice of the community; but the extreme indolence and pride of the inhabitants, will not allow them to cultivate even thoſe parts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which with the ſmalleſt aſſiſtance, would yield the moſt luxuriant produce. The richeſt and moſt delicious fruits are to be found in almoſt every plain, the ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous productions of nature: but tilling the ground, ſowing the ſeed, and reaping the autumnal fruits, are drudgeries which the indolent Spaniard can by no means ſubmit to, ſo that it is no uncommon caſe to ſee a family half ſtarved the greater part of the year, who have thouſands of acres lying without cultivation, producing
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:035035_0203_0FFFF606B2C46620"/>
nothing but food for the beaſts of the earth, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ls of heaven.</p>
               <p>It is poſſible that the nature of the government may be unfavourable to induſtry; it undoubtedly will be ſo in Spain, and every other country where the rights of people are not underſtood nor aſcertained; where the monarch can ſeize at his pleaſure, the fruits of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman's labour; and wherever an embargo is laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on human reaſon by a numerous hoſt of clergy, ſwarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all over the country, with the profeſſed intention of preventing man from exerciſing the right which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives from heaven—of judging for himſelf. But theſe unfavourable circumſtances, can never fully excuſe the extreme indolence of the people, who would rather ſtarve than labour, who have the faireſt portion of the globe parcelled out to them, and can neither ſupply themſelves nor others. Of late years it has been the faſhion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry nobility, but their claſs has never been on ſo deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable a footing in any country as in Spain. When I ſay this, I only mean in the eyes of people who have not the ſame exalted ideas of that claſs, as the Spaniards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain; for a Signior in Spain, without knowing where, or how to come by a ſupper, demands and obtains that reſpect, which the richeſt Indian nabob would receive from a populace, fond of paying every attention to the man who brings to his native country rupees enough to gratify his own avarice, and his countrymen's vanity. A good deal of Quixotiſm ſtill exiſts in Spain, but if
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:035035_0204_0FFFF60A460C5AE8"/>
this ſpirit has its abſurdities and inconveniencies, it is productive of many good conſequences. A Spaniard carries about with him an exalted ſoul; a mean or unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous action he can neither commit himſelf, nor endure in another. He pays a profound reſpect to the other ſex. The ſerious air with which he conducts himſelf may not, perhaps, be ſo congenial to the wiſhes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a young woman, as the lively ratling way of a Frenchman; but if a Spaniard profeſſes to be in love, his miſtreſs may give him credit: whereas the warmeſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of a Frenchman, paſs with the other ſex as ſo many inſtances of unmeaning gallantry. I would not be thought to inſinuate, that an illicit commerce does not take place between the ſexes in this country, as often as in thoſe countries where they are leſs ceremonious. No part of the globe has furniſhed more frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of amourous improprieties and follies than Spain, nor have they in any other country, been attended with more fatal conſequences. Jealouſy is a powerful ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in the compoſition of a Spaniard. His wife or daughter he guards with a watchful eye. Locks, bolts, and duennas are employed as barriers to keep them from the ſight of man. But ſome how or other it happens, that the caſtles moſt carefully guarded, are eaſieſt taken. Women are the ſame I ſuppoſe, in all countries, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſomething is left to their own mercy, nothing can ever be made of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="unknown:035035_0205_0FFFF60F665AA250"/>The Spaniſh ladies completely verify the truth of this obſervation. They are watched and guarded with the utmoſt attention, and yet they go as often aſtray as thoſe of other countries, when they have their time in their own hands, and their companions of their own chooſing. Maſked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>The ſtatelineſs of the Spaniard is manifeſt even in the article of dreſs. Their cloaths are generally of a dark colour, and they wear long black cloaks over all, which give them a very ſolemn appearance; but this is only the dreſs of the common people. The nobility and faſhionable part of the kingdom, have for ſome time paſt, in a great meaſure, adopted the dreſs and manners of the French: ſo that in the higher circles, the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iard has fallen off conſiderably from his natural character. Still however he meets you in a kind of reſerve.—You are as well acquainted with a Frenchman at your firſt meeting, as after twenty years intimacy; but the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of a Spaniard takes a conſiderable time to manifeſt itſelf. He ſpeaks but little, and every word with the greateſt caution. But if once you can make him your friend, he will carry his friendſhip to the moſt romantic heights; as he joins to his friendſhip a high ſenſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

He is unacquainted with deceit himſelf, and ſhould he diſcover any thing like diſhonour, or a breach of confidence in his friend, his reſentment and revenge know no bounds. The ſoul of a Spaniard is capable of riſing to the moſt unparalleled heights in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or in ſinking to the profoundeſt abyſs of vice. He is incapable of committing any of thoſe vices that have any thing like meanneſs attached to them; but if his love be once turned to hatred, he will not heſitate to take the crueleſt methods of gratifying his revenge, but plunge the dagger or ſtilletto without heſitation or remorſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the boſom of the man, by whom he ſuſpects himſelf injured.—The diſcovery of the New World, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the worſt thing that ever happened for the proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of Spain. A taſte for adventure and independence, upon diſcovery of the riches of Mexico and Peru, took poſſeſſion of the public mind in the days of Pizzaro and Cortes, which has never yet been extinguiſhed. This has made them liſtleſs and indolent in the cultivation of a country, which, with the ſmalleſt induſtry, would be a ſource of certain wealth, comfort and happineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="unknown:035035_0207_0FFFF615A10A4468"/>A taſte for gallantry is the univerſal paſſion in Spain, but their gallantries are carried on with an infinite deal of ceremony. They are very fond of the amuſement of dancing; and from this amuſement no rank or age think themſelves excluded. The grand-mother thinks herſelf as well entitled to this indulgence as her grand-daughter, and frequently the three generations join altogether in the ſame dance.</p>
               <p>The Spaniard riſes in the morning, adjuſts himſelf for matins, or morning devotions, which he attends very regularly—dines at noon—ſleeps after dinner—goes to walk, or to veſpers in the evening, and ſo finiſhes the day. They are not like the Engliſh, fond of diſcuſſing politics, or hearing news; few of the peaſantry know any thing of what paſſes in Madrid, much leſs of the tranſactions of other countries. The ladies are ſuperbly dreſſed in all viſits of ceremony, though they dreſs very plain to go to maſs, inſomuch that it is difficult at matins or veſpers, to diſtinguiſh the lady of quality from the waiting-maid. Men of all denominations wear ſwords, without which they cannot be dreſſed.</p>
               <p>Superſtition robs the country of a treaſure it can very ill ſpare—a third part of the labour of the peaſant. The vaſt number of holy days obſerved through the year, are a great drawback upon induſtry; and the very great number of prieſts, friars and nuns, who vow perpetual celibacy, is robbing the country of its greateſt riches,
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:035035_0208_0FFFAED3075EFE50"/>
by preventing the increaſe of population; and when to theſe conſiderations we add the vaſt emigrations to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, which annually take place, we cannot wonder that this fertile country ſhould neither be half peopled nor cultivated. But of all the engines of ſlavery ever produced in the world, the terrors of the Inquiſition are the moſt dreadful. The ſupreme office of the holy tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, as it is called, is in the metropolis; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of an inquiſitor general, five counſellors, (whereof one muſt be a dominican friar) a procurator, two ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of the council, an alguazile, a receiver, two repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, two qualificators, and a whole legion of familiars, or ſpies, who make it their buſineſs to enter into all companies, and watch the unguarded moment to betray. In moſt of the cities of the Spaniſh dominions, offices are kept open, and branches of this infernal traffic eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and were the Spaniards as ready to ſpeak their minds, either about religion or politics, as the Engliſh, there would in the courſe of a year be many an <hi>auto de fe.</hi> Luckily for them, however, they are poſſeſſed of the negative virtue of taciturnity; and whatever are their ſentiments, they make nobody the wiſer.</p>
               <p>With regard to the government of Spain I ſhall ſay nothing—only this, that the king is the fountain of honour; and that to this fountain all the nation look up: and as honour is in greater eſtimation than riches, independence is but little felt, or poverty little complained of, even among the moſt indigent: but the
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:035035_0209_0FFFF619C3D1F378"/>
time may come when trade and commerce will extend their influence, even to Spain, and then the infallible conſequences will be, the nobility will think more of the peaſantry, and the peaſantry lower their notions of the nobility. But it is time for me to drop the hiſtory of a people ſo well known to my countrymen, and to proceed with my narrative.</p>
               <p>We were all ſummoned to appear on board the French ſhip one evening when we little expected it. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we repaired each to our quarters, happy in the thoughts of once more reviſiting the land of liberty. There were fourteen Britiſh and American paſſengers, nine Frenchmen, which was the number of the hands, and our old friend Griffiths, who had kept his reſolution of accompanying us to Virginia. With a favourable breeze we left the bay of Cadiz, for the weſtern world, and paſſed the Madeiras on the ſixth day after our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. But on the ſeventh our favourable breeze left us, and a gale blew from the ſouth; which, nevertheleſs, allowed us to lay on our courſe.</p>
               <p>We had this wind for fourteen days, when it removed to the eaſt, and would ſcarcely carry us through the water three knots an hour. Our captain, who was the moſt complete puppy I ever ſailed with, began to tell his men he muſt put them all to ſhort allowance, as the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was like to be tedious. He immediately put his threat in execution, and began to feed his hands
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:035035_0210_0FFFAEF154C3C008"/>
with horſe beans, at every meal, and, except now and then, we were enabled to ſpare them a ſmall morſel of our allowance, this was the whole of their fare.</p>
               <p>Our paſſage proved moſt diſtreſſing; frequent gales reduced us to the utmoſt extremity. Our captain was as obſtinate as a mule, and would not be adviſed by any one on board, conſequently, our dangers were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and our paſſage, in even ſenſe of the word, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable.</p>
               <p>We had no concern in the management of the ſhip, but were like ſo many paſſengers on board of tranſports; and every one of my readers, who has been in that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, knows that it is not the moſt eligible.</p>
               <p>Our paſſage was tedious, but at laſt we diſcovered the land; about midnight, ſome of the hands giving the welcome intelligence, we all got upon the deck, and could ſee the American ſhore, to the ſouth of Cape Henry. At day-break we got a pilot on board, and proceeded up the bay.</p>
               <p>Four days afterwards we arrived at Alexandria, and were met and welcomed by every one in the town, who knew, or had ever heard of us. Every one was anxious to hear the ſtory of our captivity, to relieve our wants, and make us forget our long and painful bondage. On our part, we were no leſs happy to meet with our old

                  </gap> pleaſing reception we met with, half-compenſated for all our ſufferings.</p>
               <p>An American has very little of the Frenchman about him. His invitations are not ceremonious, but they are from the heart. Many invitations we were obliged to refuſe, for this day at leaſt, as we had agreed among ourſelves, before we caſt anchor, to make our firſt viſit to a houſe where we were all acquainted, in order to ſpend the day all together. Thither we went, and were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſurrounded by almoſt every perſon in the town, who had the ſlighteſt acquaintance with any of us.</p>
               <p>We ſpent the moſt pleaſant day I ever experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. I had yet neither got myſelf rigged out with cloaths, nor any birth to enable me to make money to purchaſe them; but I was in the land of liberty, plenty and peace, I never beſtowed a thought on to-morrow, and ragged as I was, like the firſt pair in paradiſe, I knew not that I was naked. We told our ſufferings to a multitude of both ſexes, and many of our female friends, like Deſdimonia, "loved us for the dangers we had paſſed:" and "we loved them that they did pity us." After ſpending a very jovial afternoon, we ſallied forth into the ſtreets, and in walking down to the river, I was met by an old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, one Farria, mate of a brig which traded to Philadelphia. I did not like to make myſelf known to him, and therefore took to the other ſide of the ſtreet, but I could not paſs unnoticed. He immediately ran
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:035035_0212_0FFFF6238DEE8358"/>
to me, and took me by the hand. I had divided all the clothes I had got, among my meſſmates, and conſequently my preſent appearance did not by any means indicate affluence. "Heavens!" ſays he, "what a figure you are! Where have you been? Have the Turks laid hold of you, and left you no better cloaths? I live, ſays he, near by, here is the houſe, (pointing to a ſtore that ſtood on a wharf) I will not take you from your friends now, but beg I may ſee you to-morrow, and I will give you new rigging." I was highly pleaſed with the offer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to accept of his invitation.</p>
               <p>We went back to the houſe we firſt entered, and ſpent the evening to our mutual ſatisfaction. Our friend Griffiths, who was the merrieſt man in the company, helped to enliven us all, by mixing every now and then a ſtroke of that humour, which his countrymen bring from the cradle, and by giving us a bottle of wine to enable us to reliſh it. For my own part, I enjoyed that evening a happineſs to which I had long been a ſtranger, and often bleſſed the memory of Columbus, for having diſcovered a country, where ſo much peace, harmony, liberty and plenty, may be attained without any violent exertions to come at them.</p>
               <p>The next day we were ſent for to the houſe of our owner, colonel Howe, who received us with the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt expreſſions of joy for our deliverance. He told us, he had made ſeveral applications to Congreſs about pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:035035_0213_0FFFF62514B08240"/>
our liberty, and was willing to have paid half our ranſom out of his own pocket; a perſon, he ſaid, was actually nominated to go and treat for our freedom, when the news arrived of our having obtained it by means of the Spaniſh ambaſſador. He enquired parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly about the treatment we had received, and finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the interview by putting into the hands of each, a preſent of eight guineas. This was a ſeaſonable relief to us all, for my own ſhare I laid out a part of it on ſuch cloathing as was abſolutely neceſſary for the preſent, and as my fortune had been ſo very indifferent in this quarter of the globe, I determined at all events to ſee my native country. A new veſſel was upon the ſtocks here, getting ready for Britiſh owners. The captain was a countryman of my own, and I reſolved to go as a hand to Port-Glaſgow, whither ſhe was bound. It was the middle of the bleak month of December before we were ready to ſail, and on the fourteenth of that month we left Alexandria, after I had taken leave of all my friends, particularly of Mr. Griffiths, whom I left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind with the utmoſt reluctance; but he was reſolved, he ſaid, never to reviſit Ireland till he could purchaſe a few acres of land, and a little cabin to lay up in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the winter of life. We had a part of our cargo to take in at Yeokomaco, and it was not till the fifth of January that we got all ready for ſailing. We ſailed down the ſpacious bay of Cheſapeek, and took our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from Cape Henry with a favourable breeze. At midnight, however, we were alarmed with a call of
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:035035_0214_0FFFAEE98FDAF1D8"/>
"All hands;" and running upon deck, found both pumps employed, and from three to four feet water in the hold. After labouring at the pumps for ſome hours, we could perceive we were gaining ground, and at laſt got the veſſel almoſt dry. At day break, to our great joy, we diſcovered a ſail ſteering the ſame courſe with ourſelves. We hove too for her coming up, and upon her nearer approach, found her to be the John, of Hull, bound for that port; we told them our condition, and begged they would ſtay by us for a day or two, to which the captain agreed. During all this time we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly employed at the pumps, but we reſolved to run every riſk rather than deſert her; and telling captain Brown, of the John, our reſolution, he wiſhed us a good voyage, and left us.</p>
               <p>During the whole of our paſſage, one pump was kept almoſt conſtantly employed; but our ſhip was new, our ſails and rigging good, the wind was fair, and the hopes of a quick paſſage made us ſubmit the more readily to inceſſant toil and fatigue. The twenty-third day after our departure, we obſerved the water change its colour; and trying for ſoundings, we found, to our great comfort, that we were in eighty fathoms water, and in one day more diſcovered the land to the ſouth of Dublin. The ſtrong gale we had for ſometime been favoured with, ſtill continued, and carried us rapidly up the channel, and we landed at Port-Glaſgow the twenty-ſixth day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our departure from Cape Henry.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="unknown:035035_0215_0FFFF62CCB89F2F0"/>Thus was I once more landed in my own country, rich in experience, but without any other kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; and to mend the matter, the captain refuſed paying a farthing of my wages unleſs I returned to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia in the veſſel. I never could worſe afford to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſuch a loſs. My wardrobe ſtill was very ſcanty, and the thoughts of going to ſee my friends in the plight I was in, but ill accorded with my wiſhes or inclinations. For ſeveral days I ſtayed on board, heſitating what to do, without ſending word of my arrival to my friends. However, a young man from the neighbourhood where I was born, had by accident ſeen me the day after our landing, and by his means intelligence was conveyed to my father, who immediately diſpatched a meſſenger, with orders to come and ſee him, under pain of his laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpleaſure. I had counteracted his intentions often before, eſpecially in going to ſea at firſt againſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and in all the croſs accidents of my life, this conſtantly reproached me, I determined therefore, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to add to his uneaſineſs, nor my own, by diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his injunctions, and leaving my ſhip and wages, ſet out for Ayreſhire, where I was received with open arms by all my friends, and ſupplied with every thing I ſtood in need of.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A Voyage to Canada.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I had not been many weeks at home, when I found myſelf weary with the want of employment, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together out of my element. I therefore, reſolved to embrace the earlieſt offer of going again to ſea, and an opportunity ſoon offered from a port in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to viſit a part of America, which I had never yet been in, namely Canada.—Four miles north of Irvine, lies Saltcoats, a ſmall ſea-port town, the trade of which is under the inſpection of the Irvine cuſtom-houſe. From this port a ſhip was ſoon to ſail for the above-mentioned country; and hearing they were in want of hands, I went and engaged as one. We took on board a loading of coals, to be delivered at Cork, and on the thirteenth of March, 1787, I again ſet out for the New World. On the nineteenth we had got within about a day's ſail of the Cove of Cork, when the wind veered ſuddenly round to the ſouth, and blowing very hard, we found we ſhould not long be able to contend with it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we bore away for Dublin harbour, which we could ſtill command. On the hill of Howth, which lies at the mouth of the bay, is an excellent light-houſe, which ſtanding high ſhews light at a very great diſtance at ſea,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:035035_0217_0FFFF6359C917230"/>
and as night was faſt approaching, and the tide anſwered, we thought this our wiſeſt courſe, and accordingly reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the harbour in ſafety.</p>
               <p>Being got into this harbour, we thought it beſt to diſpoſe of our cargo; and having done this, we took in ballaſt, and purſued our voyage to Cork, where we were to take in proviſions for the Britiſh army in Canada. Upon the firſt of April we ſailed from Dublin, and on the third we caſt anchor at the town of Paſſage. We were employed till the ſeventeenth in getting our load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on board, and on the eighteenth we ſailed from Cork, with a ſteady and favourable breeze.</p>
               <p>On the twentieth we took our departure from Cape Clear, and directed our courſe for the river St. Laurence. At this ſeaſon of the year in Britain, the winter gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is over, and the weather grows milder; but we were bound to a country where winter pays a longer viſit. We continued our cruize, and on the eighth of May we judged, by the extreme coldneſs of the weather, that we could not be far from the coaſt; but on the morning of the ninth we found ourſelves ſurrounded by ſeveral iſlands of ice, which convinced us the gulf was not yet paſſable. On the tenth we came in ſight of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſhips, ſome of which were froze up, and could not move. We began to be alarmed for our own ſafety, and making every exertion in our power, we at laſt got clear, and meeting with the Mentor of London, the
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:035035_0218_0FFFAEF76D371E78"/>
captain informed us of his having been in company with twenty other merchantmen, who had been frozen up for ſometime, and that he himſelf had been fourteen days in that condition, and had ſuſtained conſiderable damage from the ice, inſomuch, that he was obliged to throw a conſiderable part of his cargo overboard, in order to find out the holes made by it. He likewiſe told us, it would be impoſſible to reach our port, and for his part he meant to run for ſome port in Newfoundland, and wait till the body of the ice broke. Our captain thought it prudent to follow his example, and accordingly we both made the beſt of our way for Port-Amboy, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious harbour for the ſafety of ſhips; but the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is uninhabited in the neighbourhood, except in the fiſhing ſeaſon, when the fiſhermen reſort to it. It is ſituated in nearly forty-five degrees north lat. and is fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-nine degrees weſt of London. Here for a few days, we occupied our time in fiſhing and fowling, finding plenty of divertion in either line; ſcarce a day paſſed over our heads that we did not kill great numbers of ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe, ducks, partridges and pigeons, which ſwarm all over this country; and when tired of this exerciſe, we took to the amuſement of fiſhing.</p>
               <p>One day in walking along the ſhore, our captain could perceive ſomething at a diſtance like part of a ſhip's wreck, and returning to the veſſel, we hoiſted the long-boat, and made towards the place, and upon coming up to it, eſpied four pieces of cannon; with part of the
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:035035_0219_0FFFF63A29C6D300"/>
ropes, ſails and rigging of a ſhip. Theſe we got on board of the boat, and returned to the ſhip, well pleaſed with our prize.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we lay here, our fleet was daily augmenting till the twenty-fourth, when a French veſſel arriving, told us that they had come down from St. John's, and that the gulf was perfectly clear. Upon hearing this, we prepared for ſailing, and early next morning we weighed anchor, and ſtood up this immenſe gulf, till on the twenty-eighth, we arrived at Quebeck the capital of Canada, where we came to anchor. The river at Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck is not above one mile broad, though at the iſland of Orleans which is only a little below, it is in breadth four or five leagues, and from the river narrowing thus ſuddenly, the city is ſaid to take its name; <hi>Que-beck,</hi> in the Indian language, ſignifying a ſtraight or narrow place. Our captain immediately went aſhore, and was ordered by an agent from the victualling office, to weigh anchor again, and ſail for Montreal, as the garriſon there was in great want of proviſions. As the wind was fair no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was to be loſt; we therefore ſet ſail next day. Twenty leagues above Quebeck the tide began to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and conſequently the current againſt us was very ſtrong.</p>
               <p>The diſtance from Quebeck to Montreal is about one hundred and ſeventy miles. On the banks of this river the houſes are ſo plentiful; that it appears like one
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:035035_0220_0FFFF640AA5E7750"/>
continued village. Large plantations, and gentlemen's ſeats appearing in continual ſucceſſion. After paſſing the iſland of Riclieu, the weather became ſo extremely mild and pleaſant, that we began to think ourſelves tranſported into another climate. The iſland of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal is about thirty miles in length, and twelve in breadth. The town is built at the foot of a mountain, about half a league from the ſouth ſhore. It is ſurrounded by a wall, flanked with eleven redoubts, which ſerve inſtead of baſtions. The ditch is eight feet deep, and proportionably wide. Here is alſo a citidel, the batteries of which command the ſtreets of the town, from one end to the other. The town is divided into two parts, the upper and the lower, in the laſt of which merchants, mechanics, and men of buſineſs reſide. The hotel-dieu, the royal magazines and armoury, are likewiſe placed here. In the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town however, are the principal buildings, ſuch as the palace of the governor, the pariſh church, and free-ſchool, beſides many other piles which have a princely appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the neighbourhood has a beautiful aſpect; the whole adjoining country being cultivated and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed with many delightful villages. The harbour is formed by a ſmall iſland, which lies at a convenient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the beech, and forms a very ſafe port. A number of large veſſels may lay their broad ſides to the beach, ſo that there are no wharfs, as in moſt of the American ports.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="unknown:035035_0221_0FFFAF15A6A474C0"/>Two miles below Montreal are the <hi>rapids,</hi> a declivity of the river, where the current runs ſo ſtrong, that ſhips frequently lie a long time before they can get over, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to wait for the aſſiſtance of a ſtrong caſterly wind. This current often runs at the rate of eight or nine miles in an hour, and veſſels frequently take ſix or ſeven weeks to perform a voyage from Quebeck to Montreal, though we were lucky enough to accompliſh it in thirty-ſix hours. On our arrival, we found the garriſon had very urgent demands for proviſions, and as we were the firſt victualling ſhip that had reached the port for the ſeaſon, we met with a welcome reception. The troops joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſted us in diſcharging our cargo, and in a very ſhort time we were clear. We employed ourſelves for a few days in cleaning the ſhip, and overhauling the rigging, and then took on board part of another cargo, conſiſting of wheat, and were to ſtop to complete our quantity at Quebeck.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the month of July we left Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal, and had a moſt delightful paſſage down a river, either ſide of which exhibited a country adorned with nature's moſt elegant vegetable productions. Here the ſpring is rapid in its progreſs, and a few days will alter the appearance of the country ſo much, that one can ſcarcely know it for the ſame; and were not this the caſe, in its ſhort ſtay, it would be inadequate to the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt a long and dreary winter, which generally is prolonged for eight or nine months of the year.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="unknown:035035_0222_0FFFF64337414768"/>We had to touch at the lake of St. Thomas, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unacquainted with the channel, we run our veſſel aground; but as the bottom was of ſoft clay, we got off without any material damage. Next morning we found out the right channel, and as we meant to take in a ſmall quantity of wheat here, we ſent our boat aſhore, and in the courſe of the day had what wheat we were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all put on board, and next morning we proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Quebeck, where we arrived ſafe.</p>
               <p>On the morning after our arrival, I had liberty to go aſhore, and my firſt excurſion was to ſee the ground where the brave general Wolf, in the moment of victory, courageouſly fell, fighting for his country. I ſurveyed the remains of the ditches and entrenchments which had been formed on the memorable occaſion. On the ſpot where the general fell, is the remains of a ſmall monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment erected to his memory. I approached the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſpot with reſpect, and felt within me a ſecret pride that I could call myſelf a Briton.</p>
               <p>Leaving the plains of Abraham, I viewed the ground on which the French army had been encamped, which is a beautiful level, under the protection of the city forts. The back part of Quebeck is encloſed by a wall about ſixteen feet high, and on the top is placed a row of cannons, at regular diſtances.—The harbour is flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with two baſtions, above one of which is a demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtion, and on the ſide of the gallery of the fort, is a
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:035035_0223_0FFFF644C3FAAD40"/>
battery of twenty-five pieces of cannon; above this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, is a ſquare fort, called the citadel; beſides theſe, there are ſeveral other large batteries and fortifications, which would render the taking of this place a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult enterpri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e.</p>
               <p>The moſt conſiderable towns in Canada, are Quebeck, Trois Riviers, and Montreal; but Quebeck is the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. It contains from ſeven to eight thouſand inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and was begun to be built by the French in the year 1608, who had taken poſſeſſion of the country in the year 1525, and retained it till 1759, when it was conquered by the Britiſh, and confirmed to them by the peace of 1763. This city is divided into the upper and the lower towns. The banks of the houſes of the latter are placed againſt a rock, on which the former ſtands, and an eaſy aſcent is made from the one to the other, by ſteps cut out of the rock, for foot-paſſengers, and at another place by a gentle declivity, which opens a paſſage for all kinds of vehicles.</p>
               <p>Here is an Epiſcopal palace, which ſtands upon as pleaſant a ſituation as imagination can conceive.—On one ſide of an elegant ſquare ſtands a cathedral, and on the oppoſite ſide a Jeſuit college; the reſt of the ſquare is filled up with very handſome buildings. The hoſpitable is pleaſantly ſituated, and contains two wards, one for men and the other for women. There is likewiſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, which at this time was ſaid to contain a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:035035_0224_0FFFAF0E3A0D9E38"/>
number of devotees. To deſcribe every ſquare and public building would be an endleſs taſk, I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cloſe the deſcription of this city, and give a ſhort ſketch of the country.</p>
               <p>The neighbourhood of Quebeck, and indeed all the banks of this large river, is beautiful beyond deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At this enchanting ſeaſon of the year, the moſt luxurious foliage covers the fields, and the meadows ſend forth the moſt delicious flavour. Pears, peaches, plumbs, and apples, with many other kinds of fruit, are here produced in the greateſt abundance. Wheat is ſown in the month of May, and reaped in the month of Auguſt. The rivers and lakes are full of fiſh of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds, which furniſh the inhabitants with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſupply. This is the appearance of the country in ſummer; but alas! their ſummer is but ſhort-lived, and their winter produces an awful reverſe; then the rivers are all frozen up—all intercourſe by means of naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is totally at an end. For ſix, ſeven or eight months, every field is covered with ſnow, frozen as hard as the ſurface of the water. The half-frozen inhabitants can hardly find fuel to keep themſelves from ſtarving. All this happens in a latitude, which in Europe is moderate and pleaſant.</p>
               <p>The Indians of this country, with whom the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean ſettlers carry on a conſiderable trade, are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very tractable and humane.—They are, during the
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:035035_0225_0FFFF64D87D33450"/>
ſummer ſeaſon, to be found upon the river ſailing in all directions, in little canoes, in which they generally carry about with them all their families, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fond of ſpirituous liquors, and a glaſs or two of brandy, ſeaſonably given them, will often help the dealer to a very advantageous bargain. So long as they can by any means obtain this, they are ſure to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated, and will ſtay as long in a place as any kind of liquor is to be had in it, and then betake themſelves to their wild habitations.</p>
               <p>Theſe aborigines of the country, carry on a kind of barter with the European ſettlers, by furniſhing them with beaver, deer ſkin, &amp;c. in return for which they receive trinkets, and toys of various kinds, coarſe duffles, blankets, hatchets, tomahawks, liquors, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco. The ſkin of a beaver is one conſiderable article of trade from this country to Britain.—The natural hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of that animal is ſo well known, that I ſhall not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a particular account of it. I ſhall only obſerve, that in regulating and conducting the buſineſs of their commonwealth, and in conſtructing their winter habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, they not only leave all other gregerious animals, but even man himſelf in his natural ſtate, greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. The Newfoundland dogs, are remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble over all the world for their ſagacity, fidelity, and uſefulneſs. They are employed in this country for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny domeſtic purpoſes, and perform the taſk required of them, with a wonderful degree of exactneſs and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:035035_0226_0FFFF650971F3850"/>
They can eaſily be taught to carry any thing committed to their care, wherever they are directed. They have carts and harneſſing made on purpoſe, in which they will tranſport a large loading to a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance. By their aſſiſtance the butcher and baker are enabled to convey, with eaſe, their goods to their different cuſtomers. Maſters of veſſels, by their means, have all ſorts of proviſions brought to their ſhips; fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are by the ſame means ſupplied with water and with fuel. In ſhort, this faithful domeſtic, with a little training, anſwers ſo many purpoſes, and is ſo uſeful, both by land and water, that an extirpation of the ſpecies would be a very ſerious misfortune to this country. I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen of them in other countries, but I am apt to think they loſe ſomething both of their valour and tractableneſs, when carried to warmer climates.</p>
               <p>The reptile race is at leaſt as numerous here as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of North America. The rattle-ſnake, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, ſeems to thrive remarkably on this ſoil. They ſometimes are found of the amazing length of fourteen, fifteen, and ſixteen feet, with a proportionable thickneſs. Fortunately, however, the noiſe they make in moving, prevents the bad effects that would otherwiſe happen, as they are certain to give warning of their approach, by the rattling of their tail, by which means the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is enabled to avoid their venomous bite.—The al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inexhauſtable foreſts here, produce a variety of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds of trees. The pines, which are of two
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:035035_0227_0FFFF6542697E200"/>
ſorts, the red and the white, from both of which pitch and tar may be extracted; ſeveral kinds of firs, which grow to an amazing ſize, and furniſh excellent maſts for ſhips; the cedar and the oak are likewiſe both diſtinguiſhed by the qualities of white and red; and the maple, which generally grows on an elevated ſituation, and makes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent houſhold furniture, is likewiſe diſtinguiſhed by the qualities of male and female. But it would be an endleſs taſk to particularize the various ſorts of trees and vegetables, which cover the face of this wonderful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. I ſhall therefore proceed with my narrative.</p>
               <p>In a few days our loading was completed at Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck, and we loſt no time in weighing anchor. We ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down the river about thirty leagues, when we ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for ſome time to take in ſpars. We caſt anchor, and ſeven of us, among whom was the captain, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore and began to cut down trees; but we had not been long at work, when our captain, who was at ſome diſtance, came running to us breathleſs, and calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to make haſte, as a large body of Indians was at no great diſtance. None of our number had a mind to truſt to their mercy, we therefore, with all poſſible haſte got our trees into the water, and tying them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as well as we could, got into the boat; but we then diſcovered that one of our comrades was a miſſing: we waited for him in the moſt dreadful ſtate of anxiety; none of us being hardy enough to venture through the woods in queſt of him. At laſt we eſpied him running towards

as with all his might, and reaching the ſhore, he lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>We again entered the immenſe gulf, and having made cape St. George, the wind ſetting in from the ſouth eaſt, began to blow very violently.

being to the bay of Cadiz, where we were to deliver our cargo. Nothing remarkable happened du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a very pleaſant paſſage; we reached Madeira on the twenty-eighth of Auguſt, and then directed our courſe for cape St. Vincent, the moſt weſterly point of Spain, lying in lat. thirty-ſeven degrees, and longitude nine, weſt of London. This cape we made on the ſixth of September, and arrived at Cadiz on the ninth. We did not get product, or liberty to land, till the twelfth.</p>
               <p>Our captain during the time of our diſcharging, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to procure a freight either up the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean, or to the coaſt of Barbary, but could not ſucceed for either. We were therefore, obliged to take in bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt, and proceed up the Mediterranean to Alicant, where we expected to get a cargo of ſalt for Cork. Upon the fifth of October we left Cadiz, and ſtood for Cape Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel, or the mouth of the gulf, which we made on the ſeventh. Here the current always runs eaſtward, and if the wind happens to be from that direction, it makes a very crooked ſea. Very luckily for us we had a ſtrong gale from the weſtward, and upon the eleventh we found by our obſervation that we were right abreaſt of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

It is ſeated at the foot of a mountain, and is only a ſmall town, but one of the richeſt and beſt defended of any of the fire in Spain. A very conſiderable trade is carried on from it to almoſt every nation in Europe; and the Engliſh, French, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, and Dutch, have each a conſul reſident here.</p>
               <p>The caſtle, like that of Edinburgh, ſtands upon a high rock, and is, undoubtedly, a very ſtrong place; notwithſtanding it was taken by the Engliſh in the year 1706. It was again retaken by the French and Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, after a ſiege of two years; during which, part of the rock on which it ſtands was blown up.</p>
               <p>Alicant is remarkable for the flavour of its wines, and the excellent fruits of all kinds it produces. It is, however, greatly deficient in one neceſſary article— freſh water; for in dry ſeaſons, ſcarce a drop can be got. Large quantities of fiſh are brought here from New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundland, by the Britiſh, in return for which they take wine, brandy, and fruit, all of which articles are plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and cheap.

               <argument>
                  <p>A Voyage to the Hebrides, Denmark, and Pruſſia.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE extreme deſire of ſeeing the world, by which I had ever been governed, was not yet abated, what I had ſeen ſerved but the more to increaſe it; my only ſtudy was how to vary the ſcene. I had ſeen the manners of the ſouthern nations, and now wiſhed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine thoſe of the northern. I had not been long at home till an opportunity preſented itſelf of gratifying my deſire. A brig, from the Clyde, was to ſail for Copenhagen and Memmil, and as this was a voyage greatly to my mind. I engaged as a hand. We ſet ſail, with a favourable wind for the Hebrides, a group of iſlands on the weſt of Scotland. The ſafeſt and readieſt paſſage to the north, lies through theſe iſlands, as, in caſe of a ſtorm, ſhips can always command a port to take ſhelter in, all the Hebrides being furniſhed with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent harbours, beſides almoſt every kind of proviſions, ſuch as mutton, fowls, fiſh and eggs, which are both plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and cheap.</p>
               <p>In theſe latitudes the weather is often tempeſtuous to a great degree; many veſſels keep to the weſtward of them altogether, and by that means are deprived of
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:035035_0233_0FFFF66DE33970D8"/>
ſhelter in the hour of danger, and not unfrequently loſe both their lives and veſſels. Among theſe iſlands the wind blows in tremendous guſts, but the intervals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, are ſo calm, that one may expoſe a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed candle in their hand, without its being extinguiſhed. But ſhips run very little riſk, for if the wind ſhould be unfavourable for one paſſage it generally anſwers for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and in theſe ſounds or channels, there are very few inſtances of any dangerous accidents happening. The moſt ſoutherly of theſe iſlands are Juſa and Ila, in the laſt of which is a freſh water lake, with an iſland in the middle of it, on which may ſtill be ſeen the ruins of a large building, ſaid to have been built by Donald, king of the Iſles. Between theſe two iſlands is the entrance, known by the name of the Sound of Ila. In ſailing to the northward the iſland of Mull makes its appearance, which is about twenty-four miles long, and near twenty broad. Further north lies Lewis, which is ſeventy miles weſt of the main land of Scotland, and is eighty miles in length, and forty-one in breadth; and Barra, which is five miles long, and three broad. Cod and ling are caught here in great quantities, and ſeveral ſmall veſſels come to the iſland laſt mentioned, in the ſummer, and return laden with fiſh.</p>
               <p>We came to anchor in the harbour of Stornway, on the eaſt ſide of the iſland of Lewis, which is extremely commodious; and in the town of Stornway, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains about one hundred houſes, proviſions are plentiful
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:035035_0234_0FFFF67416400798"/>
and cheap. The weather ſetting in ſtormy, we were forced to lie here for fourteen days, during which time I had an opportunity of informing myſelf of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of thoſe iſlanders, and of mixing with ſuch ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ty as the place afforded.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of theſe iſlands ſtill retain a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful degree of veneration for their chiefs, or heads of their clans.—No Jew ever valued himſelf more on his deſcent from the father of the faithful, than one of theſe iſlanders does, if by any means he can trace back his deſcent from ſome lord of a clan; and this they will go back through fifty generations to make out; and though poor as oppreſſion can make them, they aſſume a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, from their illuſtrious deſcent, that makes up for the want of more ſubſtantial gratifications. Happy is the man who has had the good fortune to be born a <hi>Mac Donald,</hi> a <hi>Mac Pherſon,</hi> or a <hi>Mac</hi> of any kind; in theſe iſlands he is ſure to meet with ſome illuſtrious couſins. Their dreſs perhaps may but ill accord with their noble extraction, but clothes are but trifles, their views are more exalted. Allow them to tell you over their illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious pedigree, and whilſt they are doing it, enliven their ſpirits with a glaſs of uſquebaugh, or a pinch of ſnuff, and the ragged Hebredian becomes as great a man as the cham of Tartary.—Theſe remains of feudal idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atry, however, are beginning to wear out among the riſing generation; and as trade and manufactures get footing in the Hebrides, theſe ideal advantages will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:035035_0235_0FFFF676A22AF2C0"/>
fall in their value. At preſent their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal trade, as well as food, is drawn from the ocean; and did the induſtry of the inhabitants, keep pace with their neceſſities, they might thence extract vaſt ſources of wealth: nature has brought the means to their doors, but they are extremely indolent in the application of them. Accuſtomed to humble fare, and coarſe apparel, their wants are few and ſoon ſupplied. They riſe in the morning without many wiſhes, and go to bed with the ſatisfaction of having them gratified. Indolent as they are in application to buſineſs, no men in the world make better ſoldiers, or endure the fatigues of a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful campaign, with more unſhaken patience and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; hunger, thirſt and fatigue, are unable to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh their undaunted ſpirits. Let their leaders be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from their own country, and no degree of danger can affright them. When they chooſe to exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they ſhew a wonderful degree of agility and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and nothing gives ſuch life to their motions as the ſound of the bagpipe. Every chieftian, or great man, has a bagpiper of his own, who entertains him and his dependents with this animating muſic, and while he plays over the <hi>peebroch</hi> or <hi>ſtrath-ſpay,</hi> unleſs his audience were tied hand and foot, it would be almoſt impoſſible to keep them from dancing. Their coarſe food is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally little indebted to the cook, nor is cleanlineſs much attended to among them; they are, however, kind and hoſpitable to ſtrangers, fond of ſhewing them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry civility in their power, and you cannot more oblige
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:035035_0236_0FFFF679B22C6410"/>
them, than by ſitting down without ceremony, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their humble repaſt. Their expert trade con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts almoſt entirely of fiſh, but this is trilling to what it might be if the people were induſtrious, or were put upon proper methods of taking the vaſt ſhoals that viſit this coaſt.</p>
               <p>Leaving the weſtern iſles, we directed our courſe for the Orkneys, another group of iſlands on the north of Scotland, ſeparated from the main land by the tempeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſtraits, called Pentland Firth, which is twenty-four miles long and twelve broad. The inhabitants of theſe iſlands have been long viſited from almoſt every nation in Europe, conſequently they have in a great meaſure loſt the originality of manners which once cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized them; and their language begins to be mixed with that of other nations. They have in particular, borrowed ſeveral words from the Dutch, who, during the fiſhing ſeaſon, conſtantly reſort here.</p>
               <p>Almoſt every Greenland ſhip calls here, whether outward or homeward bound, for the purpoſe of laying in freſh proviſions, which are both plentiful and very cheap; alſo veſſels to and from the different ports in the Baltic, ſo that in the ſummer ſeaſon, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Orkneys have no want of company. But in winter, thick clouds, darkneſs and ſtorms, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hang over them. In the months of June and July they can ſee to read ordinary print at midnight. Four

months of the year is all the time they have for buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for in the ſhort viſits the ſun pays them in winter, he is ſo exceedingly ſhy, that they derive very little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage either from his light or heat, and the weather is generally ſo very tempeſtuous, that they can but ſeldom viſit one another, much leſs their neighbours on the main land.—The number of iſlands is twenty-eight; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>In Kirkwall, the capital of the Orkneys, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains entire, a fine Gothic building, formerly a cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral, and now the pariſh church. It is ſupported by fourteen pillars on each ſide, and is ſteepled by four. It has three gates, checquered with red and white ſtone, emboſſed and elegantly flowered.—I need not ſpend the time of my reader in an account of a people who are already ſo well known, I ſhall therefore proceed with my narrative.</p>
               <p>After waiting at Stormneſs for ſome time, we ſet ſail with a fine ſouth-weſterly wind, and paſſing through Ham-Sound, directed our courſe for the Naze in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which we made in two day's ſailing; from thence we ſailed along the mouth of the Catigate, and made the peninſula of Jutland. Nothing material happened us during the reſt of our paſſage, till we arrived at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhagen,
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:035035_0238_0FFFF683E8C3DA20"/>
the capital of Denmark, where we had to diſcharge our cargo, which detained us for ſeveral weeks, during which time I had an opportunity, as my cuſtom was wherever I went, of viewing what app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>d worthy of notice in the city.</p>
               <p>The excellency of the harbour, and its advantageous ſituation for trade, cannot be ſurpaſſed. It is guarded on both ſides by ſtrong fortifications, and the entrance is ſo narrow, that one ſhip only can enter at a time; and when once ſhips get in they are perfectly ſecure either by night or by day; for at night the harbour is ſecured by a ſtrong boom laid acroſs the mouth of it, and chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at both ends. This large commodious harbour can contain four or five hundred veſſels, and is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by a wooden gallery, to which ſhips may lay their broad ſides, and where every veſſel has her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſtation.—Were we to judge of the power or revenues of a monarch from the extent of his domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, the king of Denmark would make a very conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous figure among the potentates of Europe. His titles are, <hi>King of Denmark and Norway, and of the Goths and Vandals; Duke of Holſtein, Oldenbourg and Delmenhorſt:</hi> of all of which he is the actual ſovereign.—But the vaſt territories he poſſeſſes, are by no means populous, in proportio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as they are extenſive; and the greater part of the inhabitants are in a ſtate of real indigence, and in what is commonly looked upon by other European nations, as a ſtate of real miſery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="unknown:035035_0239_0FFFF688906AD9B0"/>The kingdom of Norway is of a vaſt extent, being no leſs than eight hundred miles long, and one hundred broad. It is inhabited by amphibious animals in the ſhape of men, who, during the ſhort ſummer, are conſtantly employed in catching and eating fiſh; and in winter ſleep, or do what they pleaſe. Here, in the ſpace of ſix weeks they both ſow and reap, but a long and dreary winter ſucceeds, and for nine months of the year the ground is covered with ſnow. The pitiful inhabitants then retire to their miſerable huts, and dream away an uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able winter, without variety or enjoyment. If ever there was neceſſity for a man chooſing an agreeable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion for life, it is here: for in this uncomfortable part of the globe, his wife is for three-fourths of the time his only companion. The ſnow ſhuts him up from all his neighbours; and if he is not happy at home, miſerable indeed muſt be his ſituation.—One thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in this country is, that all animals of chace, ſuch as hares, rabbits, deers, &amp;c. are entirely white; and even any of thoſe animals taken from Britain, in the courſe of one ſeaſon change their colour; ſo that none of them in Norway, are to be found after a few months reſidence, in the ſame coloured garb in which they firſt viſited the country.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of this kingdom are numerous, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren as it is. They multiply faſt; and the nature of the climate, and the food they make uſe of, I imagine, are no ways unfavourable to propagation. I need not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:035035_0240_0FFFF68CA797E128"/>
to my readers, that the climate is beyond endurance cold, and the greater part of their food is fiſh. The king of Denmark, therefore, has a numerous body of men yearly propagated in theſe his Norwegian domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions; and if the maxim be true, that the riches of a kingdom depend upon the number of its inhabitants, he has no reaſon to complain of poverty. I am apt how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to imagine, that men introduced into the world, in the ſtate his Daniſh majeſty ſubjects viſit it, can do very little either for themſelves or their ſovereign. They are produced, it is true, by their parents, and nurſed by their mother, from the ſame principal, or inſtinct, (if my reader will allow the term) that the bears ſuckle their offspring, and ſo their care is at an end. The father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs them as ſoon as they are capable, in the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of handling the oar, and ſtriking the fiſh; and when he has perfected them in theſe manly exerciſes, he gives up the rein, and leaves them to the direction of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.—Learning is not much known or coveted. It is not the faſhion of the country to train up philoſophers, metaphyſicians, or divines.—Poets however there are, who relate the legendary tale, in numbers deemed har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious: and no people under heaven have ſo great a taſte for poetry of the marvellous caſt, or tell a ſtory ſo much in the ſtile of eaſtern improbabilty, and in ſuch perſuaſive language, as the Norwegian poet, or dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſt.—It is certain, mankind expreſs moſt forcibly the paſſions which they feel moſt acutely. Savage nations have, without the aid of refinement or education, ſung
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:035035_0241_0FFFAF2FAEB33340"/>
their battles and amours in ſtrains which the learned European cannot help reading with enthuſiaſm. Offian has had numberleſs admirers and imitators, but it is more than probable he will never have an equal. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not the great variety of ideas, avocations, and purſuits, that a ſtate of poliſhed or refined ſociety opens up to us, deranges and diſſipates thoſe powers that in a ſtate of nature have only one object for their theme, I leave to my philoſophical reader to determine; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned as I am, I cannot help thinking, that whilſt the poets of modern days have found the way to pleaſe the ear, ſome of them who have only had nature for their inſtructreſs, have found the moſt effectual key to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt receſſes of the heart.</p>
               <p>The ſtrange appearance of every thing in nature, in theſe northern climes, fills the mind, unaccuſtomed to it, with wonderful ideas. To behold the ſun for ſeveral weeks moving round and round the pole, without ever loſing ſight of him altogether, or at moſt to have only a ſhy and haſty viſit of an hour, or an hour and a half's continuance, once in the twenty-four, is ſo different from what we are accuſtomed to behold, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help imagining himſelf tranſported into another world. In ſummer one may read the ſmalleſt print at midnight with as great eaſe as they can do in winter at mid-day.—The produce of the land here would be total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inadequate to the ſuſtenance of the inhabitants, did not the ſea, in a great meaſure, make up for its deficency.
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:035035_0242_0FFFF69567DA2600"/>
Immenſe quantities of fiſh are taken on theſe coaſts, which are ſpread on the rocks or ſand, and dried by the heat of the ſun. A high chain of mountains runs between Norway and Sweden, called the Dafrine-hills, which are neither cultivated nor inhabited. In the year 1387, it was united to Denmark; previous to this period it had kings of its own. In the year 1525 the people embraced the Lutheran religion, which they continue to profeſs to this day.</p>
               <p>The king of Denmark appoints a viceroy, who has abſolute power, and reſides at Bergen, which is the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of this country. There are in Norway, four gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral governments, Aggerhays, Bergen, Drontheim, and Wardhuys, beſides the dependencies of the kingdom, which are Iceland and the Iſle of Ferro. The face of this country preſents only foreſts and mountains, and produces oak, deal boards, tar and pitch. There are likewiſe ſeveral iron and copper mines in the country, which produce a ſmall revenue to government.—The houſes are built moſtly upon the ſide of high precipices, and they are forced to make uſe of ladders to aſcend and deſcend. When a perſon dies, he is commonly let down with ropes before he is put into the coffin. Many large caves are found in the mountains, inhabited by wild beaſts, ſuch as foxes, lynxes, bears, and wolves, which make great havock and devaſtation among the domeſtic animals. The people are almoſt totally unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the arts. Machinery is ſo much in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy

amongſt them, that a perſon coming to Bergen from the country, is amazed at the ſight of a two-wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed carriage or cart. There is in the ſea of Norway, a ſurpriſing current or motion, proceeding from a vortex or whirpool, called the Maleſtrom; the roaring of which is the moſt tremendous of any thing I ever heard. This noiſe only intermits a quarter of an hour in every ſix hours, when the ſea is at high and low water, and at theſe time, fiſhermen venture into it. When it is moſt boiſterous, in the time of a ſtorm, it is dangerous to come within a league of it, for by going too near, boats, and even large veſſels, have often been abſorbed. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens very frequently to whales, who in their fruitleſs ſtruggles, make a loud noiſe, when they find themſelves impelled to follow the current; but it always proves more than a match for any thing once in its power.</p>
               <p>Denmark, including Holſtein, is bounded on the north by the Catigate, on the eaſt by the Baltic, and on the ſouth by the river Elbe, which divides it from Bremen. The co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

It is almoſt ſurrounded by ſeas, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed with lakes and canals, which renders the air foggy, and the country unhealthy and diſagreeable to ſtrangers, although the natives of the country are, in general healthy and long-lived. The kingdom of Den<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mark, properly ſo called, is compoſed of the iſlands of Jutland, Zealand, and Funen; each of which have their ſatellites, or ſmaller iſlands, in their neighbourhood.</p>

                  <pb n="251" facs="unknown:035035_0244_0FFFF6987A46CED8"/>Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, is ſeated in the iſland of Zealand. This iſland, the reſidence of the royal family, is nearly of a circular form, meaſuring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſixty leagues in circumference. The channel, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Sound, divides it from Sohonin, a province of Sweden. The ſoil is by no means fruitful, eſpecially in dry ſeaſons, on account of its ſandy foundation; notwithſtanding the people make all their own bread, but this is the only grain produced here, ſufficient for the conſumption of the inhabitants. There is not one river of any conſequence in this iſland, and but few brooks or rivulets large enough to turn a mill. There are however, a number of lakes, plentifully ſtored with various kinds of excellent fiſh. Their cattle are ſmall and lean, owing perhaps to long confinement in winter, for during the ſpace of eight months of the year they are kept almoſt continually within doors. A fourth part of the iſland, at leaſt, is a foreſt, in which there are a great variety of game, reſerved, by the royal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, for the amuſement of the court. The iſland is divided into twenty-ſix diſtricts or bailiwicks; contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thirteen towns, twelve caſtles, and three hundred and forty-ſeven pariſhers. It produces great numbers of cattle, which, as I already obſerved, are ſmall, but their beef is uncommonly pleaſant to the taſte. Copen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen ſtands in latitude fifty-ſix, north, and nearly thirteen degrees eaſt of London. Jutland, the principal diviſion of the kingdom, is about one hundred and eighty miles in length from north to ſouth, and fifty in

breadth from eaſt to weſt. To this part of the country, it is ſaid, England owes its ancient conquerors. The people in this country are in general red-haired; and in many parts of the Britiſh dominions, particularly in Ireland, their deſcendants are diſcoverable from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of their hair to the preſent day.</p>
               <p>This peninſula is bounded on the ſouth-eaſt by the Dutchy of Holſtein, and ſurrounded on the other ſides by the German ocean and the Baltic ſea. Funen, is ſeparated from it by a ſtrait, called the Leſſer-Belt; and from Zealand by another ſtrait, called the Great Belt. It produces wheat and barley, of each a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity. The Dutchy of Holſtein is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſubject to the king of Denmark, in conſequence of which he is an elector of the empire. This country is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one hundred miles long and fifty broad, and is not the moſt inconſiderable of his dominions, being a pleaſant, fruitful country, and containing the two excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent harbours, Hamburgh and Lubeck.</p>
               <p>The metropolis of this kingdom makes a moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent appearance at a diſtance. The king's palace, ſince burnt down, was a very ſuperb building, and was built in the year 1730. The citadel is a regular fort, defended by five baſtions, a double ditch full of water, and ſeveral advanced works. The exchange and arſenal of the Eaſt India company, the king's ſtables, the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, the orphan and opera houſes, together with the
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:035035_0246_0FFFF6A2B8678788"/>
military ſchool are all of them magnificent ſtructures. Unfortunately for this city however, accidental fires in one night ſometimes deſtroy as many houſes as is built in half a century. In the year 1728, ſix thouſand houſes were reduced by fire to two thouſand two hundred and fifteen. The damage they have ſuſtained in the preſent year, from the ſame cauſe, muſt be immenſe, though the exact amount of it is not yet aſcertained in any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I have ſeen. This city is about five miles in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference; and is ſaid to contain one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand inhabitants, excluſive of ſoldiers and ſailors. It is divided into ten pariſhes, each of which has a church that goes by its name; but beſides theſe, there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other places of public worſhip; eleven areas, or ſquares, in which markets are kept; and one hundred and fifty ſtreets. The city is ſtrong both by nature and art, the ground being marſhy, deep canals are cut all round, and through the middle of it, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely convenient for the conveyance of goods. The iſland of Amak is joined to the city by a bridge, from whence the markets are ſupplied with the greater part of their proviſions.</p>
               <p>The Danes are in general tall, robuſt and well made. In the ſummer ſeaſon they affect the dreſs of the French nation; but in winter they are forced to have recourſe to their original furs. Like many other nations, the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the rich and that of the poor preſent a dreadful contract: the former are ſpread with all the variety
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:035035_0247_0FFFF6A6DAF3C3D8"/>
which luxury can deviſe; the latter have no higher or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments that ſalt or ſtock-fiſh, with a piece of rye-bread; and this is the plebeian fare of Denmark, with very little variety, through the year. In moſt northern countries, both men and women are fond of ſtrong li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors. It is ſaid that in Ruſſia the royal edict went forth, <hi>that no lady ſhould appear drunk at an aſſembly.</hi> I will not aver that a ſimilar order is neceſſary in Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark; as I cannot ſay that I ever ſaw any of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies intoxicated; but I have ſeen a woman drink more ſtrong brandy than would have intoxicated moſt men of ordinary conſtitutions in England, without any viſible effects from it. A ſtranger no ſooner enters a houſe, then the bottle is preſented. The proper hour of drinking is whenever the liquor is to be had; nor are they ſo puny as to require a dilution of water to make it go down, but take it without the ſmalleſt mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The higher orders of females commonly leave the table after a glaſs or two goes round; but the men drink till they forget that they live in a cold climate, and are carried to bed in a ſtate of complete ſtupefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>When a young couple agree to be married, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the friends of the parties meet to ſettle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leminaries, and if every thing is agreed upon, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties contract in the preſence of their friends, and often go together without aſking leave of the church; and it is not till the woman is upon the eve of bringing forth
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:035035_0248_0FFFF6AA919EF4B0"/>
her firſt child, that the ceremony is performed publicly. Cumſtom ſanctions many things in one country, that ſeem ſtrange in another, for this anti-nuptial intercourſe is neither quarrelled with by laity nor clergy; and there are few inſtances of women having cauſe to repent their credulity, the men looking upon a contract thus publicly made as equally binding with any form.</p>
               <p>They bury their dead with great funeral pomp, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten keep them above ground for weeks, or months, or perhaps for a year, that the ſurviving relations may gratify their own vanity by getting preparations made for the moſt magnificent interment. This folly is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever chiefly confined to the rich, for the poor are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the grave with leſs ceremony, though even among them, a band of mourners are hired and paid by the pariſh, (if the ſurviving relations cannot afford it themſelves) who  accompany the deceaſed to the grave with the moſt doleful exterior, and with cries and lamentations deplore the loſs they do not feel, and wipe away the tears they never ſhed. It is probable our neighbours, the Iriſh, have derived their funeral howl from the Danes when they were in the country, but this I leave to the antiquary to determine.</p>
               <p>After four weeks ſtay at Copenhagen, we weighed anchor on the twenty-fourth of October, and ſet ſail for Mem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this we directed our courſe for the coaſt of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, and on the thirtieth paſſed the iſlands of Burnholme and Earthholme, and after a very pleaſant voyage we eſpied land, which proved to be Dutchman's-Cape, a grove of trees about four miles north of Memmel river. We ſoon made the town, and having only ballaſt on board it was ſoon diſcharged.</p>
               <p>The town of Memmel is one of the moſt flouriſhing places in the Pruſſian dominions. Upwards of two thouſand veſſels are loaded yearly at this port with the produce of the country. It is extremely populous, though by no means regularly built, and encreaſes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly both in ſize and population. It is fortified by three whole and two half baſtions, beſides ſtrong out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, and a regular citadel. On the Memmel ſide of the river, the land is fertile and productive, but on the ſide oppoſite, it is only a barren ſand, producing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing either for man or beaſt. The river is broad and navigable a conſiderable way above the town, but no ſhips go further up, owing perhaps, to the want of trade in the inland parts of the kingdom: for commerce is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſolely confined to the towns on the coaſt.</p>
               <p>Dantzick, the largeſt, richeſt and ſtrongeſt town in the king of Pruſſia's territories, and the ſee of a biſhop, is ſurrounded by a wall, and completely fortified; and is ſaid to contain upwards of a hundred thouſand inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.

Here is a celebrated univerſity, which has long been noted for the learning of its profeſſors. The hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are built of brick, or ſtone, and are from four to ſeven ſtories high; and in many of the ſtreets rows of trees are planted, which in hot weather form a very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ſhade.—This city is nominally a republic, and claims a territory of about forty miles round it. The town is divided into twenty-ſix pariſhes, and contains, among other noted buildings, ſeveral hoſpitals and convents. It is a free Hanſeatic town, governed by its own laws and magiſtrates. Their magiſtracy conſiſts of thirty ſenators, and thirteen conſuls, and the latter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect four burgo-maſters out of their own body. They likewiſe appoint all other officers; but one hundred burghers are annually elected to inſpect the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of government, and defend the rights and privileges of the people. The vaſt trade carried on from this port chiefly conſiſts of grain, timber, and naval ſtores. On an average, they are ſaid to export, annually, ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand tons of corn, which is brought down the Veſtula in Poliſh veſſels, and laid up in large granaries, to be diſpoſed of to the foreign veſſels, who continually come here to purchaſe it.—Lutheraniſm is the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed religion, but all ſects and religions are tolerated.</p>
               <p>Koningſberg, the capital in legal Pruſſia, contains about three thouſand houſes, and about ſixty thouſand inhabitants. The palace is a very ſuperb and elegant ſtructure, in which is a hall two hundred and ſeventy-four

feet long, and fifty-nine feet broad. The tower of of the caſtle is a very great heighth, having no leſs than two hundred and eighty-four ſteps from the bottom to the top, from whence there is a beautiful proſpect of a very fertile country. This city contains eighteen church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, fourteen of which belong to the Lutherans, three to the Calviniſts, and one to the Catholicks. The ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, with which it is ſurrounded, is ſeven miles in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, and incloſes along with the city ſome beautiful gardens and pleaſure grounds. It has eight gates and thirty-two ravelins. The city ſtands upon the river Pregel, over which are built ſeven bridges, which render the communication eaſy between the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent quarters of it. The exchange is a beautiful edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, adorned with a great variety of elegant paintings; and the city has long been reſpected for its trade and navigation.</p>
               <p>Pillaw is about twenty miles weſt from Koningſberg, and ſtands upon a point, or peninſula. It has an excellent harbour, is a place of conſiderable ſtrength, and is look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as the bulwark of Pruſſia towards the ſea, being extremely well fortified.

The ſoil, in general, is excellent, and produces great quantities of grain, and the climate tolerably mild.</p>
               <p>The kings of Pruſſia are fonder of rearing ſoldiers than huſbandmen, and perhaps this may be one reaſon why a large portion of the land is altogether uncultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for the people are generally more induſtrious than their neighbours; but the great armies, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept up, muſt conſiderably diminiſh the number of labourers.—In the courſe of the preſent century, vaſt numbers of emigrants from France, Switzerland and Germany, have gone to ſettle in Pruſſia, who have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the arts and improvements of their ſeveral coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries along with them; by which means the natives are become more civilized and better informed, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and opulent.

               <p>The king, as duke of Brandenburg, is an elector of the empire, and by his recent connection with the French republic, is likely to gain a conſiderable acceſſion of influence in regulating the affairs of the Germanic body.

               <p>The conſtitution of this country, ſince the year 1702, when the dukes aſſumed the title of kings, is abſolute monarchy. The late king, with all his great and good qualities, was extremely tenacious of his prerogative; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="264" facs="unknown:035035_0257_0FFFF6CC1D25BF08"/>On the fifth of October, 1788, I ſailed from Irvine in a ſmall veſſel, deep loaden, for Drogheda, in Ireland. Our cargo was coals, which always find a ready market in that country, where they are a ſcarce and dear ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.</p>
               <p>Our veſſel being only fifty tons burthen, a captain, three men and a boy, were all that was neceſſary to navigate her. We had a favourable breeze, which ſoon carried us acroſs the channel to our intended port, and finding a ready market for our cargo, we loaded with grain, with an intention of diſpoſing of it in Liverpool. I had the opportunity, however, of ſpending a few days in this ancient Iriſh city, and I muſt here frankly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that in all the different places I have been in, I never yet met with ſo much real, unexpected and unmerited hoſpitality.</p>
               <p>The city of Drogheda is the principal town in the county of Luth, in the province of Ulſter. It had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been ſurrounded by a wall, the greater part of which is now in ruins. It contains from ſix to ſeven thouſand inhabitants, and has an excellent harbour, from which vaſt quantities of grain are exported. The greater part of the inhabitants are of the Roman Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olic perſuaſion. The eſtabliſhed church is a large and elegant building. Formerly there was a Preſbyterian church here, but the clergyman getting poſſeſſion of the deed of the ground and houſe, and finding he had but
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:035035_0258_0FFFF6CDA5EC5FC0"/>
few hearers, ſold it to a company of players, who have hitherto uſed it as a theatre.</p>
               <p>This city ſtands on both ſides of the river Boyne, but the greater part of it is on the north ſide. About a mile and a half above Drogheda, the famous battle of the Boyne was fought, where king James made the laſt ſtand for three kingdoms, if a ſtand it could be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for the man, who in a ſubordinate capacity was an undaunted commander, when his all was at ſtake, retired to the ſide of a hill, at a ſafe diſtance from the ſcene of action, where he had a view of the battle, and ſtood till he beheld his army routed and put to ſlight; after which he, himſelf, fled with the precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a coward, and made the beſt of his way to France, where he dragged out the remainder of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious life, a dependent upon the bounty of Lewis XIV.</p>
               <p>In memory of this famous battle, or as it is ſaid, in memory of duke Schomberg, who fell in croſſing the Boyne, a monument is erected cloſe by the river ſide, about twenty-two or twenty-four feet high, exactly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the ſpot where king William's army croſſed.</p>
               <p>The Iriſh ſeem to prize the Dutch deliverance at a very high rate, for in moſt of the northern countries, and eſpecially in this neighbourhood, it is cuſtomary for a whole company of convivial friends to fall down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their knees and drink the glorious and immortal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory

of king William III. and till of late, that politics have taken a new direction, this, in almoſt every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, was certain to be a toaſt.</p>
               <p>I happened while in this place, one day to fall in company with a Roman Catholick clergyman, at a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's houſe. In the courſe of the converſation, he entertained the company with the following profeſſional anecdote, which amuſed us not a little. "One night lately," ſays he, "I was ſent for, to bleſs a piece of mould to put into the coffin of an old woman, about half a mile out of town, who was to be buried next day. As I had half undreſſed myſelf, and was almoſt ready to go bed, I told them to go and bleſs it themſelves, and as they had the orders of a clergyman it would do equally as well as if I was on the ſpot. This did not by any means pleaſe them, and before the meſſenger went home he got another clergy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n, who went and bleſſed the mould, and anathematized me.</p>
               <p>"Next morning they went and complained of me to the tutelar biſhop, who immediately ſent for me, and reprimanded me ſeverely, telling me I ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with popular prejudices, for the world was not yet ripe enough for the government of reaſon, and that it we did not keep mankind in awe by theſe little arts, we ſhould ſoon loſe all power over them. I told him, (ſays the frair, for ſuch he was) that power ſo gained was better loſt than kept, upon which we parted very
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:035035_0260_0FFFAF6BA9461DC8"/>
bad friends." I have ſince been informed that this ſame honeſt friar had, a few months after this, read his recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the eſtabliſhed church, and became an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox preacher, according to the laws of the land.</p>
               <p>It muſt be obſerved, however, that the apoſtacy of a Roman Catholick prieſt has never yet had much effect in hurting the cauſe they deſerted, for the government of the country obliges the county in which they live, to pay every one of them forty pounds per annum, till they are provided with a living to that amount on the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When a prieſt apoſtatizes, therefore, they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom place his defect to the account of conſcience. Our governor ſays, "They very well know the value of money, and if our religion was not the beſt in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they would never give ſo much <hi>to boot.</hi>" This bribe, indeed, is ſeldom accepted by the clergy, and when any one does take it, he is heartily deſpiſed by both parties. The legiſlative body, at the time this was made, might promiſe themſelves great effects, as it would be ſuppoſed that many of the clergy would be tempted by it, and many of their hearers would follow their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But in my opinion, a ſmall matter laid out in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial ſchools, ſuch as are eſtabliſhed in Scotland, would have had much better effect. By theſe all ſectaries would have been freed from that profound ignorance ſo viſible among the lower ranks of ſociety; and whatever reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion their parents had trained them to, they would have, in time, been enabled to judge for themſelves.</p>

                  <pb n="268" facs="unknown:035035_0261_0FFFF6D6D7D45B68"/>After aſking my reader pardon for this long digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I return to my narrative. The loading of our veſſel engaged us for three days, and on the twenty-fifth of December, we proceeded down the river, with a good north-weſterly breeze, and croſſing the channel, expected ſoon to reach our port; but when we had got right a-breaſt of Holymouth, the wind ſhifted ſuddenly round to the eaſtward, and began to blow moſt violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; we ſoon loſt ſome of our ſails and rigging, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fear our little veſſel would be overpowered. We found there was no other chance for her than to keep before the wind; but perceiving we were getting faſt to the weſtward, our captain thought proper to lay too: finding however, no probability of the wind abating, or our making a port, we were forced to drift before the wind for the ſpace of eight days, during the greater part of which we ſcarcely knew where we were, nor had any of us a dry ſhirt upon our back. In this ſtate we continued, half frozen to death, and ſcarcely able to ſtand upon our legs, till the fourth of January, when the wind veered round to the ſouth, the ſea became ſomewhat ſmoother, and the air milder; but our ſails were all tattered to pieces and ſome of them totally gone. What remained we patched up as well as we could, and at laſt reached the bay of Liverpool, more dead than alive. We entered it on the ſixth, but either through ignorance of the pilot, or the careleſſneſs of the man at the helm, we run upon the rocks, where we lay for ſome hours, and ſuſtained conſiderable damage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="unknown:035035_0262_0FFFF6DB820096A8"/>At laſt we got clear off, and proceeded to the dock, where we unloaded our cargo. The neceſſary repairs detained us here for ſometime, after which we took in ballaſt, but one gale coming after another, our captain judged it very unſafe to proceed to ſea with ſo ſmall a veſſel; and the misfortunes that had already befallen us, made us all wiſh for more favourable appearances to ſet out with. But our long abſence from home, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined our captain to run all hazards.—Every perſon he ſpoke to, adviſed him ſtrenuouſly againſt ſetting out with ſo ſmall a veſſel, in ſuch tempeſtuous weather; but he was firmly determined, and no perſuaſions could alter his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>On the morning of the twelfth a young ſailor came on board, and beſpoke a paſſage to Scotland, which was readily agreed to.—He went on ſhore to bring his clothes, but juſt as he was about to come on board again he met with the captain of another Scotch veſſel, who was in want of a hand, and offered him wages if he would go with him. The young man providentially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with him, and by that means eſcaped, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, the dreadful fate that befel my unhappy meſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates.</p>
               <p>This day the wind became ſomewhat more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and the weather more inviting. We ſet ſail, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the captain took an affectionate farewell of a ſon, the captain of another veſſel, whom he left behind
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:035035_0263_0FFFAF74DCA80B58"/>
him in Liverpool harbour, without ſuſpecting it was to be the laſt parting.—With an ebbing tide and a fair wind we were ſoon carried clear of all thoſe banks that render the navigation ſo difficult and dangerous; when parting with our pilot, we directed our courſe for the Iſle of Man, but we had not long left the ſhore, till a ſtrong gale began to blow, and the ſky overcaſting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſe of the day, threatened us with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful night; and alas! our fears had by no means magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied our dangers, for a moſt dreadful night it certainly proved to us all.</p>
               <p>We ſtood on our courſe as long as we could perceive which way it lay, but night brought along with it impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable darkneſs; and now it was that we felt the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of our ſituation, for indeed a more dreadful ſituation can ſcarcely be conceived. The wind continued to blow with unuſual violence, the ſeas ran mountains high, we had no hopes of our veſſel living long in ſuch circumſtances, nor knew we the minute ſhe might be daſhed to pieces againſt a rock.</p>
               <p>About eleven o'clock at night, the captain alarmed us with the diſmal tidings that the ſhip was full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We flew to the pumps, but the ballaſt had ſhifted, and choked up the pumps ſo, that all our endeavours that way was in vain, and we had by this time three feet water in the hold. We began to clear the hold with canns, and ſuch other veſſels as we had on board; but
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:035035_0264_0FFFAFA1E9E57E90"/>
alas! this was to little purpoſe, ſtill the water continued to gain upon us. Death now ſeemed inevitable. Every face preſented the moſt dreadful picture of horror and diſmay —the ſea was foaming over the deck, and the hold faſt filling with water.—He only could aſſiſt us, who "<hi>hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the water in the hollow of his hand, and ſaith to the raging element, Hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no further.</hi>" To Him we addreſſed our fervent petitions; but alas! at ſuch an hour, the mind is but little compoſed.—The proſpect of death in its mildeſt form, brings with it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy ſenſations; but the immediate proſpect of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death is dreadful in the extreme. How often did we wiſh for the light of day, and look to the eaſt for the approach of that glorious luminary, whoſe preſence animates nature!—Though, in our preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it could bring no comfort along with it.</p>
               <p>A very thick ſnow was falling, we had not the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt idea where we were, and to add to our horrors, one of the men gave the ſhocking alarm, that we were get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting faſt upon ſome dreadful rocks. In vain were all our efforts to keep the veſſel off. We did wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

                  </gap> was poſſible to be done in ſuch a ſituation, but to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, a tremenduous billow caſt us upon a rock, and the following wave overſet the veſſel.</p>
               <p>The captain was waſhed overboard with the ſea that firſt overſet the veſſel; we beheld his ſtruggles, and heard his cries, every one of which pierced us to the
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:035035_0265_0FFFF6E121485AF0"/>
heart; but what could we do? It was out of our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to give the ſmalleſt aſſiſtance either to him or our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Another of the hands ſhared the ſame fate; three of us remained in the veſſel, caſting about us a hopeleſs eye for ſome means of preſervation. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately occurred to me to cut the laſhing of the long-boat, and try to heave her out; one of my ſurviving companions ran to aſſiſt me, but all our efforts were vain, and we found the veſſel muſt immediately be daſhed to pieces. Another of my companions took to the maſt, which, from the motion of the ſhip lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her broad ſide, was ſometimes in the water, and ſometimes out of it, and at the interval between the waves, I could perceive him making towards the end of it. The other, who was a boy, held faſt by the rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and pierced the air with his cries. I kept by the veſſel till I found her going to peices, and then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed my companion to the end of the maſt, to which he was clinging cloſe. No other chance remained for me, but to endeavour to ſave my life by ſwimming; and the tremendous appearance of the ocean made that a very hopeleſs alternative. I called to my companion to follow me, and recommending myſelf to the mercy of the Almighty, plunged into the ocean.</p>
               <p>I neither knew on what ſhore we were caſt, nor what diſtance we were from it. The ebb-tide at one time ſweeping me at a greater diſtance from the land then when I firſt ſet out, for after ſtruggling about an hour
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:035035_0266_0FFFAF7C704481A0"/>
I found the wreck of the ſhip between me and the ſhore. My ſtrength by this time was nearly exhauſted; I threw myſelf upon my back and tried to diſengage my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from my clothes; this, however, I found I was una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to effect, and I muſt inevitably have ſunk to riſe no more in a ſhort time, if the returning tide had not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted me in making the ſhore. This in a little time it did, without my being able to make any other exertion than barely to keep myſelf above the water. I reached a rock, but had ſcarcely ſtrength enough remaining to raiſe myſelf upon my feet, or get to the top of it.</p>
               <p>When with much ſtruggling, I got myſelf ſeated on it, I began to look about for my companions, hoping ſome of them had ſaved themſelves by the ſame means. While I ſat here, cold, wet, and trembling as I was, I found myſelf irreſiſtibly born down to ſleep, and had nearly given way to my inclinations, when it occurred to me that I had not yet reached the ſhore. I left the rock, and croſſing a ſmall bay, found myſelf on a ſandy beach. Here I threw myſelf down, not knowing what to do, or which way to turn myſelf. The morning was ſtill dark, and a deep ſnow had fallen upon the ground; I got up and tried to walk, but found I was unable to go any diſtance; I threw myſelf down again, and caſt many a wiſtful look towards the ſea, for the arrival of ſome of my companions, but to no purpoſe. I found I muſt attempt to find a houſe, or my reaching the ſhore would be of no conſequence, as I muſt infallibly expire
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:035035_0267_0FFFF6E9D68559B0"/>
upon the ſpot. Once more I got up, and walked as I could, I knew nor whither. Providence at laſt directed me to a houſe. I rapped, and called aloud for ſome time. I went round it, and exhauſted my little remaining ſtrength, endeavouring to make the people hear, but could obtain no anſwer. I then endeavoured to find ſome place of ſhelter from the dreadful ſtorm, and at laſt found a little hovel with ſome ſwine in it; and rough as my bed-fellows were, I found the heat they imparted extremely agreeable; I fell into a ſtate of ſlumbering, or rather ſtupefaction; nor can I recollect from that moment any thing that befel me, till I found myſelf ſtretched before a large fire, ſeemingly made for my account, wrapped in blankets, and ſurrounded by a number of peoples. It ſeems I had neither opened my eyes nor uttered a word for ſome hours, and when I came to my ſenſes, and began to thank God that I was in the land of the living, every one teſtified the utmoſt joy. They made the tendereſt enquiries how I found myſelf. I told them I would ſoon be well, and thanked them in the beſt manner I could for their care and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
               <p>A worthy man, to whom I afterwards found the houſe belonged, begged me not to diſtreſs myſelf with ſpeaking. I aſked him if he had any ſpirits in the houſe; he told me there was none, but he would ſoon get ſome. He immediately diſpatched a man to a houſe, at the diſtance of two miles, for ſome; and in the mean
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:035035_0268_0FFFAF83B493ABC8"/>
time they made me drink ſome warm milk and water; and now, for the firſt time, I began to regain the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of my ſcattered ſenſes. I recollected I had been caſt away, but knew not, as yet, in what country I was. I conjectured it might be in the Iſle of Man, but was anxious to ſatisfy myſelf. Upon enquiry, they told me, I was in the north of Ireland, about ſix miles from Porto-Ferry, and three from Balywater. I then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired if they had heard any thing of my companions, but on that head received no ſatisfaction. I had many queſtions to aſk, but my benevolent hoſt undertook to ſatisfy me of every thing he knew concerning me, by the following acccount:</p>
               <p>"About ſeven o'clock in the morning," ſays he, "the ſtorm was raging with the greateſt violence, and had torn the greater part of the thatch from the houſe, ſo that the ſnow was coming faſt in upon the bed where we ſlept. My wife and I got up and went to the ſtack yard, to get ſome ſtraw to re-place the thatch. Upon going nearer the yard, my wife thought ſhe heard the groans of a human being, we followed the ſound, and perceived you creeping in the ditch, graſping at thorns, and whatever was within your reach. Laſt year a poor maniac in this country had frightened many of the neighbours; and my wife at firſt ſight, imagined you to be him, and was for going off and leaving you. I was convinced, however, upon a nearer view, that you was ſome perſon in the utmoſt agony; and deſiring
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:035035_0269_0FFFF6F2A4C55098"/>
her not to be afraid, we went up to you, and lifting you between us, the few cloaths you had upon you convinced of you was a ſailor. We carried you into the houſe, but your ſenſes were ſo totally gone, that you frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attempted to bite us. After we had brought you in, we alarmed the neighbours, who gathered all about us, bewailing your fate, as they imagined you in the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of death: you could anſwer none of our queſtions, not even by ſigns, and indeed ſeemed totally inſenſible to every thing that paſſed. We cauſed a large fire to be made, and wrapping you in blankets, began to rub you tightly, and pour ſome warm milk and water into your mouth. You became altogether motionleſs, and continued for ſome hours in ſuch a ſtate, that none of us could tell whether you was dead or alive. At laſt you made us all happy with the recovery of your ſenſes, and you can remember what paſſed ſince. When you find yourſelf able to talk, we will be glad to hear your ſtory, and in the mean time I ſhall be happy if any thing in my houſe can afford you the leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort."</p>
               <p>After thanking the good man again and again for his kindneſs, I told him as much as I knew of my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune; but when I came to mention my having gone into the hovel, they imagined I was ſtill deranged, as there was no ſuch place as I deſcribed about the houſe. While we were diſcourſing the meſſenger returned,
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:035035_0270_0FFFF6F7DE189ED0"/>
bringing ſome whiſky, a glaſs or two of which did me a moſt material ſervice.</p>
               <p>I was anxious beyond meaſure to learn the fate of my companions, and in a ſhort time ſet out, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by my kind hoſt, and ſome of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, towards the ſhore; but how greatly was I ſurpriſed to find that I was about a mile diſtant from it. After we had got more than half way, we came up to a houſe, which I was perſuaded was the one I had firſt come to, and there was a ſwine hovel exactly like that into which I had firſt entered. I endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them that this was my late lodging, but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unaccountable both to them and to myſelf, that I ſhould have gone ſo far afterwards, without any recollection of what had paſſed; I had ſome recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion however, of having thrown off my jacket in the hovel, and begged them to go and look for it. They did ſo, and found it, and this convinced them I was not miſtaken; but how my ſteps had been directed to the hoſpitable manſion of my preſent landlord, heaven on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knows. Upon going down to the beach, we found the wreck had come aſhore; and the people in the neighbourhood were all ſcrambling for what they could get to carry off.</p>
               <p>The greater part of what was moſt valuable was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gone. I began to remonſtrate with ſome who had got clothes and other things, begging them to lay
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:035035_0271_0FFFF6F96762A058"/>
them down, but received no other anſwer than a volley of oaths, and was ordered to ſtand off, or they would ſend me to eternity.</p>
               <p>After I ſaw nothing could be done with them, and had made many fruitleſs enquiries about my companions, ſome of whom, I ſtill hoped, might have reached the ſhore, I obtained twelve men to watch over the wreck, and inform me if any perſon attempted to meddle with it; then I returned to the houſe of my landlord, and conſulted with him what was beſt to be done.</p>
               <p>James Baillie, for that was the name of the preſerver of my life, was of a very different diſpoſition from the moſt of his neighbours. This worthy man, ſo far from wiſhing to enrich himſelf with the property of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, ſuggeſted every ſcheme he thought moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preſerve what remained for the friends of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed. He perſuaded me to go before a magiſtrate, and declare every circ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>umſtance upon oath, and take a proteſt. A magiſtrate, one Mr. Savage, lived at the diſtance of five miles, and in purſuance of the advice of my landlord, I immediately ſet out for his houſe; but had not walked two miles when I was met by Mr. Main, a coaſting officer, who told me Mr. Savage, the juſtice, was gone from home; but that, if I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with him, he would take a particular account of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, and I might lodge a proteſt in his hands. I agreed to his propoſal, and delivered him a proteſt of
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:035035_0272_0FFFAF914E872D60"/>
all I knew. He promiſed to meet me in the morning, and appoint proper perſons to take care of the wreck, and make the moſt of it for the owners. I returned immediately to the wreck, and found, notwithſtanding of the guard I had appointed, many things were miſſing which I had before obſerved, but I could obtain no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, nor even find out the perſons that had taken them. I ſpent the reſt of the day in the boat, grappling for the bodies of my unfortunate companions, without being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to find any of them.</p>
               <p>I met Mr. Main according to appointment, who came to the beach with ſome other gentlemen. It was thought proper to carry what portable things had been ſaved, to my landlord's barn, which was accordingly done. By Mr. Main's orders, a ſtrict ſearch was made for the goods that had been carried away, through all the houſes in the neighbourhood, but to little purpoſe, as the depredators had taken care to conceal them ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually. I was therefore, forced to ſit down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with what I had done, conſcious that I had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nothing in the compaſs of my power, to ſecure to the ſurvivors the remainder of my worthy maſter's effects.</p>
               <p>In the whole of the buſineſs, Mr. Main conducted himſelf with a degree of attention and humanity which deſerves the higheſt encomiums, and the warmeſt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude from all concerned. He ſaw every thing diſpoſed
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:035035_0273_0FFFF6FE84EA54D0"/>
of, and wrote a letter to the collector of Irvine, at my requeſt, to give notice of the tragical event. We judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it moſt adviſable to advertiſe what goods were left, for ſale; and accordingly they were ſold for what they would bring, which was a mere trifle.</p>
               <p>For ſome days I found myſelf ſo weak and ſickly as to prevent my undertaking a journey to Scotland; this however I did as ſoon as I was able; leaving the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy ſhore where I had loſt all companions, whoſe lifeleſs bodies had been diligently ſearched for every day during my ſtay.</p>
               <p>My hoſpitable landlord had acquired the rights of a father over me, by giving me a ſecond exiſtence. He ſeemed ſorry when I propoſed leaving him, and did all in his power to detain me till my health ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. On my part, I felt for him all the affections of a ſon. He had endeared himſelf to my heart by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good offices, and our parting was tender on both ſides. I had ſcarcely a rag of clothes on my back; thoſe I had on when the ſhip ſtruck upon the rocks, being all cut and tore to peices. But the hoſpitality of my Iriſh friends ſupplied me. One brought me a ſhirt, another a pair of ſhoes, &amp;c. and the captain's great coat, which had been waſhed on ſhore, covered all defects. I therefore parted reluctantly from the good man and woman that ſaved my life, and who ever ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered by me with grateful affection, and ſet out for
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:035035_0274_0FFFF704A3F5A488"/>
Donaghadee, a ſea-port not far diſtant, on the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of January.</p>
               <p>At this port, which is the neareſt to Scotland, packet-boats are employed by government for convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mails between the two kingdoms; and in theſe paſſengers may be accommodated with every thing heart could deſire. The fare in the packet-boats is according to the purſes and inclinations of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, and the accommodations are proportioned to the fare. They can ſail in almoſt any weather, ſo that one can never be at a loſs, for any length of time, for a paſſage between the two ſiſter kingdoms.</p>
               <p>On my going on board the packet-boat, I met five unlucky men, who had been as unfortunate as myſelf, their ſhip having been caſt away on the coaſt of Spain. The ſimilarity of our ſituations created a mutual ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and we entertained one another, during the paſſage, with a recital of our misfortunes. They had procured a paſſage in a Britiſh ſhip, and had the day before landed at Belfaſt. In the ſpace of four hours we got to Port-Patrick, and as we were all to travel the ſame road, we agreed to keep one another company; ſtill however, I found myſelf ſo weak that I was hardly able to keep up with them; my feet and legs had been cut and bruiſed ſo much on the morning our unfortunate accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, it was with the greateſt pain I could move a foot.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="unknown:035035_0275_0FFFAF97853943D8"/>With much difficulty I reached the place of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, where I was joyfully received by my friends, who had juſt got intelligence of our unlucky fate; Mr. Main's letter having come to hand only a few hours before I arrived. The widow of my deceaſed friend, the captain, I found in a ſtate little ſhort of diſtraction: and indeed it was no great wonder, ſhe had loſt one of the beſt of huſbands, and a ſtroke ſo unexpected muſt have been ſeverely felt.</p>
               <p>He was at the time of his death upwards of fifty, and through life had retained the moſt amiable char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter. Providence had bleſt his endeavours, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him to leave his family in good circumſtances; notwithſtanding they ſuſtained conſiderable loſs from this melancholy accident, for the veſſel was ſolely his own property. The other ſufferers on this occaſion, though unmarried, left behind them parents, who had been moſtly ſupported by their induſtry; and what is remarkable, they were all widowed mothers. I found myſelf very uneaſy in my native place for a long time after my return; the fight of me always producing a ſhower of tears from the eyes of thoſe unfortunate ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivors.</p>
               <p>Thus have I given my reader a faithful account of my nautical life and tranſactions; and ſhall be happy if any part of this work affords him a little entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when his mind is relaxed from more importan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

employments. I can with confidence aſſure him, that in the foregoing pages, I have adhered rigidly to truth; and as there are ſeveral living witneſſes of many of the tranſactions herein recorded, to them I can appeal for a confirmation of what I write.</p>
               <p>As I am not to be deterred by the misfortunes of my paſt life from proſecuting my favourite employment, but mean immediately to viſit ſome other part of the globe. I beg leave for the preſent to bid my reader a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu: if my after life ſhould be productive of any thing deſerving his notice, we may perhaps renew our acquaintance upon ſome future occaſion.</p>
