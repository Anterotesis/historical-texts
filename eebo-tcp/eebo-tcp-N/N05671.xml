            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL.</head>
            <p>ABOUT the End of the Year 1750, ſome Perſons, who had frequent Opportunities of obſerving the Diſtreſs of ſuch diſtemper'd Poor as from Time to Time came to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> for the Advice and Aſſiſtance of the Phyſicians and Surgeons of that City; how difficult it was for them to procure ſuitable Lodgings, and other Conveniences proper for their reſpective Caſes, and how expenſive the Providing good and careful Nurſes, and other Attendants, for want whereof, many muſt ſuffer greatly, and ſome probably periſh, that might otherwiſe have been reſtored to Health and Comfort, and become uſeful to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their Families, and the Publick, for many Years after; and conſidering more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that even the poor Inhabitants of this City, tho' they had Homes, yet were therein but badly accommodated in Sickneſs, and could not be ſo well and ſo eaſily taken Care of in their ſeparate Habitations, as they might be in one convenient Houſe, under one Inſpection, and in the Hands of ſkilful Practitioners; and ſeveral of the Inhabitants of the Province, who unhappily became diſorder'd in their Senſes, wander'd about, to the Terror of their Neighbours, there being no Place (except the Houſe of Correction) in which they might be confined, and ſubjected to proper Management for their Recovery, and that Houſe was by no Means fitted for ſuch Purpoſes; did charitably conſult together, and confer with their Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances, on the beſt Means of relieving the Diſtreſſed, under thoſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and an Infirmary, or Hoſpital, in the Manner of ſeveral lately eſtabliſhed in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> being propoſed, was ſo generally approved, that there was Reaſon to expect a conſiderable Subſcription from the Inhabitants of this City, towards the Support of ſuch an Hoſpital; but the Expence of erecting a Building ſufficiently large and commodious for the Purpoſe, it was thought would be too heavy, unleſs the Subſcription could be made general through the Province, and ſome Aſſiſtance
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007197_0003_102B392E88A3A3B0"/>
could be obtained from the Aſſembly; the following Petition was therefore drawn, and preſented to the Houſe on the 23d of <hi>January,</hi> 1750-51.</p>

                        <p>THAT with the Numbers of People the Number of Lunaticks, or Per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons diſtemper'd in Mind, and deprived of their rational Faculties, hat greatly encreaſed in this Province.</p>
                        <p>THAT ſome of them going at large, are a Terror to their Neighbours, who are daily apprehenſive of the Violences they may commit; and others are continually waſting their Subſtance, to the great Injury of themſelves and Families, ill diſpoſed Perſons wickedly taking Advantage of their unhappy Condition, and drawing them into unreaſonable Bargains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THAT few or none of them are ſo ſenſible of their Condition as to ſubmit volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily to the Treatment their reſpective Caſes require, and therefore continue in the ſame deplorable State during their Lives; whereas it has been found, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of many Years, that above two Thirds of the mad People received into <hi>Bethlehem</hi> Hoſpital, and there treated properly, have been perfectly cured.</p>
                        <p>YOUR Petitioners beg Leave farther to repreſent, that tho' the good Laws of this Province have made many compaſſionate and charitable Proviſions for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Poor, yet ſomething farther ſeems wanting in Favour of ſuch whoſe Poverty is made mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>THE kind Care our Aſſemblies have heretofore taken for the Relief of ſick and diſtemper'd Strangers, by providing a Place for their Reception and Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leaves us no Room to doubt their ſhewing an equal tender Concern for the Inhabitants. And we hope they will be of Opinion with us, that a ſmall Provincial Hoſpital, erected and put under proper Regulations, in the Care of Perſons to be appointed by this Houſe, or otherwiſe, as they ſhall think meet, with Power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and apply the charitable Benefactions of good People towards enlarging and ſupporting the ſame, and ſome other Proviſions in a Law for the Purpoſes above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, will be a good Work, acceptable to GOD, and to all the good People they repreſent.</p>
                        <p>WE therefore humbly recommend the Premiſes to their ſerious Conſideration.</p>

ON the ſecond Reading of the Petition, <hi>January</hi> 29, the Houſe gave Leave to the Petitioners to bring in a Bill, which was read the firſt Time on the firſt of <hi>February.</hi> For ſome Time it was doubtful whether the Bill would not miſcarry, many of the Members not readily conceiving the Neceſſity or Uſefulneſs of the Deſign; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending moreover, that the Expence of paying Phyſicians and Surgeons, would eat up the whole of any Fund that could be reaſonably expected to be raiſed; but three of the Profeſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> Doctors <hi>Lloyd Zachary, Thomas Bond,</hi> and <hi>Phineas Bond,</hi> generouſly offering to attend the Hoſpital <hi>gratis</hi> for three Years, and the other Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being by Degrees got over, the Bill, on the ſeventh of the ſame Month, paſſed the Houſe, <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi> and in <hi>May</hi> following it received the Governor's Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and was enacted into a Law, as follows.</p>

                        <head>An ACT to encourage the Eſtabliſhing of an HOSPITAL for the Relief of the Sick Poor of this Province, and for the Reception and Cure of Lunaticks.</head>
                        <p>WHEREAS the ſaving and reſtoring uſeful and laborious Members to a Community, is a Work of publick Service, and the Relief of the Sick Poor is not only an Act of Humanity, but a religious Duty; and whereas there are frequently, in many Parts of this Province, poor diſtemper'd Perſons, who lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh long in Pain and Miſery under various Diſorders of Body and Mind, and being ſcattered abroad in different and very diſtant Habitations, cannot have the Benefit of regular Advice, Attendance, Lodging, Diet and Medicines, but at a great Expence, and therefore often ſuffer for want thereof; which Inconveniency might be happily removed, by collecting the Patients into one common Provincial Hoſpital, properly diſpoſed and appointed, where they may be comfortably ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, and their Health taken Care of at a ſmall Charge, and by the Bleſſing of GOD on the Endeavours of ſkilful Phyſicians and Surgeons, their Diſeaſes may be cured and removed. And whereas it is repreſented to this Aſſembly, that there is a charitable Diſpoſition in divers Inhabitants of this Province to contribute largely towards ſo good a Work, if ſuch Contributors might be incorporated with proper Powers and Privileges for carrying on and compleating the ſame, and ſome Part of the Publick Money given and appropriated to the Providing a ſuitable Building for the Purpoſes aforeſaid.</p>

                  <p>THE Opinion we have of your beneficent Principles, induces us to make this Application to you, and we hope the Opportunity of exerting your Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to the Afflicted and Diſtreſſed, will be ſo acceptable, as to render any Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy unneceſſary for our Freedom in requeſting your Friendſhip in delivering and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting the Addreſs we herewith ſend to our Proprietaries, THOMAS and RICHARD PENN.</p>
                  <p>THE Circumſtances of this Province have, in a few Years paſt, been much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, by the Addition of a great Number of Perſons who arrive here from ſeveral Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> many of whom are poor, and ſettle in remote Parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where ſuitable Proviſion cannot be made for their Relief from the various Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of Body and Mind ſome of them labour under; the Conſideration of which hath lately rais'd in many of the Inhabitants of this City a benevolent Concern, and engaged them to apply for the Aſſiſtance of the Legiſlature, by whom a Law is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſome Proviſion made out of the Provincial Treaſury for the Erecting a publick Hoſpital or Infirmary, under the Direction of a Corporation, by whom we have lately been elected the Managers; but as the publick Funds are not ſufficient to anſwer the Expence of endowing it, a charitable Subſcription for that Purpoſe hath been propos'd and begun with good Succeſs. The Neceſſity and Advantages of this Inſtitution are ſo apparent, that Perſons of all Ranks unite very heartily in promoting it; and as ſeveral of our moſt eminent Phyſicians and Surgeons have freely offered their Service for ſome Years, we have good Grounds to expect that this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking may be of general Service much ſooner than was at firſt expected, and that our Legiſlature will ſoon make a further Proviſion for the Building, which we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it will be prudent to contrive and erect in ſuch Manner, as to admit of ſuch Additions as the future State of the Province may require. The principal Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty we now labour under, is the Want of a commodious Lot of Ground in a healthy Situation; for (tho' we have ſo great Encouragement as we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd) we cannot flatter ourſelves with ſpeedily raiſing a Sum ſufficient to enable us to provide for all other neceſſary Charges, and to purchaſe a ſuitable Piece of Ground ſo near the built Part of the City, as the conſtant Attendance of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, and other Conſiderations, will neceſſarily require: We are therefore under the Neceſſity of laying the State of our Caſe before our Proprietaries, and we hope the ſame Motives which have induced others, will have due Weight with them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this good Work, and that they will generouſly direct a Piece of Ground to be allotted for this Service.</p>
                  <p>THERE are ſeveral Lots in different Parts of this City very ſuitable, but from their Situation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are of great Value for other Purpoſes; we have therefore thought of one, which is in a Part of the Town quite unimproved, and where, in all Probability, there will be the Conveniency of an open Air for many Years; it is the vacant Part of the Square between the <hi>Ninth</hi> and <hi>Tenth-ſtreets</hi> from <hi>Delaware,</hi> on the <hi>South</hi> Side of <hi>Mulberry-ſtreet,</hi> and is 396 Feet <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> and 360 Feet <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South.</hi> The Lots in this Part of the City have not advanced in Value
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007197_0009_102B3939EF27ABA8"/>
for ſeveral Years paſt, and are not likely to be ſoon ſettled; ſo that we are in Hopes, if you will favour us with your Application for this Piece of Ground, you will meet with no Difficulty in obtaining it.</p>
                  <p>THE Intereſt of the Proprietaries and People are ſo nearly connected, that it ſeems to us ſelf-evident that they mutually ſhare in whatever contributes to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and Advantage of the Province; which Conſideration, added to the Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſing from Acts of Charity and Benevolence, will, we hope, have ſo much Weight with them, as to render any other Argument ſuperfluous; but as your own Prudence will ſuggeſt to you the moſt effectual Method of ſolliciting this Addreſs ſucceſsfully, we rely thereon ſo much, as to think it unneceſſary to add any Thing more on this Occaſion, than that your Friendſhip therein will be exceedingly grateful to us, and our Fellow-citizens in general; and next to obtaining the Lot we aſk for, the moſt agreeable Service you can do us, is to obtain a ſpeedy Anſwer; for the Promoting this Undertaking appears to us ſo neceſſary, that all concerned therein are unanimous in determining to prepare for the Building early in the Spring next Year.</p>

                        <head>REMARKS.</head>
                        <p>T<hi>HE Deſign of the Hoſpital being (in itſelf) ſo beneficent, and our honourable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietaries having fully expreſs'd their Approbation of it in ſtrong Terms, as well as declared their kind Intentions of aiding and aſſiſting it, by granting a valuable Tract of Land, in a proper Place, for an Hoſpital; all therefore that ſeems neceſſary for us to do, is to convince our honourable Proprietaries, that the Methods by which they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to aid and aſſiſt the Hoſpital, will by no Means anſwer theſe good Intentions, but are really inconſiſtent therewith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>WE muſt then beg Leave to remark in the firſt Place, with regard to the Charter, That as the Act of Aſſembly is undoubtedly the beſt Grant of Incorporation that we can poſſibly have, and as the Repreſentatives of the Freemen of this Province have generouſly contributed towards the Deſign, we ſhould fail of the Reſpect that is juſtly due to them, were we to accept of any other, without obtaining ſome very great and manifeſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by it; but that there are no ſuch Advantages in the Charter propoſed, is evident at firſt View: On the contrary, we ſhould by it be confined to ſtricter Limits than we now are, particularly with reſpect to the Power of making By-Laws, and being ſubjected to Viſitors of the Proprietaries Appointment. But that Clauſe which makes the Lot (and of Conſequence the Buildings on it) revert to the Proprietaries, on Failure of a Succeſſion of Contributors, is ſo weighty an Objection, that were there no other, we could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007197_0014_102B394517F26EA0"/>
the leaſt Thoughts of accepting the Charter; for as the Sum allowed for Support of the Hoſpital is limited, we may reaſonably conclude, that in Time there will ceaſe to be a Succeſſion of Contributors, and no Perſon can imagine that when that happens to be the Caſe, the Lot and Buildings ought to become the private Property of any Man: And tho' the Act of Aſſembly hath made Proviſion in a Manner which may be liable to ſome Inconveniences, yet it can ſcarce fail of anſwering the Purpoſes firſt intended. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietaries, to be ſure, have not attended to theſe Conſequences, or they never would have propoſed any Thing ſo inconſiſtent with the Deſign they intended to promote.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>AS to the Lot that the Proprietaries deſigned for the Hoſpital, it is ſo ſituated, and ſo circumſtanced, that it will by no Means be ſuitable for the Purpoſe; it is a moiſt Piece of Ground, adjoining to the Brick-yards, where there are Ponds of ſtanding Water, and therefore muſt be unhealthy, and more fit for a Burying-place (to which Uſe Part of it is already applied) than for any other Service; beſides, as it is Part of a Square al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted by the late honourable Proprietary for publick Uſes, as the old Maps of the City will ſhew, our Fellow-citizens would tax us with Injuſtice to them, if we ſhould accept of this Lot by a Grant from our preſent Proprietaries, in ſuch Terms as would ſeem to imply our aſſenting to their having a Right to the Remainder of the Square.</hi>

                  <p>WE now, on Behalf of the Contributors to the <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> Hoſpital, with much Gratitude and Reſpect, acknowledge the benevolent Diſpoſition you have manifeſted by your Induſtry and Care in ſolliciting our Addreſs to our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietaries; and as we are fully convinced nothing hath been wanting on your Parts, we ſhould have been much pleaſed that the Lot which the Proprietaries propoſed for the Hoſpital, and the Terms of their Grant, were ſuch as we deſired, or could accept.</p>
                  <p>IMMEDIATELY after the Receipt of your Letter, with the Copy of that you had from the Proprietaries, our Preſident waited on the Governor, who was pleaſed to communicate to us the Inſtructions he had received; and as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer given by the Proprietaries to you, may have induced you to think they had granted our Requeſt, we think it neceſſary to ſend you a Copy of their Inſtructions to the Governor, after Peruſal of which, and of the few Remarks we have made thereon, we have no Doubt you will approve of our Reſolutions not to accept of a Lot on theſe Terms.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE we agreed on the Addreſs to the Proprietaries, we ſurvey'd the Square (of which the Lot propoſed by them is a Part) and the Situation appeared to us in every Reſpect inconvenient and unſuitable for our Purpoſe: It is contiguous to the Brick-makers Grounds, from which the City hath been furniſhed with Bricks above Forty Years paſt, ſo that their large Ponds being continually filled with ſtanding Water, renders the Neighbourhood unhealthy, and of courſe abſolutely improper for our Purpoſe, which is to reſtore the Sick to Health; and the only proper Uſe of that Square will be for a Burying-ground, to which Service ſome Part of it hath been applied by a Grant from the Proprietaries; and the Diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which appeared, and ſtill ſubſiſts among our Fellow-citizens, on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietaries
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007197_0015_102B3947B8BD0E10"/>
claiming a Right to make that Grant is ſo great, that if there were no other Objection, we would not run the Riſque of encreaſing it.</p>
                  <p>WE ſtill think that the Lot we firſt mentioned is more ſuitable for us than any other ſo near the City, and of ſo ſmall Value, and we are not entirely without Hopes that the Proprietaries, who have ſo fully declared their Approbation of our Deſign, will ſtill grant the ſame to us; we are aſſured, if they regard their own Intereſt in the Affections of the People, or even attend to the Juſtice of their concurring in the Promoting of every Scheme calculated for the Publick Utility of their Province, they will chearfully grant it to us: And if you ſhould entertain the ſame Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we requeſt you to renew your Sollicitations to them, and if you find them ſtill unwilling to favour our Requeſt, we ſhould be pleaſed to know whether they will ſell it to us, or let it for ever on an annual Rent, and the Price or Rent they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for as the Number of Contributors ſtill continues gradually encreaſing, we ſhall rather endeavour to purchaſe a Lot in a proper Situation, than to build the Houſe in an inconvenient Place, or to accept of any Lot on ſuch Terms as we know would give a general Diſſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>ONE of the Contributors hath offered to give a Lot of Ground much larger than that we now aſk, and in a very good Air, but being about a Mile out of Town, we are apprehenſive it will be inconvenient to the Phyſicians, who, as they freely give their Attendance, ſhould be ſubjected to as little Difficulty as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>WE have, for the preſent, hired a Houſe tolerably convenient, into which we began to admit Patients about ſix Months ſince; the Number ſince received is Twenty-three, of which Twelve have been cured and diſcharged, and Eleven are remaining; and as the Benefits of this Inſtitution become daily more attended to, we have not the leaſt Doubt that the Minds of ſuch who are bleſſed with the Means, will gradually become the more freely diſpoſed to contribute towards this good Work, and that it will ſoon become of general Service to the People of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
                  <p>THE kind Manner in which you have chearfully engaged to ſerve us, gives us Reaſon to think you will approve of our writing to you with ſo much Freedom, we ſhall not therefore offer any Apology for it.</p>

And as to the Remark againſt its reverting to the Proprietaries, be very readily declared nothing more was intended by the Clauſe in the Grant, than that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Scheme for the Eſtabliſhment and Continuance of the Hoſpital ſhould not ſucceed, either for want of the Sum propoſed to be raiſed as a Fund, or through any other Cauſe, that then the Ground ſhould revert,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but as to the Erections thereon, they ſhould be at the Managers Diſpoſal. We deſired his Anſwer in Writing, but he refuſed the Giving it in that Manner, and added, the Governor ſhould have the neceſſary Inſtructions on the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, unto whom you might apply concerning it. On the whole, he came to this Reſolution, not to make any Alteration in what was before granted, nor to lett or ſell the Spot of Ground you pitch upon; and therefore we are of Opinion, you ſhould either accept the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary's Offer, with the Clauſe relating to the reverting to them being explained, or elſe to fix on ſome other Piece of Ground. And if there is no other Objection than the ſmall Diſtance of a Mile to the Place which one of the Contributors hath offered to give you, may not that be more fit for an Hoſpital or Infirmary, than to have it in the City, where infections Diſeaſes may be much more liable to ſpread. We obſerve, with Pleaſure, the Succeſs that hath attended the Beginning of the good Work you are engaged in, and hope it will go forward, and be happily compleated, and are, with hearty Salutes,</hi>

               <p>AMONG all the innumerable Species of Animals which inhabit the Air, Earth and Water, ſo exceedingly different in their Production, their Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the Manner of their Exiſtence, and ſo varied in Form, that even of the ſame Kind, it can ſcarce be ſaid there are two Individuals in all Reſpects alike; it is remarkable there are none within our Obſervation diſtinguiſhed from the reſt by this Particular, that they are by Nature incapable of Diſeaſes. The old Poets, how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> extravagant ſoever in their Fictions, durſt never offend ſo far againſt Nature and Probability, as even to feign ſuch a Thing; and therefore, tho' they made their <hi>Achilles</hi> invulnerable from Head to Foot, and clad him beſide in impenetrable Armour, forg'd by the Immortals, they were obliged to leave one ſoft unguarded Place in his Heel, how ſmall ſoever, for Deſtruction to enter at.—But tho' every Animal that hath Life is liable to Death, Man, of all other Creatures, has the greateſt Number of Diſeaſes to his Share; whether they are the Effects of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and Vice, or are given us, that we may have a greater Opportunity of exerciſing towards each other that Virtue, which moſt of all recommends us to the Deity, I mean CHARITY.</p>
               <p>THE great Author of our Faith, whoſe Life ſhould be the conſtant Object of our Imitation, as far as it is not inimitable, always ſhew'd the greateſt Compaſſion and Regard for the Sick; he diſdain'd not to viſit and adminiſter Comfort and Health to the meaneſt of the People; and he frequently inculcated the ſame Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in his Doctrine and Precepts to his Diſciples. For this one Thing (in that beautiful Parable of the Traveller wounded by Thieves) the <hi>Samaritan</hi> (who was eſteemed no better than a Heretick or Infidel by the Orthodox of thoſe Times) is preferred to the Prieſt and the <hi>Levite,</hi> becauſe he did not, like them, paſs by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the Diſtreſs of his Brother Mortal, but when he came to the Place where the half-dead Traveller lay, <hi>he had Compaſſion on him, and went to him, and bound up his Wounds, pouring in Oil and Wine, and ſet him on his own Beaſt, and brought him to an Inn, and took Care of him.</hi>—<hi>Dives,</hi> alſo, the rich Man, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as being excluded from the Happineſs of Heaven, becauſe he fared ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly every Day, and had Plenty of all Things, and yet neglected to comfort and aſſiſt his poor Neighbour, who was helpleſs, and <hi>full of Sores,</hi> and might perhaps have been revived and reſtored with ſmall Care, <hi>by the Crumbs that fell from his Table,</hi> or, as we ſay, <hi>with his looſe Corns.</hi>—<hi>I was ſick, and ye viſited me,</hi> is one of the Terms of Admiſſion into Bliſs, and the Contrary, a Cauſe of Excluſion: That is, as our Saviour himſelf explains it, <hi>Ye have viſited, or ye have not viſited, aſſiſted and comforted thoſe who ſtood in need of it, even tho' they were the leaſt, or meaneſt of Mankind.</hi> This Branch of Charity ſeems eſſential to the true Spirit of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007197_0018_102B394D71410628"/>
Chriſtianity, and ſhould be extended to all in General, whether Deſerving or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving, as far as our Power reaches. Of the ten Lepers who were cleanſed, nine ſeem to have been much more unworthy than the Tenth, yet, in reſpect to the Cure of their Diſeaſe, they equally ſhared the Goodneſs of GOD. And the great Phyſician in ſending forth his Diſciples, always gave them a particular Charge, <hi>that into whatſoever City they entered, they ſhould heal all the Sick,</hi> without Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>WHEN the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> left his Patient at the Inn, <hi>he gave Money to the Hoſt, and ſaid, take Care of him, and what thou ſpendeſt more, I will repay thee.</hi> We are in this World mutual Hoſts to each other; the Circumſtances and Fortunes of Men and Families are continually changing; in the Courſe of a few Years we have ſeen the Rich become Poor, and the Poor Rich; the Children of the Wealthy lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing in Want and Miſery, and thoſe of their Servants lifted into Eſtates, and abounding in the good Things of this Life. Since then our preſent State, how proſperous ſoever, hath no Stability, but what depends on the good Providence of GOD, how careful ſhould we be not to harden our Hearts againſt the Diſtreſſes of our Fellow Creatures, left he who owns and governs All, ſhould puniſh our Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, deprive us of a Stewardſhip in which we have ſo unworthily behaved, <hi>laugh at our Calamity, and mock when our Fear cometh.</hi> Methinks when Objects of Charity, and Opportunities of relieving them, preſent themſelves, we ſhould hear the Voice of this <hi>Samaritan,</hi> as if it were the Voice of GOD ſounding in our Ears, <hi>Take Care of them, and whatſoever thou ſpendeſt, I will repay thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the Good particular Men may do ſeparately in relieving the Sick, is ſmall, compared with what they may do collectively, or by a joint Endeavour and Intereſt. Hence the Erecting of Hoſpitals or Infirmaries by Subſcription, for the Reception, Entertainment, and Cure of the Sick Poor, has been found by Experience exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly beneficial, as they turn out annually great Numbers of Patients perfectly cured, who might otherwiſe have been loſt to their Families, and to Society. Hence Infirmaries ſpread more and more in <hi>Europe,</hi> new Ones being continually erected in large Cities and populous Towns, where generally the moſt ſkilful Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians and Surgeons inhabit. And the Subſcribers have had the Satisfaction in a few Years of ſeeing the Good they propoſed to do, become much more extenſive than was at firſt expected; for the Multitude and Variety of Caſes continually treated in thoſe Infirmaries, not only render the Phyſicians and Surgeons who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them, ſtill more expert and ſkilful, for the Benefit of others, but afford ſuch ſpeedy and effectual Inſtruction to the young Students of both Profeſſions, who come from different and remote Parts of the Country for Improvement, that they return with a more ample Stock of Knowledge in their Art, and become Bleſſings to the Neighbourhoods in which they fix their Reſidence.</p>
               <p>IT is therefore a great Pleaſure to all the Benevolent and Charitable, who have been acquainted with theſe Things in other Countries, to obſerve, that an Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame Kind has met with ſuch Encouragement in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and is in ſuch Forwardneſs, that there is Reaſon to expect it may be carried into Execution the enſuing Year. May the Father of Mercies grant it his Bleſſing, and Thouſand of our unhappy Fellow Creatures, yet unborn, will have cauſe to bleſs him, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </q>
               <p>THIS Motto, taken from a Pagan Author, expreſſes the general Senſe of Mankind, even in the earlieſt Ages, concerning that great Duty and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Charity, the adminiſtring Comfort and Relief to the Sick. If Men, without any other Aſſiſtance than the Dictates of natural Reaſon, had ſo high an Opinion of it, what may be expected from Chriſtians, to whom it has been ſo warmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the beſt Example of human Conduct. To viſit the Sick, to feed the Hungry, to clothe the Naked, and comfort the Afflicted, are the inſeparable Duties of a Chriſtian Life.</p>
               <p>ACCORDINGLY 'tis obſervable, that the Chriſtian Doctrine hath had a real Effect on the Conduct of Mankind, which the mere Knowledge of Duty, without the Sanctions Revelation affords, never produced among the Heathens: For Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory ſhows, that from the earlieſt Times of Chriſtianity, in all well regulated States where Chriſtians obtained ſufficient Influence, publick Funds and private Charities have been appropriated to the Building of Hoſpitals, for receiving, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, and curing thoſe unhappy Creatures, whoſe Poverty is aggravated by the additional Load of bodily Pain. But of theſe Kind of Inſtitutions among the Pagans, there is no Trace in the Hiſtory of their Times.</p>
               <p>THAT good Prince EDWARD VI. was ſo affected at the Miſeries of his poor diſeaſed Subjects, repreſented in a Charity Sermon preach'd to him on the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that he ſoon after laid the Foundation of four of the largeſt Hoſpitals now in <hi>London,</hi> which the Citizens finiſhed, and have ever ſince maintain'd.</p>
               <p>IN <hi>Hide-park,</hi> at <hi>Bath,</hi> in <hi>Edinburgh, Liverpool, Wincheſter,</hi> and in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> and ſundry other Places in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> large and commodious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmaries have been lately erected, from trifling Beginnings of private Charities: And ſo wonderfully does Providence favour theſe pious Inſtitutions, that there is not an Inſtance of any One's failing for want of neceſſary charitable Contributions.<note n="*" place="bottom">

THE Increaſe of poor diſeaſed Foreigners and others, ſettled in the diſtant Parts of this Province, where regular Advice and Aſſiſtance cannot be procured, but at an Expence that neither they nor their Townſhips can afford, has waken'd the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of ſundry humane and well diſpoſed Minds, to procure ſome more certain, effectual and eaſy Methods for their Relief than have hitherto been provided; and having repreſented the Affair to the Aſſembly, a Law was paſſed, without one diſſenting Voice, giving <hi>Two Thouſand Pounds</hi> for building and furniſhing a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Hoſpital, on Condition that <hi>Two Thouſand Pounds</hi> more ſhould be raiſed by private Donations, to be put out to Intereſt as Part of a perpetual Fund for ſupporting it; and the Contributors were made a Body Corporate, with all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers neceſſary on the Occaſion. Since which, People of all Ranks in this City have united zealouſly and heartily in promoting this pious and excellent Deſign, and more than the Sum ſtipulated was ſubſcribed in a few Days only, and a much larger Sum will probably be raiſed here, if the Country chearfully contributes to the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Stock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which 'tis not to be doubted they will do, when they conſider how much they are intereſted in it.</p>
               <p>THE Difference between nurſing and curing the Sick in an Hoſpital, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in private Lodgings, with Regard to the Expence, is at leaſt as ten to one. For Inſtance, ſuppoſe a Perſon under the Neceſſity of having a Limb amputated, he muſt have the conſtant Attendance of a Nurſe, a Room, Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not for the firſt three or four Weeks be procured at leſs Expence than <hi>Fifteen Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> a Week, and never after at leſs than <hi>Ten:</hi> If he continues two Months, his Nurſing will be <hi>Five Pounds,</hi> his Surgeon's Fee, and other accidental Charges, commonly amounts to <hi>Three Pounds,</hi> in the whole near <hi>Ten Pounds;</hi> whereas in an Hoſpital, one Nurſe, one Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be ſufficient for ten Patients, the Extra Expences will be inconſiderable, and the Surgeons Fees taken off, which will bring the above Calculation within the Limits of Truth.</p>
               <p>BUT the Difference with regard to the unhappy Sufferer is ſtill greater. In an Hoſpital his Caſe will be treated according to the beſt Rules of Art, by Men of Experience and known Abilities in their Profeſſion. His Lodgings will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, clean and neat, in an healthy and open Situation, his Diet will be well choſen, and properly adminiſtred: He will have many other neceſſary Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007197_0021_102B395499A12458"/>
for his Relief, ſuch as hot and cold Baths, Sweating-rooms, Chirurgic Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines, Bandage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which can rarely be procured in the beſt private Lodgings, much leſs in thoſe miſerable loathſome Holes, which are the common Receptacles of the diſeaſed Poor that are brought to this City.—In ſhort, a Beggar, in a well regulated Hoſpital, ſtands an equal Chance with a Prince in his Palace for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Subſiſtence, and an expeditious and effectual Cure of his Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>IT is hoped therefore, that whoever will maturely conſider the ineſtimable Bleſſings that are connected to a proper Execution of the preſent Hoſpital Scheme in this City, can never be ſo void of Humanity, and the eſſential Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as to turn a deaf Ear to the numberleſs Cries of the Poor and Needy, and refuſe, for their Aſſiſtance, a little of that Superfluity, which a bountiful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has ſo liberally beſtowed on them.</p>
            </q>
            <p>ON the Sixteenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> it being made appear, to the Satisfaction of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that the Contributions amounted to upwards of <hi>Two Thouſand Pounds,</hi> an Order was obtained for the <hi>Two Thouſand Pounds</hi> that had been conditionally granted by the Act, <hi>One Thouſand Pounds</hi> to be paid immediately, the other in Twelve Months. The Money, when received, was lett out at Intereſt on good Security, that it might be improving till it ſhould be wanted for the Building, which the Managers were obliged to poſtpone till a Piece of Ground could be obtained that would afford ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Room in an airy, healthy Situation, and yet ſo nigh the built Streets of the City, as that the Managers, Phyſicians and Surgeons, might readily and conveniently viſit the Houſe on every Occaſion. But that ſome Good might be doing in the mean Time, the Managers concluded to hire a Houſe, and take in ſome Patients for a Beginning; but ſome Doubts ariſing concerning the Power and Duty of the Managers, a general Meeting of the Contributors was called to ſettle the ſame, and the following Law was paſſed for thoſe and other Purpoſes, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>ABOUT the Beginning of this Year twelve Tin Boxes were provided, on which were written theſe Words in Gold Letters, <hi>CHARITY FOR THE HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPITAL.</hi> One Box for each Manager, to be put up in his Houſe, ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive caſual Benefactions, in Imitation of a good Cuſtom practiſed in ſome foreign Countries, where theſe Kind of Boxes are frequent in Shops, Stores, and other Places of Buſineſs, and into which the Buyer and Seller (when different Prices are propoſed) often agree to throw the Difference, inſtead of ſplitting it: In which the Succeſsful in Trade ſometimes piouſly depoſite a Part of their extraordinary Gains, and Magiſtrates throw their petty Fees; a Cuſtom worthy Imitation! But theſe Boxes among us have produced but little for the Hoſpital as yet, not through want of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in our People, but from their being unacquainted with the Nature and Deſign of them.</p>
            <p>IN <hi>March,</hi> 1753, Doctor <hi>Lloyd Zachary,</hi> who had diligently attended the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital from the Beginning, being diſabled by a paralytick Diſorder, Doctor <hi>William Shippen</hi> was about this Time choſen, by the Managers, to ſupply his Place.</p>
            <p>IN <hi>May,</hi> 1753, the Committee of Managers appointed to ſettle the Accounts of the Hoſpital, made a Report of them, of which the following is an Abſtract, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <hi>N. B.</hi> THE Majority of the Lunaticks taken in had been many Years diſorder'd, and their Diſeaſes become too habitual to admit of Relief; others whoſe Caſes were recent, and might probably have been cured, being put in at private Expence, were ſo haſtily taken away by their Friends, that ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Time was not allowed for their Recovery: The Managers have therefore, as well for the Sake of the Afflicted, as the Reputation of the Hoſpital, reſolved to admit none hereafter, who are not allowed to remain twelve Months in the Houſe, if not cured ſooner, or judged by the Phyſicians to be incurable.</p>
            <p>THE Choice of the Sick to be ſupported on the publick Stock, was confined to ſuch only whoſe Caſes could not be healed properly in their reſpective Habitations, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

FROM the foregoing Accounts it appears, That from the Tenth of <hi>February<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 1752, to the Twenty-ſeventh of <hi>April,</hi> 1754, which is but about two Years and two Months, ſixty Perſons, afflicted with various Diſtempers, have been cured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many others that have received conſiderable Relief, both In and Out-patients; and if ſo much Good has been done by ſo ſmall a Number of Contributors, how much more then may reaſonably be expected from the liberal Aid and Aſſiſtance of the Well-diſpoſed who hitherto have not join'd in the Undertaking? Experience has more and more convinced all concerned, of the great Uſefulneſs of this Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.—The careful Attendance afforded to the Sick Poor; the Neatneſs, Cleanneſs, and Regularity of Diet with which they are kept in the Hoſpital, are found to contribute to their Recovery much ſooner than their own Manner of Living at Home, and render the Phyſick they take more effectual. Here they have the beſt Advice, and the beſt Medicines, which are Helps to Recovery, that many in better Circumſtances in different Parts of the Province do not enjoy. In ſhort, there is ſcarce any one Kind of doing Good, which is not hereby in ſome Manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted; for not only the Sick are viſited and relieved, but the Stranger is taken in, the Ignorant inſtructed, and the Bad reclaimed<note n="*" place="bottom">The kind Viſits and Converſation of ſome ſerious Perſons, and the pious Books that have been left in the Hoſpital, recommended to the Peruſal of the Patients, together with the exact Regularity kept in the Houſe, have been attended with a Bleſſing in theſe Reſpects.</note>; preſent Wants are ſupplied, and the future prevented, and (by eaſing poor Families of the Burthen of ſupporting and curing their Sick) it is alſo the Means of feeding the Hungry, and cloathing the Naked.</p>
            <p>IT is therefore hoped, that by additional Benefactions from pious and benevolent Perſons (an Account of which will be publiſhed yearly according to Law) this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity may be farther extended, ſo as to embrace with open Arms all the Sick Poor that need the Relief it affords, and that the Managers will not, in Time to come, be under a Neceſſity, from the Narrowneſs of the Funds, of refuſing Admittance to any proper Object. <q>It is hoped that a deaf Ear will not be turn'd to the Cries of thoſe, in whoſe Favour both Religion and Humanity ſtrongly plead; who are recommended by the great Pattern of human Conduct; who in Sickneſs are loſt to Society; who contribute greatly to the Inſtruction of thoſe Youth to whom the Lives of High and Low may hereafter be entruſted, whoſe Prayers are to be ſent up for their Deliverers; but that all will aſſiſt to render the Funds of this Hoſpital anſwerable to the Neceſſities of the Poor.—Incapacity of contributing can by none be pleaded; the Rich only indeed can beſtow large Sums, but moſt can ſpare ſomething yearly, which collected from many, might make a handſome Revenue, by which great Numbers of diſtreſs'd Objects can be taken Care of, and relieved, many of whom may poſſibly one Day make a Part of the bleſſed Company above, when a Cup of cold Water given to them will not be unrewarded. Let People but reflect what unneceſſary Expences they have been at in any Year for vain Superfluities or Entertainments, for mere Amuſements or Diverſions, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in vicious Debauches; and then let them put the Queſtion to themſelves, Whether they do not wiſh that Money had been given in the Way now propoſed? If this Reflection has Influence on their future Conduct, the Poor will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
