            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>THE world now yields to night's returning ſway;</l>
            <l>The deeper glooms lead on the ſolemn hour,</l>
            <l>And call my ſteps, beneath the moon's pale ray,</l>
            <l>To roam in ſadneſs on the ſea-beat ſhore.</l>
            <l>Now glide the unconſtant ſhadows o'er the plain,</l>
            <l>The broad moon ſwimming thro' the broken clouds,</l>
            <l>The gleam of waters brightens on the main,</l>
            <l>And anchor'd navies lift their waving ſhrouds.</l>
            <l>Deep ſilence reigns, ſave on the moory ground,</l>
            <l>The long reed ruſtling to the paſſing gales,</l>
            <l>The noiſe of daſhing waves, and hollow ſound</l>
            <l>Of ruſhing winds that murmur thro' the ſails.</l>
            <l>Far hence, ye pleaſures of a mind at eaſe,</l>
            <l>The ſprightly joys that rural ſcenes can yield,</l>
            <l>When ſpring, led jocund by the ſoft'ning breeze</l>
            <l>Wakes the glad morn and robes the dewy field.</l>
            <l>Far be the giddy raptures of the gay,</l>
            <l>The midnight joys licentious youth can ſhare,</l>
            <l>While Ruin, ſmiling o'er her deſtin'd prey,</l>
            <l>In ſweet allurements hides her deadly ſnare.</l>
            <l>Mine be the muſic of the rolling wave,</l>
            <l>The moonlight ſhadows and ſurrounding gloom,</l>
            <l>Mine the dread haunts of Contemplation grave,</l>
            <l>That lift the ſoul to ſcenes beyond the tomb.</l>
            <l>Here while deep midnight hold her ſilent reign,</l>
            <l>And fancy bears the raviſh'd thought along,</l>
            <l>Dark Melancholy ſpreads her airy train,</l>
            <l>And Friendſhip calls and Grief inſpires the ſong.</l>
            <l>As thro' theſe mournful glooms I ſtretch my ſight,</l>
            <l>Mid ſounds of death that bid the ſoul attend,</l>
            <l>Mid empty forms and fleeting ſhapes of night,</l>
            <l>Slowly I view a whiterobed ſhade aſcend.</l>
            <l>That ſays, "I once was St. John! from the bounds</l>
            <l>Of unknown realms beneath the dreary wave,</l>
            <l>Where ever-reſtleſs floods in nightly rounds,</l>
            <l>Roll their dark ſurges o'er my watry grave.</l>
            <l>From ſeats which, near to mortal ſight diſplay'd,</l>
            <l>The gates of vaſt eternity ſurround,</l>
            <l>In night conceal'd and death's impervious ſhade,</l>
            <l>My voice aſcends! attend the warning ſound.</l>
            <l>Oh, thou attend! who fluſh'd with early bloom,</l>
            <l>In life's new ſpring and vernal ſweetneſs gay,</l>
            <l>Mindleſs of fate, that muſt thy branch entomb,</l>
            <l>Spread'ſt thy green bloſſoms to the morning ray.</l>
            <l>With thee how late, how like alas, to thee,</l>
            <l>To mortal joys by opening youth beguil'd,</l>
            <l>I ſtretch'd my airy wiſh, and follow'd free,</l>
            <l>Where pleaſure triumph'd and where fancy ſmil'd.</l>
            <l>Then while fond Hope her glitt'ring pinions ſpread,</l>
            <l>Pointing to climes beyond the diſtant wave,</l>
            <l>Ev'n then unnoticed o'er my deſtined head</l>
            <l>Hung Death's dire form and ſeal'd me for the grave.</l>
            <l>How vain the thought for many a joyous morn,</l>
            <l>To taſte of raptures unallay'd by woe!</l>
            <l>At once from life and every pleaſure torn,</l>
            <l>From all I wiſh'd and all I loved below.</l>
            <l>The faithleſs morning, on our opening ſails,</l>
            <l>Smiled out ſerene and ſmooth'd our gliding way,</l>
            <l>While the gay veſſel, fann'd by breathing gales,</l>
            <l>Play'd on the placid boſom of the ſea.</l>
            <l>When lo, deſcending on the dark'ning wind,</l>
            <l>Burſt the dire ſtorm—and feeble to ſuſtain</l>
            <l>The ruſhing blaſts in warring fury join'd,</l>
            <l>The frail ſkiff ſinks beneath the ſurging main.</l>
            <l>And ſee, afar the oarleſs boat conveys</l>
            <l>The trembling ſailors to the diſtant ſhore;</l>
            <l>Alone, of aid bereft, with one laſt gaze,</l>
            <l>I ſunk in deeps and ſunk to riſe no more.</l>
            <l>In that ſad hour, what fearful ſcenes ariſe,</l>
            <l>What pangs diſtreſs, what unknown fears diſmay,</l>
            <l>When future worlds diſcloſing on our eyes,</l>
