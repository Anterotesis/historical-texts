            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Conſider alſo, how vile and loathſome thou and all thy Actions, whether Natural, Civil, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, are in the Sight of a holy God <pb n="3" facs="unknown:039983_0003_1015866C6BBEB330"/>while thou art out of Chriſt: Thy Soul is naked, and ſwarms with the Vermin of filthy Luſts, and thou haſt neither a <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to cover thee, nor a <hi>Fountain</hi> to waſh thee: The Leproſie of Sin ſpreads over all, ſo that from the <hi>Crown of the Head,</hi> to the <hi>Sole of the Foot,</hi> there is nothing but <hi>Bruiſes and putrefying Sores</hi>: So that there is no Mire ſo unclean, no Vomit ſo loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, no Carrion ſo offenſive, no Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſo noiſome, as thou art in thy <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs State,</hi> in the Eyes of a <hi>holy God, who cannot look upon Iniquity, but with Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> Again, Conſider thou art a Slave to Satan the worſt of Tyrants, he rules and works in your Hearts, as a Workman doth in his Shop, <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 2.

Moreover, while thou art in thy Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs State, God's Wrath is ſtill burning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, the flaming Sword of Juſtice is always over thy Neck, Pſal. vii. 11. <hi>God is angry with the wicked every Day,</hi> every Day of the Week, and every Hour of the Day; when thou goeſt out and comeſt in, riſe it up, or lyeſt down, God is ſtill angry with thee; yea, <hi>He hath bent his Bow, and made ready his Arrows,</hi> which are ſteeled with Wrath, and headed with Vengeance; nay, his Bow is drawn, and his Arrows are at the Flight; and, O Chriſtleſs Soul, thou art only the Butt thereof, and if he let them fly, they will pierce thee to the very Soul, and who will heal that Wound? What a dangerous State is this?</p>
            <p>And further, All the Curſes of the Law are levelled againſt thee, and a juſt God is engaged by his Oath to ruin thee, if thou abideſt in this State, Heb. iii. 18. <hi>To whom ſware he, that they ſhould not enter into his Reſt, but to them that believed not.</hi> Should not the Thoughts of this make thee tremble? Were it but the Oath of a Man or a Company of Men to procure thy Death as of theſe forty Men that bound themſelves with an Oath, they would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eat nor Drink till they killed <hi>Paul,</hi> it would bereave thee of thy Nights reſt and quiet till they were made Friends with thee; And will the Oath of the great God have no Effect upon thee, nor move <pb n="5" facs="unknown:039983_0004_1015866EDEED1D40"/>thee to flee to Chriſt for Protection and Reconciliation? Who can help thee or deal for thee, if Chriſt be neglected? With what Face canſt thou look to him, or cry for Mercy from him, when he comes to judge thee at the laſt Day. If thou remain Chriſtleſs now, thou wilt be Speechleſs, Helpleſs and Hopeleſs then. O think, what pale Faces, quivering Lips, fainting Hearts &amp; trembling Conſciences will be among Chriſtleſs Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners chen? How will their Heads hang down, and Knees knock together, and cry, alas for the Day! They can look no where for Comfort, for the Judge frowns on them, the Saints deride them, their own Friends upbraid them, the Angels mock them, the Devils ſcoff at them, the Heavens thunder againſt them, the Earth flames about them, and Hell groans for them, and down they will go roaring and howling for ever.</p>
            <p>O Chriſtleſs Soul, how can'ſt thou think to ly in that dark Dungeon for ever, where there is nothing but <hi>weeping and guaſhing of Teeth</hi> to be heard, and <hi>utter Darkneſs</hi> to be ſeen, but never the leaſt Sight of the Light of God's Favour to all Eternity?

Put all your other Sins in one Scale, and Unbelief in another, and you will find that Unbelief weighs down all the Reſt, for it is a ſlighting of the whole Work of Redemption, which is the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of all God's Works, being that which hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>III. Conſider what an unſpeakable Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Happineſs it is to you, to enjoy the free Offers of Jeſus Chriſt, and to have God commanding you to receive him. How would the fallen Angels value ſuch a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if they had it? They would not be loth to leave their Dungeon and accept of a Saviour as you are: But their State is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally hopeleſs and deſperate, there is no Remedy for their Miſery; O do not put your ſelves in the ſame Caſe with them by ſlighting the offered Remedy. How would damned Souls prize ſuch an Offer? The leaſt News, and remoteſt Hopes of it would make them leap in their Chains, and ſing in the Flames. O how glad would they be to lift up their flaming Hands to take hold of the Cords of Love and Mercy if they could be let down to them in that dark Dungeon? <pb n="8" facs="unknown:039983_0006_10158673919E48D0"/>Why then ſhould ye wilfully put your ſelves into the ſame hopeleſs Condition with them by your Unbelief? Nay, your neglecting ſo many Offers, will ſink you far deeper in that ſcalding Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, and increaſe your Flames to more Vehemency than theſe of others who have not been ſo privileged. O how will <hi>Devils, Turks, Jesus</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid you there, for your inexcuſeable Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſlighting your Mercy, and deſtroying your Souls?

Conſider what an excellent &amp; ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Help Chriſt is for fallen Sinners; he is well furniſhed and qualified for your Caſe, he hath <hi>Gold</hi> for your Poverty, <hi>Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve</hi> for your Blindneſs, <hi>Balm</hi> for your Wounds, <hi>Phyſick</hi> for your Diſeaſes, <hi>Bread</hi> for your Hunger, <hi>White Raiment</hi> for your Nakedneſs, a <hi>Fountain</hi> for your Pollution, and a <hi>Ranſom</hi> for your Debt and Bondage. In a Word, he hath a broad Plaiſter for your broad Sore, a deep Fountain for your deep Guilt; he is the chief of Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours for the chief of Sinners. Behold how one Deep calls to another, the Depth of thy Miſery, for the Depth of his Mercy. Are your Sins and Miſeries very extenſive, then view the large Dimenſions of his Mercy, Who can fathom the Height, the Depth, the Breadth or Length of it? As <pb n="9" facs="unknown:039983_0006_10158673919E48D0"/>for its Height, it is high as Heaven, and ſurmounts the higheſt Mountains of Guilt: It is ſo deep that it can bury the greateſt of your Sins: It is as broad as the Eaſt is from the Weſt: And for its Length, it is from Everlaſting to Everlaſting, ſo that it fully anſwers all your Wants and Miſeries. In Chriſt there is all you need or can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; there is both. Food and Phyſick, Cloathing, Strength, and Cordials; O Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, here is Blood to juſtify thee, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cleanſe; here the Water of Life, O Believer, that will reſtore thy Soul again, renew thy Youth as the Eagles, cure all thy Diſeaſes, and heal all thy Pains. In a word, you have in Chriſt all that can make you Good, all that can make you Great, and all that can make you Happy.</p>
            <p>V. Conſider how <hi>near</hi> you are to Chriſt and Mercy, the Remedy is prepared, and Salvation is brought to your very Door, ſo that you need not ſay, <hi>who will aſcend to Heaven, to bring me down the Water of Life</hi>; for it is brought to Earth to thy Hand: You need not ſay, <hi>Who will roll me away the Stone from the Well Mouth</hi>? for Chriſt hath done it for thee, and it is now a <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain opened,</hi> and running by your Door. O it would be ſad to be ſo near Chriſt, and yet eternally miſs him, to periſh like the Thief on the Croſs with a Saviour at your Side, to be within a Step of him, and yet never touch him, yea to ſink into Hell

He will not fail to notice and encourage an honeſt Attempt, Jer. xxx. 21. <hi>Who is this that engageth his Heart to approach to me</hi>? He will pity and help ſuch. If you cannot apply Chriſt to your ſelves and ſay, <hi>He is mine,</hi> yet apply your ſelf to Chriſt and ſay, <hi>I would fain be thine,</hi> yea I am reſolved to be thine. Go forth to Chriſt with all the Faith you can arrive at, ſay with the poor Man, <hi>Lord I believe, help thou my Unbelief.</hi> You muſt not ſit ſtill and do nothing, but uſe all Means in your Power, for it is in the Uſe of theſe that God works Faith; hoiſe up the Sails and wait for the Gales.</p>
