            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>FROM a very ſingular publication, which few of our readers will have an opportunity of ſeeing, we give the following ſtory. It will be neceſſary to preface it by narrating a few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars which are intimately connected with the hiſtory.</p>
            <p>It was in the year 1783 that the baron de Faublas arrived in Paris, where he had reſolved to place his daughter in a convent. He was accompanied by his ſon the chevalier de Faublas. After remaining ſome weeks in the capital, the baron, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of his intimate friend, M. Duportail, came to the reſolution of reſiding ſome years in Paris, for the purpoſe of giving the beſt education to the only heir of his name, and of ſuperintending the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032388_0003_0FF20D732CC3B398"/>
happineſs of a daughter whom he loved. The young chevalier was ſoon initiated into all the faſhionable diſſipation of the metropolis; his accompliſhments were the admiration of the other ſex, and the envy of his own. But while indulging in theſe criminal purſuits, a paſſion of a purer kind poſſeſſed the empire of his heart. In the courſe of his viſits to the convent, he had ſeen and loved mademoiſelle Sophia de Pontis, the amiable friend of his ſiſter. The heart of Sophia yielded to the attractions of the chevalier; their paſſions was reciprocal. The baron was not long ignorant of their attachment; his ſon's viſits to the convent were prohibited, and he was given to underſtand, that the daughter of M. Duportail was deſtined for his wife. What little he knew of this lady he had <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from having overheard a converſation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween M. Duportail and his father, from which it appeared, that the former had long mourned a loſt daughter. He farther underſtood, that as ſoon as his education was completed at Paris, it was his father's intention that he ſhould ſet out on his travels; that he was to remain for ſome months in Poland, and that during his reſidence in that country, he was to be employed in making enquiry reſpecting the fate of the daughter of M. Duportail, and if ſhe yet lived, in endeavouring to reſtore her to her afflicted father. An opportunity was ſoon
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032388_0004_0FF1D645A3658218"/>
after embraced by M. Duportail of communicating to the chevalier the particulars of his ſtory, which we now preſent to our readers.</p>
            <p>My hiſtory preſents a frightful example of the inſtability of fortune. It is indeed very flattering, but it is alſo ſometimes very dangerous, to have an ancient title to ſuſtain and a large eſtate to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. The ſole deſcendant of an illuſtrious family, whoſe origin is loſt in the darkneſs of remote ages, I have a right to aſpire to, and to occupy the firſt employments in the republic which gave me birth, and yet I behold myſelf condemned to languiſh in a foreign country, amidſt an indolent and inglorious obſcurity.</p>
            <p>The name of Lovzinſki is honourably mentioned in the annals of Poland, and that name is about to periſh with myſelf: I know that an auſtere philoſophy either rejects or deſpiſes vain titles and corrupting riches, and perhaps I ſhould conſole myſelf if I had loſt only theſe; but, my young friend, I weep for an adored ſpouſe, I ſearch after a beloved daughter, and I ſhall never more re-viſit my native land. What courage is capable of oppoſing griefs like mine?</p>
            <p>My father, the baron de Lovzinſki, ſtill more diſtinguiſhed by his virtues than by his rank, enjoyed that conſideration at court, which the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032388_0005_0FF20D452FBFFBD8"/>
favour of the prince always confers, and which perſonal merit ſometimes obtains. He beſtowed all the attention of a tender parent on the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my two ſiſters; and in regard to mine, he occupied himſelf with the zeal of a man of family, jealous of the honour of his houſe, of which I was the ſole hope, and with the activity of a good citizen, who deſires nothing ſo ardently as to leave to the ſtate a ſucceſſor worthy of him.</p>
            <p>While I was purſuing my ſtudies at Warſaw, the young P—<note n="*" place="bottom">The Tranſlator thinks that he can venture to pronounce M. de P—to be the nobleman who was formerly called Count <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and who lately ſo worthily filled the throne of Poland.</note> diſtinguiſhed himſelf among the reſt of my companions by the moſt amiable qualities. To the charms of a perſon at once noble and engaging, he joined the graces of a cultivated underſtanding. The uncommon addreſs which he diſplayed among us young warriors; that rare mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty with which he ſeemed deſirous to conceal his own merit from himſelf, on purpoſe to exalt the abilities of his leſs fortunate rivals, who were generally vanquiſhed by him in all our exerciſes; the urbanity of his manners, and the ſweetneſs of his diſpoſition, fixed the attention, commanded the eſteem, and rendered him the darling of that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032388_0006_0FF20D5FAD811FC8"/>
illuſtrious band of young nobility, who partook of our ſtudies and our pleaſures.</p>
            <p>To ſay that it was the reſemblance of our characters, and the ſympathy of our diſpoſitions that occaſioned my attachment to M. de P. would be to pay myſelf too flattering a compliment; however that may be, we both lived together in the moſt intimate familiarity.</p>
            <p>How happy, but how fleeting is that time of life, when one is unacquainted with ambition, which ſacrifices every thing to the deſire of fortune, and the glory that follows in her train, and with love, the ſupreme power of which abſorbs and concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres all our faculties upon one ſole object! that age of innocent pleaſures, and of confident credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, when the heart, as yet a novice, freely follows the impulſe of youthful ſenſibility, and beſtows itſelf unreſervedly upon the object of diſintereſted affection! Then, my dear Faublas, then friendſhip is not a vain name!</p>
            <p>The confident of all the ſecrets of M. de P—, I myſelf undertook nothing without firſt intruſting him with my deſigns; his councils regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated my conduct, mine determined his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; our youth had on pleaſures which were not ſhared, no misfortunes which were not ſolaced by our mutual attachment.</p>
            <p>With what chagrin did I not perceive that fatal
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032388_0007_0FF20D74E142D8C8"/>
moment arrive, when my friend, obliged by the commands of a father to depart from Warſaw, prepared to take leave of me! We promiſed to preſerve for ever that lively affection which had conſtituted the chief happineſs of our youth, and I raſhly ſwore that the paſſions of a more advanced age ſhould never alter it.</p>
            <p>What an immenſe void did the abſence of M. de P—leave in my heart! At firſt it appeared that nothing could compenſate for his loſs; the tenderneſs of a father, the careſſes of my ſiſters, affected me but feebly. I thought that no other method remained for me to diſſipate the irkſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my ſituation, than to occupy my leiſure moments with ſome uſeful purſuit. I therefore cultivated the French language, already eſteemed throughout all Europe; I read with delight thoſe famous works, the eternal monuments of genius, which it had produced; and I wondered that, notwithſtanding ſuch an ungrateful idiom, ſo many celebrated poets, ſo many excellent philoſophers and hiſtorians, juſtly immortalized, had been able to diſtinguiſh themſelves by its means.</p>
            <p>I alſo applied myſelf ſeriouſly to the ſtudy of geometry; I formed my mind in a particular manner to the purſuit of that noble profeſſion which makes a hero at the expenſe of one hundred thouſand unfortunates, and which men leſs
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032388_0008_0FF1D62EDE094138"/>
humane than valiant have called the grand art of war! Several years were employed in theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, which are equally difficult and laborious; in ſhort, they ſolely occupied my thoughts. M. de P—, who often wrote to me, no longer received any but ſhort replies, and our correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence began to languiſh by neglect, when at length love finiſhed the triumph over friendſhip.</p>
            <p>My father had been for a long time intimately connected with count Pulauſki. Celebrated for the auſterity of his manners, famous on account of the inflexibility of his virtues, which were truly republican, Pulauſki, at once a great captain and a brave ſoldier, had on more than one occaſion ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſed his fiery courage, and his ardent patriotiſm.</p>
            <p>Inſtructed in ancient literature, he had been taught by hiſtory the great leſſons of a noble diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſtedneſs, an immovable conſtancy, an abſolute devotion to glory. Like thoſe heroes to whom idolatrous, but grateful Rome, elevated altars, Pulauſki would have ſacrificed all his property to the proſperity of his country; he would have ſpilled the laſt drop of his blood for its defence; he would even have immolated his only, his beloved daughter, Lodoiſka.</p>
            <p>Lodoiſka! how beautiful! how lovely! her dear name is always on my lips, her adored remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance will live for ever in my heart!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:032388_0009_0FF20D7A325A55C8"/>My friend, from the firſt moment that I ſaw this fair maid, I lived only for her; I abandoned my ſtudies; friendſhip was entirely forgotten. I conſecrated all my moments to Lodoiſka. My father and her's could not be long ignorant of my attachment; they did not chide me for it;—they muſt have approved it then. This idea appeared to me to be ſo well founded, that I delivered myſelf up, without ſuſpicion, to the ſweet paſſion that enchanted me; and I took my meaſures ſo well that I beheld Lodoiſka almoſt daily, either at home, or in company with my ſiſters, who loved her tenderly:—two ſweet years flew away in this manner.</p>
            <p>At length Pulauſki took me one day aſide, and addreſſed me thus: Your father and myſelf have formed great hopes of you, which your conduct has hitherto juſtified; I have long beheld you employing your youth in ſtudies equally uſeful and honourable. To day—(He here perceived that I was about to interrupt him). What would you ſay? do you think to tell me any thing that I am unacquainted with? do you think that I have occaſion to be the hourly witneſs of your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, to learn how much my Lodoiſka merits to be beloved! It is becauſe I know as well as you the value of my daughter, that you never ſhall obtain her but by meriting her. Young man, learn that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032388_0010_0FF20D7BEBAA4C88"/>
it is not ſufficient that our foibles ſhould be legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to be excuſable! thoſe of a good citizen ought to be turned entirely to the profit of his country; love, even love itſelf, like the baſeſt of the paſſions, is either deſpicable or dangerous, if it does not offer to generous hearts an additional motive to excite them towards honour.</p>
            <p>Hear me: Our monarch, for a long time in a ſickly habit of body, ſeems at length to approach towards his end. His life, become every day more precarious, has awakened the ambition of our neighbours.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Ruſſians.</note> They doubtleſs prepare to ſow diviſions among us; and they think, that by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awing our ſuffrages, they will be enabled to force upon us a king of their own chooſing. Foreign troops have already dared to appear on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of Poland; already two thouſand Poliſh gentlemen have aſſembled, on purpoſe to puniſh their audacious inſolence. Go and join yourſelf with thoſe brave youths; go, and at the end of the campaign, return covered with the blood of our enemies, and ſhew to Pulauſki a ſon-in-law worthy of him.<hi rend="sup">a</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I did not heſitate a ſingle moment; my father approved of my reſolutions, but being unable to conſent without pain to my precipitate departure,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032388_0011_0FF20D81616E6150"/>
he preſſed me for a long time againſt his boſom, while a tender ſolicitude was depicted in all his looks; his adieus ſeemed to be inauſpicious; the trouble that agitated his heart, ſeized upon my own; our tears were mingled on his venerable cheeks.</p>
            <p>Pulauſki, who was preſent at this moving ſcene, logically reproached us for what he termed a weakneſs. Dry up your tears, ſaid he to me, or preſerve them for Lodoiſka; it belongs only to childiſh lovers who ſeparate themſelves from each other for five or ſix months, to weep in this manner! He inſtructed his daughter, in my preſence, both of my departure, and of the motives which had determined me to it. (Lodoiſka grew pale, ſighed, looked at her father with a face ſuffuſed with bluſhes, and then aſſured me in a trembling voice, that her vows ſhould be offered up for my ſafe return, and that her happineſs depended upon the ſafety of Lovzinſki.)</p>
            <p>Encouraged in this manner, what dangers had I to fear? I departed accordingly, but in the courſe of that campaign, there happened nothing worthy of narration; the enemy, equally careful with ourſelves to avoid any action which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an open war between the two nations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves with fatiguing us by means of frequent marches: we, on the other hand, bounded
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032388_0012_0FF20D86C7AD3D90"/>
our views to following and obſerving them; and they only ſeemed to oppoſe themſelves to us, in thoſe parts where the open country afforded them an eaſy opportunity of making good their retreat.</p>
            <p>At the end of the campaign, they prepared to retire, on purpoſe to take up their winter quarters in their own country; and our little army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed almoſt wholly of gentlemen, ſeparated ſoon after.</p>
            <p>I returned to Warſaw, full of joy and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; I thought that Love and Hymen were about to beſtow Lodoiſka on me.—Alas! I no longer had a father. I learned, on entering the capital, that Lovzinſki died of an apoplexy on the night before my arrival. Thus I was deprived of even the ſad conſolation of receiving the laſt ſighs of the moſt tender of parents; I could only offer up my ſorrows at his tomb, which I bathed with my tears!</p>
            <p>—It is not, ſays Pulauſki to me, who was but little moved with my profound ſorrow; it is not by means of barren tears that you can do honour to a father ſuch as thine. Poland in him regrets a citizen-hero, who would have been of immenſe ſervice during the critical moment which now approaches. Worn out with a tedious malady, our monarch has not a fortnight to live, and on
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032388_0013_0FF20D8C1BBC4010"/>
the choice of his ſucceſſor depends the happineſs or miſery of our fellow-citizens.</p>
            <p>Of all the rights which the death of your father tranſmits to you, the moſt noble is undoubtedly that of aſſiſting at the diet, in which you are to repreſent him; it is there where he will revive in you; it is there, where you ought to exhibit a courage infinitely more difficult to be ſuſtained than that which conſiſts only in braving death in the field of battle!</p>
            <p>The valour of a ſoldier is nothing more than a common virtue; but they are not ordinary men who on awful emergencies, preſerving a tranquil courage, and diſplaying an active penetration, diſcover the projects of the powerful who cabal, diſconcert the enterpriſes of the intriguing, and confront the deſigns of the factious; who, always firm, incorruptible, and juſt, give not their ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges but to thoſe whom they think moſt worthy of them; whom neither gold nor promiſes can ſeduce, whom prayers cannot bend, whom menaces cannot terrify.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the virtues which diſtinguiſhed your father, this is the precious inheritance which you ought to be deſirous of ſuſtaining. The day on which the ſtates aſſemble for the election of a king, will be the epoch on which the pretenſions of many of our fellow-citizens, more occupied with their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032388_0014_0FF20D786A2B9010"/>
private intereſts than jealous of the proſperity of their country, will be manifeſted, as well as the pernicious deſigns of the neighbouring powers, whoſe cruel policy it is to deſtroy our ſtrength by dividing it.</p>
            <p>I am deceived, my friend, if the fatal moment is not faſt approaching, which will for ever fix the deſtiny of our country—its enemies have conſpired its ruin; they have ſecretly prepared for a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;—but they ſhall not conſummate their purpoſes while my arm can ſuſtain a ſword! May that God, who is the protector of the republic, prevent all the horrors of a civil war! But that extremity, however frightful it appears, may perhaps become neceſſary; I flatter myſelf that it will be but a ſhort, although perhaps a violent criſis, after which the regenerated ſtate will aſſume its ancient ſplendor.</p>
            <p>You ſhall ſecond my efforts, Lovzinſki; the feeble intereſts of love ought to diſappear before more ſacred claims. I cannot preſent my daughter to you during this awful moment of ſuſpence, when our common country is in danger; but I promiſe to you, that the firſt days of peace ſhall be marked by your union with Lodoiſka.</p>
            <p>Pulauſki did not ſpeak in vain. I felt that I had now more eſſential duties to fulfil than thoſe of love; but the cares with which my mind was
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032388_0015_0FF20D8DF2970108"/>
occupied, were hardly able to alleviate my grief. I will even avow to you without bluſhing, that the ſorrow of my ſiſters, their tender friendſhip, and the careſſes more reſerved but no leſs pleaſing of my miſtreſs, made a ſtronger impreſſion on my heart than the patriotic counſels of Pulauſki. I beheld Lodoiſka tenderly affected with my irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loſs, and as much afflicted as myſelf, at the cruel events which forced us to defer our union; my chagrin, by being thus divided with that lovely woman, ſeemed inſenſibly to diminiſh.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the king dies, and the diet is convoked. On the day that it was to open, at the very inſtant when I was about to repair to the aſſembly, a ſtranger preſented himſelf, and deſired to ſpeak to me in private. As ſoon as my attendants were retired, he enters my apartment with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, throws himſelf into my arms, and tenderly embraces me. It was M. de P—! Ten years, which had elapſed ſince our ſeparation, had not ſo much changed his features as to prevent me from recogniſing him, and teſtifying my joy and ſurpriſe at his unexpected return.</p>
            <p>You will be more aſtoniſhed, ſays he to me, when you know the cauſe. I have arrived this inſtant, and am about to repair to the meeting of the diet;—would it be preſuming too much on your friendſhip to reckon on your vote?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:032388_0016_0FF20D918959E7D8"/>On my vote! and for whom?</p>
            <p>For myſelf, continues he with vivacity; it is not now time to recount to you the happy revolution that has taken place in my fortune, and which at preſent permits me to entertain ſuch exalted hopes: it is ſufficient to obſerve, that my ambition is at leaſt juſtified by a majority of ſuffrages, and that it is in vain that two feeble rivals would attempt to diſpute with me the crown to which I pretend.</p>
            <p>Lovzinſki, adds he, embracing me again, if you were not my friend, and if I eſteemed you leſs, perhaps I ſhould endeavour to dazzle you by means of promiſes; perhaps I ſhould recount to you the favours which I intend to heap upon you; the honourable diſtinctions that are reſerved for you, and the noble and glorious career that is about to offer itſelf to your ambition;—but I have not any need of ſeducing, and I only wiſh to perſuade you.</p>
            <p>I behold it with grief, and you know it as well as myſelf, that for ſeveral years paſt our Poland, become enfeebled, owes its ſafety to nothing elſe than the diſtruſt of the three great powers<note n="*" place="bottom">Ruſſia, Pruſſia, and the houſe of Auſtria.</note> which ſurround it, and the deſire to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with our ſpoils may in one moment reunite our divided enemies!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:032388_0017_0FF20D952A1FEB98"/>Let us prevent, if we can, this inauſpicious triumvirate from diſmembering the republic. Undoubtedly, in more fortunate times, our anceſtors were able to maintain the freedom of their elections; it is neceſſary however that we ſhould yield to that neceſſity which is become inevitable.</p>
            <p>Ruſſia will neceſſarily protect a king, whom ſhe herſelf has elevated; in receiving the ſovereign of her choice, you will defeat the views of that triple alliance which will render our perdition certain, and we ſhall acquire a powerful ally, who will oppoſe herſelf with ſucceſs to the two enemies that remain to us.</p>
            <p>Theſe are reaſons which have determined my conduct; I do not abandon part of our rights, but to preſerve the moſt precious of them. I wiſh not to aſcend a fickle throne, but with the intention, by means of a ſage policy, to give it ſtability; I conſent not to alter the conſtitution of the commonwealth, but to preſerve the kingdom entire.</p>
            <p>We repaired to the diet together; I voted for M. de P—. He in effect obtained the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of the ſuffrages; but Pulauſki, Zaremba, and ſome others, declared themſelves in favour of prince C—. Nothing was decided amidſt the tumult of this firſt meeting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:032388_0018_0FF20D96DE2AB7A0"/>When the aſſembly broke up, M. de P— invited me to accompany him to the palace, which his ſecret emiſſaries had already prepared for him in the capital.<note n="*" place="bottom">The diet for the election of the kings of Poland was held half a league from Warſaw, in the open air, on the other ſide of the Viſtula, near to the village of Vola.</note> We ſhut ourſelves up together during ſeveral hours, and renewed the promiſes of a friendſhip that ſhould endure for ever. I then too informed M. de P— of my intimate connection with Pulauſki, and of my love for Lodoiſki. He repaid my confidence with more important communications; he informed me of the events which had led to his approaching grandeur; he explained to me his ſecret deſigns; and I left him, convinced that he was leſs occupied with the deſire of his own elevation, than with that of reſtoring Poland to its ancient proſperity.</p>
            <p>Poſſeſſed of theſe ideas, I flew towards my future father-in-law, burning with the deſire of adding him to the party of my friend. Pulauſki was walking at a great pace up and down the chamber of his daughter, who appeared equally agitated with himſelf.</p>
            <p>Behold, ſaid he to Lodoiſka, the moment that he ſaw me enter, behold that man whom I eſteem, and whom you love! He has ſacrificed us both to his blind friendſhip. I was deſirous to reply, but
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032388_0019_0FF20D989E729DE0"/>
he went on—You have been connected from your childhood with M. de P—. A powerful faction is about to place him on the throne; you know you are acquainted with his deſigns; this very morning at the diet, you voted for him—you have deceived me:—but do you think that you ſhall deceive me with impunity?</p>
            <p>I beſought him to hear me, and be conſtrained himſelf ſo far as to preſerve a ſtern ſilence: I then informed him, that M. de P—, whom I had for a long time neglected, had agreeably ſurpriſed me by his unexpected return.</p>
            <p>Lodoiſka appeared charmed to hear me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence my juſtification—You ſhall not deceive me in the ſame manner as if I were a credulous woman, ſays Pulauſki.—But it ſignifies not—proceed.</p>
            <p>I then recounted to him the particulars of the ſhort converſation that I had with M. de P— before I repaired to the aſſembly of the ſtates.</p>
            <p>And theſe are your projects! exclaimed he. M. de P— ſees no other remedy for the misfortunes of his fellow-citizens than their ſlavery! He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes this; one of the name of Lovzinſki, approves of it; and they deſpiſe me ſo much as to tempt me to enter into this infamous plot! Shall I behold the Ruſſians commanding in our provinces in the name of a Pole?</p>
            <p>The Ruſſians, ſay I with fury; the Ruſſians reign
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032388_0020_0FF20D9FAC24D3B8"/>
in my country! On this Pulauſki, advancing towards me with the greateſt impetuoſity, cries out: Perfidious youth! you have deceived me, and you would betray the ſtate! Leave my houſe this very moment, or know that I ſhall order you to be dragged out of it!</p>
            <p>I frankly ackowledge to you, Faublas, that an affront ſo cruel, and ſo little merited, diſarmed me of my prudence: in the firſt tranſports of my fury, I placed my hand upon my ſword; and quicker than lightning Pulauſki brandiſhed his in the air.</p>
            <p>His daughter, his diſtracted daughter, ruſhed forward, and precipitated herſelf upon me, crying out, Lovzinſki, what are you about to do? On hearing the accents of a voice ſo dear to me, I recalled my wandering reaſon; but I perceived that a ſingle inſtant was about forever to bereave me of my Lodoiſka! She had left me to throw herſelf into the arms of her father. He, cruel man, beheld my grief, and ſtrove to augment it: Go, traitor! ſays he—begone—you behold Lodoiſka for the laſt time!</p>
            <p>I returned home in a ſtate of deſperation. The odious names which Pulauſki had laviſhed on me, returned unceaſingly to my reflection. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Poland, and thoſe of M. de P—, appeared to be ſo intimately connected together,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032388_0021_0FF20DA32430A600"/>
that I did not perceive in what manner I could betray my fellow-citizens by ſerving my friend; in the mean time, I was obliged either to abandon him or renounce Lodoiſka forever. What was I to reſolve? what part ſhould I take? I paſſed the whole night in a ſtate of the moſt cruel uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; and when the day appeared, I went towards Pulauſki's houſe, without yet having come to any determination.</p>
            <p>The only domeſtic who remained there informed me, that his lord had departed at the beginning of the night, with his daughter, after having firſt diſmiſſed all his people. Think of my deſpair on hearing theſe news. I aſked to what part Pulauſki had retired, but my queſtion was in vain, for he informed me that he was entirely ignorant of the place of his deſtination.</p>
            <p>All that I can tell you, ſays he, is, that you had ſcarce gone away yeſterday evening, when we heard a great noiſe in the apartment of his daughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Still terrified at the ſcene which had taken place between you, I approached the door, and liſtened. Lodoiſka wept: her furious father overwhelmed her with injuries, beſtowed his malediction upon her, and I myſelf heard him exclaim: To love a traitor is to be one! Ungrateful wretch! I ſhall conduct you to a place of ſafety, where you ſhall henceforth be at a diſtance from ſeduction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:032388_0022_0FF20DA6A09C9260"/>Could I any longer doubt the extent of my miſery? I inſtantly called for Boleſlas, one of the moſt faithful of my domeſtics: I ordered him to place truſty ſpies about the palace of Pulauſki, who ſhould bring an account of every thing that paſſed there; and commanded that if the count returned to the capital before me, he ſhould follow him wherever he went. Having given theſe inſtructions, and not yet deſpairing of ſtill finding the family at one of their ſeats in the neighbourhood of the metropolis, I myſelf ſet out in purſuit of my miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>I accordingly ſearched through all the domains of Pulauſki, and aſked concerning Lodoiſka, of all the paſſengers whom I met, but without ſucceſs. After having ſpent eight days in fruitleſs enquiry, I reſolved to return to Warſaw, and I was not a little aſtoniſhed, on my arrival, to find a Ruffian army encamped on the banks of the Viſtula, almoſt under the very walls of that city.</p>
            <p>It was night when I entered the capital: the palaces of the grandees were all illuminated; an immenſe multitude filled the ſtreets; I heard ſongs of joy: I beheld wine flowing in rivulets in the public ſquares; every thing announced to me that Poland had a king.</p>
            <p>Boleſlas, who expected me with impatience, informed me that Pulauſki had returned alone on
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032388_0023_0FF20DAA38EFF938"/>
the ſecond day after my departure; and that he had not ſtirred from his own palace but to repair to the diet, where in ſpite of his efforts, the aſcendancy of Ruffia became every day more manifeſt. During the laſt aſſembly held this very morning, adds he, M. de P— united almoſt all the ſuffrages in his favour, and was about to be declared king, when Pulauſki pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the fatal <hi>vote:</hi> at that inſtant twenty ſabres were brandiſhed in the air. The fierce palatine of —, whom the count had inſulted in the former aſſembly, was the firſt to ruſh forwarde, and gave him a terrible wound on the head. Zaremba, and ſome others, flew to the defence of their friend; but all their efforts would have been unable to have ſaved him, if M. de P—, had not ranged himſelf on their ſide, exclaiming at the ſame time, that he would ſacrifice, with his own hand, the firſt perſon who dared to approach him. On this the aſſailants retired. In the mean time Pulauſki, fainting with the loſs of blood, was carried off the field in a ſtate of inſenſibility. Zaremba departed alſo, ſwearing to avenge his friend. Having thus become maſter of the deliberations, the numerous partiſans of M. de P— inſtantly proclaimed him ſovereign.</p>
            <p>Pulauſki, who had been carried to his palace,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032388_0024_0FF20DADB441F9B8"/>
was ſoon reſtored to life; and the ſurgeon who attended him, declared that his wounds, although dangerous, were not mortal. In that ſtate, although languiſhing under the moſt cruel torments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the advice of all his friends, he ordered himſelf to be lifted into a carriage, and before noon he left Warſaw, accompanied by Mazeppa and a few mal-contents.</p>
            <p>It was ſcarce poſſible to have announced worſe news to me. My friend was upon the throne, but my reconciliation with Pulauski appeared henceforth impoſſible, and in all appearance Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doiska was loſt for ever. I knew her father ſo well as to be under apprehenſions left he ſhould proceed to extremities with his daughter. I was affrighted at the preſent, I durſt not look forward towards the future; and my heart was ſo devoured with chagrin, that I did not go out, even to felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the new king.</p>
            <p>One of my people Boleſlas diſpatched after Pulauſki, returned at the end of the fourth day: he had followed him fifteen leagues from the capital; when about that diſtance, Zaremba, who perceived a ſtranger at a little diſtance from the carriage, began to conceive ſuſpicions. As they proceeded, four of his followers, who had concealed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves behind the ruins of an old houſe, ſurpriſed my courier, and conducted him to Pulauſki.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032388_0025_0FF20DB140119FB8"/>
He, with a piſtol in his hand, forced him to acknowledge to whom he belonged. I ſhall ſend you back to Lovzinſki, ſaid the fierce republican, on purpoſe to announce from me, that he ſhall not eſcape my juſt vengeance. At theſe words they blind-folded my ſervant, who could not tell where they had carried him. At the end of four and twenty hours they returned, and tying a handkerchief once more about his eyes, they put him into a carriage, which having ſtopped at length after a journey of ſeveral hours, he was ordered to deſcend. Scarce had he put his foot upon the ground but his guards departed at a full gallop; on which he removed the bandage, and found himſelf on the ſame ſpot as that on which he had been firſt arreſted.</p>
            <p>This intelligence filled me with uneaſineſs: the menaces of Pulauſki terrified me much leſs on my own account than on Lodoiſka's, who remained in his own power: in the midſt of his fury he might ſacrifice her life! I reſolved, therefore, to expoſe myſelf to every ſpecies of danger, on purpoſe to diſcover the retreat of the father, and the priſon of his only child.</p>
            <p>On the ſucceeding day, after informing my ſiſters of my deſign, I left the capital: Boleſlas alone accompanied me, and I paſſed for his brother. We wandered over all Poland, and I
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032388_0026_0FF20DB2EFA95AE0"/>
then perceived, that the fears of Pulauſki were but too well juſtified by the event. Under pretence of obliging the inhabitants to take the oath of fidelity to the new king, the Ruſſians, ſcattered about in the provinces, deſolated the country, and committed a multitude of exactions in the cities.</p>
            <p>After having ſpent three months in vain enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, deſpairing of being able to find Lodoiska, touched with the moſt lively grief for the fate of my country, and weeping at one and the ſame time for her misfortunes and my own, I was about to return to Warſaw, to inform the new king of the exceſſes committed by thoſe foreigners in his ſtates, when an adventure that at firſt ſeemed to be very inauſpicious, forced me to a very different reſolution.</p>
            <p>The Turks having declared war againſt Ruſſia, the Tartars of Budziac and the Crimea made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent incurſions into Volhynia, where I then was. Four of thoſe robbers attacked us one afternoon, as we were leaving a wood near Oſtropol. I had imprudently neglected to load my piſtols; but I made uſe of my ſabre with ſo much addreſs and good luck, that in a ſhort time two of them <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> covered with wounds. Boleſlas encountered the third; the fourth attacked me with great fury; he gave me a ſlight cut upon the leg, but received a terrible ſtroke in return that diſmounted him
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032388_0027_0FF20DB4C29EFD70"/>
from his horſe, and felled him to the ground. Boleſlas, at the ſame moment, perceived himſelf diſencumbered from his enemy, who, at the noiſe made by his comrade's fall, took to flight. He, whom I had juſt vanquiſhed, then addreſſed me in very bad Poliſh, and ſaid: "A brave man like you, ought to be generous. I beg my life of you; inſtead of putting me to death, ſuccour me, relieve me, bind up my wounds, and aſſiſt me to ariſe."</p>
            <p>He demanded quarter with an air ſo noble, that I did not heſitate for a moment. I accordingly deſcended from my horſe, and Boleſlas and myſelf having helped him to ariſe, we dreſſed his wounds. "You behave well," ſays the Tartar to me: "you behave well!" As he ſpoke, we beheld a cloud of duſt, and in a moment after, more than three hundred Tartars ruſhed upon us at full ſpeed. "Be not afraid, dread nothing," ſays he, whom I had ſpared; "I am chief of this troop." Accordingly, by means of a ſign, he ſtops his followers, who were on the point of maſſacreing us; and ſpeaking to them in their own language, which I was unable to comprehend; they inſtantly opened their ranks on purpoſe to permit us to paſs.</p>
            <p>Brave man, exclaims their captain, addreſſing himſelf to me once more, had I not reaſon to ſay, that you behaved well? You left me my life, and I now ſave your's: it is ſometimes right to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032388_0028_0FF20DBC0233FAE8"/>
ſpare an enemy, and even a robber! Hear me, my friend: in attacking you, I followed my profeſſion, and you did your duty in conquering me; let us therefore embrace.—He then adds: the day is waſting, and I would not adviſe you to travel in theſe cantons during the preſent night. My people are about to repair each to his reſpective poſt, and I cannot anſwer for their diſcretion. You per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a caſtle on a riſing ground, towards the right: it belongs to a certain Pole of the name of Dourlinski, for whom we have a right eſteem, becauſe he is very rich: Go, demand an aſylum from him; tell him that you have wounded Titſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kan, and that Titſikan purſues you. He is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my name: I have already made him paſs many an uneaſy night. As to the reſt, you may rely on it, that while you remain with him, his caſtle ſhall be ſacred; but be careful not to come forth on any account before the end of three days, and not to remain there longer than eight.—Adieu!</p>
            <p>It was with unfeigned pleaſure that we took leave of Titſikan and his companions. The advice of the Tartar was a command; I therefore ſaid to Boleſlas, let us immediately make for the caſtle that he has now pointed out to us; I am well acquainted with this ſame Dourlinski by name. Pulauski has ſometimes ſpoken to me concerning
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032388_0029_0FF20DBF75A016A0"/>
him; he perhaps is not ignorant of the place to which the count has retired, and it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that with a little addreſs we may be able to draw the ſecret from him. I ſhall ſay at all events that we are ſent by Pulauski, and this recommendation will be of more ſervice to us than that of Titſikan: in the mean time, Boleſlas, do not forget that I am your brother, and be ſure not to diſcover me.</p>
            <p>We ſoon arrived at the ditch of the caſtle; the ſervants of Dourlinski demanded who we were: I anſwered that we were come from Pulauski, and wiſhed to ſpeak to their lord, and that we had been attacked by robbers, who were ſtill in purſuit of us. The drawbridge was accordingly let down; and having entered, we were informed that at preſent we could not ſee Dourlinski, but that on the next day at ten o'clock he ſhould give us audience. They then demanded our arms, which we delivered up without any difficulty, and Boleſlas ſoon after took an opportunity of looking at my wound, which was found to be but ſuperficial.</p>
            <p>In a ſhort time a frugal repaſt was ſerved up for us, in the kitchen. We were afterwards conducted to a lower chamber, where two bad beds were prepared for us. The domeſtics then left us without any light, and immediately locked the door of the apartment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:032388_0030_0FF20DC12AA38ED0"/>I could not cloſe my eyes during the whole night. Titſikan had given me but a ſlight wound, but that which my heart had received was ſo very deep! At day break, I became impatient in my priſon, and wiſhed to open the ſhutters, but they were nailed up. I attacked them, however, ſo vigorouſly, that the faſtening gave way; and I beheld a very fine park. The window being low, I cleared it at a leap, and in a ſingle inſtant found myſelf in the gardens of the Poliſh chieftain.</p>
            <p>After having walked about for a few minutes, I ſat down on a ſtone bench, which was placed at the foot of a tower, whoſe ancient architecture I had been ſome time conſidering. I remained for a few ſeconds enveloped in reflection, when a tile fell at my feet. I thought it had dropped from the roof of this old building; and, to avoid the effects of a ſimilar accident, I went and placed myſelf at the other end of the ſeat. A few moments after, a ſecond tile fell by my ſide. The circumſtance appeared ſurpriſing: I aroſe with ſome degree of inquietude, and attentively exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the tower. I perceived at about twenty-five or thirty feet from the ground, a narrow opening. On this I picked up the tiles which had been thrown at me, and on the firſt I diſcovered the following words, written with a bit of plaiſter.</p>
            <p>Lovzinſki, is it you! Do you ſtill live!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:032388_0031_0FF20DC6819D2988"/>And on the ſecond theſe:</p>
            <p>Deliver me! ſave Lodoiſka.</p>
            <p>It is not poſſible for you, my dear Faublas, to conceive how many different ſentiments occupied my mind at one and the ſame time: my aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, my joy, my grief, my embarraſſment, cannot be expreſſed. I examined once more the priſon of Lodoiska, and plotted in my own mind how I could procure her liberty. She at length threw down another tile, and I read as follows:</p>
            <p>"At midnight, bring me paper, ink, and pens; and to-morrow, an hour after ſun-riſe, come and receive a letter.—Begone."—</p>
            <p>Having returned towards my chamber, I called Boleſlas, who aſſiſted me in re-entering through the window. I then informed my faithful ſervant, of the unexpected accident that had put an end to my wanderings, and redoubled my inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etude.</p>
            <p>How could I penetrate into this tower? How could we procure arms? By what means were we to deliver Lodoiska from captivity? How could we carry her off under the eye of Dourlinski, in the midſt of his people, and from a fortified caſtle! and ſuppoſing that ſo many obſtacles were not unſurmountable, could I attempt ſuch a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult enterprize during the ſhort delay preſcribed by Titſikan?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:032388_0032_0FF20DCA03A63FF8"/>Did not the Tartar enjoin me to ſtay with Dourlinski three days, but not to remain longer than eight?</p>
            <p>Would it not be to expoſe ourſelves to the attacks of the enemy, to leave this caſtle before the third, or after the expiration of the eighth day? Should I releaſe my dear Lodoiska from a priſon, on purpoſe to deliver her into the hands of robbers, to be forever ſeparated from her by ſlavery or by death? This would be a horrible idea!</p>
            <p>But wherefore was ſhe confined in ſuch a frightful priſon? The letter which ſhe had promiſed would doubtleſs inſtruct me: it was therefore neceſſary to procure paper, pen and ink. I accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly charged Boleſlas with this employment, and began to prepare myſelf for acting the delicate part of an emiſſary of Pulauski in the preſence of Dourlinski.</p>
            <p>It was broad daylight when they came to ſet us at liberty, and inform us, that Dourlinski was at leiſure, and wiſhed to ſee us.—We accordingly preſented ourſelves before him with great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and we were introduced to a man of about ſixty years of age, whoſe reception was blunt, and whoſe manners were repu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e. He demanded who we were. My brother and myſelf, replied I, belong to count Pulauski. My maſter has entruſted me with a ſecret commiſſion
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032388_0033_0FF20DCDA5A44AA0"/>
to you. My brother accompanies me on another account. Before I explain, I muſt be in private, for I am charged not to ſpeak but to you alone.</p>
            <p>It is very well, replies Dourlinski: your brother may retire, and you alſo, addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his ſervants, begone! As to him here (pointing to a perſon who was his confident) he muſt remain, and you may ſpeak any thing before him.</p>
            <p>Palauski has ſent me—I ſee very well that he has ſent you, ſays the palatine, interrupting me—to demand of you—What?—news of his daughter.—News of his daughter! Did Pulauski ſay ſo?—Yes, my lord ſaid that his daughter was here.—I perceived that Dourlinski inſtantly grew pale; he then looked towards his confident, and ſurveyed me for ſome time in ſilence.</p>
            <p>You aſtoniſh me, rejoins he at length.—In confiding a ſecret of this importance to you, it neceſſarily follows that your maſter muſt have been very imprudent.</p>
            <p>No more than you, my lord, for have not you alſo a confident? Grandees would be much to be pitied if they could not rely upon any of their domeſt<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>. Pulauski has charged me to inform you, that Lovzinski has already ſearched through a great part of Poland, and that he will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly viſit theſe cantons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:032388_0034_0FF20DCF5A2A1EC0"/>If he dares to come here, replies he with great vivacity, I will provide a lodging for him, which he ſhall inhabit for ſome time.—Do you know this Lovzinski?</p>
            <p>I have often ſeen him at my maſter's houſe in Warſaw.—They ſay he is handſome.</p>
            <p>He is well made, and about my height.</p>
            <p>His perſon?—is prepoſſeſſing; it is—</p>
            <p>He is a wretch, adds he, interrupting me in a great paſſion—O that he were but to fall into my hands!</p>
            <p>My lord, they ſay that he is brave—</p>
            <p>He! I will wager any ſum of money that he is only calculated to ſeduce women!—O that he would but fall into my hands! Then aſſuming a leſs ferocious tone, he continued thus: It is a long time ſince Pulauski wrote to me—where is he at preſent?</p>
            <p>My lord, I have preciſe orders not to anſwer that queſtion: all that I dare to ſay is, that he has the ſtrongeſt reaſons for neither diſcovering the place of his retreat, nor writing to any perſon, and that he will ſoon come and explain them to you in perſon.</p>
            <p>Dourlinski appeared exceedingly aſtoniſhed at this information: I even thought that I could diſcover ſome ſymptoms of fear in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. At length, looking at his confident, who
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032388_0035_0FF20DD49B073080"/>
ſeemed equally embarraſſed with himſelf, he proceeded. You ſay that Pulauski will come here ſoon? Yes, my lord, in about a fortnight, or a little later. On this he again turned to his attendant; but in a ſhort time affecting as much calmneſs as he had before diſcovered embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:—Return to your maſter, added he; I am ſorry to have nothing but bad news to communicate to him—tell him that Lodoiska is no longer here. I myſelf became ſurpriſed in my turn at this infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. What! my lord, Lodoiska—</p>
            <p>Is not longer here, I tell you!—to oblige Pulauski, whom I eſteem, I undertook, although with great repugnance, the task of confining his daughter in my caſtle: nobody but myſelf and he (pointing to his confident) knew that ſhe was here. It is about a month ſince we went, as uſual, to carry her proviſions for the day, but there was nobody to be found in the apartment. I am ignorant how it happened; but what I know well is, that ſhe has eſcaped, for I have heard nothing of her ſince.—She muſt undoubtedly have gone to join Lovzinski at Warſaw, if perchance the Tartars have not intercepted her in her journey.</p>
            <p>My aſtoniſhment on this became extreme. How could I reconcile that which I had ſeen in the garden, with that which Dourlinski now told me? There was ſome myſtery in this buſineſs,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032388_0036_0FF20DD832409BD8"/>
which I became exceedingly impatient to be acquainted with: I was however extremely careful not to exhibit any appearance of doubt. My lord, ſaid I, this is bad news for my maſter!—Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, but it is not my fault.</p>
            <p>My lord, I have a favour to ask of you.</p>
            <p>Let me hear it.—The Tartars are ravaging the neighbourhood of your caſtle—they attacked us—we eſcaped, as it were, by a miracle. Will you permit my brother and myſelf to remain here only for the ſpace of two days?</p>
            <p>For two days only I give my conſent.</p>
            <p>Where do they lodge? ſays he to his attendant. In an apartment below ground, was the reply.</p>
            <p>Which overlooks my gardens? rejoins Dour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linski, interrupting him with great agitation.</p>
            <p>The ſhutters are well faſtened, adds the other.</p>
            <p>No matter—You muſt put them elſewhere. Theſe words made me tremble.</p>
            <p>It is not poſſible, but—continues the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and then whiſpered the reſt of the ſentence in his ear.</p>
            <p>Right, ſays the baron; and let it be done inſtantly. Then, addreſſing himſelf to me, he ſays, your brother and you muſt depart the day after to-morrow; before you go you ſhall ſee me again, and I will give you a letter for Pulauski.</p>
            <p>I then went to rejoin Boleſlas in the kitchen,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:032388_0037_0FF20DDBB38EF598"/>
where he was at breakfaſt, who ſoon after pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me with a little bottle full of ink, ſeveral pens, and ſome ſheets of paper, which he had procured without difficulty. I panted with deſire to write to Lodoiska; and the only difficulty that now remained, was to find a commodious place, where I might not be diſcovered by the curioſity of Dourlinski's people.</p>
            <p>They had already informed Boleſlas that we could not again be admitted into the apartment where we had ſpent the preceding night, until the time ſhould arrive when we were to retire to reſt. I ſoon, however, bethought myſelf of a ſtratagem which ſucceeded to admiration.</p>
            <p>The ſervants were drinking with my pretended brother, and politely invited me to help them to empty a few flasks.</p>
            <p>I ſwallowed, with a good grace, ſeveral glaſſes of bad wine in ſucceſſion: in a few minutes my legs ſeemed to totter under me; my tongue faultered: I related a hundred pleaſant and improbable tales to the joyous company; in a word, I acted the <hi>drunken man</hi> ſo well, that Boleſlas himſelf became a dupe to my ſcheme, and actually trembled leſt, in a moment when I ſeemed diſpoſed to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate every thing, my ſecret ſhould eſcape.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, ſaid he, to the aſtoniſhed bacchanals, my brother's head is not very ſtrong to-day; it is
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:032388_0038_0FF20DDD75522198"/>
perhaps in conſequence of his wound; let us not therefore, either ſpeak to or drink any more with him; for I am afraid of his health, and indeed you would oblige me exceedingly if you would aſſiſt me to carry him to his bed.—To his own bed? ſays one of them, that is impoſſible! But I will moſt willingly lend him my chamber. They accordingly laid hold of me, and conveyed me into a garret, of which a bed, a table, and a chair formed the ſole movables. Having ſhut me up in this paltry apartment, they inſtantly left me. This was all that I wanted, for the moment that I was alone, I immediately ſat down to write a long letter to Lodoiska.</p>
            <p>I began, by fully juſtifying myſelf from the crimes of which I had been accuſed by Pulauski: I then recounted every thing that had occured ſince the firſt moment of our ſeparation, until that when I had entered the caſtle of Dourlinski: I detailed the particulars of my converſation with the baron: I concluded, by aſſuring her of the moſt tender and the moſt reſpectful paſſion, and ſwore to her, that the moment ſhe gave me the neceſſary information concerning her ſituation, I would expoſe myſelf to every danger in order to finiſh her horrid captivity.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as my letter was ſealed, I delivered myſelf up to a variety of reflections, which threw
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:032388_0039_0FF20DE2CADBFBC8"/>
me into a ſtrange perplexity. Was it actually Lodoiska who had thrown thoſe tiles into the garden? Would Pulauski have had the injuſtice to puniſh his daughter for an attachment which he himſelf had approved? Would he have had the inhumanity to plunge her into a frightful priſon? And even if the hatred he had ſworn to me, had blinded him ſo much, how was it poſſible, that Dourlinski would thus have condeſcended to have become the miniſter of his vengeance?</p>
            <p>But, on the other hand, for theſe three laſt long months, on purpoſe to diſguiſe myſelf, I had only worn tattered clothes: the fatigues of a tedious journey, and my chagrin, had altered me greatly; and who but a miſtreſs could have been able to diſcover Lovzinski in the gardens of Dourlinski? Beſides, had I not ſeen the name of Lodoiska traced upon the tile? Had not Dourlinski himſelf acknowledged that Lodoiska had been a priſoner with him? Is it true, he had added that ſhe had made her eſcape; but was not this incredible? And wherefore that hatred which Dourlinski had avowed againſt me, without knowing my perſon? What occaſioned that look of inquietude, when it was told him, that the emiſſaries of Pulauski occupied a chamber that looked into his garden? And why, above all, that appearance of terror, when I announced to him the approaching arrival of my pretended maſter?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:032388_0040_0FF20DE4AD6640E0"/>All theſe circumſtances were well calculated to throw me into the greateſt agitation. I ruminated over this frightful and myſterious adventure, which it was impoſſible for me to explain. For two hours, I unceaſingly put new queſtions to myſelf, to which I was exceedingly embarraſſed to make any reply; when at length Boleſlas came to ſee if I had recovered from my debauch. I had but little difficulty in convincing him that my inebriety was mere affectation; after which we went down together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the kitchen, where we ſpent the reſt of the day. What a night!—My dear Faublas, no one in my whole life ever appeared ſo long, not even that which followed.</p>
            <p>At length the attendants conducted us to our chamber, where they ſhut us up, as on the former occaſion, without any light: it was yet two tedious hours until midnight. At the firſt ſtroke of the clock, we gently opened the ſhutters and the caſement. I then prepared to jump into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; but my embarraſſment was equal to my deſpair, when I found myſelf obſtructed by means of iron bars. "Behold," ſaid I to Boleſlas, "what the curſed confident of Dourlinski whiſpered in his ear! behold what his odious maſter approved, when he ſaid, <hi>let it be done inſtantly!</hi> behold what they have been working at during the day! it was
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032388_0041_0FF20DEA148B4ED0"/>
on this account that they prevented us from entering the chamber."</p>
            <p>"My lord, they have ſtood on the outſide," replied Boleſlas; "for they have not perceived that the ſhutter has been forced."</p>
            <p>"Alas! whether they have perceived <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> or not," exclaimed I, with violence, "what does it ſignify? This fatal grating deſtroys all my hopes; it inſures the ſlavery of Lodoiska—it inſures my death."</p>
            <p>"Yes, without doubt, it inſures thy death!" repeats a perſon at the ſame time opening the door; and immediately after, Dourlinski, preceded by ſeveral armed men, and followed by others carrying flambeaux, enters our priſon <hi>ſabre in hand.</hi> "Traitor!" exclaims he, while addreſſing himſelf to me with a look in which fury was viſibly depicted, "I have heard all—I know who you are, —your ſervant has diſcovered your name. Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! Of all the enemies of Lovzinski, I am the moſt implacable!"</p>
            <p>"Search them," continued he, turning to his attendants: they accordingly ruſhed in upon me; and as I was without arms, I made an uſeleſs reſiſtance. They accordingly robbed me of my papers, and of the letter which I had juſt written to Lodoiska. Dourlinski exhibited a thouſand ſigns of impatience while reading it, and was ſcarce able to contain himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:032388_0042_0FF20DEBCC7A61B8"/>"Lovzinski," ſays he to me, endeavouring to ſmother his rage, "I already deſerve all your hatred; I ſhall ſoon merit it ſtill more: in the mean time, you muſt remain with your worthy confident in this chamber, to which you are ſo partial."</p>
            <p>After uttering theſe words, he left me; and having double locked the door, he placed a centinel on the outſide, and another in the garden, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the window.</p>
            <p>Figure to yourſelf the horrible ſituation into which Boleſlas and myſelf were now plunged. My misfortunes were at their height; but thoſe of Lodoiska affected me infinitely more than my own! How great muſt be her uneaſineſs! She expects Lovzinski, and Lovzinski abandons her! But no—Lodoiska knows me too well; ſhe can never ſuſpect me of ſuch baſe perfidy. Lodoiska! ſhe will judge of her lover by herſelf; ſhe will think that Lovzinski partakes her lot, ſince he does not ſuccour her—Alas! the very certainty of my misfortunes will augment her own.</p>
            <p>On the next day, they gave us proviſions through the grating of our window; and by the quality of the viands which they furniſhed us with, Boleſlas augured the moſt ſiniſter events. Being however leſs unhappy than myſelf, he ſupported
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032388_0043_0FF20DF1220916C8"/>
his fate much more courageouſly. He offered me my ſhare of the mean repaſt which he was about to make; I could not eat: he preſſed me; but it was in vain! for exiſtence was become an unſupportable burden to me.</p>
            <p>"Ah! live! ſaid he at length, ſhedding a torrent of tears: "live; and if not for Boleſlas, let it be for Lodoiska!" Theſe words made the moſt lively impreſſion upon my mind; they even re-animated my courage: and hope having once more re-entered my heart, I embraced my faithful ſervant. "O my friend!" exclaimed I at the ſame time with tranſport, "my true friend! I have been the occaſion of thy ruin, and yet my misfortunes affect thee more than thine own! Yes, Boleſlas! yes! I will live for Lodoiska; I will live for thee: if juſt heaven ſhall reſtore me to my fortune and rank, you ſhall ſee that your maſter is not ungrateful!" We now embraced once more.</p>
            <p>Ah! my dear Faublas, how much do misfortunes connect men together! how ſweet it is, when one ſuffers, to hear another unfortunate addreſs a word of conſolation to him!</p>
            <p>We had groaned in this priſon for no leſs than twelve days, when ſeveral ruffians came to drag me forth on purpoſe to conduct me to Dourlinski. Boleſlas wiſhed to follow, but they repulſed him
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:032388_0044_0FF20DF2E38379F8"/>
with violence: however they permitted me to ſpeak to him for a ſingle moment. I then drew from a private pocket a ring which I had worn for ten years, and ſaid to Boleſlas:—"This ring was given me by M. de P. when we were at college together at Warſaw: take it, my friend, and preſerve it for my ſake. If Dourlinski this day conſummates his treaſon by my aſſaſſination, and if he ſhould at length permit you to leave this caſtle, go, find your king, recal to his memory our ancient attachment, recount my misfortunes to him; he will recompence you, and ſuccour Lodoiska. Adieu, my friend!"</p>
            <p>After this, I was conducted to the apartment of Dourlinski. As ſoon as the door opened, I perceived a lady in a chair, who had juſt fainted away. I approached her—it was Lodoiska! Heavens! how much did I find her altered!— but ſhe was ſtill handſome! "Barbarian!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed I, addreſſing myſelf to Dourlinski; and at the voice of her lover, Lodoiska recovered her ſenſes.</p>
            <p>"Ah, my dear Lovzinski," ſays ſhe, looking wiſtfully at me, "do you know what this infamous wretch has propoſed? do you know at what price he has offered me your liberty?"</p>
            <p>"Yes," cries the furious chieftain, "yes, I am determined upon it: you ſee that he is in my
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:032388_0045_0FF20DF82B22B1B0"/>
power; and if in three days I do not obtain my wiſhes, he ſhall be no more!" I endeavoured to throw myſelf on my knees at the feet of Lodoiska; but my guards prevented me: "I behold you again, and all my ills are forgotten, Lodoiska— death has now no longer any thing terrifying in its aſpect!"</p>
            <p>"Wretch," added I, looking ſternly at Dour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linski, "know that Pulauski will avenge his daughter! know that the king will avenge his friend!"</p>
            <p>"Let him be carried away," was the only reply made by the ferocious palatine.</p>
            <p>"Ah!" exclaims Lodoiska, "my love has been your ruin!" I was about to anſwer, but the attendants dragged me out, and re-conducted me to priſon.</p>
            <p>Boleſlas received me with inexpreſſible tranſports of joy; he avowed to me that he thought me loſt forever, and I recounted to him how my death was but deferred. The ſcene of which I had juſt been a witneſs, confirmed all my ſuſpicions; it was evident that Pulauski was ignorant of the unworthy treatment which his daughter expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced; it was alſo evident that Dourlinski, old, amorous, and jealous, was determined, at any rate, to ſatisfy his paſſions.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, two of the days allowed
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:032388_0046_0FF20DF9E1F93848"/>
by Dourlinſki for the determination of Lodoiska, had already expired; we were now in the midſt of the night which preceded the fatal third one; I could not ſleep, and I was walking haſtily about my priſon. All at once I heard the cry of To arms! to arms!" The moſt frightful howlings prevailed on the outſide, and a great commotion took place within the caſtle. Boleſlas and I were able to diſtinguiſh the voice of Dourlinski, calling and encouraging his followers; and we ſoon diſtinctly heard the claſhing of the ſwords; the cries of the wounded, and the groans of the dying. The noiſe which at firſt was very great, ſeemed at length to die away. It recommenced ſoon after; it redoubled; and at length we heard the ſhout of "Victory!"</p>
            <p>To this frightful tumult, a ſtill more frightful ſilence enſues. In a ſhort time a low crackling ſound is heard to approach us; the air ſeems to hiſs with violence; the night becomes leſs dark; the trees in the garden aſſume a red and warm tint; we fly to the window; the flames are devouring the caſtle of Dourlinski! They approach the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in which we were confined, from all ſides; and to overwhelm me with new horror, the moſt piercing ſhrieks are uttered from the tower in which I knew that Lodoiska was impriſoned!</p>
            <p>The fire becoming every moment more violent,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:032388_0047_0FF20DFF428AE100"/>
was about to communicate to the chamber in which we were ſhut up, and the flames already began to curl around the baſe of the tower in which Lodoiska was immured!</p>
            <p>Lodoiska uttered the moſt dreadful groans, to which I anſwered by cries of fury. Boleſlas ruſhed from one part of the priſon to another like a madman; he ſent forth the moſt terrible howlings; he attempted to burſt open the door with his hands and feet. As for myſelf, I remained at the window, and ſhook, amidſt my tranſports of fury, thoſe maſſive iron bars which I was unable to bend.</p>
            <p>All of a ſudden, the domeſtics, who had lately mounted the battlements, deſcend with precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and open the gates: we heard the voice of Dourlinski himſelf begging for quarter. The victors inſtantly precipitate themſelves amidſt the flames; and being at length attracted by our cries, they force open the door of our priſon with their hatchets.</p>
            <p>By their dreſs and their arms, I knew them to be Tartars: their chief arrives—it is Titſikan!</p>
            <p>Ah! ah! exclaims he; it is my brave friend!</p>
            <p>I inſtantly threw myſelf on his neck:—Titſikan! Lodoiska!—a lady!—the faireſt of women! —in that tower!—about to be burnt alive!</p>
            <p>Theſe were the incoherent expreſſions by which I made my feelings known.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:032388_0048_0FF20D4DF882ACC0"/>The Tartar inſtantly gives the word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to his ſoldiers: they fly to the tower: I fly along with them: Boleſlas follows us. They burſt open the doors; and near to an old pillar we diſcover a narrow, winding ſtaircaſe, filled with ſmoke.</p>
            <p>The Tartars, affrighted at the danger, ſtart back: I prepare to aſcend.</p>
            <p>Alas! what are you about? exclaims Boleſlas.</p>
            <p>To live or die with Lodoiska!</p>
            <p>And I will either live or die with my maſter! was the reply of my generous ſervant.</p>
            <p>I ruſh on—he follows me! At the risk of ſuffocation we aſcend about forty ſteps: by the light of the flames we diſcover Lodoiska in a corner of her priſon; who feebly utters: Who is it that approaches me?</p>
            <p>It is Lovzinski! it is your lover!</p>
            <p>Joy inſtantly lends her new ſtrength; ſhe riſes and flies into my arms: we carry her away; we deſcend a few ſteps; but volumes of ſmoke now fill the ſtaircaſe, and we are forced to re-aſcend with precipitation. At that very inſtant too, a part of the tower gives way!—Boleſlas utters a dreadful ſhriek, and Lodoiska falls into a ſwoon.</p>
            <p>Faublas, that which was on the point of deſtroying, ſaved us! The flames, formerly ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, began to extend with greater rapidity;
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:032388_0049_0FF20E02CB109888"/>
but the ſmoke was diſſipated.—Laden with our precious burden, Boleſlas and I deſcend in haſte. —My friend, I do not exaggerate; every ſtep trembled under our feet! the walls were all on fire! At length we arrived at the gate of the tower; Titſikan, trembling for our ſafety, was expecting us there: Brave men! exclaimed he, on ſeeing us appear again.—I place Lodoiska at his feet, and fall down lifeleſs by her ſide!</p>
            <p>I remained nearly an hour in this ſituation. They tremble for my life; and Boleſlas weeps aloud. I again recover my ſenſes, on hearing the voice of Lodoiska, who, returning to herſelf, calls me her deliverer. The appearance of every thing was altered; the tower was entirely in ruins. The Tartars, however, had ſtopped the progreſs of the flames; they had deſtroyed one part of the caſtle, on purpoſe to ſave the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder; in fine, we had been carried into a large ſaloon, where we were ſurrounded by Titſikan and ſome of his ſoldiers. Others of them were occupied in pillaging and in bringing away the gold, ſilver, jewels, plate, and all the precious effects which the flames had ſpared.</p>
            <p>Near to us, Dourlinski, loaded with fetters, and uttering repeated groans, beheld this heap of riches, of which he was about to be deſpoiled. Rage, terror, deſpair, all the paſſions which can
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:032388_0050_0FF20E064EA5D8F0"/>
tear the heart of a villain ſuffering under puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were viſibly depicted in his wild and wandering looks. He ſtruck the earth with fury, daſhed his clenched hands againſt his forehead, and, uttering the moſt horrible blaſphemies, he reproached heaven for its juſt vengeance.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, my lovely miſtreſs holds my hand claſped in her's. Alas, ſays ſhe, at length, with tears in her eyes, alas! you have ſaved my life, and your own is ſtill in danger! Nay, even if we eſcape death, ſlavery awaits us!</p>
            <p>No, no, Lodoiski, be comforted, Titſikan is not my enemy; Titſikan will put a period to our misfortunes—</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly, if I am able, exclaims the Tartar, interrupting me: you are in the right, brave man! (adds he) I ſee that you are not dead, and I am happy: you always ſay and do good things; and you have there (turning to Boleſlas), you have there a friend who ſeconds you admirably.</p>
            <p>On this I embrace Boleſlas:—yes, Titſikan, yes, I have a friend, who ſhall always be dear to me!—</p>
            <p>The Tartar again interrupts me: What! were not you both confined in an apartment below ground, and was not this lady in a tower? What was the reaſon of this? I will lay any wager, continues he with a ſmile, that you have taken
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032388_0051_0FF20E081CCEA240"/>
this female from that old lecher (pointing to Dourlinski) and you are in the right; for he is a dotard, and ſhe is beautiful! Come—inform me of every thing.</p>
            <p>I now diſcover my name to Titſikan, that of Lodoiska's father, and every particular that occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to me until that moment. It belongs to Lodoiska, I obſerve in concluſion, to make us acquainted with what ſhe has been obliged to ſuffer from the infamous Dourlinski, ever ſince ſhe has been in his caſtle!</p>
            <p>You know, replies Lodoiska, that my father obliged me to leave Warſaw, on the day that the diet was opened. He firſt conducted me to the territories of the palatine of —, at only twenty leagues diſtance from the capital, to which he returned, on purpoſe to aſſiſt at the meeting of the ſtates.</p>
            <p>On that very day, when M. de P— was proclaimed king, Pulauski took me from the caſtle of the palatine, and conducted me here, thinking that I ſhould be better concealed. He charged Dourlinski to guard me with extraordinary ſtrictneſs; and, above all things, to take eſpecial care to prevent Lovzinski from diſcovering the place of my retreat. He then left me, as he informed me, on purpoſe to aſſemble and to encourage the good citizens to defend his country,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:032388_0052_0FF20E0D85A32938"/>
and to puniſh traitors. Alas! theſe important avocations have made him forget his daughter, for I have never ſeen him ſince.</p>
            <p>A few days after his departure, I began to perceive, that the viſits of Dourlinski had been more frequent than uſual; in a ſhort time, he hardly ever quitted the apartment which had been aſſigned me for a priſon. He deprived me, under ſome trifling pretexts, of the only female attendant, whom my father had left me; and to prevent any perſon (as he ſaid) from knowing that I was in his caſtle, he himſelf brought me the food neceſſary for my ſubſiſtence, and paſſed whole days along with me.</p>
            <p>You cannot conceive, my dear Lovzinski, how much I ſuffered from die continual preſence of a man who was odious to me, and whoſe infamous deſigns I was ſuſpicious of; he even dared to explain himſelf to me one day; but I aſſured him, that my hate ſhould always be the price of his tenderneſs, and that his unworthy conduct had drawn upon him my ſovereign contempt.</p>
            <p>He anſwered me coldly, that in time I would accuſtom myſelf to ſee him, and to ſuffer his aſſiduities; nay, he did not in the leaſt alter his uſual conduct, for he entered my chamber in the morning, and never retired until night. Separated from all I loved, I had not even the feeble conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:032388_0053_0FF20E0F4543BB88"/>
of being able to enjoy the ſweet recollection of paſt happineſs. A witneſs to my misfortunes, Dourlinski took pleaſure in augmenting them.</p>
            <p>Pulauski, ſays he to me, commands a body of Poliſh troops; Lovzinski betraying his country, which he does not love, and a woman concerning whom he is indifferent, ſerves in the Ruſſian army, where he will be cut off during ſome bloody engagement: beſides, if he ſurvives, it is evident that nothing can ever reconcile your father to him.</p>
            <p>A few days after, he came on purpoſe to announce to me, that Pulauski, during the night, had attacked the Ruſſians in their camp; and that, amidſt the confuſion that enſued, my lover had fallen by the hand of my father. The cruel pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine even made me read a narrative of this event, drawn up with every appearance of truth, in a kind of public gazette, which doubtleſs he had procured to be printed expreſsly for the purpoſe: beſides, on perceiving the barbarous joy which he affected on this occaſion, I thought the news but too true.</p>
            <p>Pitileſs tyrant, cried I, you enjoy my tears and my deſpair; but ceaſe to perſecute me, or you will ſoon ſee that the daughter of Pulauski is herſelf able to avenge her own injuries.</p>
            <p>One evening that he had left me ſooner than uſual after I retired to bed, I heard my door
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:032388_0054_0FF20E148B59C300"/>
open very ſoftly. By the light of a lamp which I kept always burning, I beheld my tyrant advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing towards my bed. As there was no crime of which I did not believe him to be capable, I had foreſeen this event; and I had even taken meaſures to render it unſucceſsful. I accordingly armed myſelf with a long, ſharp knife, which I had the precaution to conceal beneath my pillow; I overwhelmed the wretch with the reproaches which he ſo juſtly merited; and I vowed, if he dared to advance, that I would poignard him with my own hand.</p>
            <p>He retired, with ſurpriſe and affright viſibly delineated on his countenance; I am tired, ſaid he, as he went out, with experiencing nothing but ſcorn; and if I were not afraid of being overheard, you ſhould ſoon perceive what a woman's arm could effect againſt mine! But I know a way of vanquiſhing your pride! By and by you will think yourſelf but too happy in being able to purchaſe your pardon, by the moſt humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating ſubmiſſions.</p>
            <p>He now withdrew. A few moments after, his confident entered with a piſtol in his hand. I muſt, however, do him the juſtice to ſay, that he wept while he announced to me the orders of his lord.</p>
            <p>Dreſs yourſelf, madam; you muſt inſtantly
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:032388_0055_0FF20E163B2BB868"/>
follow me!—This was all that he was able to ſay to me.</p>
            <p>He then conducted me to that very tower, where, without you, I ſhould this morning have periſhed: he ſhut me up in that horrible priſon: it was there that I had languiſhed for more than a month, without fire, without the light of heaven, and almoſt without clothes; with bread and water for my food; for my bed a few truſſes of ſtraw: this was the deplorable ſtate to which the only daughter of a grandee of Poland was reduced!</p>
            <p>You ſhudder, brave ſtranger, and yet believe me, when I aſſure you, that I do not recount to you any more than a ſmall part of my ſufferings. One thing, however, rendered my miſery leſs inſupportable: I no longer beheld my tyrant. While he expected with tranquility that I ſhould ſolicit my pardon, I paſſed whole days and nights calling on the name of my father, and in bewailing my lover! * * * * * * * * * O Lovzinski!! with what aſtoniſhment was I ſeized; with what joy was my ſoul penetrated, on that day when I once more beheld you in the gardens of Dour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linski!! * * * * * * * * * * * * Titſikan was liſtening to the ſtory of our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, with which he appeared to be deeply
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032388_0056_0FF20E17F687FDD0"/>
affected, when one of his centinels approached, and ſounded an alarm. He immediately left us in great haſte, on purpoſe to run to the draw-bridge. We heard a great tumult, and began already to preſage ſome inauſpicious event.</p>
            <p>While we remained plunged in conſternation, —Lovzinski, Lodoiska, cowardly and perfidious pair! exclaims Dourlinski, unable to contain his joy—you have hoped to be able to elude my vengeance, and eſcape my chaſtiſement. Tremble, you are once more about to fall into my hands. At the noiſe of my captivity and misfortunes, the neighbouring nobility are undoubtedly aſſembled, and have now come to ſuccour me.</p>
            <p>—They can only revenge you, villain!—cries Boleſlas, interrupting him in the midſt of his threats, and ſeizing at the ſame time, an iron bar, with which he prepared to knock him down; I, however, inſtantly interpoſed, and prevented him from executing this act of juſtice.</p>
            <p>Titſikan returned in a few minutes: it is only a falſe alarm, ſaid he to us: it is nothing more than a ſmall detachment which I diſpatched yeſterday, on purpoſe to ſcour the country—they had orders to rejoin me here; and they have brought me ſome priſoners: every thing is quiet, and the neighbourhood does not appear to be in the leaſt commotion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:032388_0057_0FF20E1F2B249DE0"/>While Titſikan yet ſpoke to me, a number of unfortunates, whoſe luckleſs fate had delivered them into the hands of the enemy, were dragged before him. We firſt beheld five, who being unbound, walked by the ſide of their conquerors, with a downcaſt and malancholy aſpect. The Tartars told us, that one of their companions had been overcome with great difficulty, and that was the reaſon why he was bound hand and foot!</p>
            <p>The ſixth now appeared: O heavens! it is my father! exclaims Lodoiſka, running at the ſame time towards him. I, too, throw myſelf at the feet of Pulauſki.</p>
            <p>Are you Pulauſki? ſays the Tartar chieftain, 'tis well—the event is lucky! Believe me, my friend, it is not more than a quarter of an hour ſince I firſt heard of you. I know however that you are proud and hot-headed, but no matter; I eſteem you: you poſſeſs both courage and abilities; your daughter is beautiful, and does not want for underſtanding; Lovzinski is brave—braver than myſelf, as I have already experienced. Attend to what I am about to ſay—</p>
            <p>Pulauski, motionleſs with aſtoniſhment, ſcarcely heard the ſound of the Tartar's voice; and ſtruck, at the ſame time, with the ſtrange ſpectacle that offered itſelf to his view, he began to conceive the moſt horrible ſuſpicions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:032388_0058_0FF20E24671B3EE8"/>He repulſed my careſſes with the moſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant diſguſt: Wretch! exclaims he at length, you have betrayed your country, a woman who loved you, a man who prided himſelf in calling you his ſon-in-law; it was only wanting to fill up the meaſure of your crimes, that you ſhould league with robbers.</p>
            <p>With robbers! cries Titſikan—with robbers indeed, if it ſo pleaſe you to call us; but you yourſelf muſt acknowledge that deſcription of people to be good for ſomething; for without me, perhaps, your daughter by to-morrow's ſun, would no longer have been a maiden. Be not alarmed, ſays he, addreſſing himſelf to me: but I know that he is proud, and I therefore am not angry.</p>
            <p>We had, by this time, placed Pulauſki in a chair; his daughter and myſelf bathed his manacles with our tears: but he ſtill continued to frown at, and to overwhelm me with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</p>
            <p>What, in the name of the devil, would you wiſh for? cries the Tartar, once more addreſſing his captive: I tell you that Lovzinſki is a brave man, whom I intend to ſee married; and as for your Dourlinſki, he is a rogue, whom I am about to order to be hanged.</p>
            <p>I repeat to you, once more, that you alone are
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:032388_0059_0FF20E281458F048"/>
more <hi>hot-headed</hi> than us three put together. But, hear me, and let us finiſh this buſineſs; for it is neceſſary that I ſhould depart. You belong to me, by the moſt inconteſtible right, that of the ſword. But if you promiſe me, upon your honour, that you will be ſincerly reconciled to Lovzinski, and give your daughter to him for a wife, I will reſtore you to your liberty.</p>
            <p>He who can brave death, replies the haughty Pulauski, can ſupport ſlavery. My daughter ſhall never be the wife of a traitor.</p>
            <p>Do you love better, that ſhe ſhould be a Tartar's miſtreſs?—If you do not promiſe to give her, within the ſpace of eight days, to this brave man, I myſelf ſhall eſpouſe her this very night! When I am weary of you and of her, I will ſell you to the Turks. Your daughter is handſome enough to find admittance into the <hi>haram</hi> of a baſhaw: and you yourſelf may, perhaps, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intend the kitchen of ſome janiſſary.</p>
            <p>My life is in your hands; do with it whatſoever you pleaſe. If Pulauski falls beneath the ſword of a Tartar, he will be lamented, and even his enemies will agree, that he merits a more glorious deſtiny: but if he were to conſent—No! no! I rather chooſe—I prefer death!</p>
            <p>I do not deſire your death! I wiſh only that Lovzinski ſhould eſpouſe Lodoiska. What!—ſhall
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:032388_0060_0FF20E29CF3CDD18"/>
my priſoner give the law to me? By my ſabre!— this dog of a Chriſtian—but I am in the wrong— he is furious, and is aſſuredly deprived of his reaſon.</p>
            <p>I now beheld the Tartar's eyes ſparkle with fury, and therefore recalled to his memory the promiſe he had made me, that he would not give way to his paſſion.</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly! but this man wearies out the patience of a favourite of our prophet! I am but a robber!—Yet, Pulauſki, I repeat it to you again, that it is my command that Lovzinſki eſpouſe your daughter. By my ſabre, he has fairly gained her; but for him ſhe had been burnt laſt night.</p>
            <p>But for him!</p>
            <p>Yes, behold thoſe ruins; there ſtood a tower in that place; it was on fire, and no perſon dared to aſcend it: he, however, mounted the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, attended by Boleſlas—and they ſaved your daughter?</p>
            <p>Was my daughter in that tower?</p>
            <p>Yes, that hoary villain had confined her there —that hoary villain, who attempted to violate her!—Some of you muſt relate the whole to him; but make haſte, as it is neceſſary that he ſhould decide it inſtantly: I have buſineſs elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:032388_0061_0FF20E2D5AFB5170"/>
for I do not intend that your militia<note n="*" place="bottom">The troops ſtationed on purpoſe to watch over the ſafety of the frontiers of Podolia and Volhinia, and preſerve them from the incurſions of the Tartars, are called <hi>Quartuaires.</hi>
               </note> ſhall ſurpriſe me here: it is otherwiſe in the plains; there I ſhould laugh at them.</p>
            <p>While Titſikan ordered the rich booty which he had taken, to be ſtowed in little covered waggons, Lodoiſka informed her father of the crimes of Dourlinſki, and mingled the recital of our affection ſo artfully with the hiſtory of our misfortunes, that nature and gratitude at one and the ſame time beſieged the heart of Pulauſki.</p>
            <p>Affected in the moſt lively manner with the misfortunes of his daughter, and ſenſible of the important ſervices which I had rendered her: he embraces Lodoiſka, and at length beholding me without reſentment, he ſeemed to wait impatiently for an opportunity to be reconciled to me.</p>
            <p>O Pulauſki! I exclaim, you whom heaven hath left me on purpoſe to conſole me for the loſs of the beſt of fathers: you for whom I have an equal friendſhip and veneration: why haſt thou condemned thy children unheard. Why haſt thou ſuppoſed a man who adores thy daughter, guilty of the moſt horrible treaſon?</p>
            <p>When my vows were offered up in favour of that prince who now fills the throne, I ſwear to
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:032388_0062_0FF20E30D9674BC0"/>
you, Pulauſki, by her whom I love ſo tenderly, that I looked upon his elevation to be an event highly, auſpicious to the happineſs, the ſafety, and the proſperity of my country.</p>
            <p>The misfortunes which my youth did not foreſee, thy experience had anticipated: but becauſe I have been wanting in prudence, ought you to accuſe me of perfidy? Ought you to have reproached me for loving my friend? Can you now look upon it as a crime, that I ſtill give him my eſteem? For the three laſt months; I have beheld the misfortunes of my country in the ſame point of view as yourſelf; like you, I have mourned over them; but I am ſure that the king is ſtill ignorant of their extent, and I ſhall go to Warſaw on purpoſe to inform him of all that I have ſeen.</p>
            <p>Pulauſki here interrupts me:—It is not there that you ought to repair: you tell me that M. de P— is not informed of the wrongs done to his native country, and I believe you; but whether he is acquainted with, or whether he is entirely ignorant of them, is now but of little conſequence. Inſolent foreigners, cantoned throughout our provinces, ſtrive to maintain themſelves in the republic, even againſt the king, whom they have cauſed to be elected. It is no longer in the power
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:032388_0063_0FF20E328D50FB38"/>
of an impotent or a mal-content king, to chaſe the Ruſſians from my country!</p>
            <p>Let us truſt only to ourſelves, Lovzinſki; and let us either avenge our country, or die in her defence. I have aſſembled 4000 noble Poles in the palatine of Lublin, who wait but for the return of their general to march againſt the Ruſſians; follow me to my camp—on this condition I am your friend, and my daughter ſhall be your wife.</p>
            <p>Pulauſki, I am ready to obey you: I ſwear to follow your fortunes, and to participate in your dangers. And think not that it is Lodoiſka alone who has extracted from me this oath: I love my country as much as I adore thy daughter; I ſwear by her, and before you, that the enemies of the republic have always been, and ſhall never ceaſe to be mine: I ſwear that I will ſpill the very laſt drop of my blood, to chaſe thoſe foreigners out of Poland, who reign there in the name of its king!</p>
            <p>Embrace me, Lovzinſki! I now recognize you; I adopt you for my ſon-in-law.—My children, all our misfortunes are at an end.</p>
            <p>Pulauſki deſired me to unite my hand to Lodoiſka's, in token of our union; and we were embracing the brave palatine at the very moment that Titſikan re-entered.</p>
            <p>Good, good! exclaims the chieftain: this is
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032388_0064_0FF20E3621264848"/>
what I wiſhed; I am fond of marriages.—Father, I ſhall inſtantly order you to be unbound.</p>
            <p>By my ſabre! adds the Tartar, while his followers were cutting the cords with which the hands and feet of Pulauſki were tied: by my ſabre! I ſhall do a noble action, but it will coſt me a world of wealth. Two grandees of Poland! a beautiful maiden! They would have produced me a large ranſom.</p>
            <p>Titſikan, ſuch a thought is not worthy of you! ſays Pulauſki, interrupting him.</p>
            <p>No! no! rejoins the Tartar, it is a mere reflection only—it is one of thoſe ideas which a robber cannot prevent.—My brave and unfortunate friends, I demand nothing from you—nay, more, you ſhall not retire on foot; I have ſome charming horſes, with which I intend to preſent you. And, for this lady, if you pleaſe, I will give you a litter, on which I myſelf have been carried for theſe laſt ten or twelve days. This young man here had given me ſuch a wound, that I could no longer ſit on horſe-back. The litter is indeed a bad one, clumſily conſtructed, by means of branches of trees; but I have nothing except that, or a little covered waggon, to offer you, chooſe which ever of them you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Dourlinski, who had not as yet uttered a ſingle word, remained with his
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:032388_0065_0FF1D67ACD2E5FD8"/>
eyes fixed upon the ground, while an air of conſternation was ſpread over his countenance.</p>
            <p>Unworthy friend, ſays Pulauſki to him, how could you ſo cruelly abuſe the confidence I repoſed in you? Were you not afraid to expoſe yourſelf to my reſentment? What demon blinded you?</p>
            <p>Love, replies Dourlinſki, an outrageous love! You, perhaps, do not comprehend to what exceſs the paſſions may hurry on a man, violent and jealous by nature. This frightful example, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ought to teach you, that a daughter charming as yours, is a treaſure which one ought not to entruſt to any perſon.</p>
            <p>Pulauſki, I have, indeed, merited your hatred; but I am ſtill worthy of your pity. I have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered myſelf exceedingly culpable; but you behold me cruelly puniſhed. I loſe, in one ſingle day, my rank, my riches, my honour, my liberty! more than all this, I loſe thy daughter.</p>
            <p>O, Lodoiſka, lovely maiden, whom I have ſo much outraged, will you deign to forget my perſecutions, your danger, and your grief? Will you deign to grant to me a generous pardon?</p>
            <p>Ah, if there are no crimes which a ſincere repentance cannot expiate, Lodoiſka, I am no longer criminal. I would I were able, at the price of all my blood, to redeem thoſe tears which I have occaſioned you to ſhed. Amidſt the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:032388_0066_0FF20E3B6D0D9990"/>
horrible ſtate to which Dourlinſki is about to be reduced, ſhall he not be permitted to carry with him the conſoling recollection of having heard you tell him, that he is no longer odious to you?</p>
            <p>Too amiable, and, until this preſent moment, too unfortunate maiden, however great my wrongs may have been in regard to you, I have it in my power, to repair them all by means of a ſingle word—advance—approach me—I have a ſecret which can only be entruſted to your private ear: it is exceedingly important that it ſhould be revealed to you.</p>
            <p>Lodoiska, without the leaſt dread, now leaves my ſide, and advances towards him without the leaſt diſtruſt.</p>
            <p>At that very moment I beheld a poignard glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in the hand of Dourlinſki.</p>
            <p>I precipitate myſelf upon him.—It was too late; for I could only parry the ſecond thruſt; and the lovely Lodoiſka, wounded immediately above the left breaſt, had already fallen ſenſeleſs at the feet of Titſikan!</p>
            <p>Pulauſki, furious at the horrid treaſon, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ew his ſabre as quick as lightning, on purpoſe to avenge his daughter's fate.</p>
            <p>No! no! exclaimed the Tartar, at the ſame time withholding his arm: you are about to make this wretch ſuffer too gentle a death!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:032388_0067_0FF20E3EE36BF670"/>It is well, ſays this infamous aſſaſſin, addreſſing himſelf to me, and at the ſame time, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating his victim with a cruel joy. Lovzinſki, you appeared but now eager to be united with Lodoiſka; why do you not follow her? Go, my too happy rival, go and accompany your miſtreſs to the tomb! Let them prepare my <hi>puniſhment;</hi> it will appear pleaſant to me: I leave you to torments no leſs cruel, and infinitely longer than mine.</p>
            <p>Dourlinſki was not allowed to utter another ſentence, for the Tartars ruſhed in upon him, and threw him into the midſt of the burning ruins. * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
            <p>What a night! my dear Faublas; how many different cares, how many oppoſite ſentiments agitated my unhappy mind during its continuance! How many times did I experience the ſucceſſive emotions of fear, hope, grief and joy. After ſo many dangers and inquietudes, Lodoiſka was at length preſented to me by her father, and I was intoxicated with the dear hope of poſſeſſing her: —a barbarian had but now aſſaſſinated her in my preſence!</p>
            <p>This was the moſt cruel and unfortunate moment of any during the whole courſe of my life!—But be comforted, my friend; my happineſs,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032388_0068_0FF20D5C26608DF0"/>
eclipſed as it were, in a ſingle inſtant, was not long in ſhining forth with all its former ſplendour.</p>
            <p>Amidſt the Tartars belonging to Titſikan, was one ſomewhat converſant in ſurgery. We ſend for him; on his arrival he examines the wound, and aſſures us, that it is but a ſlight one. The infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Dourlinſki, conſtrained by his chains, and blinded by his deſpair, had happily been prevented from giving any other than an ill-directed blow.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Titſikan was informed that the life of Lodoiſka was not in any danger, he prepared to take leave of us.</p>
            <p>I leave you, ſaid he, the five domeſtics who accompanied Pulauſki; proviſions for ſeveral days, arms, ſix excellent horſes, two covered waggons, and all the people belonging to Dourlinſki in chains. Their baſe lord is no more! Adieu! the day is about to appear; do not leave this place until to-morrow; I ſhall then viſit the other cantons. Adieu, brave Poles! tell to your country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that Titſikan is not ſo bad as he has been repreſented to them, and that he ſometimes reſtores with one hand what he takes with another. Adieu!</p>
            <p>At theſe words he lifts his hand to his head, and having ſaluted us gracefully, after the manner of his country, he gives the ſignal to depart: the Tartars, mount their ſleet courſers in an

inſtant, paſs along the drawbridge, and make for the neighbouring plain at a full gallop.</p>
            <p>They had been gone ſcarcely two hours when ſeveral of the neighbouring nobility, ſupported by a detachment of militia, came on purpoſe to inveſt the caſtle of Dourlinſki.</p>
            <p>Pulauſki himſelf went out to receive them: he related the particulars of all that had occurred; and ſome, gained over by his eloquence, promiſed to follow us to the palatinate of Lublin.</p>
            <p>They aſked for only two days to prepare every thing neceſſary for the expedition, and actually came and rejoined us at the appointed time, to the number of ſixty.</p>
            <p>Lodoiſka having aſſured us, that ſhe was now able to undergo the fatigues of a journey, we placed her in a commodious carriage, which we had luckily been able to procure for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>After having reſtored Dourlinſki's people to liberty, we abandon the two covered waggons to them, in which Titſikan, acting with his uſual generoſity, had left part of his immenſe booty: this we divided among them in equal proportions.</p>
            <p>We arrived, without meeting with an accident, at Polowiſki, in the palatinate of Lublin, this being the place which Pulauski had appointed for the general rendezvous.—The news of his return having gone abroad, a crowd of malecontents in
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:032388_0070_0FF20E45EAEBF9E0"/>
the ſpace of leſs than a month, ſtocked <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and increaſed our little army to ſuch a degree, that we ſoon found it to amount to no leſs than 10,000 men.</p>
            <p>Lodoiska, entirely cured of her wound, and perfectly recovered from her fatigues, had regained her uſual ſpirits, and appeared in poſſeſſion of all her former beauty. Pulauski, one day, called me into his tent, and ſpoke as follows: Three thouſand Ruſſians have appeared, as you well know, upon the heights above, and at no greater diſtance than half a league from us; take, in the courſe of the enſuing night, three thouſand choſen men, and go and chaſe the enemy from the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous poſts which they now occupy. Recollect, that on the ſucceſs of a firſt attempt, depends almoſt always that of the campaign; recollect, that you are about to avenge your country's wrongs; recollect too, my friend, that to-morrow I ſhall learn thy victory, and, that to-morrow alſo, thou ſhalt eſpouſe Lodoiska?</p>
            <p>I began my march about ten o'clock.—At midnight we ſurpriſed our enemies in their camp. Never was a defeat more complete: we killed ſeven hundred men; we took nine hundred pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; we ſeized all their cannon, the military cheſt, and the ammunition.</p>
            <p>At break of day Pulauſki marches out to join
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:032388_0071_0FF20E496FB570A0"/>
me with the remainder of the troops: he brings Lodoiſka along with him: we are married in Pulauſki's tent. All the camp reſounds with ſongs of gladneſs: valour and beauty are cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in joyous epithalamiums: it ſeemed to be the feſtival of Venus and Mars; and it might be truly ſaid, that every ſoldier appeared to be impreſſed with the ſame ſentiments as myſelf, and that they all partook of my happineſs.</p>
            <p>After I had given up the firſt days of ſo dear an union entirely to love, I began to think of recompenſing the heroic fidelity of Boleſlas. My father-in-law preſented him with one of his caſtles, ſituate at ſome leagues from the capital; and Lodoiſki and myſelf added to this princely donation a conſiderable ſum in ready money, on purpoſe to enable him to lead an independent and tranquil life.</p>
            <p>He firſt refuſed to leave us, but we commanded him to go and take poſſeſſion of his caſtle, and live peaceably in that honourable retreat which his ſervices had ſo amply merited. On the day of his departure I took him aſide:—You muſt go in my name, ſaid I, and wait upon our monarch at Warſaw: inform him that I am united in the bonds of Hymen to the daughter of Pulauski: ſtate to him that I am armed on purpoſe to chaſe out of his kingdom thoſe foreigners who are
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:032388_0072_0FF20E4D05892CE0"/>
ravaging it; and tell him, in particular, that Louvzinski, a foe to the Ruſſians, is not the enemy of his king.</p>
            <p>I will not fatigue you, my dear Faublas, with the recital of our operations, during eight ſucceeding years of a bloody war.—Sometimes vanquiſhed; much oftener victorious; equally great in the midſt of a defeat, as formidable after a victory, and always ſuperior to events, Pulauski attracted and fixed the attention of all Europe, whom he aſtoniſhed by his long and vigorous reſiſtance. Obliged to abandon one province, he made incurſions into, and performed new prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of valour in another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it was thus, that in marching ſucceſſively throughout all the palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, he ſignalized in each of them, by ſome glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious exploit, that eternal hatred which he had ſworn againſt the enemies of Poland.</p>
            <p>Wife of a warrior, daughter of a hero, accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to the tumult of a camp, Lodoiska accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied us every where. Of five children which ſhe had borne me, an only daughter alone remained to us, about eighteen months old. One day, after a moſt obſtinate engagement, the victorious Ruſſians precipitated themſelves towards my tent, on purpoſe to plunder it. Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauski and mſelf, followed by ſome nobles, flew to the defence of Lodoiska, whom we ſaved
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:032388_0073_0FF20E4EB5780CA0"/>
with difficulty: my daughter, however, had been carried off.</p>
            <p>This lovely child, by a ſage precaution which her mother had wiſely made uſe of in thoſe times of inteſtine commotion, had the arms of our family impreſſed, by means a chemical prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, under her left breaſt: but my ſearch after my daughter has hitherto been ineffectual. Alas, Dorliska, my dear Dorliska, either exiſts in ſlavery, or exiſts no more!</p>
            <p>This loſs affected me with the moſt lively ſorrow; Pulauski, however, appeared, almoſt inſenſible to my misfortunes; either becauſe his mind was occupied at this moment with the great project which he ſoon after communicated to me, or becauſe the miſeries of his country alone could effect his ſtoic heart. He, as uſual, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſembles the remains his army, takes poſſeſſion of an advantageous poſt, employs ſeveral days in fortifying, and maintains himſelf in it for three whole months, againſt all the efforts of the Ruſſians.</p>
            <p>It, however, became at length neceſſary that he ſhould abandon this ſituation, as proviſions were beginning to be ſcarce—Pulauſki, on this occaſion, came to my tent; and, having ordered every one to retire, when we alone remained, he addreſſed me as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:032388_0074_0FF20E5070C51798"/>Lovzinſki, I have juſt reaſon for complaining of your conduct. Formerly you ſupported, along with me, the burden of command, and I was enabled to divide with my ſon-in-law a part of my laborious avocations: but for theſe two laſt months, you do nothing but weep: you ſigh like a woman. You have abandoned me in a critical moment, when your aſſiſtance was become the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. You ſee how I am attacked on all ſides; I fear not for myſelf; I am not unhappy for my own life: but if we periſh, the ſtate has no longer any defenders.</p>
            <p>Awake, Lovzinſki! how nobly you once par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated in my cares. Do not now remain the uſeleſs witneſs of them. We are indeed bathed in Ruſſian blood: our fellow-citizens are avenged, but they are not ſaved: nay, even in a ſhort time we may be able no longer to defend them.</p>
            <p>You aſtoniſh me, Pulauſki! Whence theſe ſiniſter auguries?</p>
            <p>I am not alarmed without reaſon. Conſider our preſent poſition: I am forced to awaken in every heart the love of its country; I have found no where but degenerate men, born for ſlavery, or weak ones, who, although penetrated with a ſenſe of their own misfortunes, have bounded all their views to barren complaints.</p>
            <p>Some true citizens are, indeed, ranged under
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:032388_0075_0FF20E578685CCC0"/>
my ſtandards; but eight long and bloody campaigns have leſſened their number, and almoſt extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed them. I become enfeebled by my very victories; our enemies appear more numerous after their defeats.</p>
            <p>I repeat to you, Pulauſki, once more, that you aſtoniſh me! In circumſtances no leſs diſaſtrous, no leſs unhappy, than the preſent, I have beheld you ſuſtain yourſelf by your courage. . . . .</p>
            <p>Do you think that it now abandons me! True valour does not conſiſt in being blind to danger, but in braving it after it has been foreſeen. Our enemies prepare for my defeat; however, if you chooſe, Lovzinski, the very day which they point out for their triumph, ſhall perhaps be that deſtined to record their ruin, and atchieve the ſafety of our fellow-citizens.</p>
            <p>If I chooſe! Can you doubt my ſentiments? Speak! what would you have done?</p>
            <p>To ſtrike the boldeſt ſtroke that I ever meditated. Forty choſen men are aſſembled at Czenſtachow along with Kaluvski, whoſe bravery is well known; they want a chief, able, firm, intrepid—It is you whom I have choſen.</p>
            <p>Pulauski, I am ready.</p>
            <p>I will not diſſemble to you the danger of the enterprize; the event is doubtful, and, if you do not ſucceed, your ruin is inevitable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:032388_0076_0FF20E5AF87D51A8"/>I tell you that I am ready, therefore explain yourſelf.</p>
            <p>You are not ignorant, that ſcarce four thouſand men now fight under my command: with theſe undoubtedly I have ſtill an opportunity of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting our enemies; but with ſuch feeble means, I dare not hope to be ever able to force them to leave our provinces. All the nobility would flock beneath our banners, if the king were in my camp.</p>
            <p>What do you ſay? Can you hope that the king would ever conſent to repair hither?</p>
            <p>No; but he muſt be forced to do ſo.</p>
            <p>Forced!</p>
            <p>Yes. I know that an ancient friendſhip connects you with M. de P—: but ſince you have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, along with Pulauski, the cauſe of liberty, you know alſo that you ought to ſacrifice every thing to the good of your country: that an intereſt ſo ſacred—</p>
            <p>I know my duty, and I am ready to fulfil it; but what is it that you now propoſe to me? the king never leaves Warſaw.</p>
            <p>True; and it is, therefore, at Warſaw that you muſt go and find him; it is from the heart of the capital that he muſt be forced.</p>
            <p>What preparations have you made for ſo great an enterpriſe?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="unknown:032388_0077_0FF20E5CAD648B60"/>You behold yon Ruſſian army, three times as ſtrong as mine, and which has been encamped three months in ſight of us: its general, tranquil at preſent within his entrenchments, impatiently waits until, forced by famine, I ſhall ſurrender myſelf at diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Behind my camp are marſhes which he thinks impracticable: the moment that it is night, we ſhall traverſe them. I have diſpoſed of every thing in ſuch a manner, that the enemy will be deceived, and not perceive my retreat until it is too late. I hope, therefore, to be able to ſteal more than an hour's march upon them, and, if fortune ſeconds me, perhaps a whole day. I ſhall advance ſtrait forward to Warſaw, by the great road that leads to that capital, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the efforts of the little Ruſſian bands who hover continually in its neighbourhood. I ſhall either encounter or conquer theſe ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, or, if they form a junction on purpoſe to ſtop my progreſs, I ſhall at leaſt be able to occupy their attention in ſuch a manner, that they will not be able to impede your operations.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Lovzinſki, you will have preceded me. Your forty followers diſguiſed, and armed only with ſabres, poignards and piſtols, concealed under their clothes, ſhall have arrived at Warſaw by different roads. You muſt wait
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:032388_0078_0FF20D6351A99370"/>
there until the king has left his palace; you are then to carry him off, and to bring him to my camp. The enterprize is bold—raſh, if you pleaſe ſo to term it: the march to Warſaw is difficult; the ſtay in it dangerous; the return from it extremely perilous. If you are vanquiſhed, if you are taken priſoner, you will periſh, Lovzinſki, but you will periſh a martyr to liberty; and Pulauski, jealous of ſo glorious an end, ſighing at being obliged to ſurvive you, ſhall ſend Ruſſians, thouſands of Ruſſians, to accompany you to the tomb.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, if an all-powerful deity; if a god, the protector of Poland, has inſpired me with this hardy object, to terminate evils; if thy good fortune ſhall procure a ſucceſs equal to thy courage, what a glorious proſperity will be atchieved by means of this noble daring.</p>
            <p>M. de P—will not ſee, in my camp, other than citizen ſoldiers, the foes of foreigners, but ſtill faithful to their king; under my patriotic tents, he will reſpire, as it were, the air of liberty, and the love of his country; the enemies of the ſtate ſhall become his; our brave nobility, aſhamed of their indolence, will readily combat under the royal banners, for the common cauſe; the Ruſſians ſhall either be cut in pieces, or be obliged to paſs the frontiers—my friend, in thee thy country ſhall behold her ſaviour. * * *</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:032388_0079_0FF20E5E6B2B2D90"/>Pulauski held his word. That very night he accompliſhed his retreat, with equal ſkill and ſucceſs, by traverſing the marſhes in profound ſilence. My friend, ſaid my father-in-law to me, as ſoon as we were out of the reach of the enemy, it is now time that you ſhould leave us. I know well that my daughter has more courage than another woman; but ſhe is a tender wife, and an unfortunate mother. Her tears will affect you, and you will loſe in her embraces that ſtrength of mind, that dignity of ſoul, which now become more neceſſary to you than ever: I adviſe you, therefore, to be gone, without bidding her farewel.</p>
            <p>Pulauski preſſed me, but in vain, for I was unable to conſent. As ſoon as Lodoiska knew that I ſhould depart alone, and perceived that we were reſolved not to inform her whither, ſhe ſhed torrents of tears and ſtrove to detain me. I began to heſitate.</p>
            <p>Lovzinski, cries my father-in-law, at this critical moment, Lovzinski, depart. Wife, children, relations, all ought to be ſacrificed, when it is neceſſary for the ſalvation of your country.</p>
            <p>I inſtantly mount my horſe, and make ſuch haſte, that I arrived by the middle of next day at Czenſtachow. I here found forty brave men waiting for me, and determined for the moſt hazardous enterprize.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:032388_0080_0FF20D5A44C0C048"/>Gentlemen, ſaid I to them, we are now met on purpoſe to carry a king out of the midſt of his own capital. Thoſe capable of attempting ſuch a bold enterprize, are alone capable of effecting it: either ſucceſs or death awaits us.</p>
            <p>After this ſhort harangue, we prepare to depart. Kaluvski, forewarned of our deſign, had already procured twelve waggons, loaded with hay and ſtraw; each of which was drawn by four good horſes.</p>
            <p>We inſtantly diſguiſed ourſelves as peaſants; we hide our clothes, our ſabres, our piſtols, and the ſaddles of our horſes, in the hay with which our waggons were partly filled; we agree upon certain ſigns, and I give them a <hi>watch-word,</hi> to be uſed according to circumſtances.—Twelve of the conſpirators, commanded by Kaluvski, enter into Warſaw, accompanied by as many waggons, which they themſelves conduct. I divide the reſt of my little troop into ſeveral brigades, on purpoſe to avoid ſuſpicion: each is ordered to march at ſome diſtance from the other, and to gain the capital by different gates.</p>
            <p>We depart, and on Saturday the 2d of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, 1771, arrive at Warſaw, and lodge together at a convent belonging to the Dominicans.</p>
            <p>On the next day, which was Sunday, and which will for ever form a memorable epoch in the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:032388_0081_0FF20E67503E2848"/>
annals of Poland, one of my people, of the name of Stravinski, being covered with rags, places himſelf near the collegiate church, and ſoon after proceeds, demanding charity even at the gates of the royal palace, where he obſerves every thing that paſſed. Several of the conſpirators walked up and down the ſix narrow ſtreets in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the great ſquare where Kaluvski himſelf was poſted. We remain in ambuſcade during the whole day, and part of the afternoon.</p>
            <p>At ſix o'clock at night the king leaves the palace; he is followed, and is ſeen to enter the hotel of his uncle, the grand chancellor of Lithuania.</p>
            <p>All our followers receive notice of this event, and aſſemble inſtantly; they throw off their miſerable clothes, ſaddle their horſes, and prepare their arms, in the large ſquare belonging to the convent, where their movements are entirely concealed. They then ſally forth, one after the other, under favour of the night. Too well known in Warſaw to hazard appearing there, without diſguiſing myſelf, I ſtill wear my peaſant's dreſs, and I mount an excellent horſe, capariſoned, however, after the common manner.</p>
            <p>I then point out to my followers the different poſts in the ſuburbs, which I had aſſigned them before our departure from the convent, and they
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:032388_0082_0FF20E6ACCA71AF0"/>
were diſperſed in ſuch a manner, that all the avenues to the palace of the grand chancellor were carefully and ſtrictly guarded.</p>
            <p>Between nine and ten o'clock at night, the king comes forth on purpoſe to return home; and we remark, with joy, that his attendants were far from being numerous.</p>
            <p>The carriage was preceded by two men, who carried <hi>flambeaux,</hi> ſome officers of his ſuite, two gentlemen and an eſquire followed. I know not what was the name of the grandee in the coach along with the king. There were two pages, one at each door, two hey-dukes running by the ſide of the equipage, and three footmen, in the royal livery, behind.</p>
            <p>The king proceeds ſlowly: part of my people aſſemble at ſome diſtance; twelve of the moſt determined ſpring forward: I put myſelf at their head, and we advanced at a good pace.</p>
            <p>As there was a Ruſſian garriſon at that very moment in Warſaw, we affect to ſpeak the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of thoſe foreigners, ſo that our petty troop might be miſtaken for one of their patroles.</p>
            <p>We overtook the carriage at about a hundred and fifty paces from the grand chancellor's palace, and exactly between thoſe of the biſhop of Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow and of the late grand general of Poland.</p>
            <p>All of a ſudden we paſs the heads of the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:032388_0083_0FF20E6C7A22E770"/>
foremoſt horſes, ſo that thoſe who preceded, found themſelves ſeparated from thoſe who ſurrounded the royal equipage.</p>
            <p>I inſtantly give the ſignal agreed upon. Kaluvski gallops up, with the remainder of the conſpirators: I preſent a piſtol to the poſtillion, who inſtantly ſtops; the coachman is fired upon, and is precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated beneath the wheels. Of the two hey-dukes who endeavoured to defend their prince, one drops, pierced with two balls; the other is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by means of a backhanded ſtroke from a ſabre, which he receives on the head; the ſteed belonging to the eſquire, falls down covered with wounds: one of the pages is diſmounted, and his horſe taken; piſtol balls fly about in all directions —in ſhort, the attack was ſo hot, and the fire ſo violent, that I trembled for the king's life.</p>
            <p>He himſelf, however, preſerving the utmoſt coolneſs in the midſt of the danger, had now deſcended from his carriage, and was ſtriving to regain his uncle's palace on foot. Kaluvſki arreſts and ſeizes him by the hair; ſeven or eight of the conſpirators ſurround, diſarm, overpower him, and, preſſing him between their horſes, make off at full gallop, towards the end of the ſtreet.</p>
            <p>During this moment, I confeſs to you, that I thought Pulauski had baſely deceived me; that the death of the monarch was reſolved upon, and that a plot had been formed to aſſaſſinate him.</p>

               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:032388_0084_0FF20D689A8C5748"/>All of a ſudden I form my reſolves; I clap ſpurs to my horſe, overtake the little band, cry out to them to ſtop, and threaten to kill the firſt perſon who dare to diſobey me.</p>
            <p>That God who is the protector of good kings, watched over the ſafety of M. de P—! Kaluvski and his followers ſtop at the ſound of my well known voice. We mount the king on horſeback, make off at full ſpeed, and regained the ditch that ſurrounded the city, which the monarch is conſtrained to leap, in company with us.</p>
            <p>At that moment a panic terror takes poſſeſſion of my troop: at fifty paces diſtant from the ramparts, there were no more than ſeven who ſurrounded the perſon of the king.</p>
            <p>The night was dark and rainy, and it was neceſſary to diſmount at every inſtant, on purpoſe to ſound the moraſs with which we were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded.</p>
            <p>The horſe on which the monarch rode fell twice, and broke his leg at the ſecond fall: during theſe violent movements, his majeſty loſt his <hi>peliſſe,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Fur cloak.</note> and the ſhoe belonging to his left foot.</p>
            <p>If you wiſh that I ſhould follow you, ſays he to us, you muſt furniſh me with another horſe and a pair of boots.</p>
            <p>We remount him once more, and on purpoſe
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:032388_0085_0FF20D41A544CD50"/>
to gain the road by which Pulauski had promiſed me to advance, we reſolved to paſs through a village called Burakow: but the king exclaims, do not go that way; there are Ruſſians there!</p>
            <p>I immediately change our <hi>route;</hi> but in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as we advance through the wood of Beliany, our number continue to diminiſh. In a ſhort time I perceive nobody around me but Kaluvski and Stravinski; a few minutes after we are challenged by a Ruſſian centinel on horſeback, at whoſe voice we inſtantly ſtop, greatly alarmed for our ſafety.</p>
            <p>Let us kill him, cries the ferocious Kaluvski, pointing to the king. I inſtantly avow to him, without diſguiſe, the horror which ſuch a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition inſpired me with. Very well, you may then take upon you the task of conducting him, adds this cruel hearted man, who immediately after precipitates himſelf into the woods. Stravinski follows him, and I alone remain with the king.</p>
            <p>Lovzinski, ſays he, addreſſing himſelf to me, as ſoon as they were out of ſight; it is you, I can no longer doubt it; it is you, for I well remember your voice. I utter not a ſingle word in reply. He then mildly adds, it is certainly you, Lovzinski. Who would have thought this ten years ago?</p>
            <p>We find ourſelves at that moment near to the convent of Beliany, diſtant no more than a ſingle league from Warſaw.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:032388_0086_0FF20E6E364520A0"/>Lovzinski, continues the king, permit me to enter this convent, and ſave yourſelf.</p>
            <p>You muſt follow me, was my only anſwer.</p>
            <p>It is in vain, rejoins the monarch, that you are diſguiſed; it is in vain that you endeavour to aſſume a feigned voice: I know you well; I am fully aſſured that you are Lovzinski:—ah, who would have ſaid ſo ten years ſince? you would then have loſt your life, on condition of preſerving that of your friend.</p>
            <p>His majeſty now ceaſes to ſpeak; we advance ſome time, in a profound ſilence, which he again breaking, exclaims, I am overcome with fatigue— <hi>If you wiſh to carry me alive, permit me to repoſe myſelf for a ſingle moment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I aſſiſt him to deſcend from his horſe; he ſits down upon the graſs, and making me ſit down by his ſide, he takes one of my hands and preſſes it between his own:</p>
            <p>Lovzinski, you whom I have ſo much loved, you who know better than any one the purity of my intentions, how comes it about that you have taken up arms againſt me. Ungrateful Lovzinſki, ſhall I never find you but amongſt my moſt bitter enemies; do you return but on purpoſe to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice me.</p>
            <p>He then, in the moſt affecting language, recapitulates the pleaſures of our early youth; our
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:032388_0087_0FF20E73B776CE88"/>
more intimate connection at an age approaching to manhood, the tender friendſhip which we had ſworn to each other, and the regard which he had ever treated me with ſince that period. He ſpoke to me of the honours with which he would have loaded me during his reign, if I had been ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to merit them: he reproached me more particularly, reſpecting the unworthy enterprize of which I appeared to be the leader, but of which, he ſaid, he was well aſſured, that I was no more than the inſtrument.</p>
            <p>He threw all the horror of the plot upon Pulauski, repreſenting to me, at the ſame time, that the author of ſuch an attempt was not the ſole culpable perſon; that I could not charge myſelf with its execution, without committing a crime; and that this odious complaiſance, ſo highly treaſonable in a ſubject, was infinitely more ſo in a friend. He concluded, by preſſing me to reſtore him to his liberty: fly, ſaid he to me, and be aſſured, if I encounter any of the Ruſſian patroles, I ſhall tell them that you have purſued an oppoſite road from that which you have taken.</p>
            <p>The king continued to preſs me with the moſt earneſt entreaties: his natural eloquence, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the danger of his ſituation, carried perſuaſion to my heart, and awakened the moſt tender ſentiments there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:032388_0088_0FF20D4FAAD9D558"/>I confeſs that I was ſtaggered; I balanced the circumſtances for ſome time in my own mind, but Pulauski at length triumphed.</p>
            <p>I thought that I ſtill heard the fierce republican reproaching me with my puſillanimity. My dear Faublas, the love of one's country has, perhaps its fanaticiſm and its ſuperſtitions: but if I was then culpable, I am ſtill ſo; I am more than ever purſuaded, that in obliging the king to remount his horſe again, I performed an action that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected honour on my patriotiſm.</p>
            <p>Is it thus, ſays he to me, in a melancholy accent, that you reject the prayer addreſſed to you by a friend! that you refuſe the pardon offered to you by your king? Well, then, let us be gone. I deliver myſelf up to my unhappy fate, or rather I abandon you to your's.</p>
            <p>We now recommence our journey once more; but the entreaties of the monarch, his arguments, his reproaches, his very menaces, the ſtruggles which I felt within myſelf, affected me in ſuch a manner, that I no longer could diſcern my way. Wandering up and down the country, I kept no one certain road: after half an hour's fatigue, we found ourſelves at Marimont,<note n="*" place="bottom">Marimont is a country houſe belonging to the court of Saxony; it is nearer Warſaw, by half a league than Beliany.</note> and I was
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:032388_0089_0FF20E7742BE9F18"/>
greatly alarmed at ſeeing us thus return towards Warſaw, inſtead of leaving it at a diſtance.</p>
            <p>At about a quarter of a league beyond this, we unfortunately fell in with a party of Ruſſians. The king immediately diſcovers himſelf to the commanding officer, and then inſtantly adds: In the courſe of the preceding afternoon, I happened to bewilder myſelf during the chace; this good peaſant, whom you ſee here, inſiſted on my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking a frugal repaſt in his cottage; but as I thought that I perceived ſome of the ſoldiers of Pulauski roaming in the neighbourhood, I was deſirous of returning to Warſaw immediately, and you will oblige me much by inſtantly accompanying me thither.</p>
            <p>As to you, my friend, continues he, turning at the ſame time towards me, I am not at all ſorry that you have given yourſelf this uſeleſs trouble, for I am as much pleaſed at returning to my capital, attended by theſe gentlemen (pointing at the ſame time to the eſcort) as in accompanying you any farther. However, it would be improper that I ſhould leave you without any recompenſe; what are you deſirous of? Speak—I will grant you any favour which you may demand of me.</p>
            <p>Faublas, you may eaſily conceive how much I was alarmed, for I was ſtill doubtful of the king's intentions. I endeavoured therefore to diſcover
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:032388_0090_0FF20E7AC2993110"/>
the true meaning of his equivocal diſcourſe, which muſt be either full of a bitter irony, or a magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous addreſs. M. de P— left me for ſome time in this cruel uncertainty: I behold you greatly embarraſſed, continues he at length, with a gracious air; you know not what to chooſe! Come then, my friend, embrace me: there is indeed more honour than profit in embracing a king (adds he with a ſmile); however, it muſt be allowed, that in my place, many monarchs would not be at this moment ſo generous as myſelf! On uttering theſe words, he inſtantly departs, leaving me penetrated with gratitude, and confounded with ſo much true greatneſs.</p>
            <p>However, the danger which the king had ſo generouſly relieved me from, began every moment to aſſail me again. It was more than probable that a great number of couriers expedited from Warſaw, had ſpread about on all ſides the aſtoniſhing news of the king's having been carried off. Already, without doubt, the raviſhers were warmly purſued. My remarkable dreſs might betray me in my flight; and if I once more fell into the hands of any of the Ruſſians, better informed of the circumſtance, all the efforts of the king would not be able to ſave me. Suppoſing Pulauski had obtained all the ſucceſs which he expected, he muſt ſtill be at a great diſtance; a
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:032388_0091_0FF1D681F37343C0"/>
journey of ten more leagues at leaſt remained for me to perform, and my horſe was entirely ſpent with fatigue; I endeavoured, however, to ſpur him on, but he had not got five hundred paces before he fell under me.</p>
            <p>A cavalier, well mounted, happened to paſs along the road by the ſide of me, at this very moment: he perceived the poor animal tumble down, and, thinking to amuſe himſelf at the expenſe of an unfortunate peaſant, he began to banter me about my ſituation.—Piqued at this buffoonry, I reſolved to puniſh him for his raillery, and ſecure my own flight at one and the ſame time: I therefore inſtantly preſent one of my piſtols to his breaſt, and oblige him to ſurrender his own horſe to me; nay, I acknowledge to you, that, forced by the peculiarity of my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I deſpoiled him even of his cloak, which being very large, hid all my rags beneath it, which otherwiſe might have diſcovered me. I then caſt my purſe full of gold at the feet of the aſtoniſhed traveller, and ſprang forward as faſt as my new horſe could carry me.</p>
            <p>Luckily for me, he was freſh and vigorous. I dart forward twelve leagues, with all the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an arrow: at length I think I hear the firing of cannon, and I inſtantly conjecture that my father-in-law was at hand, and was employed in fighting the Ruſſians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:032388_0092_0FF20E7E56D42978"/>I was not deceived—I arrive on the field of battle at the very moment when one of our regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had given way. I inſtantly diſcovered myſelf to the fugitives, and having rallied them beneath a neighbouring hill, I attack the enemies in flank, while Pulauski charges them in front with the remainder of his troops. Our manoeuvres were ſo well concerted, and ſo admirably executed, that the Ruſſians were entirely routed, after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periencing a terrible carnage.</p>
            <p>Pulauski deigned to attribute to me the honour of their defeat: Ah! cries he, embracing me, after hearing the particulars of my expedition— ah! if your forty followers had but equalled you in courage, the king would have been at this very moment in my camp! But the Deity does not will it. I am grateful, however, that you have been preſerved to us; and I return you thanks for the important ſervice which you have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me: but for you, Kaluvski would have aſſaſſinated the monarch, and my name would have been covered with an eternal opprobrium!</p>
            <p>I might have been able, added he, to have advanced two miles farther; but I rather choſe to take poſſeſſion of this reſpectable poſt, on account of the ſecurity of my camp. Yeſterday, in the courſe of my march, I ſurpriſed, and cut in pieces, a party of Ruſſians; this morning I beat
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:032388_0093_0FF20E81E200E520"/>
two more of their detachments; but another conſiderable corps having collected the remainder of the vanquiſhed, took advantage of the darkneſs of the night, on purpoſe to attack me. My ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, fatigued with the toil of a long march, and three ſucceeding engagements, began to fly; but victory returned to my camp at your approach. Let us entrench ourſelves here; we will wait for the Ruſſian army, and fight while we yet have a drop of blood remaining.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the camp reſounded with the cries of gladneſs, and our victorious ſoldiers mingled my praiſes with thoſe of Pulauſki. At the noiſe of my name, repeated by a thouſand tongues, Lodoiſka ran to her father's tent. She convinced me of the exceſs of her tenderneſs, by the exceſs of her joy at our meeting; and I was obliged once more to commence the recital of the dangers from which I had eſcaped. She could not hear of the ſingular generoſity of the monarch, when I was in the power of the Ruſſians, without ſhedding tears: how magnanimous he is, exclaims ſhe, amidſt a tranſport of joy; how worthy of being a king, he who ſo generouſly pardoned you! How many ſighs has he ſpared a wife whom you forſake! how many tears the loving wife whom you are not afraid of ſacrificing! Cruel Lovzinski, are not the dangers to which you daily expoſe yourſelf ſufficient—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="unknown:032388_0094_0FF20E856852C100"/>Pulauski here interrupts his daughter with a certain degree of harſhneſs: Indiſcreet and weak woman! exclaims he, is it before me that you dare to hold ſuch a diſcourſe as this?</p>
            <p>Alas! replies ſhe in a mild accent, alas! muſt I forever tremble for the life of a father and a huſband! Lodoiska alſo made the moſt affecting complaints to me, and ſighed after a more happy futurity, while fortune was preparing for us the moſt cruel reverſe.</p>
            <p>Our Coſſacks, placed at the out-poſts, now came in from all parts, and informed us that the Ruſſian army was approaching. Pulauski reckoned on being attacked at break of day; but he was not: however, about the middle of the following night, I was informed that the enemy was preparing to force our entrenchments.</p>
            <p>Pulauski, always ready, always active, was actually defending them: during the courſe of this fatal night, he atchieved every thing that might have been expected from his valour and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
            <p>We repel the aſſailants no leſs than five different times; but they return unceaſingly to the charge, pour in freſh troops at every new attack, and, during the laſt one, penetrate into the heart of our very camp by three different avenues, and at one and the ſame time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="unknown:032388_0095_0FF20E88E4AB3CD0"/>Zaremba was killed by my ſide; a crowd of nobles fell in this bloody ac<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>n; the enemy refuſed to give any quarter. Furious at ſeeing all my friends periſh before my eyes, I reſolved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate myſelf into the midſt of the Ruſſian battalions.</p>
            <p>Heedleſs man! exclaims Pulauski, what blind fury urges you towards your deſtruction? My army is entirely routed—deſtroyed —but my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſtill remains! Why ſhould we periſh uſeleſs here? Let us begone! I will conduct you into climes where we may raiſe up new enemies againſt the Ruſſian name. Let us live, ſince we can ſtill ſerve our country! Let us ſave ourſelves let us ſave Lodoiska!</p>
            <p>Lodoiska! am I capable of abandoning her?</p>
            <p>We inſtantly run to her tent—we are ſcarce in time: we carry her off; precipitate ourſelves into the neighbouring woods, and on the next morning we venture to ſally forth, and preſent ourſelves before the gate of a caſtle that was not altogether unknown to us.</p>
            <p>It indeed belonged to a noble Pole, who had ſerved during ſome time in our army. Miciſlas inſtantly comes forth, and offers an aſylum, which he adviſes us, however, to make uſe of for a few hours only. He informs us, that a very aſtoniſhing piece of news had ſpread abroad
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:032388_0096_0FF20E8C82D799A0"/>
on the former evening, and began to be confirmed, according to which the king himſelf had been carried away out of Warſaw; that the Ruſſians had purſued the conſpirators, and brought back the monarch to his capital; and that, in fine, it was talked of putting a price upon the head of Pulauski, who was ſuſpected of being the author of this treaſon.</p>
            <p>Believe me, ſays he, when I aſſure you, whether you have engaged or not in this bold plot, that you ought to fly; leave your uniforms here, which will aſſuredly betray you: I will inſtantly ſupply you with clothes which are leſs remarkable; and as to Lodoiska, I myſelf will conduct her to the place which you have choſen for your retreat.</p>
            <p>Lodoiska now interrupts Miciſlas: the place of my retreat ſhall be that of their flight, for I will accompany them every where.</p>
            <p>Pulauski repreſents to his daughter, that ſhe was not able to ſuſtain the fatigue incident to ſuch a long journey, and that beſides we ſhould be liable to continual dangers.</p>
            <p>The greater the peril is, replies ſhe, the more I ought to partake it with you. You have repeated to me a hundred times, that the daughter of Pulauski ought not to be an ordinary woman. For the laſt eight years I have conſtantly lived in the midſt of alarms; I have ſeen nothing but
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:032388_0097_0FF20E8FF84AF708"/>
ſcenes of carnage and horror. Death has envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned me on all ſides, and menaced me at every moment: will you not permit me to brave it now by your ſide? Is not the life of Lodoiska con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with that of her father? Lovzinski, will not the ſtroke that fells you to the ground ſend your wife to the grave? and am I no longer wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy—</p>
            <p>I now interrupt Lodoiska, and join with her father, in ſtating the reaſons which determined us to leave her in Poland.—She hears me with impatience: Ungrateful man, exclaims ſhe at length, will you fly without me? You ſhall remain, replies Pulauski, with Lovzinski's ſiſters, and I prohibit you.</p>
            <p>His daughter, now frantic with grief, would not permit him to finiſh the ſentence</p>
            <p>I know your rights, my father! I reſpect them; they ſhall always appear ſacred to me: but you do not poſſeſs that of ſeparating a wife from her huſband.</p>
            <p>Ah, pardon me! I ſee that I offend you—my reaſon no longer maintains its empire.</p>
            <p>But pity my grief—</p>
            <p>Excuſe my deſpair—</p>
            <p>My father! Lovzinski! hear me, both of you; I am determined to accompany you every where!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="unknown:032388_0098_0FF20D5337518B78"/>Yes, I will follow you every where, cruel men; I will follow you in ſpite of yourſelves!</p>
            <p>Lovzinski, if your wife has loſt all the rights ſhe had over your heart, recollect at leaſt, her who was once the miſtreſs of your affections.</p>
            <p>Recal to your remembrance that frightful night, when I was about to periſh in the flames; that terrible moment when you aſcended the burning tower, crying out, let me live or die with Lodoiska</p>
            <p>That which you felt at that terrible moment, I now experience! I know no greater evil than that of being ſeparated from you; I now exclaim in my turn, let me either live or die with my father and my huſband.</p>
            <p>Unfortunate wretch! what will become of me, if you ſhould forſake me. Reduced to the cruel ſituation of bewailing you both, where ſhall I find a ſolace for my miſeries? Will my children conſole me?—Alas! in two years death hath ſnatched four away from me; and the Ruſſians, equally pitileſs as death itſelf, have bereaved me of the laſt! I have only you remaining in the world, and even you wiſh to abandon me! my father! my huſband! Will ſuch dear connections as theſe be inſenſible to my ſufferings! Have compaſſion, take pity on your own Lodoiska! * * * * * * * *</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:032388_0099_0FF20EC5C020C2B8"/>Her tears now intercepted her ſpeech. Miciſlas wept; my heart was torn with anguiſh. You are reſolved to accompany us, my daughter—be it ſo; I conſent, ſays Pulauski: but I wiſh that heaven may not puniſh me for my complaiſance!</p>
            <p>Lodoiska now embraces us both with as much joy as if all our ills had been at an end. I leave two letters with Miciſlas, which he undertook to tranſmit according to the direction; the one was addreſſed to my ſiſters, and the other to Boleſlas. I bade him adieu, and I recommended to them, to neglect no means to endeavour to recover my dear Dorliska!</p>
            <p>It was neceſſary that I ſhould diſguiſe my wife —ſhe aſſumes a maſculine dreſs; we change our own, and we employ all the means in our power to disfigure ourſelves in ſuch a manner as to elude reſearch, and prevent diſcovery.</p>
            <p>Thus altered in our appearance, armed with our ſabres and our piſtols, provided with a conſiderable ſum in gold, with ſome trinkets, and all the jewels of Lodoiska, we take leave of Miciſlas, and make haſte to regain the woods.</p>
            <p>Pulauski now communicates to us the deſign which he had formed of taking refuge in Turkey. He hoped to be employed in a ſituation equal to his rank and his abilities, in the armies of the grand ſignior, who had, for the two laſt years, with

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the Ruſſians.</p>
            <p>Lodoiska did not appear in the leaſt affrighted at the long journey which we had to make; and as ſhe could neither be known nor ſought after, ſhe inſiſted upon going out to reconnoitre the adjacent country, and at the ſame time charged herſelf with the fatiguing but important taſk of bringing us the proviſions which we ſtood in need of.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the day appeared, we retired into the woods; hid either in the trunks of trees, or in the thick groves of pines, we waited impatiently for the return of night, on purpoſe to continue our march. It was thus, that, during ſeveral weeks, we were enabled to eſcape from the ſearch of a multitude of different bodies of Ruſſian troops, who were ſent out on purpoſe to diſcover us, and who purſued us like ſo many blood hounds, animated with the paſſions of hatred and revenge.</p>
            <p>One day as Lodoiska, ſtill diſguiſed as a peaſant, was returning from a neighbouring hamlet, where ſhe had gone on purpoſe to purchaſe the proviſions which ſhe was now conveying to us, two Ruſſian marauders attacked her at the entry of the foreſt in which we were concealed.</p>
            <p>After having robbed, they prepared to ſtrip her. At the ſhrieks which ſhe uttered, we haſtened
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:032388_0101_0FF20ECCEFA80320"/>
from our retreat, and the two ruſſians immediately betake themſelves to flight upon our appearance: but we were greatly alarmed left they ſhould recount this adventure to their companions, whoſe ſuſpicions, arouſed by this ſingular rencounter, might induce them to come and drag us from our aſylum.</p>
            <p>After a moſt fatiguing journey, we entered Poleſia.<note n="*" place="bottom">Poleſia is a name given to the palatinate of Breſte, in Lithuania; Breſte, Brieſcia, or Breſſici, is ſituated upon the banks of the river Bog.</note> Pulauski wept at leaving his native country.</p>
            <p>At leaſt, exclaims he, with a mournful accent—at leaſt I have faithfully ſerved you, and I now only go into exile, that I may be enabled to ſerve you again.</p>
            <p>So many fatigues had exhauſted the ſtrength of Lodoiska. Arrived at Novogorod,<note n="†" place="bottom">There are ſeveral towns of this name in Ruſſia. This ſeems to have been Novogorod Welicki, or Great Novogorod, the capital of a duchy of the ſame name.</note> we reſolved to ſtop there on purpoſe to give her time to recover her ſtrength. It was our deſign to remain for ſome days, but ſome of the country people whom we queſtioned, frankly informed us, that a number of troops were in motion, in that neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, on purpoſe to arreſt a certain perſon of
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:032388_0102_0FF20ECEA3E05F38"/>
the name of Pulauski, who had occaſioned the king of Poland to be taken priſoner, and carried off from the midſt of his own capital.</p>
            <p>Juſtly alarmed at this intelligence, we remain but a few hours in this town, where we, however, found means to purchaſe ſome horſes without being diſcovered.</p>
            <p>We then paſſed the Deſna, above Czernicove;<note n="*" place="bottom">Czernicove, or Czernikou, is a conſiderable town, and is the capital of the duchy of the ſame name. It is ſituate on the river Deſna, 75 miles north-eaſt of Kiow.</note> and following the banks of the Sula, we croſs that river at Perevoloczna, where we learn, that Pulauſki, who had been traced to Novogorod, had eſcaped, as it were, by miracle, and that the Ruſſian ſoldiers, indefatigable in their purſue were ſtill ſearching after him, and were in hopes of making him priſoner.</p>
            <p>It was now again become neceſſary to fly once more, and once more to change our route; we therefore inſtantly made for the immenſe foreſts which cover the face of the country between the Sula and the Zem, in the dark retreats of which we hoped to find ſhelter from our foes.</p>
            <p>We at length diſcover a cavern, in which we were reduced to the neceſſity of taking up our abode. A ſhe-bear diſputes with us the entrance
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:032388_0103_0FF20ED068655AB8"/>
into this aſylum, equally ſolitary and frightful: we aſſail, we kill her, and devour her young.</p>
            <p>Pulauſki was wounded in this encounter: Lodoiſka, worn out with fatigue and diſtreſs, was ſcarcely able to ſupport her exiſtence: the winter was approaching, and the cold was already exceſſive.</p>
            <p>Purſued by the Ruſſians in the inhabited parts; menaced by wild and ferocious animals in this vaſt deſert: deſtitute of any arms but our ſwords; reduced in a ſhort time to eat our very horſes; what was to become of us?</p>
            <p>The danger of the ſituation to which my father-in-law and my wife were reduced, had become ſo preſſing, that no other fear any longer alarmed me. My perſonal ſafety, hitherto ſo dear to me, did not now ſuggeſt itſelf once to my mind: I felt only for their's. I reſolved, therefore, to procure for them at any rate, thoſe ſuccours which their ſituation required, which was ſtill more deplorable than my own; and leaving them both with the promiſe of rejoining them in a ſhort time, I take a few of the diamonds belonging to Lodoiſka, and follow the ſtream of the Warsklo.</p>
            <p>You muſt know, my dear Faublas, that a traveller, bewildered amidſt thoſe vaſt countries, and reduced to the neceſſity of wandering about without a compaſs, and without a guide, is obliged
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:032388_0104_0FF20ED246635C58"/>
to follow the courſe of a river, becauſe it is upon its banks that the habitations of mankind are moſt commonly to be met with.</p>
            <p>It was neceſſary that I ſhould gain, as ſoon as poſſible, ſome conſiderable town in which a few merchants reſided: I therefore journeyed along the banks of the Warſklo, and travelling day and night, found myſelf at Pultava<note n="*" place="bottom">Pultoway, Pultowa, or Pultava, is a fortified town in the Ukraine, famous for a battle fought in its neighbourhood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Charles XII. of Sweden, and Peter the Great of Ruſſia. It is 100 miles ſouth-weſt of Bielgorod, from which Lovzinſki pretended to have come on purpoſe to purchaſe merchandize, &amp;c.</note> at the end of four days. During my reſidence in this place, I paſs for a trader belonging to Bielgorod. I there learn that the Ruſſian troops were ſtill roaming about in purſuit of Pulauski, and that the empreſs had ſent an exact deſcription of his perſon every where, with orders to ſeize him either dead or alive, wherever he might be found.</p>
            <p>I make haſte to ſell my diamonds, to purchaſe powder, arms, and proviſions of all kinds, different utenſils, and ſome coarſe but neceſſary furniture; every thing, in fine, which I judged moſt proper to relieve our miſery, and ſoften our misfortunes. With theſe I load a waggon, drawn by four good horſes, of which I was the only conductor.</p>
            <p>My return was equally tedious and difficult;
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:032388_0105_0FF20ED5B9DDBC68"/>
no leſs than eight whole days expired before I arrived at the entrance of the foreſt.</p>
            <p>It was there that terminating my diſagreeable and dangerous journey, I was about to ſuccour my father-in-law and my wife; and I was about to reviſit all that was moſt dear to me in the world; and yet my dear Faublas, I felt none of thoſe tranſports of joy which ſuch an event ſeemed likely to inſpire.</p>
            <p>Your philoſophers have no belief in forebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
            <p>I aſſure you, however, my dear friend, that I experienced an involuntary uneaſineſs: my mind became diſpirited, diſmayed, and ſomething, I know not what, ſeemed to whiſper to me, that the moſt unhappy moment of my whole life was faſt approaching.</p>
            <p>On my departure I had placed ſeveral flint ſtones at certain diſtances, on purpoſe to enable me to retrace my road; but I could not now diſcover them. I had alſo cut off with my ſabre large pieces of the bark of ſeveral trees, which I could not now perceive: I enter the foreſt, however: I holla with all my ſtrength: I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my gun from time to time, but nobody anſwers me. I dared not truſt myſelf among the trees and ſhrubs for fear of loſing my way back; neither could I wander too far from my waggon,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:032388_0106_0FF20E9371EC70F8"/>
which was ſtored with proviſions ſo neceſſary to Pulauski, his daughter, and myſelf.</p>
            <p>The night, which now approached, obliged me to give over my ſearch, and I paſs it in the ſame manner as the former. Rolled up in my cloak, I lay down beneath my waggon, which I had carefully ſurrounded with my larger movables, and which thus ſerved me as a rampart againſt the wild beaſts.</p>
            <p>I could not ſleep; the cold was extremely intenſe; the ſnow fell in great abundance: at break of day I looked around, and found all the ground covered with it. From that moment I formed the moſt horrible and the moſt ſiniſter preſages: the ſtones, which might have pointed out the path I was to have taken, were all buried, and it appeared impoſſible that I ſhould ever be able to diſcover my father-in-law and my wife.</p>
            <p>Had the horſe, which I left with them at my departure, afforded them ſufficient ſuſtenance ever ſince? Had not hunger, cruel hunger, obliged them to fly from their retreat? Were they ſtill concealed in thoſe frightful deſerts? If they were not there, where ſhould I be able to find them? Where, without them, ſhould I drag out my miſerable exiſtence? * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="unknown:032388_0107_0FF20EBE55BC50D8"/>But could I believe that Pulauski had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned his ſon-in-law? that Lodoiska had conſented to ſeparate herſelf from her huſband? No— undoubtedly not. They were ſtill confined within the circle of this frightful ſolitude; and if I abandoned them, they muſt die with famine and with cold! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
            <p>Theſe deſperate reflections at length determined my conduct, and I no longer examined whether or not in removing at a diſtance from my waggon, I was in danger of never finding it again. To carry ſome proviſions to my father-in-law and wife, to ſuccour Pulauski and Lodoiska—theſe were now the only ſentiments that occupied my mind.</p>
            <p>I accordingly ſeize my fowling-piece, take ſome powder and ſhot, and load one of my horſes with neceſſaries: I pierce into the woods, much farther than during the former evening. I again holla with all my ſtrength; I again make frequent diſcharges with my gun. The moſt melancholy ſilence reigned all around me.</p>
            <p>I now find myſelf in a part of the foreſt where the trees were ſo extremely thick, that there was no longer any paſſage for my horſe: I, therefore tie him to a tree, and my deſpair getting the better of
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:032388_0108_0FF20EDEF967FBE0"/>
every other conſideration, I ſtill continue to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance with my gun and part of my proviſions. I had now wandered about for two hours more, my inquietude forcing me every moment to double my pace, when at length I perceive human footſteps imprinted upon the ſnow.</p>
            <p>Hope gives me new ſtrength, and I therefore inſtantly follow the traces which were ſtill freſh. Soon after I diſcovered Pulauski almoſt naked, emaciated with hunger, and ſo changed as ſcarce to be known even by me!</p>
            <p>He makes all the efforts in his power to drag his limbs towards me, and to reply to my enquiries. The moment that I had rejoined him, he ſeizes, with avidity, on the victuals that I preſented to him, and devours them in an inſtant. I then demand of him where Lodoiska is.</p>
            <p>Alas! ſays he, you will ſee her there! The tone of voice in which he pronounced theſe words, made me tremble. I run to, I arrive at, the cavern, but too well prepared for the melancholy ſpectacle that awaited me. Lodoiska, wrapped up in her own clothes, and covered with thoſe of her father, was extended upon a bed of half rotten leaves!</p>
            <p>She raiſes, with ſome difficulty, her weary head, and refuſing the aliments which I now offer her, addreſſes me as follows:—I am not hungry!
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:032388_0109_0FF20EA3C54190D8"/>
The death of my children; the loſs of Dorliska; our journies, ſo long, ſo laborious, ſo difficult: your dangers, which ſeemed to increaſe daily— theſe have killed me! I was unable to reſiſt fatigue and ſorrow. My friend, I am dying—I heard thy voice, and my ſoul was ſtopped in its flight— We ſhall meet again! Lodoiska ought to die in the arms of a huſband whom ſhe adores!—Aſſiſt my father! May he live! Live both of you— conſole yourſelves, and forget me! * * * * * * * * * —Search every where for my dear * * * * * * * *</p>
            <p>She was unable to pronounce the name of her daughter, and inſtantly expired! * * * * * * * *</p>
            <p>Her father digs a grave for her at a little diſtance from the cavern; and I behold the earth incloſe all that I loved in this world! * * * * * *</p>
            <p>What a trying moment! Pulauski alone prevented me from becoming the victim of deſpair: he forces me to ſurvive Lodoiska! * * * * * * *</p>
            <p>Lovzinski now endeavours to continue his narrative, but his tears prevent his utterance. He demands leave to retire for a moment, paſſes into a neighbouring apartment, and returns in a ſhort time after with a miniature in his hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="unknown:032388_0110_0FF20EE2D7414AF8"/>Behold, ſays he, the portrait of my dear Dorliski! behold how handſome ſhe was while an infant! In her features, as yet ſcarcely deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped, I recognize thoſe of her mother—Ah! if at length—</p>
            <p>I now interrupt Lovzinski: What a beautiful face! exclaims I: ſhe greatly reſembles my <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome couſin</hi>!</p>
            <p>Theſe are the rhapſodies of a lover, replies he; he ſees the object of his adoration every where!</p>
            <p>Ah, my dear friend, if Dorliska were reſtored to me!—But after ten years of an uſeleſs ſearch, I can no longer hope to ſee her again.</p>
            <p>With his eyes ſtill diffuſed with tears, which he ſtrives to retain, Lovzinſki reſumes the hiſtory of his misfortunes, in a voice overcome as it were with their exceſs:</p>
            <p>Pulauſki, whoſe courage never abandoned him, and whoſe ſtrength was by this time reſtored, obliges me to occupy myſelf jointly with him, in the buſineſs of procuring our ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p>By following along the ſnow the prints of my footſteps, we arrive at length at the place where I had left my waggon, which we immediately unload, and burn ſoon after, on purpoſe to withhold from our enemies the moſt diſtant ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the place of our retreat.</p>
            <p>By the aid of our horſes, for which we procure
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:032388_0111_0FF20EEBA3356D80"/>
a paſſage by making a circuitous journey, inſtead of attempting to bring them ſtraight to the place of our retreat, we were at length able to tranſport thoſe proviſions and moveables to our cavern, which it was ſo neceſſary for us to procure, and to huſband, if we reſolved to remain much longer in this ſolitude. We ſoon after killed our horſes, which we were unable to ſupply with food. We lived upon their fleſh, which the rigour of the ſeaſon preſerved for a conſiderable time; it corrupted, however, at length; and our fire-arms being unable to procure us any other than a ſcanty ſupply of game, we were obliged to have recourſe to our proviſions; which, at the end of three months, were entirely conſumed.</p>
            <p>Some gold, and the greater part of Lodoiska's diamonds, ſtill remained. Should I make a ſecond voyage to Pultava? or ſhould we both run the hazard of ſuch an undertaking, and quit our retreat in company? We had already ſuffered ſo much, and ſo cruelly in this foreſt, that we reſolved to embrace the latter reſolution.</p>
            <p>We accordingly ſally forth; we paſs the Sem near Rylks; we purchaſe a boat there, and, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing ourſelves in the dreſs of fiſhermen, we deſcend that river, and enter the Deſna.</p>
            <p>Our boat was viſited at Czernicove, but miſery had ſo disfigured Pulauſki, that it was impoſſible
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:032388_0112_0FF20EEF21A57AC8"/>
any longer to recognize him. We then enter the Dnieper; we croſs from Kiof<note n="*" place="bottom">Kiof, or Kiow, is a palatinate, in winch is ſituated a town of the ſame name, which is reckoned the capital of the Ukraine. It is built on the banks of the river Nieper, or Dnieper, as it is ſometimes called.</note> to Krylow. There we were obliged to receive into our boat, and carry to the other ſide, ſeveral Ruſſian ſoldiers, who were on their march to join a ſmall army employed againſt Pugatchew.</p>
            <p>At Zaporiſkaia, we heard of the capture of Bender and Oczakow, the conqueſt of the Crimea, the defeat and ſubſequent death of the vizar Oglou.</p>
            <p>Pulauſki, reduced to a ſtate of deſperation, was anxious to traverſe the vaſt deſerts that ſeparated him from Pugatchew, on purpoſe to join himſelf to that enemy of the Ruſſians; but the exceſs of our fatigues obliged us to remain at Zaporiskaia.</p>
            <p>The peace which was ſoon after concluded between Ruſſia and the Porte, at length afforded us the means of entering Turkey.</p>
            <p>On foot, and ſtill diſguiſed, we croſſed the Boudziac, part of Moldavia, and Wallachia, and after a thouſand unforeſeen and unexpected difficulties and fatigues, we at length arrive at Adrianople.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="unknown:032388_0113_0FF20EF0E099E2E0"/>Having remained for ſome time at this place, on purpoſe to repair our exhauſted forces, we prepare to depart: but we are arreſted, and, being carried before the cadi, are accuſed of having ſold ſeveral diamonds in the courſe of our journey, which we had apparently ſtolen. The miſerable clothes with which we were covered, had given riſe to this ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>Pulauski diſcovers himſelf to the muſſulman judge, and he ſends us immediately to Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</p>
            <p>We are admitted ſhortly after to an audience of the grand ſeignior. He orders apartments to be prepared for us, and aſſigns us a liberal penſion upon his treaſury.</p>
            <p>I then write to my ſiſters, and to Boleſlas: we learn, by their anſwers, that all the property of Pulauski had been confiſcated; that he was degraded from his rank, and condemned to loſe his head.</p>
            <p>My father-in-law is in the utmoſt conſternation on receiving this intelligence: he is filled with indignation at being accuſed as a regicide: he writes home in his own juſtification.</p>
            <p>Conſtantly animated, and devoured as it were with the love of his country, continually influenced by the mortal hatred which he had ſworn againſt its enemies, he never ceaſed, during the four whole

years that we remained in Turkey to endeavour, by his intrigues, to oblige the Porte to declare war againſt Ruſſia.</p>
            <p>In 1774, amidſt a tranſport of rage, he receives intelligence of the triple invaſion,<note n="*" place="bottom">The diſmemberment of Poland, by the empreſs of Ruſſia, the emperor of Germany, and the king of Pruſſia. This event which took place by the agreement of three royal robbers, is one of the moſt diſgraceful actions that ever ſtained the page of humanity.</note> which bereaved the republic of one-third of its poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>It was in the ſpring of 1776, that the inſurgents in America, fearful of the tyranny of an iſland which once boaſted of its own liberties, reſolved to redeem their violated rights by force of arms. My country hath loſt her freedom, ſays Pulauſki to me one day: but, ah, let us ſtill fight for that of a new people!</p>
            <p>We paſs into Spain, we embark on board of a veſſel bound for the Havannah, from whence we repair to Philadelphia. The congreſs inſtantly preſents us with commiſſions, and employs us in the army of general Waſhington.</p>
            <p>Pulauſki, conſumed with a black melancholy, expoſes his life like a man, to whom life had become inſupportable, is always to be found at the moſt dangerous poſts, and towards the end of the fourth campaign, is mortally wounded by

            <p>I find that my end approaches, ſays he, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf to me. Ah! it is but too true, that I ſhall never ſee my native country again!</p>
            <p>Cruel, fantaſtical deſtiny! Pulauſki falls a martyr to American liberty, and the Poles ſtill continue ſlaves! * * * * * * * * * * * My friend, my death would be indeed horrible, if a ray of hope did not remain to cheer me! Ah! I hope I do not deceive myſelf—No, I am not miſtaken, adds he in a firmer accent.</p>
            <p>A conſoling deity diſcloſes in my laſt thoughts a futurity, a happier futurity which approaches!</p>
            <p>I behold one of the firſt nations in the world awakening from a long and deep ſlumber, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demanding of its proud oppreſſors, its violated honours, and its ancient rights; its ſacred, impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptible rights, the rights of humanity.</p>
            <p>I behold, in an immenſe capital, long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by every ſpecies of ſervility, a crowd of ſoldiers diſcovering themſelves to be citizens, and millions of citizens becoming ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>Beneath their redoubled blows, the baſtile ſhall be overturned; the ſignal is already given from one extremity of the empire to another;—the reign of tyrants is no more!</p>

Inſtead of the cruel advantage of affrighting and ſubduing the nations around you, diſpute between yourſelves the more ſolid glory of enlightening their ignorance, and breaking their chains.</p>
            <p>Approach, adds Pulauski; behold at a little diſtance from, and in the midſt of the carnage that ſurrounds us, among ſuch a croud of famous warriors, a warrior celebrated even in the midſt of them, by his maſculine courage, his early talents, and his virtues truly republican.

            <p>Envy his fate, Lovzinski; endeavour to imitate his virtues, and follow as near as poſſible the ſteps of ſo great a man. He, the worthy pupil of a Waſhington, ſhall ſoon be the Waſhington of his own country. It is almoſt at the ſame time, my friend, it is at that memorable epoch of the regeneration of nations, that the eternal juſtice ſhall alſo preſent to our fellow-citizens, the days of vengeance and of liberty.</p>
            <p>Then, Lovzinski, in whatever place thou mayeſt be, let thy hate re-kindle! Again combat gloriouſly on the ſide of Poland.</p>
            <p>Let the remembrance of our injuries, and of our ſucceſſes, call forth thy courage!

            <p>My friend, I fought for the United States of America, until the happy peace which inſured their independence.
