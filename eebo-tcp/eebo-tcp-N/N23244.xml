            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This puniſhment I incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the commiſſion of a robbery, to which ſome particular circumſtances, joined to the poverty conſequent on diſſipation and extravagance had tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me.</p>
               <p>The maſter to whom my ſervice was adjudged in the Weſt-Indies, happened

                  </gap>oon after my arrival there. I got my freedom, therefore, though it was but to change it for a ſervice as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere as my former: I was enliſted in a regiment then ſtationed in the iſland, and being conſidered as a felon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of any mild treatment, was conſtantly expoſed to every hardſhip which the hardeſt duty, or the moſt continual expoſure to the dangers of the climate could inflict.</p>
               <p>Had I revealed my ſtory, and taken advantage of that diſtinction which my birth and education would have made between the other convicts and me, it is probable I might have prevented moſt of the evils both of my former and preſent ſituation: but I ſet out from the firſt with a fixed determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bear every part of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030728_0021_0FE8CB1DE8053D40"/>
viciſſitudes of the weather; and from a ſullen diſregard of life, with which the remembrance of better days in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired me, my ſoul became as fearleſs as my body was robuſt. Theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties made me be taken notice of by ſome of the officers of the regiment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and afterwards, when our regiment was ordered to America, and went on ſome indian expeditions, were ſtill more ſerviceable, and more attractive of obſervation.</p>
               <p>By theſe means I began to obliterate the diſgrace which my ſituation at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſting had fixed upon me, and it ſtill regarded as a ruſſian, I was at leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be a uſeful one.</p>
               <p>Not long after, on occaſion of a piece of ſervice I performed for an officer on an advanced guard, that was attacked by a party of hoſtile indians, I was promoted to a halbert.</p>
               <p>The ſtigma, however, of my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation was not yet entirely forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and by ſome it was the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, becauſe of my preſent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement. One of thoſe, with whom I was not on good terms, was partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly offended at being commanded,

as he termed it, by a jail-bird; and one day, when I was on guard, had drawn on the back of my coat, the picture of a gallows, on which was hung a figure in caricature, with the initials of my name written over it.</p>
               <p>This was an affront too groſs to be borne; having ſought out the man, who did not deny the charge, I challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to give me ſatisfaction by fighting me. But this, from the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion conceived of my ſtrength and fer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For this offence I was tried by a court-martial, and ſentenced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive five hundred laſhes, as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When their ſentence was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to me, I petitioned that it might be changed into death; but my requeſt was refuſed.</p>
               <p>That very day, therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I received one hundred laſhes, (for the ſentence was to be executed at different periods) and next morning was to ſuffer as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more. The remainder, however, I reſolved, if poſſible, to eſcape, by an

               <p>I held therefore in a direction the moſt probable for falling in with them and a very little after day break diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a party, ſeated after the manner of their country, in a ring, with the aſhes of their newly extinguiſhed fire in the middle.

no refined ſenſation of delight, there is alſo no ideal ſource of calamity; we ſhall the leſs wonder at the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants feeling no regret for the want of thoſe delicate pleaſures of which a more poliſhed people is poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, that I am far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſingle inſtance, of one who had even obtained maturity in Europe, and yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>"The compoſure with which the old man met his diſſolution, would have done honor to the firmeſt philoſopher of antiquity. When he found himſelf near his end, he called me to him, to deliver ſome final inſtructions reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my carriage to his countrymen. He obſerved, at the cloſe of his diſcourſe, that I remained ſo much of the Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, at to ſhed ſome tears while he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it.</p>

                  <hi>"In thoſe tears"</hi> ſaid he, <hi>there is no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for there is no uſe. I have heard, that in your country, men prepare for death, by thinking on it while they live; this alſo is folly, becauſe it loſes the good, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating the evil. We do otherwiſe, my ſon, as our fathers have better inſtructed us, and take from the evil by reflecting on the good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have lived a thouſand moons, without captivity and without diſgrace: In my youth I did not fly in battle, and in age the tribes liſtened while I ſpake. If I live in another land after death, I ſhall think of theſe things with pleaſure if the preſent is our only life to have done thus is to have uſed it well. You have ſometimes told me of your countrymen's account of a land of ſouls; but you were a young man when you came among us, and the cunning amongſt them may have deceived you, for the children of the french king call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after the ſame God that the Engliſh do; yet their diſcourſes concerning him cannot be true, becauſe they are oppoſite one to another. Each ſays that God ſhall burn the other with fire, which could not happen if both were his children.</hi>

their God heareth all things, yet do they break the promiſes which they have called upon him to hear; but we know that the ſpirit within us liſteneth, and what we have ſaid in its hearing that we do.</hi>

               <p>If in another country the ſoul liveth, this witneſs ſhall live with it; whom it hath here reproached, it ſhall there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet; whom it hath here honored, it ſhall there reward.</p>

               <p>With ſuch ſentiments the old man reſigned his breath, and I bluſhed for the life of Chriſtians, while I heard them.</p>
               <p>I was now become an independent member of the community, and my behaviour had been ſuch, that I ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the condition of my father, with the reſpect of a people, amongſt whom honour is attainable only by merit. But his death had diſſolved that tie, which gratitude, and indeed affection for the old man had on my heart; and the ſcene of his death na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally awakened in me the rememb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a father in England, whoſe

age might now be helpleſs, and call for the aid of a long loſt ſon to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and ſupport it.

               <p>When he left me, I ſtood ſome minutes, looking back, on one hand to the wilds I had paſſed, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the cultivation which Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an induſtry had formed; and it may ſurpriſe you to hear, that though there wanted not ſome rekindling attachment to a people amongſt whom my firſt breath had been drawn, and my youth ſpent, yet my imagination drew, on

The mate, who ſeemed to be the ableſt ſailor on board, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them at leaſt to endeavor running the ſhip into a bay, which opened a little on our ſtarboard quarter, where the ſhore was flat and ſandy: comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the reflection, that they ſhould at leaſt be caſt on friendly ground and not among <hi>ſavages.</hi> His advice and encouragement had the deſired effect; and notwithſtanding the perils with which I was ſurrounded, I looked with a gleam of ſatisfaction on the coaſt of my native land, which for ſo many years I had not ſeen.

               <p>"<hi>They are gone this way," he cried, with an eagerneſs of look, graſping one of the knotty branches which the ſoldier's fire had ſpared. "If there is danger in your ways ſaid his companion, "you ſhall not meet it alone.</hi>"</p>
               <p>They ſallied forth together, but had not proceeded above a quarter of a mile, when they perceived at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the twinkling of lights in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; their pace was quickened at the ſight; but in a few minutes thoſe were extinguiſhed, the moon was darkened by another cloud, and the wind began to howl again.

                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:030728_0054_0FE8CB3CC5255E18"/>They ruſhed forward in the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſound till they were ſtop<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped by a pretty high wall.

But the voice had failed, and all was ſilent within. Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton knocked at the door but received no anſwer, when ſuddenly the ſcreaming was repeated with more violence than ever.</p>
               <p>He and his companion now threw themſelves with ſuch force againſt the door, as to burſt it open.

               <head>A proſecution of the diſcovery mentioned in the laſt chapter.</head>
               <p>"I HAVE been a wicked woman— May God and this lady forgive me! But Heaven is my witneſs, that I was thus far on my way to confeſs all to your honor, (turning to Sir Thomas Sindal) that I might have peace in my mind before I died.</p>
               <p>"You well remember, Sir, that this young lady's mother was delivered of her at the houſe of one of your tenants where a Mr. Camplin (I think that was his name) brought her for that purpoſe. I was intruſted with the charge of her as her nurſe, along with ſome trinkets, ſuch as young children are in uſe to have, and a conſiderable ſum of money to provide any other neceſſaries ſhe ſhould want.</p>
               <p>At that very time I had been drawn in to aſſociate with a band of pilfering vagrants, whoſe ſtolen goods I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cived into my houſe, and helped to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:030728_0059_0FE8CAC6C6DFDF58"/>"Fearing therefore that I might one day be brought to an account for my paſt offences, if I remained where I was, and having at the ſame time the temptation of ſuch a booty before me, I formed a ſcheme for making off with the money and trinkets I had got from Mr. Camplin; it was, to make things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as if my charge and I had been loſt in croſſing the river, which then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be in flood. For that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I daubed my own cloak and the infant's wrapper with mud and ſleech, and left them cloſe to the overflow of the ſtream, a little below the common ford.</p>
               <p>"With ſhame I confeſs it, I was more than once tempted to drown the child, that ſhe might not be a burden to me in my flight; but ſhe looked ſo innocent and ſweet, while ſhe claſped my fingers in her little hand, that I had not the heart to execute my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>"Having endeavored in this manner to account for my diſappearing, ſo as to prevent all farther inquiry, I joined a party of thoſe wretches whoſe aſſociate I had ſome time been, and left that part
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030728_0060_0FE8CAC85ACB38F0"/>
of the country altogether. By their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance too, I was put on a method of diſguiſing my face ſo much, that had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my acquaintance met me, of which there was very little chance, it would have been ſcarce poſſible for them to recollect it. My booty was put into the common ſtock, and the child was found uſeful to raiſe compaſſion when we went a begging, which was one part of our occupation.</p>
               <p>"After I had continued in this ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the beſt part of a year, during which time we met with various turns of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, a ſcheme was formed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of us (for ſeveral of my companions had been baniſhed, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to hard labor in the interval) to break into the houſe of a wealths far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who, we underſtood, had a few days before received a large ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on a bargain for the leaſe of an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, which the proprietor had redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>"Our project was executed with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; but a quarrel ariſing about the diſtribution of the ſpoil, one of the gang deſerted, and informed a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring juſtice of the whole tranſaction,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030728_0061_0FE8CAD08AAC21C8"/>
and the places of our retreat. I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be a fortune-telling in this gentleman's houſe, when his informer came to make the diſcovery; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſeted with one of the maid ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, overheard him inquiring for the juſtice, and deſiring to have ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with him in private I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſuſpected his deſign, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing got out of the houſe, eluded pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit by my knowledge in the bye paths and private roads of the country.</p>
               <p>"It immediately occured to me to diſburden myſelf of the child<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſhe not only retarded my flight, but was a mark by which I might be diſcovered. But, abandoned as I had then become, I found myſelf attached to the child by that ſort of affection which women conceive for the infants they ſuckle. I would not, therefore, expoſe the child in any of thoſe unfrequented places through which I paſſed in my flight, where her death muſt have been the certain conſequence, and two or three times, when I would have dropped her at ſome farmer's door, I was prevented by the fear of diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

               <p>"I ſaw you make your ſervant pick up the child, and place her on the fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before him.

               <p>"But being ſometime after appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended on ſuſpicion, and not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give a good account of myſelf, I

was advertiſed in the papers and diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to be an accomplice in the robbery I have mentioned, for which ſome of the gang had been already condemned and executed.</p>
               <p>I was tried for the crime and caſt for tranſportation. Before I was put on board the ſhip that was to carry me and ſeveral others abroad, I wrote a few lines to your honor, acquainting you of the circumſtances of my behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you daughter; but this I ſuppoſe, as it was entruſted to the boy that uſed to go on errands for the priſoners, you never received. Not long ago I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from tranſportation, and betook myſelf to my old courſe of life again, but I happened to be ſeized with the ſmall pox, that raged in a village I was paſſing through, and partly from the violence of the diſtemper, partly from want of proper attendance in the firſt ſtages of it, was brought ſo low, that the phyſician whoſe humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had induced him to attend upon me, utterly deſpaired of my recovery. And I found that the terrors of death on a ſick bed, had more effect on my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030728_0064_0FE8CBF664363F98"/>
than all the hardſhips I had heretofore undergone.</p>
               <p>Under theſe impreſſions I began to look back with the keeneſt remorſe on a life ſo ſpent as mine had been. It pleaſed God, however, that I ſhould recover, and have ſince endeavored to make ſome reparation for my paſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, by my penitence.</p>
               <p>"Among other things, I often reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on what I had done with regard to the child; and being ſome days ago ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally near Sindal park, I went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and tried to learn ſomething of what had befallen her.</p>
               <p>"I underſtood, from ſome of the neighbors, that a young lady had been brought up from her infancy with her aunt, and was ſaid to be the daughter of a friend of yours, who had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her to your care at his death. But upon enquiring into the time of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to your houſe, I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that ſhe muſt be the ſame I had conjectured, imputing the ſtory of her being another's, to your deſire of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing that ſhe was yours, which I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined you had learned from the letter I wrote before my tranſportation; till

               <p>On hearing this I was confounded, and did not know what to think; but, when I began to fear that my letter had never reached you, I trembled at the thought of what my wickedneſs may occaſion, and could have no eaſe in my mind till I ſhould ſet off for Bilſwood to confeſs the whole affair to your honor.</p>
               <p>"I was to-night overtaken by the ſtorm near this houſe, and prevailed on the landlady, though it ſeemed much againſt her inclination, to permit me to take up my quarters here.</p>
               <p>"About half an hour ago I was wak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſhrieks of ſome perſon in diſtreſs, and upon aſking the landlady, who lay in the ſame room, what was the matter, ſhe bid me be quiet and ſay nothing; for it was only a worthy gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of her acquaintance, who had overtaken a young girl, a foundling, he had bred up, that had ſtolen a ſum of money from his houſe, and ran away
