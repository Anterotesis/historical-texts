            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>THIS day his Majesty came to the House of Peers, and being in his royal robes seated on the throne with the usual solemnity, Sir Francis Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux, Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, was sent with a Message from his Majesty to the House of Commons, commanding their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in the House of Peers. The Commons being come thither accordingly, his Majesty was pleased to give his royal assent to</p>
                        <p>An ACT to REPEAL an Act made in the last Session of Parliament, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, an Act for granting and applying certain Stamp-Duties and other Duties in the British Colonies and Plantations in America, towards further defraying the expences of defending, protecting and securing the same, and for amending such parts of the several Acts of Parliament relating to the trade and revenues of the said Colonies and Plantations, as direct the manner of determining and recovering the penalties and forfeitures therein mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Also ten public bills, and seventeen private ones.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday there was a meeting of the principal Merchants concerned in the American trade, at the King's Arms tavern in Cornhill, to consider of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to his Majesty on the beneficial Repeal of the late Stamp-Act.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday morning about eleven o'clock a great number of North American Merchants went in their coaches from the King's Arms tavern in Cornhill to the House of Peers, to pay their duty to his Majesty, and to express their satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at his signing the Bill for Repealing the American Stamp-Act, there was upwards of fifty coaches in the procession.</p>
                        <p>Last night the said gentleman dispatched an express for Falmouth, with fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen copies of the Act for repealing the Stamp-Act, to be forwarded immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for New York.</p>
                        <p>Orders are given for several merchantmen in the river to proceed to sea im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on their respective voyages to North America, some of whom have been cleared out since the first of November last.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday messengers were dispatched to Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester, and all the great manufacturing towns in England, with an account of the final decision of an august assembly relating to the Stamp-Act.</p>
                        <p>When the KING went to the House of Peers to give the Royal Assent, there was such a vast Concourse of People, huzzaing, clapping Hands, &amp;c. that it was several Hours before His Majesty reached the House.</p>
                        <p>Immediately on His Majesty's Signing the Royal Assent to the Repeal of the Stamp-Act the Merchants trading to America, dispatched a Vessel which had been in waiting, to put into the first Port on the Continent with the Account.</p>
                        <p>There were the greatest Rejoicings possible in the City of London, by all Ranks of People, on the TOTAL Repeal of the Stamp-Act,—the Ships in the River displayed all their Colours, Illuminations and Bonfires in many Parts.—In short, the Rejoicings were as great as was ever known on any Occasion.</p>
                        <p>It is said the Acts of Trade relating to America would be taken under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and all Grievances removed. The Friends to America are very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and disposed to assist us to the utmost of their Ability.</p>
                        <p>Capt. Blake sailed the same Day with Capt. Coffin, and Capt. Shand a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night before him, both bound to this Port.</p>
