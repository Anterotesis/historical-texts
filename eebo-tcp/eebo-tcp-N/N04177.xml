            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM not such a Stranger to the captious Temper of the Age, in which I have liv'd so long, as not to expect the Censures of many in undertaking this Work myself, which every one (at first) will think ought to have been done (if done at all) by a more indifferent and impartial Hand. And I am very ready to submit to the Justice of their Censure so far, as to own, That the Pen and Patronage of others would have recommended it to the World with less Suspicion and Jealousy, and in a much better
<pb facs="unknown:005146_0003_1016B934091151D0"/>
Dress, and with far greater Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Liking than I can do. But in Plea for myself, I must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint such, that I have not been wanting in endeavouring to engage some of my Brethren in this Work, who were best acquainted with the <hi>Deceased</hi>: But the constant Burden of necessary Business upon some, the Modesty of others, and the great Distance of the rest (from the Place where the Providence of GOD has at present cast me) has denied me that Satisfaction, and the World that Priviledge.</p>
            <p>Since therefore it has fallen upon myself, I am chiefly concern'd, that the daily Work upon my own Hands, in such a Province as I am now acting in, and my own bodily Infirmities, and the disconsolate Frame of my own Spirit, have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb facs="unknown:005146_0004_1016B93597FF95D0"/>
me so incapable, and given me so little Leisure to peruse and digest the several Volumes of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscripts, out of which the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Collections should be made, to do Justice to her Memory.</p>
            <p>However, lest all the Memorables of her Life should be lost at once, I have ventured on all the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and published the few fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Fragments, which will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther serve as a Specimen, than give any full Account of her Life, in all the <hi>Duties, Trials, States,</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> of a Christian.</p>
            <p>Her <hi>Diary</hi> to me has been one of the most affecting Things I ever read; 'tis large and particular, and runs thro' almost the Course of <hi>thirty Years.</hi> It seems to me to be penn'd with great <hi>Sincerity, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> and <hi>Modesty,</hi> without any
<pb facs="unknown:005146_0005_1016B93728408120"/>
Art of <hi>Affectation</hi>; in a great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of <hi>Expression,</hi> without <hi>Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi>; and with such a Design to carry on the <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Power of Religion</hi> in her own Soul, and to record the Works of the Lord in her, and for her, to the Honour of the Riches of his own Grace, that whatever the Opinion of others might be concerning it, I shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reckon it amongst my grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Treasures.</p>
            <p>It has been one of the greatest Difficulties to me in the whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, to satisfy myself to leave out at least nine Parts in ten of what I tho't was truly valuable, and thereby to break the Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Dependance, and Consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the whole <hi>Diary</hi>; and yet I found it was absolutely necessary, or else the Volume must have
<pb facs="unknown:005146_0006_1016B93A477ADF08"/>
swell'd to such a Bigness, as to have been useless to many for whom it was especially design'd.</p>
            <p>I hope I have given no just Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to any to suspect my Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in what I have done; I have acted (if I mistake not myself) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a more governing Principle than that of <hi>Affection</hi>; and have not imposed any false or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Things upon the World, but can fully vindicate myself (in what I call Her's) by original Vouchers, which every one must allow (that calls not her own Sincerity in Question) to be authentick.</p>
            <p>Her LIFE, I am well assured, has been of great Service to many, and I would hope these few Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of it may be useful to more. And that such as have not been duly influenc'd by the <hi>Precepts</hi> of
<pb facs="unknown:005146_0007_1016BF24F9EE7990"/>
Religion, may be somewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by such an <hi>Exemplar</hi> to the Practice of it.</p>
            <p>It is not for one in my afflicted State, and especially upon a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject so grievous as this, to have any Regard to Stile or Language; it shall satisfy me, and I believe it will be more pleasing to others, that I chiefly write with her own Pen, having ever tho't her Phrase and Expression more decent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, and spiritual than my own.</p>

But being neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any <hi>Direction</hi> or <hi>Interdict</hi> concerning them, and thinking they are <hi>Valuable</hi> in <hi>themselves,</hi> and such as have a probable Tendency to a <hi>Common Good</hi>: I have ventured upon that which I never did before, to discover her thus far in her <hi>Religious Secresies,</hi> since it is with no other View, than to Magnify the Grace of GOD in her, to endear her Memory to Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivors, and to propagate Religion in the World, and more especially amongst <hi>our selves,</hi> for whom she had an uncommon Concern, and inviolable Affection, as almost every Page in her <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb facs="unknown:005146_0009_1016BF29640826D0"/>It is, doubtless, a very great Instance of divine Benignity and Good-will to Men, to Intrust us wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the Lives, and allow us to observe the Deaths, of some such Heavenly Creatures here on Earth, to teach us the Way of useful Living, and to Reconcile us the more at last to the Thoughts of Dying.</p>
            <p>It has often recommended Religion to me, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Beauty, Light, and Lustre of it, in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemish'd Lives of some Eminent Professors; and made the Thought even of Heaven it self more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, as it is the Place and Center, and Rest of such precious Souls, which we are hoping to enjoy with much greater Advantage than in an embodied State: Nay, and rendred the <hi>Grave</hi> itself and all the doleful Scenes of Mortality by far the less Formidable, since it is but our Dwelling a while with such Sacred Dust, in Obscurity and Silence, to rise together at last in Glory, to be for ever with the Lord.</p>
            <p>If the Example of a <hi>Relative</hi> will any wise provoke you to an Imitation, I hope it will be this; GOD was her Witness, and so am I, to the daily Travail of her Soul, for the Eternal Safety and Happiness of your's. How many <hi>Hours</hi> of Prayers, yea, and how many <hi>Days</hi> of <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> has she spent for her <hi>own Relations</hi> and <hi>mine,</hi> with <hi>equal Concern,</hi> as she has often said? How often can I find her in her <hi>Diary</hi> Praying and Weeping, and Wrestling with GOD for you, when you knew it not? And Recommending all your particular Cases, in all the Circumstances of them in a most Pathetical Manner to GOD? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Rejoycing, sometimes Mourning, but always Hoping and Waiting, even under Discouragements.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:005146_0010_1016BF32021D13A0"/>By this you will know what a <hi>Praying-Friend</hi> you have lost; but GOD forbid that <hi>her Prayers themselves</hi> should be lost too, I hope they will not, I hope they cannot.</p>
            <p>But give me leave, as a Friend to such that were dear to her, (and whither to me let GOD be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>) to entreat, and beseech, and adjure you all to Pray for <hi>yourselves,</hi> and for <hi>one another,</hi> as she did; and it may strengthen your Faith and Hope, that she has laid up such a Stock of Prayers for you, which have been long entrusted with the common Advocate.</p>
            <p>What can I say to my dear <hi>Relations</hi> more? But that as ever you would see her Face in Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, you would conscionably Remember now her Heavenly Instructions, her Faithful Reproofs, her Pathetical Warnings, and Compassionate Entreaties, for your own Good, and the Good of your Families? How often has she summoned your Consciences to an Account in Conversation with you? How often has she reminded you of your Solemn Dedications to GOD in Baptism? And the many Personal and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added Vows and Engagements you have been under since? How seriously has she warn'd you never to forsake the GOD of your Fathers, nor be asham'd of Religion in the Power, Purity, and Practice of it? How often has she reviv'd your Convictions, anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your Desires, encouraged your Beginnings with GOD, and caution'd against a deceitful World, the Company of such as are acted by the Devil, and are Agents for him; and especially of such, who have treacherously departed from GOD, and the Interests of Religion? This has been the Manner of her Life with you, her Generous Designs, and Religious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
<pb facs="unknown:005146_0011_1016BF339A1E14B8"/>
as I am sure you know, without any Recourse had to her own Papers.</p>
            <p>Now, if all her Prayers, and Tears, and Distresses for you, should signify nothing, but be lost at last, what a Wound will it be to the Hearts of surviving Relations! What a Brand of Infamy upon yourselves, to set at nought the Councils and Example of such a Friend! To degenerate from her Ancestors and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily! And in spight of all her Kindness and tenderest Bowels of Compassion towards you, to procure for your selves double Damnation.</p>
            <p>I ask no Pardon for my necessary Plainness and Freedom with you, which (GOD knows) proceeds form the Sincerity and Earnestness of my Affections. This is (very probably) the last Time I shall ever Address myself to any of you in this Public Manner; I am hastening Homewards, and should be glad to be call'd to my Father's House and Family above; to see the Face of my Lord Redeemer, and to join Consort with the Triumphant Choir, in their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Hallelujahs; and with her, amongst the rest, who was <hi>once</hi> my <hi>dearest Relation</hi> upon Earth (whom I doubt not to know in her unbodied State.)

               <head>CHAP. I. Of her Birth, Parentage, and Family.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>RS. ELIZABETH BURY, was born (about) the Second of <hi>March,</hi> 1644. at <hi>Clare</hi> in the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and was baptized the Twelfth.</p>
               <p>Her Father was Captain <hi>Adams Lawrence,</hi> of <hi>Lynton</hi> in <hi>Cambridgshire</hi>; a very graceful Person, of good Character, and great Integrity, who died <hi>June</hi> 13. 1648.</p>
               <p>Her Mother was Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Cutts,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Henry Cutts,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> of <hi>Clare,</hi> aforesaid; a Person learn'd in the Law, yet a great Peace-Maker amongst his Neighbours, and a zealous Promoter of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005146_0013_1016BF3AA35739D8"/>
of the Gospel, who died <hi>August</hi> 23. 1657. and his most eminently religious Consort after him, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> 5. 1667.</p>
               <p>These were the holy and happy Parents of Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Bury,</hi> who not only bare their <hi>earthly,</hi> but much more their <hi>heavenly Image.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her <hi>Mother</hi> was a Person well known to myself, and celebrated (I think) by most that knew her, for her great Sagacity and Penetration, as well as her great Piety and Zeal in Religion. She was an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently serious, heavenly and experienc'd Christian; an Ornament to her Family, a Blessing to her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the Delight of all her Friends: She lived long to adorn her Profession, to exemplify Religion, and to testify her Constancy and Resolution for the Interest of Christ. Her Conversation was pleasant and profitable: Her Expectations of a better Life were steady, and for many Years unshaken: Her Trials were many, and her Faith victorious. The constant Tenor, Course and Business of her Life, the solemn Transactions between God and her Soul, her sweet and near Communion with God, the full Acquaintance she had with herself, and the <hi>weekly</hi> solemn Remembrance she had of her <hi>Family</hi> in her Closet, would fully appear by her own Papers, which have been lately put into my Hands.</p>
               <p>By her first Husband <hi>(Lawrence)</hi> she had several Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anne,</hi> the first, who married Mr. <hi>Stavely,</hi> a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of <hi>London,</hi> and died six Weeks after, <hi>July</hi> 12. 1660. much lamented by her Friends, being a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of early Piety, ripe Judgment, and quick Parts and Capacity.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mary,</hi> the fourth, (who married Mr. <hi>John Mason</hi> of <hi>St. Ives, Huntingtonshire</hi>) a Person of true Piety, but harassed with various Exercises in different Scenes of Life. Se died <hi>June</hi> 29. 1717.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mother,</hi> about three Years after the Death of her Husband <hi>(Lawrence)</hi> was married again to the Reverend Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Bradshaw,</hi> B. D. and one of the senior Fellows of <hi>Trinity-College</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>; a Person (saith Dr. <hi>Calamy</hi>) eminently holy; a strict Observer of the Sabbath, and a laborious <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techist</hi> in his Family, to whom he constantly expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Scripture Morning and Evening; a <hi>Boanerges,</hi> well adapted to the People of <hi>Wivelingham,</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeshire,</hi> to whom he preached, whom he found very prophane and ignorant; but in a little Time had numerous Seals given to his Ministry among them: He left his Living of between three and four Hundred Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi> for the Ease and Safety of his Conscience, <hi>August</hi> 24. 1662.—He died <hi>October</hi> 16. 1690. in the seventy-first Year of his Age.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Him</hi> she had six Children:</p>
               <p>The first was <hi>Thomas,</hi> born <hi>March</hi> 26. 1652. who died <hi>April</hi> 15. following.</p>
               <p>The second was <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a serious, circumspect, judicious, and exemplary Christian; a common and compassionate Nurse to her Family and Friends, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bowed down with Fears and Jealousies, as to her spiritual State; a Person of great Knowledge, quick Parts, and tender Affections; frugal in her own Expences, that she might be charitable to others: Her <hi>own Papers</hi> (left in my Hands) shew her frequent and close Trials of her Heart and State, the Grounds of her Fears, her secret Sorrows, and good Hope

through Grace. She died of a painful <hi>Asthma,</hi> (in a single State) <hi>March</hi> 29. 1720.</p>
               <p>The third was <hi>Cathrine,</hi> who was married to the Reverend Mr. <hi>Thomas Salmon,</hi> Rector of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The fourth was <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> born <hi>August</hi> 24. 1656. who died <hi>September</hi> 5 following.</p>
               <p>The fifth was <hi>Dorathy,</hi> who married Mr. Serjeant <hi>Hook,</hi> sometimes Chief Justice of <hi>Wales</hi>: She was a Person of excellent Parts, great Conduct, eminent Piety, and most indefatigable Diligence in Instructing her Children in the Principles and Practice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; she made a very comfortable Exit, <hi>December</hi> the 8. 1693.</p>
               <p>The sixth and last was <hi>Anne,</hi> a Person much esteemed for her fineness of Parts, great Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and remarkable Piety: She died very much lamented, <hi>April</hi> 21. 1689.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mother</hi> herself died full of Grace and Years, <hi>October</hi> 7. 1697. Aged 78.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of her Natural Temper, Parts, and Genius.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Frankness, Ingenuity, and Pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of her <hi>Temper,</hi> was ordinarily known to all that conversed with her: She was never reserv'd, but when she thought her Company was disagreeable, or she could profit her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self more by her own Thoughts, than the Discourse of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:005146_0016_1016BF4325123430"/>She has often been taken notice of by others, as a Person of uncommon <hi>Parts,</hi> ready Thought, quick Apprehension, and proper Expression: She was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways very Inquisitive into the nature and reason of Things, and greatly obliged to any that would give her Information.</p>
               <p>In common Conversation, upon the <hi>Flirts</hi> or <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of others, she had often such sharp <hi>Turns</hi> and ready <hi>Replies,</hi> that were very surprizing; and yet mollify'd, at last, with such Art, and Air, and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, that they could very seldom be resented by any.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Writing</hi> of <hi>Letters,</hi> she had a great aptness and felicity of Expression; and was always thought so close and pertinent, and full to the purpose; and withal, so serious, spiritual, and pungent, that her Correspondence was greatly valued, by some of the brightest Minds, even in very distant Countries.</p>
               <p>Her <hi>Genius</hi> led her to the Study of <hi>almost</hi> every Thing, having such a natural <hi>Capacity,</hi> accompanied with a very faithful and retentive <hi>Memory</hi>; and taking such a continual <hi>Pleasure</hi> in <hi>Reading,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,</hi> she soon became Mistress (in some measure) of any thing she aim'd at.</p>
               <p>She often diverted herself with <hi>Philology, Philosophy, History,</hi> Ancient and Modern; sometimes with <hi>Musick,</hi> Vocal and Instrumental; sometimes with <hi>Heraldry, Globes,</hi> and <hi>Mathematicks</hi>; sometimes with learning the <hi>French</hi> Tongue (chiefly for Conversation with <hi>French</hi> Refugees, to whom she was an uncommon Benefactrix) but especially in perfecting herself in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which by long Application and Practice, she had rendred so familiar and easy to her, as frequently to quote the Original in common Conversation, when the true meaning of some particular Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture depended on it. Her very critical Remarks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005146_0017_1016BF46E244C420"/>
the Idioms and Peculiarities of that Language, which I have lately found amongst her Papers, have been very suprizing to me.</p>
               <p>Another study which she took much pleasure in, was <hi>Anatomy</hi> and <hi>Medicine,</hi> being led and prompted to it, partly by her own ill <hi>Health,</hi> and partly with a desire of being useful amongst her Neighbours: In this she improv'd so much, that many of the great Masters of the Faculty have been often startled, by her stating the most nice and difficult Cases, in such proper terms, which could h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But however she diverted herself with these, yet her constant Favourite and darling Study, was <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi>; especially the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> having from her very Childhood taken GOD'S <hi>Testimonies</hi> for the <hi>Men</hi> of her <hi>Counsel.</hi> And in the latter Part of her Life, devoted the most of her secret and leisure Hours to the Reading of Mr. <hi>Henry</hi>'s Annotations, which she would often say were the most plain, profitable, and pleasant she ever read, and the last Books (next to her Bible) she should ever part with: She ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the Author, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He always surpriz'd her with something new, and yet so natural and of such necessary Consequence, and unobserv'd by others, that she still read him with a fresh Gust and Pleasure— Next to the holy Scriptures, her chiefest delight was in reading <hi>practical Divinity</hi>; and the plainer and closer, and more penetrating any Author was, he was always the more acceptable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:005146_0018_1016BF4B8B4A59B0"/>But notwithstanding all her Knowledge, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual Attainments, in so many Professions, Faculties, kinds of Literature, spiritual and most concerning Truths of Religion, she would always confess and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail her own Ignorance, and that she knew little of what others did, or what she ought to have known, in any of those Matters.</p>
               <p>She would often regret, that so many <hi>Learned</hi> Men should be so uncharitable to her <hi>Sex,</hi> as to speak so little in their <hi>Mother-Tongue,</hi> and be so loath to assist their <hi>feebler Faculties,</hi> when they were any wise <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi> to an accurate Search into Things curious or profitable, as well as others; especially (as she often argued) since they would all so readily own, <hi>That Souls were not distinguished by Sexes.</hi> And therefore she thought it would have been an <hi>honourable Pity in them to have offered something in Condescention to their Capacities, rather than have propagated a despair of their Information to future Ages.</hi> And as to herself, she would always speak with the greatest Thankfulness, of her singular Obligations to her Father <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fulwood,</hi> and some <hi>others,</hi> for the ready and kind Assistance they gave her, in all her Applications to them, in order to the little Light and Knowledge she had attained in such Things.</p>

fear'd the Work was not done 'till then; and tho she had many suspicions and jealousies of herself, and state after that, yet upon the most serious Searches, she thought she had better ground of Hope than Fear.</p>
               <p>Her early beginning in Religion gave her many opportunities of glorifying GOD, of doing much good to others, and of gaining great experiences of the Grace, and Goodness, and Faithfulness of GOD to herself: And from the Benefit and Comfort she found in it herself, she always recommended it with much Seriousness, Affection, and Importunity to others. And (as it has been observ'd by many) there was something very <hi>peculiar</hi> in the <hi>disposition</hi> of her <hi>Mind,</hi> and <hi>turn of Thought,</hi> that adapted itself to the Capacity, Temper, Genius, and liking of most Children: Her first and principal attempt upon all such, was to bring them into <hi>Love</hi> with their <hi>Bibles,</hi> to learn them some short Sentences, and Prayers, and Pieces of pleasant History there, especially such as concerned Children: And then to insinuate herself into their Affections, and so to instruct and persuade, and oblige, to talk with them in their own Phrase and Dialect, that her Company was generally very acceptable and pleasant to all, and by the Grace of GOD made very profitable to many.</p>
               <p>Having set out thus early in the Way to <hi>Zion</hi> her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and allured and persuaded all she could, into the same Way, she held on her own Course, with great Steadiness, Resolution, and Pleasure; and proceeded from Strength to Strength, and for the Joy that was set before her, out-run many of her Fellow-Christians: She thought it not enough to begin her Work in the <hi>Morning,</hi> but she wrought hard at it all the <hi>Day</hi> long: She was always aware of the Vigilance of her Enemies, and that kept her upon her Watch: She would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

say, she had much to do, and what <hi>must</hi> be done, and knew not how short her Day would be, and therefore she had no Time to loiter: She often observ'd what was said of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that after he had met with GOD, he <hi>gathered up his Feet,</hi> and went on his Way; and thought that she herself ought to do likewise.</p>

               <p>I cannot be certain when she began this; but, as I conjecture, it must be about the 18th or 20th Year of her Age. After that, for betwixt twenty and thirty Years, she conceal'd her Accounts in <hi>Short Hand,</hi> which cannot be recovered by me, nor, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, by any other, because of many peculiar Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and Abbreviations of her own.

               <p>It would be almost impossible to enumerate the several <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> of which her <hi>Diary</hi> consisted.

Let her Mind be never so much muffled, the Exercise of Reason and Grace never so much interrupted, yet the Review of former Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was an extraordinary help to future Confidence. And this brought her again to her great Rock and Refuge, and Rest, 'till she recovered her usual Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness. And hence it was she so often recommended this Practice to others, that God might not lose the Glory, nor they themselves the Comfort of their Lives.</p>

them — And under the <hi>unkind Treatments</hi> of some, whom she had studied to oblige to the uttermost, and whose Interests she had often espoused, to the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Prejudice of her own, she shew'd a very exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary Carriage, by keeping the Possession of her own Mind, and kissing the Rod that lashed her, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Good to them for all their Evil. Indeed, these were Tryals that sat closest to her of most others; but by the Grace of God she was Conqueror over all, she ey'd God in all, and ever refer'd her Cause to God.</p>
               <p>As to this <hi>World,</hi> she was very thankful to God for the good Provision she had in it, but often protested she would never take this for her Portion, since God had offer'd Heaven and himself to her. The Cares, and Incumbrances, and Vexations, but more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Sinfulness of the World, had wholly wean'd her Affections from it, and caus'd many restless, and almost incessant Cries, to be deliver'd out of it. She was never elevated with its Smiles, unless in Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to God; and never dejected at its Frowns, unless she apprehended Sin as the Cause. Her Mind for the most part, was equal in every State, because she was always longing for her heavenly Country and Inheritance: How often would she wish, <hi>Oh! for those Realms of Light, and Love, and Purity!</hi>

                  <hi>Her Love to the Souls of others</hi> was manifest, by her Instructing, Examining, Reproving, and Advising them upon all occasions. There were very few could escape her (after some Acquaintance) but she would know whereabouts they were in Religion; and when she had convers'd with, she would earnestly pray for them in her Closet, and be greatly Thankful when she found any Impression made — She constantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail'd the Ignorance, Impiety, Profaneness, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, she saw or heard of, in any; but in a more

We often (by her <hi>Diary</hi>) find her praying, that her Visits may be made profitable to herself and others; that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Time might not be wasted by empty Chat, but that they may be helpers of each others Faith and Joy, and may have some comfortable Talk of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: She often bewai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Her Zeal for God</hi> was manifest, in promoting his Worship, and every probable method for publick Service; having the Interest of God and Religion much more at Heart, than any private or selfish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Her Charity to the Poor</hi> was known to many, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Houshold of Faith, whether to <hi>Natives</hi> or <hi>Foreigners</hi>: She spared no Pains, and grudg'd no Charges (in her Widow-State) to carry on her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, for the Relief of miserable <hi>Families,</hi> exil'd for Religion: For erecting of <hi>Charity-Schools,</hi> to Educate the Poor; for the Maintenance of <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Candidates</hi>; and for a Stock of <hi>Bibles</hi> and <hi>Practical

So many long and expensive Journies she had taken in promoting these charitable Designs amongst her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, that she had sometimes this pleasant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark upon herself, <hi>I have acted the part of a Beggar so long, that I am now almost really one myself</hi>— She very much approv'd of every one's <hi>devoting</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain part of their Estates to <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>charitable Uses</hi>; for then, says she, they will not grudge to give out of a Bag that is no longer their own. And as to such as had <hi>no Children,</hi> she thought it was reasonable they should appropriate a <hi>fourth Part</hi> of their Neat Profits (as well as she) to such necessary Purposes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Her Faith in Christ, and Dependance on God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> was the daily Exercise of her Soul: Her first and principal Care was to clear up her Interest in Christ, and the Promises, in which she was cautious and exact: She then prepared and digested a very choice <hi>Collection</hi> of <hi>Promises,</hi> suited to every State, Duty, Relation, Frame, Temptation, and Difficulty of Life. This was the Food of her Faith, always prepared, and from which she had constant Strength and Comfort: She grounded her Prayers upon these, took her Arrows out of God's own Quiver, pleaded with God from his Word, and thus wrestled with him in his own Strength, for herself and others, in every Ordinance, in every Business, in every Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance and Turn of Life. Her <hi>Diary</hi> shews what fast hold she took of God by his Covenant-Promise; and how she kept her hold, sometimes hoping even against Hope, 'till she had baffled Temptation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Corruption, and surmounted all her Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Reaches of her Faith after Christ, her So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Dedications of herself to him, and steady Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency of Soul upon him, as her only Rock and Refuge, were such as did not appear in common

               <p>She always began her <hi>Day</hi> with God, by consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her first and freshest Thoughts to him, that she might guard against Vanity and Temptation, and worldly Discomposures, and keep her Heart in Tune for the following Duties of the Day.</p>

often urging on herself the words of the Psalmist, <hi>My Voice shalt thou hear in the Morning, in the Morning will I direct my Prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Reading, Singing, and Prayer in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was over, she constantly withdrew again to her Closet, and ordinarily spent most of her Morning there: She first <hi>lighted</hi> her <hi>Lamp</hi> (as she express'd it) by <hi>Reading the holy Scriptures,</hi> for the most part with Mr. <hi>Henry</hi>'s Annotations; diligently compared pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Texts, and took a great Pleasure in <hi>Synchroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi> the History of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and reducing Things to their Place and Time: She then <hi>pour'd</hi> out her Soul to God in Prayer, with constant regard to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Christ, would often bitterly bewail the wanderings of her Heart in that Duty, and plead Covenant-Grace and Faithfulness, and so finish her Morning Work with some Hymn of Praise, and giving herself an Account of all in her <hi>Diary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Through the <hi>rest of the Day,</hi> she walked with God, and carefully observ'd her goings; avoiding the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of Sin, watch'd over her Heart, and guarded her Lips; accustom'd herself to holy Conference with others; was frequently lifting up her Heart to God in ejaculatory Prayers or Praises, upon any Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence. When at any Time she had been surprized by Sin, she presently reflected, confess'd, repented, and had fresh recourse to the Blood of Christ, and solemnly engag'd to God for greater Circumspection for the future.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Evening</hi> (as early as she could) she call'd herself to an Account for all that had pass'd in the Day, and again stated the Account in her <hi>Diary</hi>: Having opened her Heart to God, and committed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and her All to him, and sung to his Praise, she then chearfully join'd in Family-Worship.</p>

               <p>She often <hi>visited the Sick,</hi> and relieved the <hi>Poor,</hi> and bless'd God that she was in Circumstances to <hi>give</hi> rather than to <hi>receive.</hi> And when (in her Widow-State) she had sometimes given to the last <hi>Penny,</hi> (thro' the ill Payments of Tenants) she often observes that speedy Supplies were sent in a very unexpected Manner, <hi>As if giving to the Poor were the readiest way to bring in her Debts.</hi>

               <p>Of all Company, there was none more offensive, or grievious to her, than <hi>Tale-Bearers</hi> and <hi>Tatlers</hi>: She could not forbear reproving them, and often frown'd them out of her House: She had Business enough (she would say) of her own, and therefore did not desire to intermeddle with her Neighbours: She durst not defame others, or take up an evil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port against them, or countenance those that did:

               <p>Her first <hi>Marriage</hi> was to <hi>Griffith Lloyd,</hi>

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005146_0033_1016BF7AFB8DB658"/>
Answers to both? What her Yearly Remarks were upon this Day, is a Pleasure to me to find in her <hi>Diary,</hi> but does not concern others.</p>
               <p>As to her Relative Duties, she made great Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of them, and was very Exemplary in them.</p>
               <p>It was not possible (I think) there should be a more Observant, Tender, Indulgent, and Compassionate <hi>Wife</hi> than she was: It was never in her Temper to desire any greater Authority than God had given her.</p>
               <p>I cannot, but with great Affection (and let others pardon me in it) read over her constant and too so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous Concern for me; and how many Hours and Days of Prayer by herself (and by her Procurement) with others, were observ'd upon my Account, for the Recovery of my Health, and Continuance and Success in my Ministry: To which, I am persuaded (under God) I owe my Life, and many Instances of Grace in the Course of my Preaching. It has griev'd me to think, how many weary Days, and waking Nights, and hazardous Journies, and anxious Thoughts, the ill State of my Health has caus'd her from Year to Year.</p>
               <p>Nor can I, without great thankfulness to God, reflect upon the many Comforts of our Lives, our mutual Endearments, and unbroken Affection to each other: The Peace and Pleasure we have had, without the Allay of any one <hi>Quarrel, Passion</hi> or <hi>Dispute,</hi> for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most twenty-three Years together, which, next to the Grace of God, was chiefly owning to her singular Prudence, and Patience, and the excellency of her natural and christian Temper.</p>
               <p>Nor must I forget, what others have never known 'till now, with what Meekness, and Humility, and Submission, in the most Obliging, as well as Inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Manner, she has sometimes hinted what she sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected amiss in my Conversation and Conduct: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005146_0034_1016BF7E461F2F38"/>
Infirmities, no doubt, she industriously covered; but, in Tenderness of Affection to me, she would never let any such Sin lie upon me, which she thought might be observ'd by others, or prove any Blemish to my Profession.</p>
               <p>In one thing she was apt to be <hi>smart</hi> upon me; and that was, for not dealing faithfully with her in the Slips I observ'd in her own Conversation; and would often say, she left that Guilt upon me, which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in her, and she not in herself: But I hope my Conscience can answer for me against that Charge.</p>
               <p>As a <hi>Mistress,</hi> she was very careful in the Choice of her Servants, where she could have Choice: Was always afraid of Strife and Contention in her Family, lest she should be ruffled in her own Spirit, and the common Interest of Religion obstructed by intestine Jarrs and Disaffection: She never took any into her Service, 'till she had solemnly pray'd to, and pleaded with God, and submitted herself to his Direction: Whenever she treated with any, she did not only acquaint them with the Business of their Place, but also with the Religious Orders of the Family, to which she had their explicite Consent: When once Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it was her first and constant Care to enquire into the State of their Souls, to instruct and catechize, to reprove and encourage; to warn them of the Snares and Dangers of their Age, and Place; and to enjoin them to take Time for Secret Prayer, reading the Scripture, Meditation, and Self-Examination—She always charg'd it as a Duty upon herself, to talk over every Sermon they heard together, especially on Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and to Inculcate that upon them, in a particular manner, in which she thought they were most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd: She sometimes took an Account of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

and apart, that such as could remember but little, might not be discouraged by those that could do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And that she might have a fairer opportunity of closer Application to their particular State, as she saw Occasion. By this Means, she became a Servant to her Servants, and took Pleasure in all her Pains with them, tho' oftentimes to extream Faintness. Her Servants themselves will own, what natural Care she took of them in Sickness, as well as Health. And her <hi>Diary</hi> will abundantly prove, how Incessantly she pray'd for them, and suited her Prayers to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Exigences of every State.

And melted into Tears for them, and lodging her Appeals with God, as to the Sincerity of her En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to have done them good; and rejoycing over others, that God had answered her Prayers, and bless'd her Instructions, and brought them under the Bonds of the Covenant, and planted them in Families and made them Blessings there. I cannot remember any that were ever brought under her Care, but had learn'd something of the Method of a Sermon, before they left her; and very many, whose Memories were improv'd so far, as to bring Home all the particular Heads of two Sermons in a Day, tho' many. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she inclin'd to part with a Servant, she always consulted God in it; would then take the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And such was the Success of these her Religious Methods, that I know not of any one Servant she ever had, but was, first or last, under some Awakenings of Conscience, and Spiritual Convictions, and seeming Resolutions for God and Religion, however they wore off afterward. It is common with some of them still, upon every

Occasion, to speak of their <hi>Mistress</hi>'s Care of them, and Prayers with them, when the Family was left with her, as in the necessary Absence of others, it often was.</p>
               <p>If we consider her, with respect to her other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, we shall find her a constant sharer with them in all their Joys and Sorrows: A more sympathizing Spirit is very rarely to be found; she never ceas'd to pray for them, as Parts of herself; was often Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their Sins and Afflictions: Rejoycing in the Piety of some, and thirsting after the Conversion and Return of others. When at a Distance from any, she had a peculiar <hi>Talent</hi> in Writing to them: And such was the Pertinency, <hi>Pathos,</hi> and Pungency of all her Letters, that every one valued, and was greatly pleas'd with them. When present with others, she was always feeling which way their Pulses beat; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuating herself into their Affections; instilling something proper into their Minds; observing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suading, warning, and directing, as she thought it necessary. She has an honourable Testimony in the Consciences (I believe) of all her Relations, who honour her Memory, and own her a Pattern of great Integrity, Piety, Ingenuity, and Faithfulness. Her Animadverting upon her Friends (in the manner she us'd to do it) was so far from offending, that it was oftentimes very pleasing to them; begat in them some aweful regard to her Person, and a true Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum in their own Lives.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all <hi>Orders</hi> of Men, she had the greatest Love for the Ministers of Christ: She coveted their Company, in order to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove by it, and was never better pleas'd than when her House and her Table were fill'd with them: She would diligently enquire of them in all her Difficulties, and as carefully observe all their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections: She honoured the Aged, Learned, and Grave, with a double Honour; was often griev'd for the Infirmities of others, but despised none for their Weakness, if she apprehended they were faithful to God and his Interest, and had been useful in their Places.</p>
               <p>She thought it her Duty to pray for Ministers above all Men, inasmuch as they are concern'd in the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of so many Souls. That this was her Practice, appears by her <hi>Diary,</hi> from one end to the other; and particularly, from one Remark she makes of a single Omission; <hi>I have heard a Sermon</hi> says she, <hi>to Day, but I forgot to pray for the Minister, and I sped accordingly</hi>: Which shews, that it had been her Custom to pray for every Minister before she heard him.</p>
               <p>She look'd upon God's Tabernacles as truly Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which she had often seen fill'd with his Glory, and where the Blessing had been commanded out of <hi>Zion</hi>: She constantly attended upon Ordinances, if not prevented by insuperable Difficulties, and would always be present at the Beginning of them: And would often blame the Remisness of many, and say,

Christian-Love to others; and therefore having begg'd of God to guide her Tongue, to move their Hearts, and bridle their Passions; she would, in great Compassion, in a proper Season, with much Plainness and Freedom, tell them of their Faults, and plead with them thereupon. The Younger, and her Inferiors, if the Case required it, were told of them with some Severity and Smartness; but others with much Gentleness, Meekness, and Modesty.

               <p>Yet she statedly join'd herself to <hi>Dissenters,</hi> and was never asham'd, or afraid to own or plead for them.</p>
               <p>It was not her <hi>Education</hi> that determin'd her in this Practice, but a faithful Regard to Scripture and Conscience, and uncorrupted Antiquity: She read, and consider'd, and fully weigh'd the Controversy; and after her most diligent and serious Searches for Truth, she concludes at last, <hi>I must be a Dissenter in Principle still, for ought I can see to the contrary: The Way I am in, so far as I am capable of judging, is that which comes nearest to the Scripture Rule, and by much the freest for my Conscience, and the Way wherein I have found most of God, and therefore the Way in which I must still walk: Far be it from me to Censure others, and be it as far from others to Censure me; they differ as much from me, as I do from them, and therefore it is but just that we should have equal Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any worldly Interest could have biass'd her Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Matter, she wanted not Temptations, when in a single State, from Persons of very unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish'd Characters and prosperous Circumstances, (Sir <hi>P.T.</hi> Sir <hi>F.M.</hi> and B—p <hi>S.</hi>) if she could have been easy in the Communion, of the <hi>Establish'd Church</hi>: But she chose rather to suffer Affliction with poor <hi>Dissenters,</hi> than to lose the Liberty and Peace of her own Conscience, for any Titles of Honour, or worldly Grandeur, which she look'd upon but as Toys and Bubbles, and therefore what should never Charm her out of her Profession.</p>
               <p>She saw many Clouds on the Dissenting Interest then, and shared in the Sufferings that befel it since: But was mov'd at nothing, unless it were at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steadiness of some that were dear to her, who forsook

               <p>She would often take Notice with what Scorn and Contempt, and Malignity, it was treated by some, and how shamefully discredited by others, that had seemingly embrac'd it: But nevertheless, was always fully persuaded, that God would Patronize that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest as his own, revive it out of its Bondage, and make it Honourable at last: That all the Prayers, and Tears, and Treasures, and Bonds, and Sufferings of its noble Confessors, should not be always forgot or unrewarded — She would often repeat the Words of the Prophet (to poor ejected Ministers) <hi>Tho' your Brethren that hated you have cast you out, and said, Let the Lord be glorified, yet he shall appear to your Joy, and they shall be ashamed.</hi>

                  <hi>secret Prayer,</hi> to bespeak the divine Presence and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance thro' the Day; then Read and Sung, as she had Time, before Family-Worship: When that was over, she retir'd again to Read, and Sing, and Pray, and had a constant Remembrance of the Minister, for Assistance and Success amongst the Hearers—</p>
               <p>As she was early up on Sabbaths, so she was always early out, and her whole Family with her, not so much regarding the <hi>Dressing</hi> of her own <hi>Dinner</hi> as the Advantage of her Servants Souls. When Publick Ordinances were over, she always withdrew for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation; then examin'd her Servants, and inculcated upon them what they had heard: Then pray'd in her Closet, before Family-Worship; and after that fill'd up the spaces of the Evening with spiritual and edifying Discourses.</p>
               <p>She was never more pleas'd in any Ordinance, than in <hi>Singing,</hi> having a natural Love to <hi>Musick,</hi> and a good Understanding and Skill in it. But yet a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of Voices could not satisfy her, without an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and Harmony of Heart with what was Sung. And hence was it, that we find her in her <hi>Diary</hi> this smart Remark upon herself, <hi>That in such a Place I was so charm'd with the Novelty and Sweetness of the Tune, that I had sung several Lines, before my Heart was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in what I did.</hi>

               <p>Nor durst she ever rush upon that sacred Ordinance without serious and solemn Preparation for it: She carefully examined and proved her Graces, her Faith, Love, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and could not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied only with former Tryals: She search'd, and

made diligent Search into her Heart and Life, to find out her Sins, in order to confess and bewail them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in secret. For this purpose, she read over the <hi>Commandments,</hi> and some Expositor upon them, that she might better know the Duties required, and the Sins forbidden in each, and the several Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them: She then read over her <hi>Diary,</hi> and more especially reflected upon the Sins she had been guilty of since the last Sacrament, that she might watch and pray, and guard against them for the future.</p>
               <p>When she had prepar'd herself thus, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to excite her Graces for proper Exercises, she durst never trust to her own Preparations, but only on the Strength, &amp; Merits, &amp; Mediation of Jesus Christ, for Acceptance and Success. In his Strength she was strong, and went forth with longing Expectations of much Grace and Consolation in that Banquet of Love, and seldom fail'd of what she had pray'd and hoped for.</p>
               <p>She then attended the Ordinance, in an humble Sense of her own Vileness, with an awful Regard to the Majesty of God, and great Fear and Care, lest any worldly Trifle should carry off her Heart from its proper Work: Her Faith fix'd upon Christ, as the proper Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that every Sin, and Folly, and Instance of her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from God, was perfectly known to him: And every penitent Confession, Tear, and Groan, was in the Sight, and under the Hearing of an <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresent</hi> God: And every Prayer and Purpose, and Vow, and solemn Obligation made, and renew'd, and ratified there, was sacred and awful, as under the Eye and Notice of an <hi>All-seeing</hi> and <hi>Heart-searching</hi> God. And this she often found had greatly restrain'd her from Sin, and excited her to Duty, and dispos'd her for comfortable Communion with God, and kept her Heart from <hi>Trifling</hi> in her Closet.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the great Work of her Life to get ready for <hi>Death</hi>: She began it early, and went on with it daily, and with great Success: She often reflected upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages of her Life, and very penitently bewail'd the Sins of her Childhood and Youth, as well as of her riper Years, to the last; and could never be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd 'till God spoke Peace and Pardon to her Soul, in the Blood of Christ.</p>
               <p>It was in her Youth (I think about the 20th Year of her Age) that God gave her the sure Pledges of his Love, and clear Evidences for Eternal Life: And for <hi>fifty-six</hi> Years after, to the Day of her Death, she liv'd in comfortable Communion with God, and joyful
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005146_0050_1016BFB16CC9F528"/>
Expectation of the promised Inheritance: She care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully laid her Foundation at first, in God's Covenant with Christ, and with Sinners in him, and her own hearty Consent to that Covenant; and then built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God's Promises, Christ's Righteousness, Merits, and Mediation: And would often say, <hi>Tho' it should sometimes Rain in at the Roof, she must not therefore pluck up the Foundation</hi>; or suspect her Safety from every Shock or Flaw, or Failure in the Course of her Life and Actions.</p>
               <p>She did not only <hi>believe,</hi> but <hi>knew</hi> in whom she believe, and to whom she had committed herself, and her <hi>eternal All,</hi> and with the greatest Satisfaction and Assurance left them there.</p>
               <p>She was always complaing of a <hi>corrupt Nature,</hi> and many times of an evil Frame of Heart, and Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from God in Times of Duty, but still she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored her Soul on Christ, and kept hold on God's Covenant, and her hope was steadfast even to the end.</p>
               <p>She was often taken into God's Banquetting House, where she had the Displays of his Banner of Love. What special Remarks has she in her <hi>Diary</hi> upon <hi>some Days!</hi> and upon <hi>some Hours,</hi> as giving her greater Pleasure than all the rest, — <hi>O joyful Morning never to be forgot! — Bless'd Day of God, a Day of Heaven to my Soul! — This Day in God's Court, was better than a Thousand!— O how the Face of the dear Redeemer shone on his unworthy Dust in that Ordinance! O the Fulness of Joy, and ravishing Consolation of the Spirit of God this Morning in my Closet!—Was ever such Grace as this? What shall I render to the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She liv'd long at the Gate of Heaven, and knew where she was; and therefore no wonder she so earnestly desired to enter in: How often would she say, <hi>The blessed Hour will come!— How fain would I

enter into the Heavenly Courts?— When shall I see God? — O how I long to get out of the Tents of</hi> Kedar, <hi>and to be at Rest! — Come Lord Jesus! come quickly! I love my Relations on Earth, yea, I love them dearly; but I cannot but love my God and Saviour, and love them better: Oh! for that Life of Purity! and Love! and Joy! where every thing will be as I would have it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR some of the last Years of her Life, she found herself in a declining State, and was always waiting for her Dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: The Clearness of her Thought, Vigour of Mind, and Strength of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, held to the last; but as she was often loaded with bodily Infirmities, and had many wearisom Nights and Days appointed her, which still made her the more desirous of her eternal Rest.</p>
               <p>While we were both afflicted together, the one with <hi>Nephritick,</hi> the other with <hi>Hysterick</hi> Pains, it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised by Physicians, that the one should make use of <hi>Bristol Waters,</hi> the other of <hi>Bath,</hi> which were tho't the properest Remedies in both dangerous Cases. In pursuance of these Advices, in <hi>Autumn,</hi> 1719. we set out for <hi>Bath,</hi> and spent the Season with good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess: At which juncture of Time, just as we were leaving <hi>Bath,</hi> I was much surpriz'd with very unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Overtures from a Congregation in <hi>Bristol,</hi> to succeed in the Pastoral Charge, upon the Death of their late Minister. How improbable soever my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance

with this Call seem'd to me at first, by reason of some peculiar Circumstances that perplex'd it, yet I durst not dismiss it without some Thought: And the Call being still urg'd, and the State of my Health growing worse, and threatning me in a little Time with a total Disability for further Service in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Station, I resolv'd to refer myself entirely to the Conduct of Providence, and the Choice that God should make for me. And by much Prayer, and careful Observation thereupon, we both apprehended it our Duty, to make a Tryal of the Waters there for six Months, and then to be at our Liberty to return, if we thought fit. Upon this Concession we set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for <hi>Bristol,</hi> on the Fourth of <hi>April</hi> following, and arriv'd there the Eighth. And to the third of <hi>May</hi> we both of us enjoy'd a very comfortable Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Health, and were purposing in a few Days for <hi>Bath,</hi> though she often opposed it, alledging, that she found no need of it, having never been better for Seven Years past, then she had been since she came to <hi>Bristol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Providence of God soon alter'd the Scene, and hung our Harps upon the Willows. On the same third Day of <hi>May,</hi> as we had just entered into a Friend's House, where we were to Dine, she was immediately struck with an exquisite Pain in one Ear, which presently caus'd such a Deafness, as to render her unsociable; upon which, she desired to withdraw and went Home. Her Deafness continuing, a <hi>Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick-Fever</hi> soon follow'd, and after that a <hi>Lethargy,</hi> which depriv'd us, in part, of what Heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation we promis'd ourselves from her upon her Death-Bed.</p>
               <p>In former Illnesses, when she herself, and every one else thought her under the Sentence of Death, she was always so far above the fear of it, (tho' naturally
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005146_0053_1016BFB774CDE608"/>
of a very timorous Spirit) that she triumph'd over it, and sang,
<q>O Death! where is thy Sting? O Grave where is thy Victory? Thanks be to God, who giveth me the Victory, thro' our Lord Jesus Christ—I am fighting, <hi>saith she,</hi> under the great Captain of my Salvation, and can bid Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to all the Powers of Hell, and boldly encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Satan in his own Kingdom—I am now in the dark Valley, but I see Light at the end of it, and the Gate of Heaven stands open; O let me go into endless Love, and live that sinless Life: When Lord! shall I come to thee? Almost gone and yet I cannot go—O, my dear Friends! why so Cruel! What should I live any longer for? My Work is done, and why would you not have me go to Rest? Give me up, I entreat you, to God, and do it chearfully? My constant Prayer has been, to be always waiting and hoping, and this is my present Frame—It is an abundant An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to all your Prayers for me, that I have Peace, and Hope, and Comfort, without any doubt, or fear, or any suspicious thought of my Salvation— I am sure I have not flattered myself in the Tryal of my State, nor been superficial in it, and am fully persuaded that God will not deceive me— I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine. It is but one Push, and better now if God sees fit, or else I shall have all this to do again— Father! into thy Hands let me commend my Spirit— With what Pleasure would she feel her faultering Pulle, and say, When wilt thou b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<q>We have need of Patience,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005146_0054_1016BFBDA9DB2DF0"/>
that after we have done the Will of God, we might inherit the Promises.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In her last Illness she had the same stedfast Faith and strong Consolations as before, but a more difficult Passage than was expected: We thought, by her <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Groans</hi> for some Days together, that her Pains had been very exquisite; but when it was ask'd her, she ordinarily answer'd, <hi>I feel but little Pain, only am Restless.</hi> Her cold and excessive <hi>Sweats</hi> continued for many Hours together, and were not more <hi>profuse</hi> in themselves, than <hi>affecting</hi> to others.</p>
               <p>Tho' the Nature of her Distemper forbad her to speak much, yet what she spoke was always <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi>; Her Mind was not only calm and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, but every placid and chearful, as oft as she awaked. <hi>O my God,</hi> says she, <hi>I wait for thy Salvation — This Day I hope to be with Christ in Paradise— The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God are all yea and Amen in Christ Jesus; and here my Faith lays hold, and here it keeps it's hold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the eleventh of <hi>May</hi> she pray's us, with much entreaty, to detain her no longer by our Prayers, but resign up her Soul to God, which we did with as much earnestness as ever we had ask'd her Life before: Such are God's Ways to wean us from our dearest Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this World.</p>
               <p>About ten a Clock that Night, the poor <hi>Prisoner</hi> was releas'd from all her Bonds, and obtain'd a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Freedom: Her Heaven-born Soul (with its mighty Guard) took Wing for the Realms of Light; has heard its <hi>Euge,</hi> and receiv'd its Crown, and is for ever safely lodg'd in the Bosom of its dear Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>She died without any Regret, unless it was that she had liv'd so long; and has left a <hi>Name</hi> behind her (more precious than that of Sons and Daughters) to the Honour of her Sex, Relation, and Profession.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:005146_0055_1016BFC0F80D7CC0"/>She had often made it her Prayer to God, <hi>That she might come Honourably off in her last Encounter</hi>; that neither Religion might be discredited, or her Friends discouraged by any thing that should then be observ'd in her. And as God had abundantly answered so many of her Prayers before, so he very graciously answered her in this; for such were the free and lively Exercises of her <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> that they wholly triumph'd over all her <hi>Fears,</hi> and carried her with full Sail to Glory: And to the great Comfort of her surviving Friends, she left this World at la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>1690. <hi>Sept.</hi> 27.] <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I was <hi>Nine</hi> or <hi>Ten</hi> Years old, I first began the Work of <hi>Self-Examination,</hi> and <hi>begg'd</hi> the All-searching God to try and discover me to myself: And I think, I may date my <hi>Conversion</hi> about that Time.</p>
               <p>I have kept an Account of the Tryals of my self since 1670. And tho' my undutiful, ungrateful
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:005146_0057_1016BFC83819E488"/>
Returns have fill'd each Examination with just and bitter Complaints, yet upon twenty Years review, to the Glory of free Grace, I take it the Case has stood thus with me.</p>
               <p>My Judgment has esteem'd God, even his Holiness, the most desirable Good; and I would be a Partaker of his Holiness, whatever it cost me; and have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally been willing of, and thankful for the smartest Discipline, in hope of that desir'd Effect, and still would be more holy, tho' by Sickness, Pain, or any other Affliction; having always esteem'd Sin the greatest Evil, and now for many Years my bitterest Affliction, tho' in some Hurries, have not felt the most sensible Mournings for it.</p>
               <p>As I have chosen God for my Portion, so I stand by my Choice, and rejoyce in it above all the World; and thro' his Grace assisting, resolve never to forsake him, tho' I die for it (which I shall never do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extraordinary Assistance, having no natural Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.) I have chosen the Way of God's Precepts, as the Means to this End, and have deliberately, entirely, rejoycingly, given myself to Jesus Christ, the Way, the Truth, and the Life; and prefer his Love to all the World: And by many sweet (tho' too short Experiences) have found it lifting my heart up above all earthly Enjoyments, and sometimes making it joyful under Smart, Pain, and Trouble; which has hinted the Power of his prevailing Love, and made me hope it will cast out Fear, if he calls me to Martyrdom.</p>
               <p>My Hope is in God, thro' Christ; and all I have I would part with, rather than his Love and my hoped Interest therein.</p>
               <p>My Desires are after him above Gold, Health, Friends, Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I long for fuller Communion with Father, Son, and Holy Spirit here, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted Communion of Heaven.</p>

               <p>My Love, saith with <hi>Austin,</hi>
                  <q>Let me see thee, O Light of my Eyes! Joy of my Spirit! Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of my Heart! Life of my Soul! great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light! sweet Comfort! my God! the whole Glory of my Soul! Desire of my Heart! let me embrace thee, heavenly Bridegroom! let me pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess thee!</q>
               </p>
               <p>My Sorrow and Anger are usually most intense against Sin, tho' too violent Torrents often spent on Sufferings.</p>
               <p>My Hands, Feet, Head, and Heart, follow not as I would; my Life is stained and blotted with daily Sins, yet God knows I loath them; with daily De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in Duties, yet have I a respect to all God's Commandments: O wretched Creature! Sin still dwells in me: I cannot do the things I would; but I would, upon any Terms, be rid of Sin: I sin daily but I sorrow for, and hate it daily, and fly to the Fountain opened, which alone can cleanse me.</p>
               <p>I forsake and renounce the Devil's Dominion; and as I have receiv'd the Lord Jesus Christ, so I watch and pray, and strive to walk after his Will, and holy Example.</p>
               <p>The World gets near and about me, and I am too ready to follow and serve it's Pleasures, and Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies; but it is more solid Joy to my Soul to say, <hi>That Christ is mine</hi>; than to be able to say, <hi>This Kingdom, this World, yea, all that I ever lov'd, were still mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My own Righteousness I abhor; the best, most perfect, most sincere Service I ever did, or hope do, gives me no Hope of Acceptance, but in and thro' Christ.</p>

                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:005146_0059_1016BFCD23E23BC8"/>O Lord, Jehovah, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, thou art my Portion; whatever this Flesh would have, Lord! let me be thine at any Rate; truly I am and would, and will be thy Servant, by Choice and Consent, whatever thou givest me, or whatever thou deniest me: Oh! how bountifully has God dealt with me, while he has lov'd me from Death to Life.</p>
               <p>Lord Jesus! thou art my Way unto the Father! my only Mediator! I have accepted thee to each and rule, as well as to save my guilty Soul; I cry as loud for purging, as for pacifying Grace: I am will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be kept from mine Iniquity; I except no Darl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thine Iron Mace; I ask no Mercy, nor would I shew it any.</p>
               <p>I approve and subscribe to all thy Precepts, as Holy, Just, and Good, as best for me, at all Times, and in all Conditions: Let my Heart be searched, and I will love the Word that doth it—I account thy Law my Liberty—Thou hast drawn, and I have run—Thou hast made it my Love, Delight and Study, and it is the sincere bent of my Life to keep thy Word: Oh! that I might keep it to the End!</p>
               <p>1692. <hi>August</hi> 29.] Examining my Heart by Mr. <hi>Allein</hi>'s Rules, I find many sad Defects in Duties; much distance from God, my Joy and Portion, and an Inclination to a vain, vexing, and polluting World; yet I cleave to Christ, my Righteousness, and my Soul rejoyces in God my Saviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sept.</hi> 3.] Setting close to the Duty of Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, my Heart was deeply affected with it's wandring from God, amazed and sad at the Inconstancy of my Love to God, which I take to be the Cause of my wandering Thoughts; I still mourn over it, adoring the Patience of God, and his infinite Mercy, in Christ, to such unstable and vile Dust; I abhor the Fountain and filthy Streams of my polluted Nature; I fly to the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:005146_0060_1016BFCF05636500"/>
Blood of sprinkling: Lord! shall I never be cleansed? How long shall vain Thoughts lodge within me? I will still wait at the Pool, where thou hast, and wilt wash me in thine own Blood; and if I cannot find less Sin, I will bless thee if I find more Grace, and wait, 'till by Death, thou presentest me spotless, who hast loved me, and already wash'd me in part.</p>
               <p>1693. <hi>March</hi> 3.] Comparing my Heart with God's Word, I have still good hope, thro' Grace, that Sin hath not Dominion there. Sad Strength and Prevalency— I confess, bemoan, abhor, and beg Cure of by any Method; yea, so vigorous are all the Lusts of my depraved Soul, I know not which to call (long together) my Master-Sin; what I most sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, I most hate, watch, resist, beg divine Aids a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, and rely on the Lord Redeemer for Strength to subdue: I acknowledge his Mercy, Power, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, Patience, to me unworthy Wretch, from my Birth to this Day; first sweetly overcoming my Will, by his invincible Power, and since bearing all my ungrateful Backslidings; preventing, aiding, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, conducting, chastening, recovering, and feeding me in all Places, Relations, and Conditions.</p>
               <p>1695. <hi>July</hi> 23.] I examined my Heart, and found much Dross mix'd with its purest Gold; and the holy Spirit of Grace and Supplication helped me to confess and beg Pardon with some suitable Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and indited many Petitions for my self, Family, and Friends; all which I have left with my merciful Intercessor, in Faith and Hope of a gracious Answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid</hi> 27.] I examined and found much Folly and Unevenness in my Conversation, my Wanderings from God, great Unsteadiness in my Covenant; yet thro' free Grace, no allowed ill Behaviour towards my dearest Lord Redeemer: I abhor all the Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Dullness, and Frowardness of my Spirit, to my

               <p>1696. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1.] Reflecting on part of this Year's <hi>Diary,</hi> there appears the greatest divine Goodness and Bounty to the most unworthy and sinful Wretch: A multitude of gracious Answers to my poor Prayers, and great Appearances of God in publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; yet many afflictive Strokes, but follow'd with Support and Usefulness: So that my very Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses, in very Faithfulness, I have been and am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted— And now on the whole Year, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God has been faithful to his Covenant in all things, and I heartily renew my Covenant-Obligation to him, and beg Strength to walk more stedsafely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> 4.] Examining my Heart and Ways, I have good Evidences, thro' free Grace, that God is my Covenant-God in Christ, and has made good his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Promises to me, in convincing, converting, comforting, guiding, strengthening, and rejoycing my Soul in his Ways; and in healing Infirmities and Pains; conducting me, supplying my Wants, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting and keeping my Mind quiet under Troubles; sanctifying Corrections to wean me from this World, giving Victory over Corruption; removing a Thorn in the Flesh, for which I be sought him often, in Tears and sore Affliction; and so seasonable, as to evidence my sincere Hatred of Sin, before the Smart of his Rod taught me Wisdom, for which my Soul adores him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>August</hi> 4.] Oh! how much better than Life, or any thing in Life, is the Loving-Kindness of my God? So sweetly, so evidently, so abundantly manifested to my Soul, this Morning! Lord! how free, how full, how humble, and ingenuous my Confessions, when thy holy Spirit indites and assists poor hardened Dust? What a View of Sin can thy Remembrance give for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful

Rocks? What melting Shame and Sorrow? What Tears of Love? What Delight? What Pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after more Grace? What calm and joyful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescence in relucted Discipline? What chearful unreserved Resignation?

               <p>1697. <hi>March</hi> 20.] I fell upon the Search of my Heart before the Sacrament, with respect to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Effects of true Faith; and find, that I am glad of the Discovery, even of such Truths as most directly strike at my strongest Heart-Sins, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentest Appetites: I am glad of the Threats that powerfully work on me to reform me, as of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises that refresh me: I believe them all in <hi>Thesi</hi> and <hi>Hypothesi,</hi> and wish their Energy in cleansing, as well as comforting, so far as I can discern.</p>
               <p>I embrace the <hi>Promises</hi> with delight, and find thro' free Grace, a spiritual Taste and Relish in the Food of Life; such, as sometimes, quite weans me from the Love of the World, gives me great Peace of Conscience, Joy in the Holy Ghost, and Love to Christ's Appearing—I find good Hope thro' Grace, that I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who gave himself for unworthy me; for I do delight in his Word, above my appointed Food: It has been, in some Measure, of an Assimilating Nature; I hope I have attain'd to some, and pray and labour for more Growth in Universal uniform Obedience to all God's Commands— I depend on the perfect Righteousness of Christ, and must own from the Beams of that Sun of Righteousness, a gracious Illumination and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Inclination upon my Soul unto all Good— A tender Sympathy, for the most part, with the Church of God, even when my particular State inclines me

to a contrary Temper—A free use of spiritual Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, seeing the Light of God more perfectly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently than usual, hearing his Word with delight, tasting his Mercies with Comfort; I feel and mourn under the Wounds and Pressures of Sin; I love di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths, not so much because proportionable to my Desires, but because, conformable to God, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve in all Estates to rely on God's Mercy and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; I wholly renounce all Trust in myself, or any Concurrence of my own naturally in any good; I build not my Hopes or Fears on Man, or make them or myself the Rule or End of my Desires; I indulge no known Sin; I have no known Guile; I allow not the least Sin, or appearance of Evil; I hate the first Risings of it, and bitterly regret the least, the first, the most unavoidable Thought that Rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law.</p>

                  <hi>March</hi> 28.] Glorious Morning of this Day of the Son of Man: Lord! what is all this World to me? Thy darkest Paths appear light and pleasant to my Soul: Thy Will be done with all my Heart: All thy Ways are, and have been holy, just, good, and true: In very Faithfulness thou hast afflicted; in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest Bowels pity'd, spar'd, and born with thy pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish ungrateful Child; and yet say'st, <hi>Thou art mine, and I am thine</hi>; and hast fill'd my Soul with Joy, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration, Love, Praise, Resignation, Acquiescence, Dependance, Hope, Trust, above what I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I ever enjoy'd: O that present Experience may strengthen my Faith in future Combats. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>Nov.</hi> 15.] Having begg'd the Assistance of the holy Spirit, and examin'd my Heart as to divine Teachings, I find God has powerfully, plainly, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, affected my Heart; influenced the Means, my Mind, and Will thereby, in some good Measure sanctified my Heart, renew'd his Image, mortified Sin by hearty Conflict and Sorrow, rather than by Victory and Triumph: That Sin lives not an easy Life in my Soul, but is usually check'd in its Birth by the Holy Spirit, or follow'd with Shame and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when not early stifled; and I am restless 'till Pardon and Peace be evidenced—The Spirit of God I hope, is dwelling in my Heart, by some ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sympathy with Christ's Interest and Members; by Assistance to, in, and after Prayer; by some, tho' too little Heavenly-mindedness, and by practical Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience agreeable to the Word.</p>

<pb n="54" facs="unknown:005146_0065_1016BFE1DB98BE38"/>
Life, for more than thirty Years past, has been to approve myself unto God: I have search'd with Fears of Mistakes, and am willing to know the worst of myself, and thankful for the most searching Sermons and Books: I hate what Sins I find, and would be rid of them: My Heart begs Sanctification as frequently and earnestly, and is as desirous of it as of any Blessing of God's Covenant; and has mourned more under the delays of Answers of Prayer for this, than for any other Mercy I have sought. The inward, secret, and first Risings of Sin in my Heart, have been the most bitter Affliction of my Life: Nothing have I deprecated more than being plung'd into my own Filth; and been thankful for nothing more than Prevention or Recovery. Tho' I have mourned for the Sins of others, yet my greatest Hatred and Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has been for my own Sins, which Hatred has been follow'd with true Edeavours to mortify them; yet I am doubtful whether my Heart be so sensibly touch'd for God's Dishonour in Company, as my own: In my Obedience, I find an Uniformity, as to the Object: I have a respect to all God's Commands; and as to the Subject, my whole Soul and Body, so far as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd, moves the same Way: I trust on Covenant-Aids, and resolve to cleave to God in all Tryals: My Heart has been sway'd by God's Command, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond and without any other Argument: The little I can do, has been hearty, as to the Lord: When God enlarges my Heart, or uses me for any Service, my Soul hath been humbled—I can do no more, no better, yet thankful for any thing, and freely own all has been of his free Grace: That the bent of my Heart is for God, I conclude from my inward desire join'd with Love: This Inclination has been habitual, no sudden Pang: I have daily purposed and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd a Conscience void of Offence towards God,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:005146_0066_1016BFE36C7374A0"/>
and Man; still aiming at more Degrees of Grace, to walk more circumspectly: Yet much Weakness and Wanderings in Duties to God, Inclinations to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality towards Men: Not so sensibly touch'd with Sorrow as I ought, when in Company I hear the Name of God taken in vain, nor have I oft dared to reprove it, which makes me avoid Company, to the Censure of Morosness: Yet I do hate the Sin, even where I do love the Company: I humbly hope my hatred of Sin is of the whole kind, in its first Motions, least Degrees; as Sin against God, more than for it's Trouble and Danger: I delight to be nothing in my own Eyes, and love to be laid low before God: I have and do love God, when smitten in my nearest Comforts, or lust, and have bless'd God for every Twig of his Rods: I love the Person of Christ, as his Benefits, and all that bear his Image, tho' in nothing else lovely: I love his Service, even when I fail of Comfort in it, and prefer his Image on my Soul to all his Benefits— [<hi>Jan.</hi> 4.] I dare not pursue my Examination farther; my Head fail'd, my Body fainted, and I could pray but shortly with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; my wandering Heart, weak Head, and feeble Body, renders me very unable to pursue my Duty: Lord! strengthen, unite, and assist to better or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept feeble Attempts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feb.</hi> 7.] Upon the best Search I can make, if I were now at the awful Bar of God's Tribunal I must say, so far as I can judge of my Heart, it does hate all Sin as Sin: It is and loves to be humbled before God; it loves God for every Rebuke of its Lusts; it loves the Person of Christ in all his Offices, and every Soul that bears his Image, tho' in nothing else lovely; it would approve itself to God, when no Eye sees it; it chuses the Image of Christ more than all Comforts.</p>

                  <hi>March</hi> 24.] The good Spirit of God witnessed with my Spirit, to the marks of true Repentance; in hating Sin as Sin, forsaking Sin, and flying to Christ for Cleansing: Sorrow for Sin has been express'd by Tears, when Sense of pardoning Mercy hath frequently melted my Heart: It hath been more general, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and lasting, than for any Affliction; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude God has pardoned my Sin for the Glory of his Sovereign Will, Mercy, Riches of Grace, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Truth, and Power, and has chosen, redeemed, and will receive me to Glory hereafter.</p>
               <p>1703. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1.] In reviewing past Examinations, I have good hope that my State is safe; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring myself with Years past, and the Means and Mercies since enjoy'd, I suspect my growth in Grace.</p>
               <p>1704. <hi>Dec.</hi> 31.] A most unworthy, froward, weak, and unprofitable Servant, yet not cast out of God's Family, and Care, but receiv'd fresh Instances of his Truth and Faithfulness to his Covenant-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; aiding and strength'ning my Soul in what I depended on him for, pardoning my peevish Spirit, encouraging my Hopes of Life more abundantly: I confess my Ingratitude, Dulness, Unfruitfulness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der richest Mercies and Means of Grace, and begg'd Pardon, and Help to renew my Covenant in Christ's Strength, and more growth in Grace, and Meetness for Glory, of which I have some joyful Expectation that tunes my Heart to Praise.</p>
               <p>1705. <hi>Nov.</hi> 24.] Searching into the sinfulness of my Thoughts, I find great Vanity, Inconsistency, Unfixedness, to my great Shame and Loss, and get little Victory even now when freed from many vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cares, formerly unavoidable: My Passions sly, and strong, and peevish, disquieting my Spirit too oft on little Temptation—My Words too idle, careless, injurious, or not so profitable as they should be—</p>

                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:005146_0068_1016BFE8632F9950"/>My Spirit too slothful and dull. My Time little improv'd for God's Honour, my own or others good. My Mercies more us'd for self than God—My spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Seasons add little to my growth: I am short in all personal and relative Duties; my secret Duties seldom vigorous, or the Impression of publick, lasting I seem to languish and decay in my spiritual Vigour, ordinarily to my Shame and Grief: Lord! pardon, and strengthen the things that remain.</p>
               <p>1706. <hi>Feb.</hi> 21.] I heard a good Sermon on <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation</hi> with God, and have good hope, tho' Grace, all Hatred is ceas'd, and Friendship with God begun in my Soul: That God, who hath first lov'd me, hath circumcised my Heart to love him: I love all his Works, and hope he accepts mine, thro' Christ: I love his Children, and have receiv'd many Love Tokens from him, and do unfeignedly give myself to him: I bless the Lord for his transcendant Love, and beg, above all Blessings, the Evidences of it; and act Faith on Christ for maintaining Friendship with God: I renounce all contrary Friendships, and desire alway to please God, whatever I suffer for so doing.</p>

                  <hi>Octob.</hi> 25, 26.] I set closely to examine my State, and begg'd of God to discover whatever Mistake I might have been under in my former Tryals, which I review'd, and the sad Instance of—Still a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Apostate, did perplex my Mind; his Knowledge of the Law was great; his Examination seemingly serious, and with great Application of Mind; his cleaving to Christ seem'd hearty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I must try by Scripture, and have no reason to believe that will deceive me, and I beg of God my Heart may not deceive me: I have review'd the Tryals I have made, and cannot find I am mistaken — Mr. <hi>Vines</hi> distinguishes the true Christian from an Hypocrite

thus—<hi>His hatred to Sin, and liking to God arise from an inward Nature or Principle.</hi> Lord! my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence does not reproach me when I say, I hate the whole Species of Sin, and whatever appears so to me: I love the whole Law of God for it's Purity, and my Soul pants daily for more Conformity to it.—<hi>The inward Man of a Christian is made up of Christ.</hi> Lord! Thou knowest the little Knowledge of, and Faith in, and Love to, and Tastes of Christ, I have had, have made me hate and mourn for Sin, and love Christ, and I do fight against Sin in his Strength— I have felt the Teachings of God, and do love my adorable Lord Jesus, for himself— My Repentance and Sorrow for Sin is most pungent, when under the Power of Love—I desire Grace for Service, as well as Salvation; <hi>true Grace casts out Self-Love</hi>: It comes from and draws the Soul into Union and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Christ: Lord! I love my Soul and Body when they love and serve thee: I hate that either should dishonour thee: I am willing to deny myself any thing for thee; yet I fear too much Indulgence of Self, by Sloth, and Love of Ease—<hi>To love and seek God for himself is above the Power of all common Gifts</hi>: O Lord! thou hast made my Soul to love thee for thy glorious Excellencies and Perfections, as well as thy redeeming Love, tho' not always so distinctly as I would—From these and such like Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, upon the most diligent Search I can make, I dare not but conclude, I am a sincere Christian, and no Hypocrite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Decemb.</hi> 7.] On many Years Experience, I can discover no Guile in Covenanting with God from 1689 to this Day: I still willingly, freely, constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, rejoicingly renew the same Covenant, and depend on it for Grace and Strength to walk more evenly, constantly, and suitably to it: I bewail the frequent

Interruptions in my Communion with God, thro' my Sloth and Wandering; the frequent Foils, by hated indwelling Corruptions: I fly for Refuge to the Hope set before me; here will I cast my Anchor, Lord! let it secure my Rest, when Storms in Life or Death arise.</p>
               <p>1708. <hi>April</hi> 30.] I searched my Heart and Ways by reflecting on many Years past; and from all, have good Hope and Evidence still of my true Conversion to God, and can appeal my continued Resolution to be his ever since 1673.—</p>
               <p>1709. <hi>April</hi> 11.] My Head is so dull and torpid, I can do little at Heart-Examination; but so far as I can discern, I have, on most mature Deliberation, embraced Christ in all his Offices: I entirely yield up myself to his sanctifying and disposing Will, and bewail my short Performances, as my greatest Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and am willing to die for Cure: Lord! fit me for, and hasten me to eternal Purity and Glory.</p>

I will not take this for my Portion, I had rather lose them all than the Light of thy Countenance, so far I know my Heart—I do daily, thankfully, joyfully accept of and rely on the Lord Jesus Christ, as offered in the Gospel, to justify my poor, miserable, guilty Soul, that has nothing in it but Sin and Misery, and must perish for ever, if thou wilt not pity and save it; but hopes to cast it's Crown at thy Feet, and cry, <hi>Grace, Grace</hi>: Lord!

I still give myself to Thee, to thy Praise: Lord! thy Glory is my ultimate End: All I am, or have, or can do, is of the Lord, and from him; with Joy and Thankfulness I recognize thy Right, and yield up my self to the <hi>Sanctifying Power</hi> of the Spirit, consenting that thou shouldest cleanse my unholy Heart in what way thou pleasest, and write thy Law there, and make me Obedient: And to thy <hi>Disposing Will,</hi> as the Rule of my Patience, that thou shouldst subdue every murmuring Thought at any thing thou dost with me, or mine: Lord!

                  <hi>Sept.</hi> 22.] My Head was clouded, and much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispos'd for Self-Examination; yet in reviewing my Heart and Life since the last Sacrament, I find the Frailty of my own Resolution, soon after the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my Covenant; but since <hi>June</hi> 21. I have found my Redeemer's Strength sufficient for his weakest Children; his Pity, Pardon, and Patience to the most Unworthy: I long to feel the powerful Influences of thy Love, making it more natural to me to love my Brethren, tho' injurious, frail, ungrateful, as I have ever been to thee; to pity, forgive, and do good to Enemies, as thou hast done to me, while I was thy Enemy: Lord! slay all Enmities in my Soul, and help me to resist every angry Resentment faithfully in thy Strength: O holy Spirit of Love and Peace, rule in my Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Decemb.</hi> 31.] On review of the Year past, I must still witness to the Truth and Mercy of God, who has not turn'd away from doing me good: I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with Shame and Sorrow, the Pride, Passion, and Peevishness of my Spirit, under slight Temptations, against Convictions, penitent Confessions, Resolutions, Prayers, and Tears—Innumerable, vain, and sinful Thoughts, and Words, yet the Lord has spared me this Year also: Has restored my Hearing, continued my Sight, preserved my Limbs, provided abundantly

Food and Rayment, given me more Health than many of my Age, eas'd my Pains heal'd my Diseases, many a time, when I cried to him: But, Oh! the rich Grace and Mercy to my Soul, when almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with Sorrow, to find such Remainders of Sin in myself, and others, dear to God and me— Very sweet the Sabbaths, and all the Sacraments of this Year have been—Many gracious Answers of Prayers for myself and sick Friends—And now, Lord! I acknowledge the Sweetness of following thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, relying on thy Strength, depending on thy Word; the Pleasantness of thy Ways, only my slips in, or stepping out of thy Paths, have made all the Bitterness of this Year—Lord! enable me to keep the Resolution of the Year; to leave every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of my future Life and Death to God; to be watchful over my Words; to do to others as I would they should do to me—I acknowledge the Multitude, the Seasonableness, the Extensiveness of the National Mercies, in Answer to the Prayers of a poor Remnant, who cried to God by themselves, and obtain'd a double Defeat of the Enemies at <hi>Dumblain</hi> and <hi>Preston,</hi> while praying on the Lord's Day: But, Oh! how short our Returns of Praise and Duty.</p>
               <p>1718. <hi>June</hi> 14.] Very dull and drowsy all this Day: I have often covenanted to be the Lord's, with Soul and Spirit, Will and Affections, but yet how treacherous and unprofitable: I have renounced Sin, Self, this World, yet how oft overcome by them? I have taken Christ Jesus, the Lord, on his own Terms, to love, and obey, and serve him, but how short in all? I have given myself to God thro' Christ, to the sanctifying Operations of the Holy Spirit, to the commanding Power of his Law, and the Disposals of his Providence, and would be to him a Praise, yet how oft to him a Dishonour? Lord! I still resolve

in thy Strength; be Surety for thy weak, but will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Servant.</p>
               <p>1719. <hi>Jan.</hi> 8.] I search'd my Heart and Ways, and found I had been an ill Subject to my Lord and King, but would be better; yet upon farthest Search, I could not conclude I had been a Traitor to my dear Lord.</p>
               <p>1720. <hi>April</hi> 30.] In searching into myself; Lord! how many of the <hi>Seven</hi> and <hi>Seven</hi> Abominations are still in my Heart, even when they break not forth into Words or Actions! For these I loath myself, and daily cry for Pardon and Healing: Lord! encrease my Faith in thy Power and Compassion to cleanse my leprous Soul: For this it was I came first <hi>to,</hi> and still rely <hi>upon</hi> thee; and am this Day devoting myself afresh to God, my Portion, Redeemer, and Sanctifier.</p>

               <p>1693. <hi>Jan.</hi> 22.] Strong Consolation in Reading, sweet Influences of the Holy Spirit in Prayer: My Soul follow'd hard after God for a Blessing this Day: And he that taught me to pray, heard my Cry, and helped me against the Bands of Rovers, that had like to have lost my Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> 30.] How lovely, Lord! were thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles this Day! better than Life, or all desirable therein! Lord how sweetly hast thou made me to differ from myself in the Morning! Oh! that my Dulness might never return more!</p>

                  <hi>Sept.</hi> 10.] Oh! how gracious! how full! how sweet! the Answer of my poor languid defective Prayer, in abundant Assistance in Body and Spirit to Gospel-Heraulds, publishing freest Grace to vielest Dust; even the Holy Spirit of Grace, trying and evidencing to my Soul its first coming to Christ; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing and encouraging renewed Acts of Faith: If such Joy in the outer Court, what is Glory above!</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 14.] Lord! how sweet are the Returns of thy Favour, after dark Desertion! what can displease my Soul in all this Discipline, while thou encreasest and helpest me to act my Faith on thy Truth, Power, and Promise: Lord! while thou hast taught me by

thy Word, and helped me by thy Spirit to believe, how easy are the Difficulties; how light the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; how reasonable the dark Dispensations; how true thy Retributions; how clear the Misteries of the Gospel; how hopeful Death itself; and how certain the Promises that concern thy Church! all which have so puzzled and afflicted my Soul of late.</p>

                  <hi>Nov.</hi> 3.] I rested ill with fear of oversleeping, which gave little Advantage to the Duties of the Day; yet going forth in Dependance upon God, I found him present with his own Institutions to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>1696. <hi>May</hi> 31.] A joyful Morning! sweeter to me than all the Delights this World ever afforded: Sweet Sun-shine after Clouds and Tears: My Soul pleaded hard for a wandering Prodigal, and other young ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Decemb.</hi> 6.] Reflecting on my own Sins, and shortness in all the Duties of the Sabbath, I find Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Humiliation, especially in singing the Morning-Psalm, I was so intent on the Tune, that I had sung several Lines e'er my Heart went along with the Words.</p>
               <p>1697. <hi>April</hi> 4.] I awaked in sweet Sabbath Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, beyond the Power of any to give but the Lord of the Sabbath: Him I adore, on him, O my Soul! do thou ever depend: Whoever did, or can quiet, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, satisfy, rejoyce, and heal thee, as he hath done? Be this, <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> for ever thy Encouragement.</p>
               <p>1698. <hi>Octo.</hi> 9.] My Soul hath been filled with Hope, and Love, and Joy, and fain would have gone from my Lord's Table to the Mansion.</p>
               <p>1699. <hi>Jan.</hi> 15.] Sweet were the Displays of God's Power to his People, awful and terrible to his Enemies: Gracious was the Assistance to the Preacher; O let the God of Power fix the Arrows in the Hearts of his Enemies.</p>

               <p>1701. <hi>March</hi> 23.] My Heart was much drawn out in Love to the Laws of God, as holy, just and good: And my Soul rejoyces in the Government of my dear Redeemer, as much as in his other Benefits to me: I bewail the remaining Disconformities of my Heart and Life, and beg every jarring Thought might be subdued: And am thankful for Gospel-Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to awe my disingenuous Spirit, when Love cannot draw it to Duty as I would, nor keep it from what I would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 13.] Very dull and indisposed in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for holy Duties, 'till I inculcated the Sermon at Noon upon my Servants: The Lord then pitied and drew nearer to me in the Afternoon, and helped my Faith to rely on his sealed Covenant for Life and Liveliness.</p>
               <p>1702. <hi>April</hi> 5.] How much clearer and sweeter hath my Perswasion of God's Covenant-Love been this Day under a lively Sermon, than I ever gain'd by Light of Reason—How dull did I go out, how lively, warm and joyful did I return?—Lord! that did'st enable me to instruct my Family, and hast drawn out my Heart in Pity and Prayer for all under my Roof; bless the Labour of thy poor Worm, and yet fulfil thy gracious Promise to Training up in thy Way, and accept of all my Aims at thy Glory in the Son of thy Love whom thou hearest always, and all thine for his sake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>

Worship: And I begg'd the sweet Force of his strong Charms for all that assemble in God's House this Day; very gracious was the Lord to me in going to and in his House, and returning to mine own; strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Memory to retain his Word, and assisting me to inculcate it on my Family; and encouraging my Hope of better Success, by a more willing Disposition in our new Servants to learn.</p>

               <p>1707. <hi>April</hi> 20] Sweet was this Morning's Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in reading <hi>Numbers</hi> XXI. Lord! what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in looking unto Jesus, for healing the flaming Stings of Sin in my Soul; what my Tears cannot quench, Faith in my exalted Lord can: O send thy Spirit to be a Well of Life in my Soul: Spring up, O Well! this Day, and cause me to sing to it, and let poor dark and defiled Souls be healed in the Waters of the Sanctuary here and elsewhere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nov.</hi> 2.] Very gracious has the Lord been to me this Day; and sweet was the Word, Prayer, and Singing, and the Minister lively in Preaching—O immense, active patient Being—I was exhorted to Study, Meditate, and Talk of God's Preservation of my natural and spiritual Life—I liv'd when others died of the same Fever—God help'd when Man could not: I deserv'd to die and perish: I might have died e'er my Peace had been made—My Graces have been assaulted, not slain: Languish'd, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd: God's Dishonour by my woful Fall prevented: Lord! that I may live more for thee, and more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for others: Let the Holy Spirit dwell in me, who alone can preserve my spiritual Life; let me cast

out all that would offend or grieve him, give full room in my Soul to him, and be fully govern'd by him: Love and attend thy Ordinances, observe thy Providences, and plead thy Promises for spiritual Life and Growth—I concluded the Day with Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for the Recovery of my natural and spiritual Life, and earnest Prayer for my Sick and afflicted Friends, and the poor Servant under my Care.</p>
               <p>1709. <hi>March</hi> 20.] The Lord composed my Mind, and I begg'd more Communion with the Father, Son and Spirit in the Worship of this Day, than yet afore: And on mature Debates with my own Heart, I desire ever to be kept in the Communion of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with whom I still join, verily supposing their Pastors chosen, qualify'd, and constituted according to Christ's Appointment; I love, and pity, and pray for those submitting to a Yoke their Fathers could not bear, and I hope will never be easy to them: I humbly implore the jealous God to purge his Church from Superstition and Human Inventions; That all Terms of Communion, Anti-scriptural and Extra-scriptural, may be taken away, and Peace and Union follow; and the Gospel-Preachers, cast out by their Brethren, may have abundant Recompence in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of their Ministry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> 10.] I bewail'd the Vanity of my Thoughts on this holy Day, wherein I am discharg'd from what is my Duty on other Days: Lord! how kindly dost thou allow me Rest from vexing Vanities! but how cruel am I to myself, and ungrateful to Thee! by undue, unnecessary Concern for Troubles on some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dear to me, which all my anxious Thoughts cannot ease: Lord! curse this Fountain, and wither the Fruit of my corrupted Nature, and lift my Mind up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the publick and private Worship of this Day.</p>

               <p>1712. <hi>Jan.</hi> 27.] God assisted his Ministers, and helped my Memory to assist others; and my Soul ascended in the Hymn after Sermon with unusual Flame, when my Voice could not mix in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort.</p>
               <p>1713. <hi>Sept.</hi> 13.] I awaked in great Pain, which continued, 'till in secret Prayer I lost all Sense of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Pain in spiritual Pleasure, and Tears of godly Sorrow for Sin, and Joy in my Redeemer.</p>

               <p>1717. <hi>Feb.</hi> 10.] Lord! how sweet has this Day of the Son of Man been unto <hi>me!</hi> In secret Reading, and Meditation; in Prayer alone, and with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; in publick Prayer, Singing, Preaching, and After-reflection: O Son and Lamb of God, who diedst for me, and hast given me Life, let all my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests ever bow to thine; all my corrupt Passions be subdued by thee; my Life ready to be parted with at thy Call: O holy Spirit of Grace, continue thy sweet and powerful Influences on my Soul.</p>
               <p>1719. <hi>July</hi> 12.] Reflecting on God's dealing with me for Fifty Years past, I adore the unparellelled Love that first loved me; and then made me consent and sweetly drew me into the Bands of the everlasting Covenant: My Soul was never yet willing to depart from one Article of that Covenant: But, Oh! how often faulty in, and short of what I have bound my Soul to do, or avoid; and still a Captive, but not a willing Slave to Sin, World, or Satan: Jesus! thou Captain of my Salvation, lead me on to more Victory; sanctify me more and more by thy Word of Truth this Day—I went out much indisposed, my Head and Heart fail'd, that I could neither enjoy God nor my self, but forced to take my Bed at Noon.</p>
               <p>1720. <hi>Jan.</hi> 17.] I arose, and begg'd ease to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend my Father's House, and his Presence there, and in all the Assemblies of his Servants: God assisted the

                  <hi>Octob.</hi> 1. Sweet Morning, while the Lord help'd by healing bodily Lassitude: Enlarg'd and comforted my Heart in sense of redeeming Love; melted my Soul into Shame and Sorrow, for ungrateful Neglects remaining Enmity, Distance, and Strangeness; pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish, selfish, carnal, unsuitable Frames of Spirit, after such Love purchased, published, tasted to Soul-Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishment, so oft, after so many turns again to Folly: Lord! what Bowels doth my perverse Heart spurn against? But what cannot thy Blood cleanse? And now, since by the Faith of thine own Operation, thou shewest the Attonement of my so guilty Soul, O Lord! how can I but love thee? O satisfy the Thirst thou hast raised, and return thy poor Dust in Triumphs of Praise, and more compleat Victory over all her and thine Enemies, and stronger, chearfuller Obedience, 'till I be ever with thee—Continued 'till Noon, in sweet Temper, fullest Joy, nearest Communion with God in Prayer, Reading, Singing, Hearing, with less Interruption than ever before experienced, 'till ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to the Lord's Table, surprized by an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, the Devil took the Advantage of my Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and so hurried and ruffled my Thoughts with

fear of losing the joyful Temper I had, that I soon lost it, and sat under the most pathetick Invitations to Joy and Praise, all in Tears, and return'd in Shame and Sadness, and yet cannot recover; but am hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling my Soul for it's unsuitable Temper, and relying upon Christ for Pardon and Strength, and resolving to love and praise in spight of Sin and Devil.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>June</hi> 17.] The Preparations of my Heart were from God, who quickens the Dead, for I arose in great Pain and Languor, yet my Soul was made to ascend to God, its Original and Felicity.</p>
               <p>1695. <hi>Feb.</hi> 3.] The Lord was gracious, and met me in his House, and at his Table; and made his Ambassador my Mouth to him, more than ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: In Confession, he spake my very Heart, more than ever I could my self: And, Oh! how the good Spirit of Grace melted me all into Tears; strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened my Faith, raised my Hope and Joy, confirm'd my Resignation and Resolution, in renewing my

               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> 3.] I renew'd my Covenant to be the Lord's, and to acquiesce in all he does: My Desires after nearer and more immediate Communion with God were encreased: Meditating on the Providence of God in Brutes and humane Kind, that lov'd their young Ones more ardently, and with encreasing En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments still, after they had nourished them with their Milk, or lactified Blood; my Soul pleaded hard with the God of Nature, Grace, and Glory, that the Wonders of his Love might not be less in Grace than Nature: But while he so freely and frequently nourish'd me with his Body and Blood, I might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience more and more his inexpressible Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and vital Union, giving Joy, and Strength, and Pardon, and Purging, and all I want.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> 5.] My Soul cleav'd to the Dust, and little Life of Grace appear'd: A sorrowful Sight of Strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Distance from God, my Felicity, with less lively Mourning over my Ingratitude: My Soul flies to the Blood of Sprinkling, and begs the Holy Spirit to apply it this Day—The Lord shew'd his Power and Love to a poor unworthy Lump of Clay, and sweetly refresh'd my Soul, and sent me back rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing: But, ah! too soon abated, even e'er I slept.</p>
               <p>1697. <hi>Feb.</hi> 7.] My Soul was fill'd, as with Marrow and Fatness, and acknowledg'd (with Love and Shame) never frowarder unworthier Child was more indulg'd—How amiable were thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, O Lord of Hosts, to me! whilst thou madest me feel what, thro' gracious Assistance, thine Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador feelingly express'd of Communion with God: The Day was all sweet; I think, in the whole, the best Day I ever enjoy'd.</p>

               <p>1699. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1.] With Shame and Sorrow, my Soul reflects on the Sins of my whole Life, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the Year past: O Lord! Days and Years have not taught me Wisdom; but after so long Experience of the tenderest Care, Compassion, Pity, Patience, Pardon, and Provision, what a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Ingratitude do I still continue, after Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Covenant-Engagements, hope of better? Lord! how unfruitful, dull, wandering, slothful, and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is my Heart! And must it be ever thus? Is not cleansing, quickning, strengthening, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> promised and sealed in thy Covenant, as Dedication and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation on my Part: Lord! I gave my Soul and Body to thee for Sanctification as well as Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I renew my solemn Covenant this Day, and go forth to the Gospel-Feast for all I want, and thou hast provided: O give Bread, not Stones, to thy starving Child, tho' unworthy to be called so; yet, thro' Grace, I am thy Servant, thy Child, let thy Bowels move towards me, and draw me 'till I follow hard after thee; wash me in the vital Stream from my dear Lord's Side, 'till I feel I am cleansed, and return with Praise—My Heart was flat and dull at the Table, and I return'd discouraged and asham'd, and bemoan'd my self in secret.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Nov.</hi> 3.] The Lord was gracious and drew near to my Soul in Preparative Duties, and melted my Heart with godly Sorrow; strengthened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Faith, inflamed my Love, encreased my Joy and Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, enlarged my Desires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—And now, Lord! what wait I for, but nearer and nearer Touches of my Redeemer, 'till I feel in my Soul I am healed: O hear my Prayer, indited by thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for my own Soul, thy Ambassador, the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, thy Church, for dear Relations in Covenant, and others yet at distance. <hi>Amen.</hi>—Gracious was the Lord in entertaining my Soul at his Table; sweet was the Day, but dull and wandering the Close.</p>
               <p>1701. <hi>Nov.</hi> 16.] I bewail'd my ungrateful wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Heart, and begg'd of God to unite and heal my planetary Spirit, and committed it to its holy Guardian, who hath helped in like Distress—God, by his Ambassador, call'd me at his Table, to trust in him for his Presence in his own Institution; and he did not reject my Trust, nor suffer my Heart to

               <p>1703. <hi>Octob.</hi> 31.] My Heart trembles to read the Backslidings of <hi>Asa,</hi> after long upright Walking, and Experience of God's Presence with him, and Mercy towards him: I am sensible of my Instability, and dread, as Death, a partial Departure from my God; and deprecate no Suffering, like being plung'd in the Mire of my own Filth—My Heart grew flat and dull when drawing near the Lord's Table; but the King came in, and excited the Graces he had given, and very sweet was the Feast; yet thro' bodily Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the Afternoon was not so chearful, but I was much encouraged by instructing my Family.</p>

under my Father's Rod, my Defects of Faith, Love, Desire, Delight in God: I begg'd Pardon for Jesus sake, and renew'd my Covenant in his Strength, to be wholly and forever the Lord's; to submit to all his Discipline, and walk in all his Commandments: I rely on his Truth and Faithfulness, who allows me to plead all the Articles of his Covenant, as his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Aug.</hi> 17.] I go to this holy Feast for encrease of Faith, that it may more clearly apprehended divine Truths, and be more distinct and firm in the Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of them: More certain &amp; confident of them, my Consent to the Covenant more free, resolv'd, delightful; my Love more inflam'd, that I may be more patient in suffering, and more diligent in doing the Will of God: I depend on the sufficient Grace of God for Strength in all Duties; for Wisdom to direct, for Victory over Sin and Temptation; help under all Affliction, and in my last Change: Lord! these are thy Purchase, thy Promise in the Covenant, to which the Seal is annexed: Thy Command is, <hi>That I Believe</hi>: Lord!

               <p>
                  <hi>Decemb.</hi> 20, 21.] The Lord humbled and softned my Heart in Confession, and gives hope in his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Mercy: Innumerable are the Sins of my Thoughts, Words and Actions, in every Age, State, and Relation: Aggravated by Knowledge, Means of Grace, Experience of the Evil of departing from God, in whole or in part, and the Pleasures of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to him—Lord!

                  <hi>March</hi> 28, 29, 30, 31.] I began the Day with some Life in secret and publick Prayer, but was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards faint and dizzy: Lord! how poor, how short, how imperfect, are my best Duties!—God refresh'd my indisposed Head, and revived my drooping Soul in the Morning—Many gracious Answers of Prayer has God given unworthy me; and a few of his poor Children met to seek his Face, for recovering sick Friends, and preserving others from infectious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases: For a Blessing on the Means of Grace, to many of Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s Charge: For extraordinary Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port under extream Pain, and Strength for his Work beyond Expectation: Lord! who hearest for Jesus sake, the Supplications of a few of thy poor Children in particular and private Cases, wilt thou not regard

the united Cries of thy travailing <hi>Zion,</hi> and maintain her Cause so far as it is thine own? <hi>Jehovah-Jesus!</hi> maintain thy Royal Power in thy Church, against all who would, or do oppose it; and protect and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age all, who, in the sincerity of their Heart, seek the Preservation of thy sacred Institutions in their primitive Purity: Lord! unite all that love thee, and bear thy Image; And tho' our Breaches seem wide as the Sea, yet do thou pour out a Spirit of Love, and Peace, and Purity, and heal them—Lord! if <hi>Sodom</hi> might have been spared for <hi>Ten Righteous,</hi> might not <hi>Britain</hi> for many more!—The History of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, after <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi>'s Reign, made my Heart sad, yet I know not the length of God's Patience, therefore pray and wait, in hopes that God may yet be entreated for us, and deliver his Church from crafty proud Enemies, who own their Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to suppress those that cannot comply with their dividing Articles of Communion; but wherein Men deal proudly, God will be above them; he turns the Counsel of the Froward headlong, and takes the Crafty in their own Craft.</p>
               <p>1718. <hi>Octob.</hi> 16.] My Heart was melted for Sin in Meditation on Gospel-Grace and Love: I was very desirous to join with the Congregation in Prayer on Mr. <hi>Wright</hi>'s Account: I begg'd <hi>Hearing,</hi> and hoped I might have heard more, but struggling to attend confused my Head, and damp'd my Heart: Lord! reconcile me to all thy Methods of humbling and cleansing my sinful Soul.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="unknown:005146_0113_1016C0780C827038"/>
I pour'd out my own Heart in secret Confession to God, and pray'd that God would prepare the Hearts of his Ministers to pray, and bow his Ear and hear: And great was his Assistance to them and me, and great my Hope and Expectation: Our Supplications were chiefly for healing a Child under sore and strange Fits, but especially for her Conversion, urging God's Covenant with her Parent, and Prayers and Tears, and solemn Dedications upon the File.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> 31.] My Soul praises God with Chearfulness, for mitigating, &amp; giving us Hopes of removing the Child's Fits: I love the Lord, and depend upon him more.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> 7.] I found God had heard my Prayer for a Word in Season, to awaken some poor Sinners, even while my own Heart was dull and drowsy, God alarm'd some that before were dead in Sin.</p>
               <p>1699. <hi>July</hi> 13.] We returned safe from <hi>London</hi> this Evening, to our own Habitation, which we had committed to God's Care, who mercifully preserv'd it, notwithstanding an Attempt to break it open.</p>
               <p>1701. <hi>Sept.</hi> 7.] I pleaded hard with God to assist his Messenger this Day, to convince, and convert, and quicken, and comfort by his Word; especially, one that is under great Guilt and Stupidity—It appeared God heard my Prayer for convincing the Guilty, who was brought under great Terror: The Lord carry on the Work to a thorough Conversion.</p>
               <p>1702. <hi>Feb.</hi> 11.] I begg'd divine Protection this Day in Journeying, and we were wonderfully deliver'd
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:005146_0114_1016C07D40E79140"/>
in a very imminent Danger: The Foot-board break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Coachman fell betwixt the Horses, one of which was very unruly, and had like to have kick'd his Brains out; and both ran several Yards, the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being within half a Foot of having his Back broke by the Fore-Axle-Tree, e'er Mr.<hi>B</hi>— discern'd him to be out of the Box: Yet the Lord mercifully stopp'd the Horses, and we went on safely; and the Word was sweet to my Soul, and I hope successful to others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> 18.] A dreadful Fire brake out in the Wooll-Hall; the Wind high and strong, threatning great part of the Town, and my House: In which I look'd to God, that gave me a plentiful Furniture, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and continue what his Bounty gave, without my Desert, and beyond my Hopes; and my Heart submitted to his Will, and he soon extinguished the Flame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> 27.] God answered, and by Conversation with others, I came now to understand that God had graciously answer'd my Prayers for my little Niece, tho' her Life was denied us; yet God ordained Praise out of the Mouth of that Babe, who instructed and profited many, by her Discourse and Submission, and rare Consolations in her Extremity; which I desire to acknowledge to God's Praise, and my own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, as a full Answer to the Meaning, and much to the Words of all my Prayers on her Behalf; and I do here record it for strengthening my own and others Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> 28.] Gracious Answers of Prayers, oft while I am praying; sometimes soon after, at other times long after praying but always very seasonable.</p>

                  <hi>April</hi> 14.] I begg'd divine Protection, and went out to visit a sick Friend, and went safely; but in my Return, the Horses being very unruly, ran us down
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:005146_0115_1016C07F142CC798"/>
an Hill, and against a Bridge, and brake that and the Coach both, yet the Lord preserv'd me and two Children with me, that we had no harm.</p>
               <p>1703, <hi>Nov.</hi> 27.] A most tempestuous Night; but God heard Prayer, and preserv'd the pleasant Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation he bestow'd upon us: Whilst abundance of other Houses were laid waste, there was only a very little Glass broke in ours: We were the wonder of our Neighbourhood for Preservation: We gave Thanks to God in secret, and in the Family, and begg'd to be distinguish'd by true Piety, as we were by providential Care.</p>
               <p>1704. <hi>July</hi> 17.] In great Pain till Noon, when a dreadful Fire raged near our House: I went up to view it, and pray'd to God to distinguish us in the common Calamity, and preserve the Habitation we ask'd of, and solemnly dedicated to him: God heard and turn'd the Wind to save us—We committed our selves and Habitation to God, and slept in Safety.</p>
               <p>1705. <hi>March</hi> 9.] Ill Health inclin'd me to pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Sadness; but I was cured in the Evening by a sinsible Memorial of a gracious Preservation, while a Fire brake out at <hi>Bury,</hi> which threatned great Part of the Town; and while Mr. <hi>B.</hi> with his Family acknowledg'd God's Sovereignty and Justice, and our ill Deserts, and pleaded Mercy, for Christ's sake to spare the Town, and distinguish between the Pious and the Wicked; the Lord rebuked the Flames, and spared some good Families in imminent Danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dec.</hi> 27.] This Night we had a merciful Rescue from Fire, kindled in a Cellar among small Wood, not discovered 'till the Morning, just before we met for Family-Prayer.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="unknown:005146_0116_1016C080E36FAF90"/>
with Shame and Sorrow to the holy Feast he has long neglected: I begg'd of God to pity, pardon, comfort, and establish him in his House, and at his Table; and gave Thanks for his Blessing on his Word preach'd, and private Conversation and Prayer for his poor Ambassador.</p>
               <p>1707. <hi>Jan.</hi> 12.] I pleaded God's Promise, to meet and bless his assembled People, for Strength and Healing to his poor infirm Ambassador, and Success on his Preaching, and private Instructions—Bless the Lord, O my Soul! for a chearful Day and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 17.] At Midnight, a doleful Cry of Fire rais'd the Town, and our Family all went forth, save myself and one Servant: I retired to my Closet, and pour'd out my Heart to God, and begg'd the Town might yet be spared, and reform'd; his People distinguished in the threatning Calamity; the Helps preserved and succeeded: I acknowledged former distinguishing Mercies to me, and many of God's Children in like Dangers: And the Lord sent a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Shower, and held the Winds from blowing; and when I went out of my Closet, I perceiv'd an Abatement of the Flames: I endeavour'd to improve the Midnight Cry in Discourse with my Servant; then return'd to secret Prayer again for the Town, and the Lord heard the Cry of the Afflicted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked the Flames, which were mastered in less than an Hour and half's Time.</p>
               <p>1708. <hi>Jan.</hi> 22.] The Lord assisted me in pouring out my Heart in secret Prayer for — and he presently answered.</p>

them to Combate with prevailing Corruptions; and still uses unworthy me as an Instrument of some good to others, tho' so evil myself: To thee, Lord! be all the Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> 15.] The Lord has heard Prayer, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd signally, in defeating the <hi>French</hi> Invasion; dispersing the false Prophets from these Parts; soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Spirits Mr. <hi>B.</hi> laboured with for Famil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>1709. <hi>April</hi> 5.] I was much indisposed and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited, and inclined to Melancholly; and late, in secret Prayer in my Chamber, my Cloaths took Fire I know not how, nor could I discover it 'till I arose from my Knees; yet the Lord, my Preserver, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected my Hands to subdue it; and my Servants (without my Calling) came immediately to my Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and I received no harm, blessed be God!</p>

               <p>1712. <hi>June</hi> 17. to <hi>July</hi> 9.] In the Morning with an unusual Faith and Fervency, I was drawn out in secret Prayer for the Church of God, especially in these sinful Islands—In the Evening about Seven or
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:005146_0118_1016C08A73B36D88"/>
Eight a Clock, I was seized with a violent Rigour upon my Nerves, which lasted all Night, and the next Morning a Fever succeeded, which affected my Head, that I was incapable of directing those about me, what to do with me: Yet so graciously did the Lord hear my daily and last Supplication in secret, that I was willing rather to depart and be with Christ, and had not one Cloud, Doubt, or Fear of Death thro' the whole Sickness: The Disease appear'd desperate, and no Hope of my Life from Humane help remain'd: But my dear Relations ceas'd not to pray, and call on others to join; and many from whom I expected not so great a share of Affection, were much enlarg'd in Prayer for me; and the Lord was entreated to spare a poor, sinful, unworthy, unprofitable Creature, and say, <hi>Return</hi>; while the strong Men bowed under the same Disease, and fell down slain, tho' the same Physicians, and Means used for them as for my self— So, Father! it has seem'd good in thy Sight; thy Will be done: But what shall I render? What shall I do?— I am thankful for Life; it is God's Gift; it is given in answer of Prayer: But, Lord! if I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it not to thy greater Glory, how sad shall I be? Thou knowest I had no desire to live, but for better Service: And shall I be called from a seeming abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Entrance into Glory again, to struggle with Flesh and Blood, World and Devil, and not be made more than Conqueror, through the Captain of my Salvation? O Lord! on thee, through thy Assistance did I cast my sinful Soul, and loathsome Body, when I thought them parting, without a relucting Thought: And shall I distrust thy Power, or Love, in what thou hast for me yet to do, or suffer? Strengthen my Faith by this Experience of thy Power and Goodness, for Jesus sake, whom thou hearest always.</p>

               <p>1715. <hi>Octob.</hi> 1.] Having been extreamly Deaf and Asthmatick, since <hi>July</hi> 24. I now hear and breathe with usual freedom: My Hearing returned of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with stretching Noise, which I cannot account for: Lord God of Nature! that madest and knowest every Part, thou canst and hast heal'd a poor Worm suddenly and unaccountably, I will ever praise thee.</p>
               <p>1718. <hi>Dec.</hi> 3, 4.] Thankful for former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, I pleaded God's Promise for Direction, in a very difficult Affair, resolved to wait his Time and Way—In one Hour God opened a promising Scene.</p>

               <p>

                  <hi>Dec.</hi> 22.] In the Night, God struck a young Relation with great Terror and Distress of Spirit, which gives me hope of her Conversion: I begg'd of God to direct his Work in Truth on her Soul; and that this may be a Pledge of the Return of all the Souls under our Charge to God—That this and other Seals might be added to publick and private Labours.</p>

                  <hi>Ibid</hi> 29.] In a short Review of my Life past, I ador'd divine Patience, Goodness and Wisdom, that have been exercised towards me from my Birth to this Day; bringing me into so noble a Being; sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining so polluted a Wretch, a Transgressor from the Womb; bearing so long the Rebellions and Vanities of my Youth; wisely chastning my proud Spirit by the Displeasure of some, and by Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from others; drawing me by his Word and Spirit, and driving me by Affliction to Prayer, and encouraging my early Addresses to him; disposing me comfortably into the World; imbittering over-lov'd Enjoyments, to wean me from them; bringing me into nearer Communion with himself, graciously di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting by his Providence (as upon this Day) to a second Marriage; and giving me Comfort in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my Faith or Prayers.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sept.</hi> 13.] On review of the Sermons I last heard, I have reason to hope that my Resolutions against Sin, in the Strength of Christ, are sincere, serious, solid, entire, habitual, peremptory, industrious &amp; continued: I groan daily under indwelling Sin, and appeal to the Omniscient God, that so far as I know my Heart, it is the most distressing Evil ever felt, and nothing so much reconciles me to Death, as the final Cure of that hated Evil: Lord! thou knowest I am rather passive that active in it: I consent not to it, I watch and strive against it, I mourn for it, and rely on Christ's Righteousness alone for Pardon; and beg, as the chiefest of Blessings, a fuller Conformity to the holy Nature and Law of God—Lord! cleanse the Fountain, that the Streams may be purer.</p>

                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> 19.] The Lord yet seems to make our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies triumph over us; and those we pitied, and pray'd for, and liv'd peaceably with, are now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the greatest Hatred of, and Malice against us, &amp; chusing rather to go off to <hi>Rome,</hi> than what they call <hi>Presbytery</hi>—O Lord! hear and rebuke their Rage, and chain their Hands, who are implacably bent against thee and thy hidden Ones; and turn the Hearts, and open the Eyes of such as, thro' Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, hate thy People.</p>
               <p>

Lord! shall I have the Name of thy Child so many Years, and yet no more of thy Nature! Oh! that I were more meek, merciful, humble, thankful, patient, ready to give and forgive: O Lord! I have chosen thee for my Portion, and verily hope thou art and wilt be my everlasting Felicity, and yet what little selfish Designs and Thoughts perplex my Mind? I know and daily feel, there is nothing in this World can satisfy my Soul, and yet very little Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Creatures, discomposes my Spirit: I feel this earthly Tabernacle falling, and yet what little Joy in the Prospect of my House in Heaven? Lord! what unaccountable Contradictions are there in my deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heart? O search and heal me!</p>

               <p>1715. <hi>March</hi> 12.] How much earlier than many other, did God turn my inquiring Soul to see it's Misery and Danger, and shew'd me the All-sufficient Remedy! And when I was foolish and negligent in securing my Interest in Christ, and hoping for great

                  <hi>Feb.</hi> 20.] The Anniversary Day of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and his Son <hi>M.</hi>'s wonderful Deliverance at Sea—The most lively Evening I ever enjoyed with my praying Neighbours: While we paid the Vows of them who had been delivered, I was encouraged to hope that God would pour out more of the Spirit of Grace and Supplication on his Remnant among us—I long'd to join the triumphant Choir above: My Heart was much lifted up all that Night.</p>

                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> 29.] I was confined to my Bed all Day by Pain, very Deaf, almost Blind, and quite Stupid: I could fix my Thoughts on nothing that was good, but so peevish, I was amazed and asham'd of myself: Lord! what Seeds of the old Apostacy still remain and spring up in my Soul! Thou gavest me Sight and Hearing, and may'st thou not take them away when thou pleasest? How long shall my foolish Heart pervert its Way, and then fret against the Lord! O humble and pardon, and heal my proud Spirit.</p>

Can any Tyrant inflict such pungent Torture so long, and yet support so under it? And will not Death deliver me from all Sin and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, into a Joy superior to all the Joy of a Man Child's being born into the World? And yet how does my Heart fail at the Antecedents and Concomitants of a natural Death, tho' I have good Hope, thro' free Grace, that the Consequences will be safe and joyful?

               <p>

               <p>1717. <hi>Jan.</hi> 7.] My Rest was somewhat disturbed by a Letter from one dear to me, departed from the Ordinances and Instruments of her Conversion, and pleading for her Departure: I rose early, and cast my Burthen upon the Lord, and begg'd the down-pouring of his Spirit to enlighten and sanctify the World, and comfort his despised Ministers and People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> 15.] I went to visit a sorrowful Friend, who assured me God had made my Conversation very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to her—All Glory to God, who uses the Weakest and most Unworthy to serve his Purposes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>July.</hi> 13.] I searched my Heart, and found too great a Difficulty in forgiving ungrateful Returns for the most sincere and affectionate Treatment, I was capable of shewing to Relations; but how much worse have I treated thee, my eternal Lover and Friend! What are their Pence, to the Talents thou hast and dost forgive me? O Lord! forgive them and me, and prepare us all for mutual endless Love and Purity.</p>

                  <hi>Dec.</hi> 31.] In reviewing the Year past, I find how good the Lord has been to my <hi>Body,</hi> in supplying it abundantly with Food, Physick, Rayment, Fewel, Attendants: In preserving my Limbs in Falls: In easing me when pain'd: In continuing my Sight, and restoring my Hearing—But oh! how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to my Soul! What sweet Communion with him the first Sacrament in <hi>January</hi>? How many sweet Visits then in his House, in my Closet at Home, and at <hi>Bath</hi>?

               <p>1720. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1, 2.] I ended the last and began this Year in extremity of Pain: After a long waking Night, I could not fix my Mind on any thing with Comfort, 'till past Four in the Morning when I sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred myself afresh to God, and begg'd healing for my diseased Soul: I rose at Six in much Pain, begg'd of God to reconcile me to his Discipline, and shew me wherefore he thus contends with me: Not long after had some Ease, was carried in a Chair to the House of God, where I gave Thanks, and had a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Day—Lord! pity and heal my Soul, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare me for Glory!

apt to Censure me for having transcrib'd too much already; but when I consider'd that the apparent Tendency of all is merely to Excite and Animate to a more vigorous and spiritual Exercise of Religion, a more constant and industrious Observation of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, a greater and steadier Zeal for the Glory of God, and a closer and more acurate Regard to the eternal Interests of our own Souls; it has easily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled me in what I have done against all the Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Pleas that can be urg'd to the contrary.

No surely, He that is gone before to prepare a Place for his Disciples, hath left them his Holy Spirit, not only to fit them for that glorious Inheritance, but also to seal them up to the Day of Redemption, and given them undoubted Pledges and Earnests of their future Possession—The <hi>major</hi> Proposition is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, He that believes shall be saved; the Doubt will lie in the <hi>minor,</hi> but upon serious Tryal, you may come to know, that you are the true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver.

Therefore don't impatiently conclude it is not attainable because not yet attained. But with strenuous Endeavous be still pursuing the making your Calling and Election sure. Always remembring, that it is the same Spirit that works Grace, that alone can shine on it, and discover and give you the clear Knowledge of his Work. Pray hard and be very Thankful for his least Assistance, than which I know not a more effectual Way to gain more.

The smallest Sin if not resisted and mourn'd for, will breed Doubts and Troubles as sure as rotten Flesh doth Worms.

There are in the best such Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Corruption, as ever incline to Apostacy, for none are so compleatly sanctified, but the Flesh is still lusting against the Spirit; and Corruption is an active Principle, very importunate, and not easily to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: The Temptations of Satan are always assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and our own Corruptions ever ready to side with them: Yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and God's just Desertions often concur; for tho' he does not withdraw his Love and Care, yet for our Neglects he often may, and does suspend his Influence and Assistance, and then what are we? — Let me entreat you not to lose these hasty Lines, 'till you have tried your present Case, whether you are growing or declining.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>INCE you pretend to be pleas'd with any of my Scrawles, I will give you a short History of what has pass'd with us this <hi>Christmas</hi>: You remember, I now live with a Tradesman, call'd a <hi>Milliner,</hi> (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose from the multitude of Things that such ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Trade in, especially in the Country.) It is a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and laudable Custom with him, to cast up his Shop, for the most part once a Year. I love not to be ignorant of any Thing that falls in my Way with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Trouble; and therefore, to divert my Mind, I have sometimes engaged with him in some little Part of this comical Fatigue: The whole of which is a thoro' Scrutiny into all that has been bought and sold, and got by it, and into what remains. In order to this, abundance of Files, of Bills, Letters, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, besides Books, were to be examined: But my Province was only to assist in Measuring and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting (in <hi>English,</hi> to write on every Piece, after measured, what it contained;) the Tryal of Gains was left to themselves, and held them to it Night and Day, &amp; every one was pleasant &amp; chearful at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion. I expostulated with my Landlord the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary Trouble of this, for one that had no reason to suspect his Circumstances; but was answered, That besides the Pleasure of proving it, their future Trade could not be so successful, easy, and beautiful without it: The Sale of what had been bought, directs
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:005146_0187_1016C17A28283278"/>
to what's best to be bought again, by finding out what had been sold to best Advantage; what had been misplac'd, and thought to have been lost, is now in order again, and readily found: Besides, the Gain made a Recompence for the Trouble, and was an help to Thankfulness, &amp;c.— Now, my dear Friends, if we are so wise for this World, why should we be so weak for the other? And yet how few are there, that with that unwearied Diligence, Dexterity, and Chearfulness, cast up in their spiritual Trade? I blush at my own Sloth and Folly, and endeavour to commend <hi>Heart-Examination</hi> to my Thoughts by my <hi>Christmas</hi> Diversion. The Result of all my Landlord's Trouble, assures him he has gain'd by last Year's Trade, but can give him only some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Conjectures how he may thrive the next, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with many Fears of losing by some unfashionable Goods, which he looks upon with heavy Sighs. But if upon serious Scarch, I can find I have gain'd any true Grace, I am sure of its encrease, and that it can never be lost, or become useless. Can I but find Faith as a grain of Mustard-Seed, I can safely conclude, it will grow to a Tree: The Path of the Just, as a shining Light, will shine more and more to the perfect Day. If I sigh over the Weakness of my Grace, I am yet encouraged when I read the Encomiums of my compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate Redeemer, on the weak Faith of many that addressed to him in the Days of his Flesh—Therefore my good Friend, let us call in the Assistance of others, and diligently search our Hearts and Ways, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it to a comfortable Conclusion, and then my Diversion might be Useful to myself and you—</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thought I could with less Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance have parted with a Sister, than I find I can: I did hope Death would not have begun at the wrong end of the Register-Book; but they are Seniors in the best Sense, who have soonest done their Work, and are first fit for Glory: Tho' I could not have parted with a Sister without Tears, to any distant Country upon Earth, tho it had been to her own Advantage, yet Reason would have blamed and soon overcome such a fond and foolish Passion: And surely Religion then should do no less, but more, when she is in a far higher and happier Preferment than all this World could pretend to offer. Our All-wise Creator first form'd our massy Lump, and then inspired it; and when he is pleas'd to dissolve the <hi>Compositum,</hi> it is not that either of the constituent Parts should be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy'd: But the Dissolution, as to the Righteous, with regard to their <hi>Souls,</hi> is immediate <hi>Glory</hi>; and with regard to their <hi>Bodies,</hi> but a Refining, in order to a Re-union: The forsaken Mansion is, indeed, a melancholly Object! and it is very affecting to close the dear Eyes that were wont to delight us with their silent Rhetorick; but we more than water the Body sown in Dust, while we dim our Prospect of their Glory. Why should I wish the Soul in this Body still merely to say, I had a Sister in such a Place? What if Heaven (where she is) be farther off? I am sure, as that is more suitable, so it ought to be nearer to my immortal Part: And may I not still have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with her, and with the glorious Company she keeps, by loving, praising, admiring, and adoring the same God, tho' I am yet on Earth?

in the Thoughts of meeting her among the Spirits of the Just made Perfect? Surely, they have more Courage, better Success, or less Difficulty than I who can wish that War protracted—But she has now passed the Pikes, O happy Soul! Her Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is sown in Corruption, and cannot defend itself from Worms, and is putrifying and loathsome at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but it will not be always so. If the innate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of Re-union could not perswade me of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, yet the infallible Word of God has assur'd me of it; and that it shall arise, not as it was sown, a natural and sluggish Body but agil and sprightly, and fit to serve its superior and vigorous Soul. It is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to me sometimes to think of the Lustre and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of glorified Bodies, which rest not either Day or Night, nor suffer any Decays, Imperfections, Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or Interruptions, in their high and happy Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but the greatest Pleasure of all, to think of being for ever with the Lord—</p>

But the All-wise Father of our Spirits can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mistake in measuring, timing, and appointing his Methods of healing Souls: If Guilt makes you fear his Wrath, rather than taste his Love in your Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you should cast your guilty Soul upon him for promised Rest; and may be well assured, that God will not exact the Debt from the Offender and the Surety too: Fly daily to that Refuge, that sure Hope, that justifying Righteousness, and then you will find no Fury in God, how grievous soever your Afflictions are—You have liberty to pray for Pity and Help as well as <hi>David,</hi> who, when he had aching Bones, had a sense of Guilt also, even of scandalous Sins— If your own or others Cries for you seem yet unheard, it might be our mistake, to urge for present Ease, without a due Respect for future Cure, Sin is the worst Disease, its Cure is to be fought, tho' by the roughest Methods: The Children of God are agreed in this, and yet can scarce submit the Means to the infallible Physician: Tho' we can trust a Surgeon to apply a Caustick (though of <hi>Lapis Infernalis</hi>) and let it lie his Time, if there be any hope of Cure; yet how hardly can we submit on higher Reason, surer Hope, or happier Experience, to him, whose Word of Truth assures us, that every thing he does shall do us good, both purge away our Sins, and make us Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Holiness.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I received your Request of an <hi>Elegy</hi> on the late excellent Mrs. <hi>BURY,</hi> I found my self unwilling to deny a Person of your Merit: Yet I knew not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume a Study I had abandon'd so many Years, except what I devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Imitation of the Psalms of <hi>David.</hi> Tho' I do not use to bind myself with solemn Vows, yet I had long ago purposed to write no more such Poems, but when the Occasion itself should be so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary as to awaken my old Idea's almost from the Grave, and constrain Fancy to the Work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:005146_0208_1016C1BEF583B500"/>Such an unexpected Occasion, <hi>Sir,</hi> was given me when you put into my Hands the Memoirs of her LIFE, which you had collected. The Character of the Deceased so far exceeds what I could have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that drew my Thoughts and Verse out to all this Length, almost contrary to my own Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</p>
            <p>Accept it, honoured <hi>Sir,</hi> as a Tribute paid to the Memory of so uncommon a Virtue, and a Life of Piety so sublime. And may the Publication of it to the World be attended with some happy Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of so shining an Example. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head type="sub">Late Wise of the Reverend Mr. SAMUEL BURY, of <hi>Bristol,</hi> annexed to some Memoirs of her Life, drawn up by him, but collected out of her own PAPERS.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>SHE must ascend: Her Treasure lies on High;</l>
               <l>And there her Heart is. Bear her thro' the Sky</l>
               <l>On Wings of Harmony, ye Sons of Light,</l>

               <l>The Sense was known before: Those sacred Themes,</l>
               <l>"The GOD, the Saviour, and the flowing Streams</l>
               <l>"That ting'd the cursed Tree with Blood divine,</l>

               <l>Brought Paradise to Earth, and sooth'd her Pains.</l>

               <l>Seiz'd the fair Piece, and wash'd it o're with Tears,</l>
               <l>Dress'd it in Flowers, then hung it on her Urn;</l>
               <l>A Pattern for the Sex in Ages yet unborn.</l>

               <l>Gay Silks and Diamonds are a vulgar Road:</l>
