            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>READER, you have now before you, ſome account of the Life and Death of one, whoſe eminent piety entitled her to, and obtained her the eſteem of all the real lovers of virtue in the circle of her acquaintance.</p>
            <p>Had her character as a Chriſtian in <hi>life,</hi> and the circumſtances attending her <hi>death,</hi> been as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally known as they were worthy of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would have precluded the neceſſity of this publication; but as this was not the caſe, it was thought by ſome of her religious acquaintance, that <hi>a ſhort account</hi> thereof, ſent into the world, might be of real ſervice to the enlightened, but too thoughtleſs and ſecure inhabitants of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:027054_0005_0FD37FDE60302C60"/>But in the execution of this a conſiderable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty has ariſen: no minute being made of her expreſſions and behavior 'till immediately after her death, many paſſages, (though highly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting) are obliged to be omitted, on account of their being ſo imperfectly remembered by thoſe who were preſent when ſuch occurrences hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that they could not again repeat them with ſuch perſpicuity and accuracy as the nature of the caſe required.</p>
            <p>Of the reality of the following account, there are a number of living witneſſes; who moreover feel a pleaſure in declaring, that ſuch an inſtance of triumphant <hi>faith</hi> and patient <hi>reſignation,</hi> they never before ſaw in all their lives.</p>
            <p>One remarkable inſtance of her entire reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is contained in the following circumſtance; which being omitted in the following account, will be the more acceptable here.—One of her brothers (Bennett Maxey) being an itenerant miniſter in the Methodiſt Epiſcopal Church, was travelling and preaching the Goſpel at a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance from home.</p>
            <p>It is extremely natural for thoſe who are leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world to wiſh to ſee their friends, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe whom they peculiarly eſteem. But when ſhe was aſked, whether ſhe would have him ſent for, ſhe ſaid ſhe wiſhed to ſee him; but as he
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:027054_0006_0FD37FDFCB838280"/>
was engaged in his Maſter's work, ſhe did not wiſh to hinder him; but requeſted them to tell him to redeem time, and try to meet her in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And no doubt but the hope ſhe had that they ſhould meet again at the reſurrection of the juſt, enabled her to give up all hope of ſeeing him again in time. <note n="*" place="bottom">Her brother, on receiving an account of her death, writes in the following words; which being ſtrongly expreſſive of their love and union, and of the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made on his mind by her pious exhortations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem time, &amp;c. are here tranſcribed.
<q>When I left my <hi>dear ſiſter</hi> I was in great hopes I ſhould have ſeen her again in time, but am diſappointed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think I will take her good advice, and redeem all the time I can.—Time is precious, and my poor heart is too backward to redeem time; but God being my helper, I feel more than ever reſolved to do his bleſſed will.—When I think of the love and union there were between us, I hardly know how to give her up. The pain of parting is great; but I expect the joy will be greater if ever we meet again. So I find a reſignation to the will of God.</q>

            <p>The reader will obſerve, in the courſe of the following pages, a very remarkable circumſtance She had labored for ſome time under a moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful temptation; but was at length wonderfully and ſtrangely delivered by a remarkable dream; in which a ſmall ticket appeared to be providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially conveyed to her, containing theſe words of the apoſtle John—"Beloved, now are we the ſons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:027054_0007_0FD37FE1FA890028"/>
be; but we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is." Theſe words proved ſuch a ſource of comfort to her both at the time and afterwards, that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and requeſted that they might be made the ſubject of her funeral diſcourſe. She had at the ſame time, ſuch juſt conceptions of the <hi>value</hi> of <hi>time,</hi> that ſhe alſo requeſted a ſermon on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject might be preached to thoſe that ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her funeral. Accordingly at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, two eminent miniſters of God's word, (whom ſhe herſelf had nominated Mr. James O'Kelly, and Mr. Philip Gatch) ſolemnized her funeral, in the preſence of a vaſt concourſe of people. The one of them preached from the words ſhe had choſen; and the other from Rev. x. 5, 6.
<q>And the angel which I ſaw ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſea, and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to Heaven, and ſware by him that liveth for ever and ever, that there ſhould be time no longer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The attentive multitude behaved with great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs and ſolemnity. But when her ſilent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains were conſigned to its mother duſt, there to reſt till the trumpet awakes the dead;—then in an eſpecial manner, the peculiar ſolemnity of the ſcene exceeded deſcription.</p>

            <head>A Short Account OF THE <hi>LIFE AND DEATH</hi> OF THEODOSIA MAXEY.</head>
            <p>THEODOSIA MAXEY, the daughter of John and Mary-Anne Maxey, was born in Powhatan County, in the State of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, on the thirteenth day of June, in the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty-ſix. She was remarkable from her very infancy, for her uncommon obedience to her parents, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deportment to the reſt of the family; and on all occaſions, manifeſted a mild, gentle, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſpoſition. But as ſhe grew up to maturity, (as it commonly happens) the corruptions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grew alſo. And although ſhe was ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from thoſe wicked practices that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to youth, yet the cuſtoms and vanities of the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027054_0010_0FD37FE737D63C38"/>
world, ſo far led her heart aſtray from God, as to make her careleſs and indifferent about the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her ſoul. It is, however, but juſtice to obſerve, that very few, while in an unregenerate ſtate, preſerve a character ſo amiable, and a life ſo free from vice.</p>
            <p>For ſome time ſhe did not appear to have had any other awakenings, than thoſe of an enlightened conſcience; nor any other convictions, than thoſe which neceſſarily ariſe from the enlightening beams of "That true light which lighteneth every man that cometh into the world"—ſo that there appeared nothing remarkable in her religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exerciſes, till about the 18th year of her age.</p>
            <p>About the year 1775, ſhe began to hear the Methodiſts preach. Edward Dromgoole, Joſeph Hartley, Philip Gatch, and others who ſucceeded them, preached the Goſpel through thoſe parts, with conſiderable ſucceſs. Her parents were ſome of the firſt that were converted to God in that neighbourhood. Their houſe was opened for the reception of Methodiſt preaching, where it has been regularly continued ever ſince. This circumſtance tended greatly to increaſe her oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of inſtruction; for beſide hearing frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the word of God in public, ſhe had alſo the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027054_0011_0FD37FE8B3B7E610"/>
of being much in the company of thoſe worthy characters who preached it, and of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their private inſtructions: a priviledge for which many will have cauſe eternally to bleſs God.</p>
            <p>Nothing however, of a religious nature, ſeems to have made any laſting impreſſion on her mind, till about the beginning of the year 1785. It was then that Mr. <hi>J. Major,</hi> after preaching at her father's, earneſtly intreated her to "try and ſave her ſoul;" and after ſome other plain and pointed converſation took his leave of her with ſaying, "If you periſh your blood will be upon your own head." Theſe words (which carried convictions with them) appeared to be ſpoken with great ſimplicity and godly ſincerity: and a conſciouſneſs of their truth with a fear of their being dreadfully verified, deeply affected her, and created ſuch an alarm in her conſcience, that thence forward ſhe could not reſt till the Lord ſpake peace to her ſoul.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of the convictions ſhe now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, her mind became very reſileſs and uneaſy. A firm perſuaſion that ſhe was a ſinner againſt God;—An awful apprehenſion of his juſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and a hope that there was yet mercy for
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027054_0012_0FD37FEAF0C4D530"/>
her, fixed in her a determination to take the preacher's advice, and try to ſave her ſoul.</p>
            <p>We do not intend to give a particular account of the whole progreſs of her convictions from this time. There were ſome circumſtances, however, which had a powerful tendency to deepen and increaſe thoſe convictions; a brief account of which, will, we truſt, be pleaſing, inſtructive, and entertaining to the reader.</p>
            <p>Religion, about this time, was at a very low ebb. Many of thoſe who embraced it, ſome years before, were now called from this to a better world.—The preaching of the Goſpel had appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently very little effect:—The then riſing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration were thoughtleſs and prophane;—and though many attended the preaching of the word, yet the ſeed ſown fell moſtly by the <hi>way ſide,</hi> and but few brought forth fruit to perfection, and adorned the profeſſion of Chriſtianity. Such was the State of things, when God, jealous for his own Glory, was pleaſed to revive his work in the following manner.</p>
            <p>Eliſha Maxey (a brother of Theodoſia) in the month of <hi>June</hi> 1785, was powerfully awakened and converted to God. He was one evening
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027054_0013_0FD37FEC79FDAC30"/>
importuned by his father to pray in the family: for a few moments he heſitated; but caſting his care on God, he began the firſt public prayer he ever offered to a throne of grace. He had utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but few words, when the Spirit and power of God, was diſplayed in a very extraordinary manner. Deep convictions ſeized ſeveral of the family, who till then had remained careleſs and unconcerned; but were now conſtrained to cry out aloud for mercy. <hi>Theodoſia</hi> was then preſent, and ſunk to the floor under the powerful opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſpirit of God. Her ſtrong cries and tears, plainly diſcovered the agonies of her wounded ſoul; and her convictions from that time appeared to be greatly deepened.</p>
            <p>That a gracious work was now begun, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily going on, in Mr. Maxey's family, was now very evident. Seriouſneſs and ſolemnity marked their countenances, while ſighs and groans fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently burſt from their diſconſolate hearts; and the very breathing of their ſouls appeared to be after God; and, "What ſhall I do to be ſaved?" was the important queſtion. As they were thus earneſtly inquiring the way to Zion, <hi>Eliſha</hi> (the young man above mentioned) did all in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to point them to Chriſt, as being both able and willing to ſave; and his labours are not in

vain. <hi>Prayer-meetings</hi> were inſtituted, and the work began to ſpread far and wide like fire among dry ſtubble. Numbers attended the prayer meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: preaching alſo was wonderfully bleſt: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions were frequent, deep, and laſting; and it was not uncommon to ſee ſeveral ſouls converted at a common prayer-meeting. The work ſoon ſpread into other neighbourhoods and counties, yea into diſtant parts; till at length great part of the ſtate ſeemed to catch the ſacred flame, ſo that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds in a ſhort time were brought to enjoy the favour and love of God.<note n="*" place="bottom">From this beginning the work ſoon after ſpread through Virginia and the ſouthern ſtates, like a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty torrent bearing down all before it.—When we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect bow this work began —the inſtruments employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in carrying it on,—and its progreſs in ſpite of all oppoſition —we are conſtrained to ſay "This was the Lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes.</note>

            <p>But the great and good effect, which theſe things had on Mr. Maxey's family, (and Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia in particular) is what principally demands our obſervations at preſent. She continued for ſome time truly and heartily engaged with God. Her ſighs, tears and ſecret groans, were an inconteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proof that ſhe was hungering and thirſting after righteouſneſs: but unbelief kept her from laying hold on the promiſe. In this diſtreſſed
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027054_0015_0FD37FEFC704A950"/>
ſtate, ſhe went mourning from day to day, without comfort, without peace, and ſometimes almoſt without hope!</p>
            <p>But God who wounds with an intent to heal, dropt a cordial into her bitter cup. Her mind was deeply impreſſed with thoſe encouraging, and ſoul refreſhing words of our Lord, (Matt. xi. 28.) "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt." Theſe words gave her ſome eaſe of mind, and were the ground of a hope, that God would in his own good time, give her the reſt ſhe ſo greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
            <p>During this her great diſtreſs, ſhe ſpent much of her time in private retirement, ſearching the ſcriptures and wreſtling with God in prayer. Having on a certain time retired into a private room for thoſe purpoſes, ſhe chanced to read the paſſage above mentioned. After pondering for ſome time on the words, ſhe withdrew, leaving the book open at the place. Juſt about that time Mr. D— had an appointment to preach at her father's; and having occaſion to go into the ſame room, found the book in the poſture ſhe had left it. On looking therein he was at once ſtruck with a view of the words, and a ſenſe of their
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027054_0016_0FD37FF4C78EFB78"/>
importance; and after a few minutes' meditation therein, made them the ſubject of his diſcourſe that day in public. The word was applied to her heart, her hopes were ſtrengthened, her deſires increaſed, and ſhe appeared more reſolutely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to perſevere in ſeeking the fulfilment of the promiſe to her ſoul.</p>
            <p>But finding at length, that notwithſtanding all her endeavours, her prayers, tears &amp;c. ſhe (like one of old) was nothing mended, but rather grew worſe, ſhe determined to add <hi>faſting</hi> to the other means of grace. This ſhe found recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended both by precept and example in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and by thoſe now whom ſhe had reaſon to believe were the real children and lovers of God. Hoping therefore to find ſome relief from this, ſhe entered upon it without delay: But ſhe ſoon found this was not the help ſhe needed. At length after making every ſhift, and uſing every means in her power, ſhe became fully convinced,
<q>
                  <l>"The blood of Chriſt muſt ſtill remain,</l>
                  <l>"Sufficient and alone."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Inſtead therefore of getting relieved of her bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, it ſe<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d daily to increaſe. Being thus beaten out of all dependence on means, ſhe was at laſt experimentally taught the important leſſon
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027054_0017_0FD37FF6AD12BA10"/>
ſhe had been ſo long ſtriving to learn; and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up every plea, came to Chriſt, as "a weary, heavy laden ſinner." She had long labored as in midnight darkneſs, and drank the wormwood and the gall: her ſins for ſome time had preſſed heavily upon her; but now unbelief, like a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeemed to cruſh her down: In this diſtreſs and bitterneſs of ſoul ſhe attended the prayer meeting,
<q>
                  <l>"Burden'd with a world of grief,</l>
                  <l>"Burden'd with a ſinful load,</l>
                  <l>"Burden'd with this unbelief,</l>
                  <l>"Burden'd with the wrath of GOD."</l>
               </q>
But her extremity was God's opportunity. At this prayer meeting ſhe was enabled to act faith; the chains and fetters of unbelief dropped off, and her ſoul burſt into the liberty of the chidren of God: Her ſorrow and diſtreſs vaniſhed in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and joy and peace took poſſeſſion of her heart. Her mouth was filled with praiſes, and her tongue looſed to tell what God had done for her ſoul. Old things were done away, and all things became new, and a new ſong put into her mouth, even praiſe to God.</p>
            <p>Indeed the praiſes of God were now her daily employ, and ſhe never appeared happier than when engaged in this heavenly exerciſe. She
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027054_0018_0FD37FF979D688A8"/>
frequently ſang with tranſport the following words,
<q>
                  <l>"Now I'll ſing of Jeſu's merit,</l>
                  <l>"Tell the world of his dear name;</l>
                  <l>"That if any want his Spirit,</l>
                  <l>"Jeſus is the very ſame;</l>
                  <l>"He that aſketh ſoon receiveth;</l>
                  <l>"He that ſeeks is ſure to find;</l>
                  <l>"Come—for whoſoe'er believeth,</l>
                  <l>"He will never caſt behind."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In this happy frame ſhe continued for ſome<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>time, a living witneſs that "God has power on earth to forgive ſin." And the happineſs ſhe found in religion during this period, appeared too great for words to deſcribe: ſhe ſeems to have conſoled herſelf with the pleaſing (though delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive hope, that her enemies were all deſtroyed, and ſhe ſhould learn war no more. But experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſoon taught her otherwiſe, and the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nature with the temptations of the Devil, convinced her of her miſtake. Evil tempers and diſpoſitions, the remains of the carnal mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſtruggle for the aſcendency, and ſhe found herſelf ſurrounded with enemies before ſhe was aware! By conſulting her experience, ſhe found this was not a ſtate of reſt, but of war and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict; and that ſhe conſequently needed the whole
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:027054_0019_0FD37FFAB1E0AD40"/>
armour of God; otherwiſe her enemies would prevail, and her latter end be worſe than the beginning. While theſe conſiderations taught her the neceſſity of a deeper work of grace, a conviction that it was her privilege, ſet her to ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. She found great encouragement from theſe, and the like portions of Scripture—"His name ſhall be called Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people <hi>from</hi> their ſins:"—"that he was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to <hi>deſtroy the works of the Devil:</hi>" that he has promiſed to "ſanctify his people <hi>wholly,</hi> body and ſoul and ſpirit; and to preſerve them <hi>blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs</hi> unto life eternal:—and above all—"that he alſo is <hi>faithful</hi> who has promiſed, who alſo <hi>will do it.</hi>" And as ſhe ſought the Lord for the pardon of her ſins, ſo ſhe did for a deſtruction of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mind with all her heart.</p>
            <p>From Auguſt, 1785, till the 5th day of April, 1786, ſhe earneſtly and perſeveringly ſought the Lord for this bleſſing. Then it was that her prayers were heard and anſwered in a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner, before a number of witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; ſome of whom to the preſent day, retain a lively remembrance of that ſolemn ſcene. The ſervent agonizing manner in which ſhe wreſtled
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027054_0020_0FD37FFC3B97F758"/>
with God, is not eaſily expreſſed. Her mortal part, at length, unequal to the taſk, ſunk under the conflict, and remained for ſome time almoſt motionleſs; but the aſpiring ſoul would take no denial; till at length, like Jacob, ſhe became a prevailer. In a word, ſuch an inſtance of active, perſevering and prevailing faith, we may venture to ſay is rarely to be met with.</p>
            <p>From this time forward, ſhe appeared to dwell as in the ſuburbs of Heaven, and lived a witneſs that even here, "the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin." Her conduct and deportment was truly becoming the Chriſtian character, and the ſervice of God was her delight. She cheerfully ſubmitted to difficulties, croſſes and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in order to attend the worſhip of God, and the miniſtry of his word: and ſhe uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her wonder and aſtoniſhment that ſo many who had an opportunity of hearing the word of God, would nevertheleſs continue careleſs at home, and ſpend that precious time in vanity that they might have ſpent in the ſervice of God. This was far from being the caſe with her, for ſhe would neglect no opportunity, but at all times appeared deſirous to wait on God in the uſe of all
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027054_0021_0FD37FFE1BD1C7C8"/>
his appointed means; and ſo ſhe continued, a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy member of ſociety, and pattern of piety till God ſaw good to call her from this vale of tears to reap thoſe incorruptible joys that are at his right hand for ever more.</p>
            <p>About two years before her departure, the ſymptoms of a conſumption were firſt diſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>rable. A dry tickling cough, the wearing away of the fleſh, a quick pulſe, ſhortneſs of breath, &amp;c. ſeemed to portend her approaching diſſolution. As her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy weakened, and the diſorder increaſed, her ſoul ripened apace, for the eternal reward. Relying on the word of him who has promiſed, that "All things ſhall work together for good to them that love God;" She did not appear to dread her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching change, but reſigned herſelf into the hands of God: and when ſhe was aſked, if ſhe dreaded death? would reply, "I have a hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the grave!"</p>
            <p>After a variety of means had been uſed to check the diſorder without the deſired effect; ſhe was adviſed about Auguſt 1792, to uſe the waters of a mineral ſpring. The perſon at whoſe houſe ſhe ſtay<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

She had daily an intermitting fever, and her cough, at times, was very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome; Yet her countenance diſcovered a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity and tranquility of mind, that death (though apparently not far off) could not take from <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> And although ſhe was generally ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and ſolemn, yet ſhe never diſcovered the ſmalleſt ſymptom of that alarming dread that ſeizes the ſinner,</q>

            <p>"When life ſinks apace and death is in view;"

            </p>
            <p>While ſhe continued to uſe the waters above mentioned, ſhe thought ſhe found relief; but on her return home ſhe grew worſe, and was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſoon after moſtly to her bed. Death now ſtared her in the face! And no doubt but the grand enemy of ſouls tried to repreſent it to her view in all its ghaſtly forms. But ſhe had been
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:027054_0023_0FD3800264756B78"/>
long accuſtomed to view death as a vanquiſhed enemy; No wonder then that,
<q>"Death could not make her ſoul afraid."</q>
            </p>
            <p>She could rejoice at the proſpect of her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching diſſolution, and would often ſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>During the fall and beginning of winter, her diſorder gained ground very faſt, and her body weakened accordingly; in conſequence of which ſhe could ſit up but little: Her cough alſo was very troubleſome, and conſiderably diſturbed her reſt; but inſtead of murmuring at any of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Providence, ſhe bore all her ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with a chriſtian-like patience, and entire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to the Divine will.</p>
            <p>On Wedneſday <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:027054_0024_0FD380048F4A17D0"/>Thurſday the 21ſt. Her ſpirit ſeemed to be uncommonly depreſſed; and the ſtrong and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope that ſhe had hitherto enjoyed, ſeemed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt taken away. From what cauſe this diſtreſs aroſe, we cannot poſitively affirm; but from what happened the next day, there is reaſon to believe ſhe was tempted to doubt her being one of the children of God.</p>
            <p>Friday, 22. She appeared to labour ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame diſtreſs. One aſked her if ſhe was afraid of death? She replied, "I think at times I am not ſo fearful of it as I ought to be."—From this it appears that her mind was in ſome degree beclouded, ſo that ſhe durſt not conſider herſelf entitled to the great and precious promiſes made to the children of God. But he who permits the trial of his people, can, when it pleaſes him, wonderfully and ſtrangely deliver them: An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this we have <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with the temptation, ſhe fell into a doze. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> awaking, ſhe ſaid,

                  </gap> a ſmall piece of paper lie on the floor, which I took up, and found on it theſe words, <hi>Beloved, now are we the ſons of God.</hi>—
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:027054_0025_0FD38007298C5A40"/>
But the reſt</q>
ſaid ſhe "I cannot remember." She deſired her brother to take the ſcriptures and ſearch, and ſee of he could find ſuch a paſſage there. He preſently found it in 1 John iii. 2. The whole paſſage is as followeth,
<q>Beloved, now are we the ſons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be, but we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</q>
The words when read to her, ſeemed to remove her fears; ſhe again took courage. Indeed it appears as if this was a ſingular providence of God to communicate comfort to this afflicted ſaint, in this hour of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Saturday 23. She ſaid
<q>Mamma, can you give me up?</q>
Her mother ſaid, "Yes my child, if it is the will of God!" She then aſked for her father and put the ſame queſtion to him. She ſaid,
<q>I feel as if I am going to heaven, and I want you to meet me there.</q>
She exhorted him to redeem time; "Precious time!" ſaid ſhe; and deſired him to tell her brothers to redeem time, and meet her in glory, for ſhe did not think he ſhould ſtay here long.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:027054_0026_0FD380092F7A6B40"/>Her parents expecting her departure was near, ſent for two of their ſons and families. When they arrived ſhe reached them her hand, ſaying
<q>Here they come! I wiſh I may ſee you all come ſo into heaven.</q>
One of her brothers aſked her how ſhe was? She ſaid
<q>Poorly in body, but happy in ſoul! Jeſus is ſweet in affliction; and his love is wonderful;—ſtronger than death.</q>
She then requeſted them ſeverally to try to meet her in glory, and on their promiſing they would; ſhe thanked God for the hope ſhe had of meeting with them again,
<q>
                  <l>"Where death ſhall all be done away,</l>
                  <l>"And bodies part no more."</l>
               </q>
She exhorted the children to be dutiful to their parents; and above all to try and ſave their ſouls. Then exerting her little ſtrength, addreſſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the byſtanders in general, and intreated them to perſevere; and preſſed the neceſſity of holineſs, and a diligent uſe of the means of grace, with ſuch forcible language and melting expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as drew tears from their eyes in abundance. One of thoſe preſent, ſpeaking of this ſolemn diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſays "I think it will never be forgotten; it was truly loud preaching to me!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:027054_0027_0FD3800DE79F3FE0"/>Sunday, 24th. She lay ſtill and ſaid but little. The few words, however, that dropped from her lips, were weighty and powerful, adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace to the hearers.</p>
            <p>Monday, 25. Was nearly as the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Tueſday 26. She complained a little of her mouth and throat, which were very ſore. To thoſe who came to ſit up with her in the evening ſhe ſpoke moſt feelingly and affectionately on the neceſſity of holineſs; and earneſtly exhorted them to meet her in heaven. Obſerving one who made no profeſſion of religion, ſhe took him by the hand and intreated him to ſeek the ſalvation of his ſoul. Nor would ſhe let him go till he gave her a promiſe that he would fulfil her requeſt.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday 27. The enemy of ſouls again thruſt ſore at her. She was now tempted to think ſhe had offended God by impatience; and ſo powerful was this temptation that it deſtroyed her peace, and brought her to the border of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. To one of her brothers who viſited her in this diſtreſs, ſhe ſaid, "Brother, I have waded
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027054_0028_0FD38011218B5378"/>
through deep waters ſince I ſaw you, and ſtill I fear I have not been enough reſigned to the will of God." He told her this was the travail of a chriſtian, and encouraged her to look to God for deliverance. He inſtanced the caſe of David, who, when the waves and the billows went over him, cried out, "Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul, and why art thou diſquieted within me? Hope thou in God for I ſhall yet praiſe him." But ſhe could take no comfort from this, for the cloud ſtill hovered over her mind. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many people came and offered their ſervice to ſit up. She thanked them and ſaid, "I hope the Lord will reward you for your kindneſs." And then intreated them in the moſt endearing and affectionate manner to ſeek the ſalvation of their ſouls; "For if I ſhould miſs of heaven (ſaid ſhe) I want you to get there." From this it appears that ſhe was not yet freed from the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation above mentioned. Her great reſignation when ſo violently attacked by the devil is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly obſervable: For, when aſked by one which ſhe would chuſe, life or death, ſhe ſaid "I will chuſe neither; the will of the Lord be done."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:027054_0029_0FD3801202215D48"/>Thurſday 28. She lay very ſtill in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaid ſhe felt very weary, and her throat ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſore: ſhe was likewiſe ſo hoarſe that it was with difficulty ſhe could be underſtood. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the mean time plied his fiery darts: and a fear that ſhe ſhould miſs of heaven at laſt, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her into the depth of diſtreſs:—But he, who permitted the trial of holy Job, and faithful Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;—that delivered Daniel in the lion's den, and Jonah in the whale's belly;—now ſaw good to rebuke the tempter, and once more ſet her ſoul at liberty.</p>
            <p>About 12 or 1 o'clock the cloud was diſpelled, the darkneſs diſperſed, her fears and doubts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and heavenly light reſtored. The ſpirit of the Lord came upon her, his glory ſhone round her, and heaven ſprang up in her ſoul. Her mourning was now turned into joy, her hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs into happineſs and her ſorrow to ſongs of praiſe. She began to exhort the family, encou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raging and perſuading them to preſs on, and ſecure their eternal happineſs. She told them of the goodneſs of God; and the more ſhe ſpake of his goodneſs, the more of it ſeemed poured down into her ſoul, till all her powers ſeemed loſt in wonder, love and praiſe.</p>

               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:027054_0030_0FD3801374CF0B00"/>At length reaching forth her trembling hand, ſhe ſaid, "I want my dear ſiſter;" and taking her by the hand, ſaid farewell! you are my on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſiſter;—obſerving her ſiſter to be bathed in tears, ſhe ſaid, "Weep not for me, for I feel as if I am going to glory, and I want you to meet me there." She then took leave of her father and mother in the ſame manner; then of the reſt of the family; leaving this charge with them all, "Try to meet me in glory." To her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhe ſaid, "Take care of your children, and bring them up in the fear of God; and don't forget to tell your other brother (who lived at a diſtance and was not preſent) to do the ſame by his." Then turning to ſome of the neighbours who were preſent, intreated them to meet her in glory, and then bid them all an affectionate fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
            <p>She then lay ſtill a while: but the nearer ſhe approached the heavenly Jeruſalem, the more lively and clear her views were, of the glory of the place. New diſcoveries, and ſtill more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious proſpects, ſeemed to open to her view; and her triumphant ſoul appeared to want nothing but wings: Indeed ſhe ſeemed inſenſible of her great weakneſs, and with a ſtrength of voice that was truly aſtonſhing, cried out, "Jeſus is come,
<pb facs="unknown:027054_0031_0FD38014F1FAF7B8"/>
and the glory of God ſhines brighter than I ever ſaw it before. Why will you not help me to praiſe him? O that all my neighbours were here, that I might tell them how good Jeſus is." She would extend her arms and ſay, "The door of mercy is yet open! Come, come for yet there is room! and the Lord is willing to ſave your ſouls." Thus ſhe continued for a conſiderable length of time, rejoicing—praiſing God—and exhorting the people. The ſolid, weighty and melting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which dropped from her lips at this time:—the deep and genuine piety that they breathed:—the affectionate and pathetic man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which ſhe delivered them:—and the cheerfulneſs of her countenance during the whole time; were enough to ſtrike conviction into the hardeſt hearts. She continued happy all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, but her bodily ſtrength failed; and ſhe lay ſtill calmly reſigned, and cheerfully ſubmiſſive to her fate.</p>
            <p>Obſerving in the evening, among thoſe who came to viſit her, ſome whoſe ſtates ſhe feared were dangerous; ſhe did not ſail to tell them "That ſhe feared for their ſouls!" And earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreated them to ſeek and ſerve God. To one who aſked her how ſhe was? ſhe replied "poorly in body, but happy in ſoul! I wiſh <hi>you</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:027054_0032_0FD3801683976F00"/>
could ſay ſo: you are a kind man, and have done me many favours, and never denied me one: I have ſtill one more to aſk, and hope you will not deny me that:—It is that you will try to ſave your ſoul?" This laſt, important, and dying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt he durſt not deny, but promiſed he would; which appeared to give her much ſatisfaction. To another ſhe ſaid "Now is the time! and it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry precious therefore redeem time and prepare for eternity."</p>
            <p>Theſe her dying requeſts, 'tis to be hoped were not in vain. Some good effects have already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and we truſt that when her ſleeping duſt ſhall awake ſhe will find ſome, who through her importunate intreaties, were prevailed on to ſeek and ſerve God, and will in conſequence ariſe with her to a glorious immortality.</p>
            <p>Friday March 1. The ſoreneſs in her mouth and throat increaſed: and although ſhe was a remarkable inſtance of patience and reſignation, yet at all times ſhe complained a little of this; though not from a murmuring or diſcontented principle, for theſe were ſtrangers to her breaſt.</p>
            <p>The ſprings of life now ſink apace, and the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſymptoms of approaching death, diſcover
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027054_0033_0FD38017F16D2708"/>
themſelves! What can be ſo deſirable in ſuch a ſituation, as an aſſurance of the favor of God? This aſſurance ſhe had been favored with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding day in a very uncommon manner. But how dreadful the thought of loſing this in times of the greateſt extremity? This, however diſtreſſing, appears to have been the caſe: For, as ſhe infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med one, "ſhe waded through deep waters for ſome hours." But the God whom ſhe ſerved was able to deliver her, and would not ſuffer her to be carried away of the flood. For although like one of old, "the waters might come in to her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul, yet was it for her good that through ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſhe might be made perfect:
<q>
                  <l>"That power at whoſe command the thunders roll,</l>
                  <l>"Curbs the wild ſtorm, and bids its fury ceaſe;</l>
                  <l>"Can whiſper comfort to the labouring ſoul,</l>
                  <l>"And huſh its ſorrows into laſting peace."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>When, therefore, he whom the winds and the ſeas obey, ſhall ſpeak the word, all will be peace.</p>
            <p>Saturday 2. After this ſevere ſtorm had laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſome hours, He who has power to ſay, "Hitherto ſhalt thou come, but no further, and here ſhall thy proud wave be ſtayed," <hi>He</hi> ſaid, "<hi>Peace! be ſtill:</hi> and, indeed, there was a great calm." She then dropped into a doze, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:027054_0034_0FD38019B18CEBD8"/>
to enjoy comfortable reſt in ſleep for ſome time. When ſhe awoke, ſhe ſaid to her mother, "I want you to breakfaſt early," and being told that they had breakfaſted, ſhe ſaid very well." Her mother aſked, "what do you want, my child?" She replied, "I told you I ſhould have three hard ſtruggles, and then I ſhould go: they are over." Her mother ſaid, "Do you dread death?" She ſaid "not at all." After lying ſtill for ſome time, ſhe ſaid, "I feel ſtrange; but I don't think I ſhall die to day." This appeared ſtrange to thoſe preſent; one of whom ſays, "we were expecting every moment to ſee her depart." She then cloſed her eyes and appeared to doze, but ſoon after burſt into raptures of praiſe, ſaying, "wonderful, wonderful! Why don't you help me praiſe God?" She then aſked for a little water, to waſh her mouth, that ſhe might, as ſhe ſaid, "be the better enabled to praiſe God."</p>
            <p>She ſeemed, (during the time ſhe appeared to doze) to have a view of, and communion with ſome of the bleſſed inhabitants of the celeſtial world! This will not appear ſtrange when we conſider that "they are <hi>miniſtering ſpirits,</hi> ſent forth to miniſter to the heirs of ſalvation." She had paſſed through many ſevere conflicts, and had
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:027054_0035_0FD3801CCAC53B90"/>
happily weathered the ſtorms: Her <hi>patience</hi> had been ſufficiently proved; and her <hi>faith</hi> like gold ſeven times tried. She was now juſt entering the conflict with her laſt enemy, "<hi>the King of Terrors</hi>:" And as ſhe had ſtood firm hitherto, her merciful and heavenly Father would not now forſake her; for "right precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints." <hi>He,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who has promiſed to be with his people, in, and through the valley of the ſhadow of death, no doubt commiſſioned a convoy of theſe miniſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits to earth, with the pleaſing and welcome news, "That her warfare was accompliſhed, her trials at an end, and her ſoul called to receive its reward. Indeed, it appears as if ſhe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſenſible, that ſuch a meſſage was arrived, for ſhe ſaid with an audible voice, and with a pleaſing cheerful countenance, "Don't leave me, I will go with you." Which abundantly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted that the ſting of death was quite deſtroyed, and her ſoul ripe for a glorious immortality.</p>
            <p>After taking a little refreſhment, ſhe deſired the company preſent to ſing an hymn. She deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a book might be brought to her, and choſe herſelf the following words, which they ſung, and ſhe, though her voice was extremely weak, joined with them in the praiſes of her great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:027054_0036_0FD38021F680F8F0"/>
Theſe being the laſt words in which ſhe ever attempted to attune the praiſes of God here below, we take the liberty of tranſcribing them.</p>

They appear to be the language of a ſoul ſtanding on the border of eternity, looking over the narrow ſea, death; and viewing, by faith, the glories of the place, of which the earthly Canaan was only a type. She appeared earneſtly to deſire to drop the clay tenement, and and to be with Chriſt, which is far better.</p>
            <p>After they had done ſinging the hymn, ſhe continued rejoicing and talking of God's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ſome time, then dropped into a doze, and ſlept calmly for about one hour; ſhe then awoke with a ſhortneſs of breath, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid "Lord have Mercy on me." When aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what ſhe wanted, ſhe would ſay, "reſt." The pangs of death were now ſtrong upon her, but ſhe would frequently ſay,
<q>
                  <l>"My ſuffering time will ſoon be o'er,</l>
                  <l>"When I ſhall ſigh and weep no more."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Being aſked by Mr. G—, how ſhe was? replied, "Happy in God, and entirely reſigned to his will." What a comfort it is, (ſaid one) to have ſuch an aſſurance! She ſaid "Wonderful!, Wonderful!" One taking her leave of her ſaid
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:027054_0038_0FD38026634ACE28"/>
"God bleſs you my child; if I never ſee you more on earth, I will try to meet you in heaven." She ſaid "where parting will be no more," and ſoon after ſlept in Jeſus, and her ſpirit went to reſt, in the 27th year of her age.</p>
            <p>Thus lived, and thus died that humble and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout follower of her Lord, a remarkable inſtance of faith and patience. But—O reader thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo muſt die! This dreadful debt thou muſt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pay! Art thou prepared, or art thou yet a ſinner? Reſolve this queſtion before it is too late. Dreadful! horribly dreadful will it be to die without real religion! The many hard ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles this young woman encountered will clearly evince, that death is no trifling thing! Then to prevent a miſerable death, take her advice,— follow her example,—and ſeek God with all your heart; So ſhall you die the death of the righteous, and your laſt end ſhall be like her's.</p>
