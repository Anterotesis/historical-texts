            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>AS the following ſhort Treatiſe was haſtily wrote, it may probably appear incorrect to the judicious; but as the Deſign was to repreſent the Value and Importance of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Colonies to this Kingdom, I hope it will anſwer my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of promoting the public Good.</p>
            <p>Their Trade and Produce have not hitherto been properly encouraged, altho' their Utility may be eaſily comprehended; a ſmall Bounty on the ſeveral rough Materials they are capable of raiſing, and ſhipping <hi>Home,</hi> would ſoon enable them to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Nation with a Variety of Articles, in Return for its Manufactures, which are now purchaſed of Foreigners with <hi>Caſh,</hi> and imported in their <hi>Ships.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Settling of <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> will in a few Years render the preſent Inhabitants induſtrious and uſeful, whereby it may be juſtly accounted a moſt valuable Acquiſition, which will be the more conſiderable, as the Conditions of its Settlement may be ſo advantageouſly calculated as to fill it without draining our Mother Country of its Inhabitants. For this Purpoſe I have deſcribed the Soil, Quality, and Manner of improving the ſeveral Parts of it from my own Obſervation, whereby it will appear how eaſily it may be effected at a very ſmall Charge, compared with the Benefits that will naturally reſult from it.— But if they were doubtful, yet the Advantages the <hi>French</hi> might otherwiſe make of this Province, and the Want of an effectual Barrier for ſecuring the Poſſeſſion, Trade, and Fiſhery of the Northern Colonies againſt their Efforts in a future War, ſufficiently demonſtrate the Neceſſity of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out of their Hands, without being diverted by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:006346_0004_1028A95342811148"/>of the Expence; and this is the more obvious, and important, as they will always be expoſed to the Attacks of the <hi>French,</hi> from the Neighbourhood of <hi>Cape Breton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt here beg the Reader's Indulgence for ſaying a Word in Support of my Remarks on that <hi>Iſland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſenſible that a high Opinion has been conceived of its Worth, and with good Reaſon, from the concurrent Accounts of both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Writers; but as the former have been principally copied from the latter, their Veracity may be fairly called in Queſtion: This I have a Right to do, from the exacteſt Information I could obtain on the <hi>Spot,</hi> and I can ſafely appeal to the moſt intelligent Perſons, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided there long enough to make proper Obſervations, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what I have advanced.</p>
            <p>By fortifying <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> by encouraging the Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its Produce to be wrought up here, and promoting the Fiſhery in Time of Peace; by ſtationing a proper Naval Force there, and on the Coaſt of <hi>New-England</hi> in Time of War, this Kingdom may ſecure to itſelf all the Advantages that could have aroſe from the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> at a leſs Expence than would have been requiſite for keeping ſo large a <hi>Fortreſs</hi> in Repair, and defending it with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Garriſon.</p>
            <p>Settling of the <hi>Cape Sable</hi> Shore, will undoubtedly make a Winter's Cod-Fiſhery practicable, and may ſoon become more conſiderable than any that has ever been proſecuted, and as the Fiſh caught and cured in that Seaſon exceeds all others, they will of courſe come to a better Market in all Parts of the World.</p>

            <head>THE STATE OF THE <hi>North-American</hi> Trade and Settlements, conſidered; With a particular ACCOUNT of NOVA SCOTIA.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>GREAT-BRITAIN</hi> has enjoyed the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of a moſt extenſive Commerce, ſince the Diſcovery of <hi>America,</hi> which, if properly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, will contribute more to its future Intereſt, than any other Branches of Trade, by enlarging the Demand for all its Manufactures, and increaſing the Means of its Naval Force.</p>
            <p>That the Riches and Strength of this Nation depend principally on its Commerce with foreign Countries, and its own Colonies, is a Fact that needs no Illuſtration; it being equally true in Regard to all trading Kingdoms; for the Increaſe of Wealth and Power has generally been proportionate to the Englargement of their Trade, and
<pb facs="unknown:006346_0006_1028A954DCEC3C60"/>Hiſtory fully proves, that Ruin and Deſolation have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attended the Loſs of it; the moſt flouriſhing are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to it for their Grandeur, and the moſt opulent and powerful have been undone by the Neglect of it.</p>
            <p>As every State in <hi>Europe</hi> ſeems deſirous of increaſing its Trade, and the Acquiſition of Wealth enlarges the Means of Power, it is neceſſary, in order to preſerve an Equality with them, that this Kingdom extends its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in proportion; but to acquire a Superiority, due Encouragement ought to be given to ſuch of its Branches, as will moſt effectually enrich its Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>As Trade enables the Subject to ſupport the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Government, the leſſening or deſtroying that of a Rival, has the ſame effect, as if this Kingdom had enlarged the Sources of its own Wealth; it is evident from hence, that it is not ſufficient to ſupport the Credit of a Country with its Neighbours, that its Commerce be enlarged only, unleſs its Increaſe be proportionate to theirs: But, as an Aſcendency is to be gained by checking the Growth of theirs, as well as by the Increaſe of our own, whenever one of theſe happens to be the Conſequence of the other to this Nation, its Figure and Reputation will riſe to a greater Height than ever.</p>
            <p>My Purpoſe being to ſhew how ſar theſe good Effects may be produced by encouraging the <hi>North American</hi> Trade and Settlements, I ſhall confine myſelf to thoſe Branches which are capable of the greateſt Improvement.</p>
            <p>That <hi>the Riches of a Country conſiſts in the Number of its Inhabitants,</hi> is an Expreſſion that drops from the Pen of every Writer; but it muſt always be underſtood, that thoſe Inhabitants are properly employed, and ſuitably encouraged; for, otherwiſe, it would appear to be an odd Poſition, that a Country ſhould be called rich, when it is only filled with Vagabonds and Beggars.</p>
            <p>But when it is conſidered, that the Northern <hi>Colonies,</hi> in leſs than <hi>five</hi> Years, have loſt above <hi>ſeven thouſand</hi> of their moſt active and induſtrious Inhabitants by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Ardour in exerting themſelves for the public
<pb facs="unknown:006346_0007_1028A91EA3AF19F0"/>Good, beſides a Habit of Idleneſs that has been contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a large Body, which has been long in Arms wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Employment; to which may be added <hi>three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> more, who having entred on board his Majeſty's Ships of War, and Privateers, are never like to return; their loſs will appear almoſt invaluable, and not to be repaired but by replacing a much ſuperiour Number of Men in the Country. From the apparent Connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Northern Colonies and the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and their joint Relation to this Kingdom, it is evident, that the Increaſe of Inhabitants in the former, will contribute more to the common Intereſt, than employing the like Number at Home. This, Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> in a Treatiſe on Trade, has demonſtrated to be nearly in proportion of five to one; from whence it follows, that the before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Loſs is equal to that of <hi>fifty thouſand</hi> Labourers and Artificers here; and in regard to thoſe Colonies vaſtly exceeds the Grant lately made them by Parliament, as the Value of their Labour for <hi>three</hi> Years only would have been equal to that Sum; and notwithſtanding a Jealouſy has been frequently excited on account of their Growth, it will appear, that the Commerce and Naval Power of this Kingdom will greatly depend on their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Encouragement and Protection.</p>
            <p>The Policy and Wiſdom of a Covernment diſcovers itſelf in nothing more evidently, than by proportioning its Influences ſo as to ſupport, and cheriſh the Circulation of Trade, and Manufactures, in its minute Parts, as well as its large and more opulent Members; the ſmaller Wheels in a Machine being as neceſſary to make it uſeful as the largeſt, and commonly require the niceſt Skill of the Artificer in their Regulation: And without a due Regard be had in every State to the Trade of its Individuals, there is the greateſt Danger of the weaker Parts being oppreſſed by the ſtronger; and whenever this happens, the Extremities are ſure of being the firſt, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the greateſt Sufferers, as by their Remoteneſs from the Vitals, they feel leſs of their Influences, and labour longeſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006346_0008_1028A956625AC4F0"/>under their Diſtreſs; and although Diſorders of this Kind do not immediately affect the whole, yet the ſmalleſt Obſtructions, if not ſeaſonably removed, often produce a general Stagnation, and may prove as dangerous to the political, as to the natural Body.</p>
            <p>It may not be improper to obſerve, before I proceed any farther, that ſome Perſons, either thro' Prejudice, or for Want of better Information, are too apt to inſinuate, that <hi>great Care ought to be taken, leſt thoſe Colonies grow too powerful, and ſet up a Government of their own.</hi> This is ſo far from having the leaſt Foundation to ſupport it, that I am poſitive no People on Earth are more firmly attached to their Prince, than they are to his Majeſty and the preſent Eſtabliſhment, being all Proteſtants, who have ever manifeſted the greateſt Abhorrence of Popery, by which Means Roman Catholicks have been always deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from ſettling in the Country, and their conſtant, and repeated Demonſtrations of Zeal and Loyalty to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Government, are ſufficient to clear them from every Aſperſion of this Kind; but to make the Matter more evident, it may be obſerved, that if they were <hi>ten</hi> Times more populous, and wealthy than they are at preſent, no Motive could be urg'd of ſufficient Weight to induce them to a Revolt; neither the Love of Liberty, <hi>Force of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, Burthen of Taxes,</hi> or Deſire of becomeing more powerful, could poſſibly Influence them to ſtruggle for Independency: If the Love of Power and Liberty ſhould be taken into Conſideration, 'tis apparent that they enjoy as great a Share of both as any of his Majeſty's Subjects, and much more than if they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> independent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for, in that caſe, they muſt be ſuppoſed to put themſelves into the Hands of ſome foreign State, which could protect them from the juſt Reſentment of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and it is well known that is not to be done; but if it could, to whom are they to apply that would continue to them the Liberties they enjoy now? No People in their Senſes would ſubject themſelves to the <hi>French, Spaniards</hi> or <hi>Dutch,</hi> with a View of ſecuring their Privileges with
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006346_0009_1028A92230240150"/>greater Tranquility than <hi>they</hi> at preſent enjoy them; and ſhould they aim at abſolute Independency, the Expence of defending themſelves would infinitely exceed any they have yet been ſubject to, and indeed, they could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without the Protection of their Mother Country.</p>
            <p>As to any Diſcontents that might ariſe from Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or the Burthen of Taxes, they are ſubject to none but ſuch as reſult from the Laws of their own making, an Indulgence they eſteem themſelves ſecured of under a Proteſtant King, and which gives them a Share of Power equal to their Deſires; and as their very Being, in a Manner, depends on this Kingdom, their Trade is ſo cloſely connected with, and grafted on it, that nothing would ſo effectually ruin them, as to be deprived of it; for were they to be ſupplied with <hi>European</hi> Goods by any other State, the Difference would prove fatal to them. Upon the whole, nothing can, nor ever will, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon them to attempt, or think of a State of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, whilſt they enjoy the Freedom of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects under ſo happy a Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>But if, after all, it be thought dangerous to ſuffer the Colonies to grow too large, leſt they ſhould take it into their Heads to revolt, 'tis pretty extraordinary, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>French, Dutch</hi> nor <hi>Spaniards</hi> have ever been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from promoting their <hi>American</hi> Settlements; their Caſe is widely different from ours; were the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Dutch</hi> Colonies, for inſtance, to revolt to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it would ſcarce be poſſible for <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain them; but as to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions in <hi>America,</hi> not all the Force of Old <hi>Spain,</hi> if it was contiguous to that Continent, would be ſufficient to reduce them; and although there is ſcarce a Native of <hi>America</hi> that is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to hold a Poſt of Profit, they wear their Chains with great Contentment; but to ſuppoſe a People ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to none of theſe Grievances capable of a ſingle Thought of ſetting up for themſelves, is branding them with a Diſpoſition ſo fooliſh and unaccountable as cannot well be conceived.</p>

To ſhew what may be ſaved to the Kingdom, as well as gained by its enlarged Trade to the Northern Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, 'tis to my Purpoſe to obſerve, that the Sugar-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies could not ſubſiſt without them: Moſt of the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for their Buildings and Works, as well as Proviſions, Caſk for Spirits, Sugars, Molaſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> come from thence, and that they conſtantly ſend the greateſt Part of their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects home in <hi>New England</hi> built Ships, without which they would not be able to bear the Duties paid in this Kingdom, by reaſon of the exceſſive Price of Freights.</p>
            <p>This, if rightly conſidered, will appear to be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of great Importance in regard to the <hi>French Weſt-Indies.</hi> Mr. <hi>Aſhley</hi> has very juſtly obſerved, That, <q>ſhould Plantation built Ships be diſcouraged, Freight would be ſo dear, as to loſe the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Advantages over its Rivals in Trade,—<hi>a low Freight;</hi> and from the great Traffick of the Kingdom, they muſt be compelled to buy Materials for building of Ships, of <hi>Foreigners,</hi> with Caſh, inſtead of their own Manufactures, to the enriching of ſuch <hi>Foreigners,</hi> and the Diſcouragement of our <hi>American Colonies:</hi> That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of prejudicing that Branch of Buſineſs here, the refitting and finiſhing Plantation built Ships often gives as much Advantage to the Shipwrights, as the building of new Ships. The <hi>French</hi> take the Benefit of our Plantation built Ships to carry their Sugars to <hi>Spain,</hi> and commonly pay them in the Produce of their own Iſlands, and have, in this Inſtance, a very great Advantage of us. "That the ſaving a Shilling or Eighteen-pence on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>per</hi> Hundred in the Article of Freight, would go near to enable us to under-ſell them at foreign Markets, if the Ships employed in the Sugar Trade were indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame Privileges, as thoſe which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Act Ships.</hi> That the flouriſhing State of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Commerce, and the Revenues ariſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, are, in no ſmall Degree, owing to <hi>a low Freight, occaſioned chiefly from our building Ships ſo cheap in our</hi> American <hi>Plantations.</hi> That ſince the <hi>French</hi> ſtruggle
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006346_0011_1028A923B56042C8"/>ſo hard to gather Strength in <hi>America,</hi> ſurely it is the true Intereſt of this Kingdom to do ſo too, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage its Northern, as well as its Southern Colonies, ſo that they may both contribute to the Support and Benefit of their Mother Country. <hi>"The Northern Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies are a great Support to the Naval Power of</hi> Great-Britain, <hi>and aſſiſt, in a great Meaſure, in giving us a Superiority at Sea over all other Nations in the World:</hi> They ſupply the King's Yards with great Quantities of Maſts, Yards and Bowſprits inſtead of thoſe of foreign Growth, with Pitch, Tar and Turpentine, for all which immenſe Quantities of Goods are exported from <hi>Great Britain,</hi> which prevents five Times the Value thereof from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Kingdom in Caſh to <hi>Sweden,</hi> and other foreign Countries.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All the Articles with which the <hi>Britiſh Weſt Indies</hi> are ſupplied, require a great Number of Artificers and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Men to fit them for Shipping; and they are in ſuch Demand, as to be the moſt conſiderable Branch of the <hi>New England</hi> Trade, although the Price of every Article is ſo high, as greatly to affect the Value and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Produce; but if the Price of Labour in the Northern Colonies could be reduced <hi>fifty per Cent.</hi> the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Iſlands would receive all their Supplies ſo much cheaper as to be able, in <hi>thirty</hi> or <hi>forty</hi> Years, to double their Remittances, and, conſequently, the Duties paid on Importation.</p>
            <p>By enlarging the Trade, and increaſing the Number of Inhabitants in the Northern Colonies, their Demand and Abilities to pay for <hi>Britiſh</hi> Goods would be proportionable.</p>
            <p>But the Price of the ſeveral Commodities with which the Sugar-Colonies are ſupplied, and thoſe which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>England,</hi> is much higher than if the Country was fuller of Inhabitants, the Want of which diſables the Merchant from ſhipping its Produce, but to his own Loſs, unleſs he carefully attends to ſuch Articles as, by a Fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation peculiar to Trade, come to a better Market at one time than another; but were the Price of Labour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006346_0012_1028A95BA5A42778"/>every Cargo he ſhipped would ſtand charged at a lower Price, and he would be enabled to pay more for his Goods in <hi>England</hi> as ſoon as they are purchaſed.</p>
            <p>The Reduction of the Price of Freight from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> by increaſing the Number of Ships, is an Article of great Conſequence to the Sugar Iſlands, in which they cannot well be eaſed, but by Means of the Northern Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; for their Conſumption of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures is ſo inconſiderable, compared with the Effects they ſend Home, that the Owners of Veſſels here muſt fit them out for the common Profit of Freights from there only; but the Merchants in <hi>New-England</hi> are conſtantly employed in building Ships for their Correſpondents in this Kingdom, which are full freighted from <hi>Boſton</hi> to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> and very often the Profit is equal to, and ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that of the Freight to <hi>England,</hi> ſo that the Increaſe of Ships will not only oblige them to carry their Freights cheaper, but will occaſion a conſtant and large Supply of all the North <hi>American</hi> Produce, by which they will be enabled to increaſe their Stock, ſettle new Plantations, and, in a few Years, pay double the Duty here upon the Produce of their own Iſlands, which is an Event that principally depends on the Increaſe of Inhabitants in the Northern Colonies.</p>
            <p>The eaſier to comprehend the Certainty of this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it is neceſſary to caſt our Eyes a while on the <hi>French</hi> Sugar-Iſlands, whoſe Supplies have commonly coſt them <hi>thirty</hi> or <hi>forty per Cent.</hi> more than our own; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, the Progreſs they have made ſince the laſt War, bids fair for ſupplying all <hi>Europe</hi> with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, and whenever they are furniſhed with the Produce of <hi>North-America,</hi> as cheap as our Iſlands, they will be able to underſell us at all foreign Markets.</p>
            <p>An Objection has often been made againſt promoting the Intereſt of the Northern Colonies, on account of the inconſiderable Proportion they pay to the public Revenue, notwithſtanding it is pretty evident, that neither the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Colonies, nor the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> would be able to pay
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006346_0013_1028A9264C2A4200"/>any Duties at all, were it not for the Supplies and Aſſiſtance of the former: But ſuppoſing this was not the Caſe, and that the Northern Colonies yearly receive <hi>ſix hundred</hi> thouſand Pounds in <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures, which are paid for in ſuch Articles as are conſumed in <hi>England,</hi> and pay no Duty; on the other hand, the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Iſlands year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive the Value of <hi>four hundred</hi> thouſand Pounds in <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures, and remit <hi>ſix hundred</hi> thouſand Pounds Sterling in Sugars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that pay Duty here, this Kingdom gains more by the former than the latter; this follows from the Duty's being paid finally by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumer; for were it taken off, certainly the Price of Sugars would fall in proportion, and, conſequently, the whole Amount of the Duty would be ſaved by the Conſumers; and was it to be laid on the Produce of the Northern Colonies in the ſame Proportion, all the Difference would conſiſt in ſhifting the Payment from the Conſumers of the former to the Conſumers of the latter, and yet the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject pays it here in either Caſe.</p>
            <p>But what moſt nearly concerns the Intereſt of <hi>Great Britain</hi> is, the ſurprizing Progreſs the <hi>French</hi> have made, and are ſo intent in purſuing, by Means of their Plantation-Trade; it is evident, that the Supplies of Proviſions from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and both Proviſions and Lumber from <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> have been no inconſiderable Means of their Growth; but to leave them both out of the Queſtion, the <hi>French</hi> are endeavouring, by all poſſible Means, to furniſh themſelves with theſe Articles from their own <hi>Northern</hi> Colonies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were, for ſome Time, poſſeſſed of the Sea-Coaſt of <hi>North America,</hi> before the <hi>French</hi> had made any conſiderable Progreſs in it; they at firſt ſettled on the North Side of the River <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> and gradually extended their Settlements from thence to the Mouth of <hi>Miſſiſipi</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, cultivating the ſtricteſt Harmony with the Natives, by inter-Marriages, and proſelyting them to the <hi>Romiſh Faith,</hi> whereby they maintain a regular Correſpondence through ſeveral Lakes, and large Branches of thoſe Rivers, for near <hi>eight hundred</hi> Leagues, on the Back of all the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:006346_0014_1028A95E93ECE808"/>Colonies; this not only makes them Maſters of the <hi>Furr</hi> Trade, but will in Time put it in their Power to furniſh <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> with all Sorts of Naval Stores, Ships, Iron, Hemp, Flax, and every thing elſe they are in Want of that is produced in <hi>North America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſenſible thoſe Parts of <hi>New France</hi> that lie in the moſt Northern Latitudes, are not likely to produce many of thoſe Articles; but as they claim a Tract of Land of vaſt Extent, <hi>viz.</hi> from New <hi>Orleans</hi> on the South, to the Latitude of <hi>ſixty Degrees</hi> North, which is above <hi>ſix hundred</hi> Leagues; and in Breadth from the Streights of <hi>Belliſle</hi> in Longitude <hi>fifty-ſeven</hi> Weſt, to the Lake <hi>De Bois,</hi> is not leſs than <hi>ſix hundred</hi> Leagues from Eaſt to Weſt, every thing is to be found in it that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies can boaſt of.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>French</hi> have artfully extended their Lines within our Colonies, not only with a Deſign to cut off our Communication, and trade with the Natives, but to croud ſuch of them into the Sea, as are too weak to make a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and, finally, to maſter the whole Continent.</p>
            <p>This is not an Event that may ſeem practicable in an Age, but yet the Continuance of the ſame Zeal and Care in promoting their Settlements for thirty Years to come, which has ſo manifeſtly evinced itſelf for thirty Years paſt, would render it no difficult Undertaking; beſides, the ambitious Views of <hi>France</hi> leave no room to doubt, but they will attempt what their Intereſt ſo evidently calls for; it is beyond Diſpute that their Proceedings on this Plan will ſoon put it in their Power; the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> only for twenty Years in Peace or War, would be no inconſiderable Means of effecting it.</p>
            <p>Should the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies be neglected, or not equally countenanced with the <hi>French,</hi> or to make it worſe, ſhould an unſeaſonable and groundleſs Jealouſy be the Means of checking their Growth, and diſcouraging their Settlements, whilſt the <hi>French</hi> are ſtriving with all their Might to cheriſh theirs, and ſpare neither Art, Labour nor Expence to make them conſiderable, ſurely no one can doubt but the Event muſt prove fatal to us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:006346_0015_1028A927D0D0FA38"/>
It is evident what Streſs the <hi>French</hi> lay upon North <hi>America,</hi> from the immenſe Sums they have expended to ſecure their Poſſeſſions, and to reduce ours to their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; the Charge of fortifying <hi>Louiſburgh</hi> and <hi>Quebec,</hi> the Penſions and Salaries yearly paid in <hi>Canada,</hi> the Loſs attending Duke <hi>D'Anville</hi>'s fruitleſs Attempt on <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> and <hi>Cape Breton,</hi> and the great additional One of their Fleet the laſt Year, muſt amount to an immenſe Sum; one tenth Part of which expended in the ſettling of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> would be productive of ſuch Advantages in the Increaſe of the moſt valuable Brances of Trade, as would exceed the whole Expence the <hi>French</hi> have been at in promoting and ſecuring their Colonies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Whale</hi>-Fiſhery, which is now totally neglected, might be rendered very profitable if properly attended to; how this Nation ſhould have diſcontinued it ſo long is difficult to account for, but it may be obſerved ſince the Merchants here decline it, that the Manner of fitting Veſſels, Boats, Craft, and killing the Fiſh, in practice amongſt the <hi>New-England</hi>-Men, exceeds that of any People in <hi>Europe,</hi> makes their Succeſſes more certain and their Voyages leſs expenſive, but the Want of Seamen prevents their proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of it to Advantage; by transferring this Buſineſs from the <hi>Dutch</hi> to the Colonies, they might not only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>Great-Britain</hi> with Bone and Oil for home Conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but with large Quantities for Exportation, and increaſe the Demand for <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures.</p>
            <p>After having thus lightly touched upon theſe Points, I preſume it will be agreeable to give a brief Deſcription of the Northern <hi>Colonies,</hi> more particularly of thoſe Parts which are moſt commodious for new Settlements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>NEW-ENGLAND</hi> is bounded by <hi>New-York</hi> on the Weſt, New <hi>France</hi> on the North Weſt, <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> on the North-Eaſt, and the main Ocean on the Eaſt and South, extending about <hi>one hundred and twenty</hi> Leagues from South to North, and <hi>eighty</hi> Leagues in Breadth from Eaſt to Weſt; theſe Limits comprehend four different Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>viz.</hi> the Provinces of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Bay, and

            <p>
               <hi>NOVASCOTIA</hi> extends from North to South a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>one hundred and twenty</hi> Leagues, and from Eaſt to Weſt about <hi>one hundred,</hi> comprehending all the Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Cape <hi>Sable</hi> and <hi>Canſo</hi> on the South Eaſt, and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>St Lawrence</hi> on the North-Weſt; and beſides its being equally commodious with <hi>Newfoundland</hi> for the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, its Harbours are ſo numerous and fine, as not to be exceeded in any Part of the World. It abounds with Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Trout, Eels, and ſeveral other Sorts of freſh water Fiſh, a great Plenty of wild Fowl of different Sorts, its Woods are ſtock'd with Deer, Rabbits, and an uncommon Variety of furr'd Animals: Its Soil is very fertile, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Kinds of Grain and Proviſions: The Country is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Aſh, Beech, Elm, Firs, Maple, Cedar, and Pines fit for Naval Uſes, and abounds with Lime-Stones and fine Quarries for building.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CAPE BRETON</hi> lying a little to the Eaſtward of this Tract, is neither ſo fertile, nor ſo capable of Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it is both rocky, cold and barren, abounding neither
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006346_0017_1028A930AC675328"/>with Furrs, nor Timber for building of Ships, its principal, if not only Advantages conſiſting in its Situation, Harbours, which are in the Center of all the Fiſhing-Banks on the North <hi>American</hi> Coaſts.</p>
            <p>The Iſland of <hi>NEWFOUNDLAND</hi> lies between the 46th and 52d <hi>Degree</hi> of North Latitude, and is about <hi>three hundred</hi> Miles in Length, and near as broad, is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Fiſhing Banks, and many fine Harbours, is very commodious for the Fiſhery, having every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency for promoting it, and by its Situation, being the moſt eaſterly Part of North <hi>America,</hi> has the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all other Parts, on account of its Nearneſs to the <hi>European</hi> Markets, but it is not likely to admit of any great Improvements, the Climate being too cold, and the Soil but indifferent.</p>
            <p>As there is very little Difference in the Temperature of the Air, in the ſeveral Parts of <hi>New England,</hi> ſo its ſeveral Products, and Aptneſs for different Improvements, vary but in a few Particulars, the Southermoſt being moſt natural for Corn, and the Northern for grazing, and afford a much greater Plenty of Timber and Fiſh.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Iſlands are furniſhed from hence with Horſes, and ſeveral Kinds of live Stock; Flower, Bread, Peaſe, ſalted Beef, Pork, Codfiſh, Mackrel, Herrings, Cyder, Butter, Onlons, Oil, Turpentine. Ships, Timber, Plank, Boards, Maſts and Yards, Bricks, Shingles, Staves and Hoops; the Southern <hi>Colonies</hi> with Rum, Ships, Deal-Boards, Bricks and <hi>European</hi> Goods; <hi>Newfoundland</hi> with Rum, Moloſſes, imported Salt for the Fiſhery, and all Sorts of Proviſions; <hi>Great Britain</hi> and the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> with Codfiſh, Ships, Train Oil, Whalebone, Deer ſkins, Peltry, Staves, Maſts and Yards, Pitch, Tar, Turpentine, raw Hides, Bees-Wax, and Bayberry Wax, the Profit of all which ſeveral Branches of Buſineſs finally center in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>In theſe Colonies, the Lands which are already cleared of Timber, and improved for Tillage and Paſture, are very far from yielding ſuch Profit to the Owner, as they
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006346_0018_1028A963B0162670"/>are capable of, for Want of Manuring, and being proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdivided into ſmaller Allotments, which the great Price of Labour now makes impracticable; but as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has furniſhed the Country with ſeveral Sorts of Marle and Sea Ware, whenever the Farmer has been able to enrich the Soil with them, the Produce of his Lands has paid his Expence, and greatly raiſed their Value, yet by Reaſon of the Scarcity of Labourers, very few can bear the Charge of ſo neceſſary a Cultivation; but by increaſing their Number, the Country may ſoon be enabled to do it, and conſequently to ſupply the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Iſlands at a much cheaper Rate than they can now.</p>
            <p>A Number of Inhabitants ſettled on the uncultivated Lands in <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> would not be able to furniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Proviſions for the firſt Year, but as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is full of fine Harbours, Lakes and Rivers, the Lands are covered (as was before obſerved) with Timber, and the Sea-Coaſt plentifully ſtocked with Fiſh and wild Fowl, it will ſoon be in their power to ſupport themſelves
<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>French</hi> King has commonly defrayed the Charge of tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Subjects to <hi>America,</hi> and maintaining them a Year after their Arrival; and the Intereſt of this Kingdom never called for a more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Expence, than that of felling this Province with Proteſtants.</note>.</p>
            <p>It will be of great Conſequence to the firſt Settlers in this Country, that in clearing and ſubduing their Lands, they will be paid for their Labour by converting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce into Ship-Timber, Planks, Maſts, Deal-Boards, Shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, Staves and Hoops, all which may be carried from their Plantations to Market, by Veſſels that will ſupply them with Horſes, Cattle, Swine, and other Neceſſaries, to ſtock their improved Lands.</p>
            <p>With theſe Advantages, 'tis eaſy to foreſee how ſoon it is practible to bring forward new Settlements in a Country which is ſo well furniſhed with Supplies, and is ſo near <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a Market that will always take off their Produce, and enable them to raiſe their Proviſions, to build their Houſes, and ſtock their Plantations, and in a few Years to export
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006346_0019_1028A92B5BCD89D8"/>many valuable Commodities in Veſſels of their own, whilſt they are promoting the Trade of their Country.</p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid it will appear, that if <hi>New-England</hi> and <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> were fully inhabited, and the Lands brought under Improvement, they would be able to furniſh the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> with Proviſions, and other Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in larger Quantities, than they are capable of export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now, and their Remittances to <hi>England</hi> would not only become more conſiderable, but cheaper to the Merchant, by reducing the Price of Labour.</p>
            <p>The Advantages that may ariſe to this Kingdom from ſeveral other Improvements in the Northern <hi>Colonies,</hi> when they are fully inhabited, is worthy of a particular Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the <hi>Country</hi> is every where very apt to produce the very beſt of Flax, and in many Places is natural for Hemp, both which are Articles of very great Conſequence to this Kingdom, as the Manufucture of Linnen-Cloth within it, bears but a ſmall Proportion to its Conſumption.

            <p>The great Plenty of Iron Ore in many Parts of the <hi>Country,</hi> will enable them not only to ſupply this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with vaſt Quantities of Pig Iron, but Iron in Bars, cheaper and equal in Goodneſs to the beſt <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or <hi>Swede</hi>'s Iron, which laſt, according to a late Calculation, draws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>two hundred thouſand</hi> Pounds yearly from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in Money, and 'tis well known that if Labour was reduced a quarter Part in <hi>New England,</hi> they could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a Quantity equal in Value to that Sum cheaper than 'tis now imported, and receive their Returns in <hi>Britiſh</hi> Goods.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, it will enable them to ſecure the Cod-fiſhery to this Kingdom, by making it more beneficial and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive than it ever has been, as the Proceeds of their Voyages will be remitted to <hi>England</hi> in Caſh, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for freſh Supplies of its Commodities will be encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and its fineſt Nurſery for Seamen enlarged.</p>

There is one Article which has excited the Jealouſy of this Nation more than all the Improvements the Colonies are capable of proſecuting, and that is, the raiſing of Wool, and as this has never been properly repreſented, I conclude it may be acceptable now; the Inhabitants of <hi>New England</hi> and <hi>New York</hi> are ſuppoſed to conſume one with another <hi>thirty</hi> Shillings <hi>Sterling</hi> yearly in <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufactures, two Thirds of which conſiſt of Woollens, and according to Mr. <hi>London</hi>'s Pamphlet, in proportion to their Numbers is equal to the Conſumption within this Kingdom; It will appear from his Calculations, that <hi>five hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> Packs of Wool weighing <hi>two hundred and forty Pounds</hi> Weight each, are yearly wrought up in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> amounting to <hi>twenty-one Millions,</hi> of which more than one half being exported, the Number of Inhabitans, at <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Shillings each Perſon, exceeds the Value of the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; This may be eaſily demonſtrated, by comparing the Number of People in theſe <hi>Colonies,</hi> amounting to <hi>four hundred thouſand,</hi> to the Value of their <hi>Britiſh</hi> Importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is above <hi>ſix hundred thouſand Pounds</hi> yearly, from whence it follows, that they annually conſume more Woollen Cloaths than an equal Number of Inhabitants in this Kingdom; but as they are known to raiſe Wool in <hi>New-England,</hi> it will be a Queſtion, what becomes of it? to which it may be anſwered, that the Winter Seaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commonly longer, and ſeverer than it is here, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants require more Cloaths in proportion, which may be eſtimated at a ſixth Part; beſides their uſual Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being very different from thoſe of ſedentary Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and indoors Manufacturers, may well be ſuppoſed to enlarge their Conſumption.</p>
            <p>It will appear from the foregoing Computation, that theſe Colonies produce about <hi>two thouſand</hi> Packs of Wool annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, which is <hi>four hundred and ninety nine</hi> leſs in Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Inhabitants, than grows in <hi>Great Britain.</hi> This Account may the more eaſily be credited, by comparing it with the Number of Sheep ſlaughtered in the Courſe of each Year, obſerving, that as they are ſmall, their Fleeces do not
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006346_0021_1028A92DE4853E40"/>weigh above <hi>two Pounds</hi> one with another. But it may ſerve more effectually to remove all Apprehenſions of the <hi>Colonies</hi> being ever able to prejudice this Nation in the Woollen Manufacture, to obſerve, that their Sheep are not only liable to various Diſtempers, but are ſhort-liv'd, and their Wool is of a very coarſe Staple; for when the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from Year to Year admit of little or no Variation, they are frequently ſubject to a cutaneous Diſorder, which being renewed with every Spring, cauſes an Itching that ſeldom leaves them till they wear off their Fleeces by frequently rubbing themſelves againſt every thing that preſents itſelf to View, and when the Weather proves dry, and hotter than common, they tear their Skins as well as Coats, and are ſoon Fly-blown, rotten, and deſtroyed; this has often proved ſo contagious as to end in the Deſtruction of half the Sheep in the Country; and when the Winter has been lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than uſual, 'tis a great Doubt whether their Loſſes don't exceed their Increaſe; for it has twice happened within twenty Years, that a third Part of all their Stock has been carried off by the extreme Severity of the Weather.</p>
            <p>It is uncommon to eat any Mutton in the Country of more than three Years Growth, from whence it follows, that inſtead of ſlaughtering one fifth of their Stock yearly, as is computed to be the Caſe here, they conſume a third Part, and their Fleeces falling ſhort one half in <hi>Weight,</hi> they muſt neceſſarily raiſe four times the Number of Sheep to produce an equal Quantity of Wool; but the Coarſneſs of its Staple, which exceeds that of <hi>French</hi> Wool, puts it out of their Power to fabricate fine Cloaths; and its Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs renders it of little Uſe but to be wrought into Stockings, and an ordinary Cloth which is more expenſive, and leſs durable, than a much finer imported from hence.</p>
            <p>It is evident from the preceding Account, that 'tis the Profit of their Mutton, rather than their Fleeces, that indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces them to raiſe any Sheep at all: Whenever their Lands have been enriched by Manuring, they find that the raiſing of Beef, Pork and Corn, which are Articles of Exportation, as well as Home Conſumption, is of greater Advantage; for
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006346_0022_1028A967E4585628"/>the whole Buſineſs of Huſbandry and heavy Carriages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed by Oxen, inſtead of Horſes, the former are doubly uſeful, and after a long Courſe of Servitude, by two Years Idleneſs and fattening, produce Beef that would cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the Stalls in <hi>Leaden-Hall</hi> Market.</p>
            <p>The Increaſe of Inhabitants in theſe <hi>Colonies</hi> will then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo far from being injurious to the Wollen Manufactury here, that it will contribute more to promote it, ſupplying an equal Number of People in any other Part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Dominions; but if it ſhould ever be otherways, it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Neceſſity, rather than Choice; for if they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly encouraged in raiſing of Hemp, Flax, Iron, and other rough Materials by a ſuitable Bounty, and in thoſe Branches of Trade and Navigation which are not prejudicial to the general Intereſt of the Kingdom, their Advantages would be infinitely greater, and their Labour leſs, than if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Wollen Manufactury: But if on the contrary, theſe ſeveral Articles are totally neglected, they will be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered incapable of making Remittances ſufficient to pay for <hi>Britiſh</hi> Cloaths, and muſt of Courſe manufacture the beſt they can for themſelves.</p>
            <p>The general Advantages that will ariſe from fortifying and ſettling <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> are to be conſidered as they regard the Views of <hi>France,</hi> as well as <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> have artfully laboured to make the moſt of the <hi>Nova Scotians,</hi> ever ſince their Subjection to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown; they have not only ſecured to them the Enjoyment of their Religion and Eſtates, but take care to furniſh them with Prieſts, who teach them to believe from their Infancy, that they are the Subjects of <hi>France,</hi> and they have always been equally uſeful to them; before the preſent War, they not only ſupplied the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Louiſburg</hi> with Proviſions, but with Wives, and were very ſerviceable to them in their Fiſhery, in piloting their Veſſels, and aſſiſting them in their Fortifications; and ſince its Reduction, have all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to ſupport, and many of them have actually joined a Body of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> in order, if poſſible, to get Poſſeſſion of <hi>Annapolis Royal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:006346_0023_1028A93339DB7278"/>
The Zeal and Attachment of theſe <hi>Nova Scotians</hi> to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith, will always prevent the Settlement of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> in the Country, unleſs it be done in compact Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and under the Cover of Fortifications; but till this is accompliſhed, it can no more be ſaid that the Province belongs to the Crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> becauſe it is poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of <hi>Annapolis Royal,</hi> than of the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> from our Poſſeſſion of <hi>Gibralter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore abſolutely neceſſary for the Safety and Intereſt of the Northern <hi>Colonies,</hi> that ſome ſpeedy, and effectual Meaſures are taken, to put theſe <hi>Nova Scotians</hi> on a different Footing, or to remove them; the laſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be done, and the firſt in nothing better than by encouraging a conſiderable Number of foreign Proteſtants, and others, to ſettle amondſt them.</p>
            <p>This will not only be of immediate Service, but in a few Years will produce various good Effects, as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try abounds with Pines and Firs, it will be capable of ſupplying this Kingdom with the fineſt Deal-Boards and Timber of all Kinds, in Veſſels of its own, which are now imported from <hi>Norway,</hi> the <hi>Baltic,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>foreign</hi> Bottoms, and drains the Nation of immenſe Sums of Money; this is not only practicable on the firſt Settlement of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> but in the Courſe of a few Years will become a ſteady and uſeful Branch of Buſineſs: But if none of theſe good Conſequences enſue, yet ſettling the Province with Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants is of the greateſt Importance, as the <hi>French</hi> will other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe continue to cheriſh the preſent Inhabitants, till they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Number, and are of more Conſequence than thoſe of <hi>Canada,</hi> and it requires no long Time to effect this, in a <hi>Country</hi> whoſe Inhabitants are not only very health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but very prolific; it muſt ſurely be deemed impoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic then to ſuffer ſuch a Colony of <hi>French</hi> Bigots to be rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up under the kindly Influences of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to cut our own People's Throats whenever the <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſhall conſecrate the Knife; notwithſtanding they hardly know the Name of a Tax or Duty, their <hi>Quit-Rent</hi> being but a Trifle, and thoſe who are at a great Diſtance from
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006346_0024_1028A96C8505F320"/>
               <hi>Annapolis,</hi> have ſeldom paid any; in the mean time, they have on all Occaſions manifeſted a Contempt of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Government when they could do it with Impunity, or were too remote from that <hi>Garriſon</hi> to ſend their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment.</p>
            <p>It therefore highly concerns this Kingdom, that ſome ſeaſonable Steps be taken to prevent their future Growth, and Defection; but it is very difficult to attempt, and almoſt impoſſible to effect their Removal, without Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and if they were diſpoſſeſſed, they would be a very great additional Strength to <hi>Canada</hi> and <hi>Cape Breton,</hi> as we could not prevent their ſettling in thoſe Places.</p>
            <p>It ſeems then more eligible to continue them in the Country, to permit them to hold ſuch Lands as are under actual Improvement, and to which they can make out a clear Title, for 'tis beyond Diſpute but they claim much larger Tracts than they have any Right to.</p>
            <p>Their Eſtates are held by Patent from the <hi>French</hi> King, for which they pay a very ſmall Acknowledgment, their Right was reſerved to them by the Articles of Capitulation at the Reduction of <hi>Annapolis,</hi> and was finally ratified by the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht;</hi> but as no civil Government has ever been eſtabliſhed there, they have no more to do with their new Maſters than to pay their Quit-Rent, which in the whole Province does not amount to <hi>forty Pounds</hi> a Year.</p>
            <p>When the Form of Government was eſtabliſhed, which is now exerciſed there, the Inſtructions to the Governor and Council were copied from thoſe of <hi>Virginia,</hi> whereby the Power of granting Lands is veſted in them, and is reſtricted to ſuch Conditions, as have hitherto proved a great Diſcouragement to his Majeſty's Subjects; for the Patentee is not only obliged to pay a Penny <hi>Sterling per</hi> Acre for the whole, but is ſubject to a Penny more when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Government ſhall demand it, and unleſs he has built a Houſe, and brought Part of his Lands under Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement within three Years from the Date of his Grant, he forfeits his Title: This attended with the conſtant
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006346_0025_1028A9371447A680"/>Obſtructions which both the <hi>French</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">It has always been found impracticable to ſettle here, without entering into a Conteſt with the <hi>French,</hi> who either have a real, or trump up an imaginary Title to the ſame Spot; and if that fails, the <hi>Indians</hi> are ſure to challenge the Property as Lords of the who'e. And indeed 'tis difficult to determine what Right the preſent Inhabitants have, or how extenſive it is, without a ſpecial Enquiry and Survey.</note>, and <hi>Indians</hi> have made in Prejudice to any Proteſtant Settlements, when compared with the eaſy Terms on which Lands are granted in other Parts of North <hi>America,</hi> evidently accounts for the preſent Situation of the Province.</p>
            <p>Since it is apparently for the public Intereſt, that the growing State of theſe <hi>Nova Scotians</hi> ſhould be checked, that they ſhould either be rendered uſeful, or prevented from becoming dangerous to the other Colonies, it cannot more effectually be done, than by erecting ſuch Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as will keep their moſt populous Towns in Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and at the ſame time ſerve as a Protection to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Settlements in the Province; a more particular Deſcription of which ſeems neceſſary in order to carry ſo uſeful a Deſign into Execution.</p>

               <hi>ABOUT ſeventeen</hi> Leagues North from Cape <hi>Sable,</hi> the Entrance of the Bay of <hi>Fundy</hi> commences, where it is about <hi>twenty</hi> Leagues wide, and extending near <hi>forty</hi> Leagues, divides itſelf into two Branches, one of which terminates in ſeveral Rivers, that diſcharge themſelves into <hi>Minas</hi> Bay, and the other running more Northerly to <hi>Chignecto,</hi> forms an <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of that Name between this Branch and the Bay of <hi>Vert,</hi> which empties itſelf into the Gulf of <hi>St. Lawrence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twelve</hi> Leagues from the aforeſaid Entrance on the South Side of the Bay, lies the Gut of <hi>Annapolis,</hi> which is about three Quarters of a Mile wide, and a Mile and an half long, on each Side of which the Land is very moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous and rocky; the Tides are ſo impetuous, as often to render this a dangerous Paſſage for large Veſſels, but when they are once in, a moſt delightful Harbour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents itſelf to View, called the <hi>Baſon</hi> of <hi>Annapolis,</hi> from the gradual Declivity of the Lands ſurrounding it, being

            <p>At the Month of this River are ſeveral ſmall <hi>French</hi> Villages, from whence 'tis about <hi>two</hi> ſhort Leagues to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napolis Royal,</hi> which ſtands upon a Point of Land, formed by this and another ſmall River that ranges about South Eaſt: The Situation of this Fortreſs being elevated <hi>ſixty</hi> or <hi>ſeventy</hi> Feet above the Level of the River, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on its Bank, renders an Attack from Ships almoſt impracticable, for the Strength of the Tides makes it very difficult for them to moor, unleſs it be in the Eddy or Counter-tide, which brings them too near the Shore to do any Execution.</p>
            <p>As it is ſituate on a Level with the <hi>Campain,</hi> there is nothing to prevent the regular Approaches of an <hi>Enemy</hi> on two Sides of the Garriſon; it is mounted with a about <hi>forty</hi> Cannon on <hi>four Baſtions,</hi> and has a Battery to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the River; its <hi>Ramparts</hi> are of Earth, covered with large Stocks of Timber towards the <hi>Foſſe;</hi> and it might make a good Defence, were its Powder <hi>Magazine</hi> Bomb proof, which is doubted; and as ſeveral of the other <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines</hi> and <hi>Barracks</hi> are built of Timber, its Garriſon might eaſily be burnt out: 'Tis defended by about <hi>one hundred and thirty</hi> Men, excluſive of the <hi>New England</hi> Auxiliaries, who, in the Courſe of two or three Years, have, in a manner, rebuilt the Fort, under the Direction of the <hi>Engineer</hi>

On the South Eaſt Side of the Bay of <hi>Fundy</hi> about <hi>thirty</hi> Leagues from the Entrance of <hi>Annapolis,</hi> is the Bay of <hi>Minas,</hi> a Name derived from the Report of ſome valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mines having been diſcovered in its Neighbourhood, being <hi>twelve</hi> Leagues long, and about <hi>three</hi> in Width, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the Rivers <hi>Canard, Caobegat, Piſegat,</hi> and ſome others diſcharge themſelves.</p>

            <p>From the Entrance into the Bay of <hi>Fundy</hi> to Cape <hi>Sable,</hi> there are ſeveral fine Rivers and Harbours, and two ſmall Villages; from Cape <hi>Sable,</hi> ſo called from the Sand Banks on its Shore, to <hi>Canſo,</hi> the Iſlands and Harbours are ſo numerous as not to admit of either Deſcription or nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the moſt conſiderable of which are <hi>Chebucto, Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſh, Port Roſſignol, Port Mutton, Port le Have, Port Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoir, Liſcombes Harbour,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Canſo,</hi> which at preſent ſerve only as a Retreat to fiſhing Veſſels, and others in bad Weather, or to wood and water; a few ſtragling Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, who ſhift their Habitations as the Seaſons for Fiſhing and Hunting vary, are the only Inhabitants on this exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Coaſt, except a <hi>French</hi> Settlement at <hi>Malegaſh.</hi>

            <p>From this Deſcription of the Country, ſeveral Places will appear neceſſary to be fortified, of which I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to point out the moſt convenient, as well as thoſe which are moſt commodious for bringing forward the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Settlements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Canſo</hi> and <hi>Chebucto</hi> on the Sea-Coaſt of this Province, naturally preſent themſelves firſt to Conſideration; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer from its having been a long Time improved in the Fiſhery, and having once had a wooden Blockhouſe, and a ſmall Detachment of Troops for its Protection, and the latter for its ſpacious and fine Harbour, and having been the Rendezvous of Duke <hi>D'Anville</hi>'s Squadron.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Canſo</hi> is conveniently ſituated for the God Fiſhery, but claims the Preference to the other on no account but its having been already improved, and probably ſooner known; But this laſt greatly exceeds the former in ſeveral Reſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> its Situation, its Harbour, and Aptneſs for Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Its Situation is ſuch, that it has a ſhort and eaſy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication by Land with all the Settlements on the Bay of <hi>Fundy,</hi> is equally commodious for the Fiſhery with <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> and is more in the Way of all Ships paſſing to and from <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>New England</hi> that may occaſionally, or by Streſs of Weather ſeek a Port for Shelter, or Relief.</p>
            <p>Its Harbour gives place to none in the World, and by its natural Form, and an Iſland at its Entrance, is capable of being well defended by a regular Fortification.</p>
            <p>Its Soil exceeds that of <hi>Canſo,</hi> and by the Vicinity of ſeveral fine Harbours, will afford great Conveniences to the firſt Inhabitants; theſe ſeveral Advantages it boaſts beyond any other Place on this Side of the Country; whereas
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006346_0030_1028A97366C3FB10"/>
               <hi>Canſo,</hi> though poſſeſſed for <hi>thirty-five</hi> Years, could ſhew no Improvements but on ſome ſmall Iſlands, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced little more than a few Kitchen Gardens; its Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is complained of as not well defended from hard Gales of Wind, has a very rocky and difficult Entrance, and the Communication from hence to the Inland Parts of the Province is through <hi>Chebucto,</hi> or <hi>Tatamagouche.</hi> This laſt Place ſeems alſo to claim ſome Share of Attention, and may probably upon a critical Survey, be found ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Settlement, and to merit ſuch a Fortification as may cut off all future Supplies to <hi>Louiſbourg</hi> by this Channel.</p>
            <p>Leaving this Side, and the Sea Coaſt of the Province, I ſhall return to the Bay of <hi>Fundy</hi> again, where the Soil, and Manner of improving Lands differs from all other Parts of North <hi>America,</hi> and where two or three different Fortreſſes will be neceſſary to awe the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> and to protect the propoſed Settlements from their Inſults.</p>
            <p>In all Parts of this Bay the Rivers are of great Length, and very numerous; the Ebbing and Flowing of the Tides is from <hi>four</hi> Fathom at the Entrance, to <hi>ten</hi> or <hi>eleven</hi> at the Head of its longeſt Branches; between their Banks, and the Verge of the Upland, are fine and large Tracts of Salt Marſh, in many Places extending themſelves on a Plain for <hi>thirty</hi> or <hi>forty</hi> Miles without Interruption: In the Bays of <hi>Minas, Chegnecto,</hi> and their ſeveral Branches, are Millions of Acres that were never yet improved; the <hi>French,</hi> in order to ſave themſelves the Labour of ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lands that are covered with Foreſt Wood, and interſperſed with Moraſſes, have ſurrounded part of theſe Marſhes with Dykes
<note n="*" place="bottom">This Term by Cuſtom is applicable to the Bank as well as the Ditch, and is always uſed for both in <hi>Nova Scotia.</hi>
               </note>, without which they would often be flowed at high Water, and always by Spring Tides; they are afterwards ploughed up, and in three Years pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all Kinds of Grain, and when fallow'd run into fine
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006346_0031_1028A93D662457E0"/>Graſs. This Land, by Reaſon of its natural Richneſs, requires very little manuring, and is not only eaſy of Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, but affords a beautiful Proſpect; their Gardens, with ſome Patches for particular Uſes, being all the Upland they have under Improvement.</p>
            <p>It is obvious from this Account, which is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exaggerated, that no Country is better calculated to yield an early Support to its infant Colonies, with more Certainty and leſs Labour, and affording them, in the mean time, a comfortable Subſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The Highlands which commonly lie near the Sea Coaſt, and the Sides of the Bay of <hi>Fundy,</hi> are rocky, and covered chiefly with Firs, but produce Plenty of Graſs when brought under Cultivation; the level Country is covered with ſeveral other Kinds of Wood uſeful in Building, and when ſubdued and fitted for Tillage, diſcovers a fine rich Mold, producing all Things in Perfection that are natural to the Climate; and this will ſerve for a general Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Province, for altho' ſome Parts of the Cape <hi>Sable</hi> and <hi>Canſo</hi> Shores are rocky, and unfit for Tillage, they are intermixed with valuable Tracts of low Lands, navigable Rivers, and a great Number of Iſlands, where Fiſh may be taken all the Year round, as the Harbours are ſeldom obſtructed with Ice.</p>
            <p>On the North Side of this Bay, <hi>St. John</hi>'s River ſeems to be the fitteſt Place for making a Settlement, and erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Fortreſs; about <hi>fifty</hi> Miles from its Entrance, the moſt judicious and conſiderable, tho' not the moſt nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tribe of <hi>Indians</hi> on this Part of the Continent are ſettled, and in the laſt War had a ſlight Fortification erected by the <hi>French</hi> for their Defence.</p>
            <p>Here the Land is fertile, and lies nearly on a Level very far into the Country, having a gradual Declivity on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the River, that ſerves to direct the Courſe of ſeveral large Branches into its Sides.</p>
            <p>By the Information of the <hi>Natives,</hi> the inland Parts of this Country are capable of the fineſt Improvements, and although here is but a very little Marſh-Land, the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:006346_0032_1028A9770C426998"/>of the Soil makes ample Amends for the Want of it, and here are no Claims of any Significancy to prevent the Settlement of it.</p>
            <p>In order to ſhew what Places within the Bay of <hi>Fundy</hi> are moſt proper to be fortified, I ſhall begin with this, as it is not only a very valuable Country, but is commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſituated for the Fiſhery; from hence the direct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with <hi>Canada</hi> is maintained through the Country, and continued acroſs the Bay to <hi>Minas</hi> and <hi>Annapolis,</hi> from which Places it is not more than <hi>twenty</hi> Leagues diſtant.</p>
            <p>Within, and very near the beforementioned Streight, the Land ſeems conveniently elevated for erecting a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs that will command the Entrance, and in time of War, a Boom Chain would effectually ſecure the Paſſage; this Place might not only ſerve to protect Ships in the Road below, but would be a ſufficient Defence to a new Settlement, and if properly garriſoned, might cut off the Correſpondence between <hi>Quebec</hi> and the <hi>Nova Scotians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>St. John</hi>'s Tribe might on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion attempt to interrupt a Settlement, but as they are in a State of Hoſtility with us, and by the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht</hi> their Lands were given up by the <hi>French</hi> to this Crown, no Peace ought to be concluded with them but upon our own Terms, for they were actually the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, by joining the Enemy in the Siege of <hi>Annapolis,</hi> contrary to ſeveral Treaties they formerly entered into with the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Bay.</p>
            <p>From this Place to <hi>Chignecto,</hi> the Country has but two or three Harbours, and the Sea Coaſt being very mountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and but little known, I can only aſſert what the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſay of it, that the inland Parts are fertile.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chignecto</hi> forming the Peninfula, which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Accadie,</hi> is commonly mentioned as a neceſſary Place to be fortified, in order to cut off the Communication with <hi>Canada</hi> in time of War, the Iſthmus not being here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two Leagues wide: The foregoing Reaſon would have more weight, if the <hi>French</hi> tranſported any Baggage or Train with them on theſe Occaſions, but that is not
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:006346_0033_1028A9411569BC38"/>practicable, and therefore they commonly croſs the Rivers below in <hi>Canoes</hi> with their ſmall Arms and Ammunition, their larger Stores being landed out of Veſſels from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada</hi> at <hi>Tetamagauche.</hi> Several Places here ſeem well ſituated for erecting a Fortreſs, upon one of which, an Eminence ſurrounded with Marſh, and commanding both the River and the Town, appears to be the moſt eligible for that Purpoſe
<note n="*" place="bottom">It is well known that many of the Inhabitants of this Place have actually bore Arms in Conjunction with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> and were concluded to be with them when they attacked the Auxiliary Troops at <hi>Minas</hi> in the Winter 1746.

            <p>
               <hi>MINAS</hi> being the principal Place in the Province, and the Center of all its Settlements, requires a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Deſcription.</p>
            <p>It is compoſed of a Number of Villages and Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, extending <hi>ſix</hi> or <hi>eight</hi> Miles in Length, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding ſome Towns a little more remote, contains about a <hi>thouſand</hi> Families; I don't mean ſo many Houſekeepers, but ſuch as would be thus denominated among the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for here it is cuſtomary when one of a Family marries, to enlarge the Manſion-houſe, and by the Addition of new Apartments, they make Room for the expected Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; from this Practice 'tis common to find <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> Generations under one Roof; it is computed that they amount to about <hi>ſeven thouſand</hi> People, and were the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants induſtrious they might produce immenſe Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Corn; the Soil of their Marſhes having been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſubject to the periodical Overflowing of the Spring Tides, is compoſed of the Fat and Slime that has been waſhed from the inland, and mountainous Parts of the Country, by Rains, and the melting of Snow for Ages
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:006346_0034_1028A9788F69B1A8"/>paſt, and on that Account admits of a long Improvement without any Manuring.</p>
            <p>Whenever it happens that any of their Dykes are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually broke down, the Overflowing of the Tide renders the Marſh incapable of bearing any Corn for <hi>three</hi> Years, but afterwards, by Means of the new Recruit of Salts, which are incorporated with the Mold, the Soil is renewed, and produces as fine Crops as ever; thus Nature ſeems by Accident to have pointed out a Proceſs, whereby its Fertility is reſtored without any Expence to the Owner: Theſe Lands, after ſome Years Improvement, produce ſeveral Kinds of Graſs, and ſerve all the ſeveral Uſes of Huſbandry.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants make a joint Buſineſs of Dyking in ſeveral large Tracts, which ſerve firſt as common Fields, and being afterwards ſub-divided into ſmaller Allotments are capable of the various Improvements before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Their Dykes are made of large Sods of Marſh cut up in ſquare Pieces, and raiſed about <hi>five</hi> Feet higher than the common Surface, of a competent Thickneſs to withſtand the Force of the Tides, and ſoon grow very firm and durable, being overſpread with Graſs, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Foot-paths on their Summit, which are both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and delightful.</p>
            <p>On the different Branches of <hi>Minas</hi> Bay are ſcattered ſeveral other Towns and Villages, whoſe Inhabitants pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the ſame Methods of improving their Lands.</p>
            <p>There is one Thing peculiar to theſe People which has ſecured their Allegiance during the preſent War, that is, the Dread of having their Dykes cut down, and their Eſtates by that Means ruined by the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> this Practice they felt the ſevere Effects of about <hi>forty</hi> Years ago, when their Lands were thus expoſed by the <hi>New England</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Remembrance of which is pretty ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on the old Inhabitants, and has had a very good Effect on their Poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Minas</hi> is ſo ſituated, as to have a ſhort and eaſy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the extreme Parts of the Province, being
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006346_0035_1028A9439D03A490"/>within a Days March of <hi>Chebucto,</hi> on the South Shore, and not much farther by Land from <hi>Annapolis,</hi> is about <hi>thirty</hi> Leagues by Water from <hi>St. John</hi>'s River, and is not much farther from <hi>Tetamagauche.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Account of the Country and its Inhabitants, it appears that <hi>Minas</hi> is not only the moſt conſiderable Part of it, but is moſt properly ſituated for a Metropolis, and conſequently requires a ſtrong Fortreſs for its Security; ſeveral Places have been propoſed in and near the Town for this Purpoſe, upon one of which ſtands the <hi>Stonehouſe</hi> which is Proof againſt ſmall Arms; this is built on an Eminence that commands great Part of the Town, but being overlooked by high Land on three Sides, would be greatly expoſed in caſe of an Attack: There is another Eminence that ſtands by the River <hi>Gaſpero</hi> to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Town, which is ſubject to the like Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; but the moſt proper Place, if not one of the fineſt in the World, on account of its natural Situation, is an Iſland of Upland about a Quarter of a Mile long, that commands the Mouth of the River, is ſurrounded with ſalt Marſhes, and has no firm Land within a Mile of it.</p>
            <p>The Subſtance of theſe Marſhes is ſo ſpongy and porous below the Level of the common Tides, as that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to open Trenches, but they will be directly filled with Water, and as they are commonly flowed at the Full and Change without the Dykes, it will appear im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable to make a regular Attack againſt it by Land, or to proceed by ſapping or mining, and 'tis equally ſo from Ships, unleſs it be attempted at high Water, and this muſt be done in a very ſhort Time on account of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of the Tide, which on ſuch an Occaſion would be equally hazardous to them as the Oppoſition of a ſtrong Garriſon.</p>
            <p>This Iſland commands the Proſpect of <hi>Minas</hi> Bay, ſo that no Veſſel can come in or go out undiſcovered, and if it is regularly fortified, might be defended by <hi>two hundred</hi> Men againſt the whole Force of <hi>Canada</hi> and the <hi>Nova Scotians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:006346_0036_1028A97B27FA1D98"/>
If this Plan be approved of, 'tis very eaſy to make an open Road from hence to <hi>Chebucto</hi> for all Sorts of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, it not being above <hi>forty</hi> Miles through the Country, and erecting a wooden Blockhouſe midway, that is Proof againſt ſmall Arms, might ſerve as a Place of Security to Travellers, and deter the <hi>Savages</hi> from interrupting the new Settlements.</p>
            <p>It will be alſo requiſite to fortify the Country imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, that being a preparatory Step which requires ſome time to execute, and will be found neceſſary to precede the propoſed Settlements, whoſe Neighbourhood will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally raiſe a Jealouſy among the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> that may create a great deal of Trouble, and retard the deſign'd Progreſs.</p>
            <p>To prevent the latter from being troubleſome, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Council ſhould be directed to take Hoſtages of them to ſecure the Performance of ſuch Treaties as ſhall be entered into; for unleſs ſome ſalutary Precautions of this Kind are uſed, 'tis much better to continue the War till they are wholly extirpated; 'tis evident that for many Years the <hi>Indians</hi> did as much Miſchief in <hi>New-England</hi> during a Peace as in Time of War, which has proceeded from the Inſtigations of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries amongſt them, and the Want of Power in the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to purſue and puniſh them in their wild Retreats. It is expedient that a direct Enquiry ſhould be made into the Claims and Titles of theſe Inhabitants, that their Bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries may be fixed; and to prevent future Contentions, all the Lands that are in the Diſpoſal of the Crown ſhould be ſurveyed, and the Nature of their Soil, and different Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities for Improvement enquired into; that a Report be made to his Majeſty, of the moſt commodious Places on navigable Rivers, and the Sea Coaſts, for ſettling of Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, for the Conveniency of the <hi>Cod Fiſhery,</hi> and the Proſecution of Agriculture.</p>
            <p>The Settlement of this Province will be attended with ſome Charge to the Government, and on that Account may probably meet with Interruption; yet as the general Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006346_0037_1028A94662904C10"/>are ſo conſpicuous, nothing ſhould be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to defeat it; for altho' the Expence may at firſt be conſiderable, it will not be durable, as the new Inhabitants, by a well regulated Militia, may be able in a few Years to defend themſelves; this was the Caſe with the Colonies in <hi>New England</hi> from their Infancy, altho' they ſtruggled under Difficulties infinitely exceeding any that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Settlements can be ſubject to, whilſt <hi>Great-Britain</hi> commands at Sea: The <hi>French</hi> Inhabitants muſt continue to be neutral, as they ſtile themſelves now, and the <hi>Indians</hi> are become ſo inconſiderable that very little Danger is to be apprehended from them, if the Settlements are made compact, and in a defenſible Form; the Maintenance of Forts, and Garriſons will then be a temporary Charge only, and ſoon ceaſe to be neceſſary; but if it ſhould not, the Introduction of Proteſtants, and ſecuring the Country from <hi>France,</hi> will greatly over-ballance the Expence, and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all the real, and imaginary Advantages</hi> that have been ſuggeſted to reſult from the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Cape Breton:</hi> As this Aſſertion may be thought repugnant to the ſeveral <hi>Importances</hi> of that Iſland, which have been laid before the Public, I ſhall enter more particularly into the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and its Fiſhery, than I at firſt intended: It has already been obſerved, that the Place is barren compared with <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> and will never admit of any conſiderable Improvements: The Truth, and Reaſon of theſe Facts are very obvious; <hi>Cape Breton</hi> was as ſoon known, as <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> or <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> but was never thought to be of any Value to the Poſſeſſors of thoſe Places, and it was the Excluſion from them, that put the <hi>French</hi> on fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and induced their Settlement of it, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>thirty</hi> Years Poſſeſſion, its Produce, excluſive of Fiſh, will not ſubſiſt a <hi>hundred</hi> Families; its Winters are of great Length, and extreme cold, it being common for the Froſts to continue till the latter End of <hi>May,</hi> and it is near the Middle of that Month before it is free of Ice: For as this Iſland forms an Eddy to the Current ſetting through the Gulf of <hi>St. Lawrence,</hi> it draws ſuch Quantities into its
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:006346_0038_1028A97EDFBCA628"/>Harbours as to obſtruct the Fiſhery, and render the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation very dangerous: During the Summer it is ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſubject to Fogs, as to have neither Heat nor Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine ſufficient to ripen its Corn and Fruits. I cannot undertake to aſſign a philoſophical Reaſon for the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Temperature of the Air in two Places lying in the ſame Latitude, and ſo near together as <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> and this Iſland, but to obſerve, that as the Duration, and ſeveral Degrees of cold moderate, and warm Weather in all Places vary with, and depend upon the prevailing Winds, in the ſeveral Seaſons of the Year, ſo in this, they commonly blow from ſuch Points in the Winter as bring on Storms of Snow and Froſt, and in the Summer thoſe are moſt frequent, that blow directly from the <hi>Banks,</hi> accompanied with thick Fogs and Miſts, and altho' ſome Parts of <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> are ſubject to them, 'tis neither in Degree nor Duration ſufficient to affect the Produce of the Earth, nor to interrupt the Courſe of Buſineſs by Land or Sea.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that notwithſtanding the Situation of this Iſland, four Fifths of the <hi>French</hi> Fiſhery have been proſecuted in other Places: Their <hi>Bankers,</hi> amounting to more than <hi>two hundred</hi> Sail of Ships in Time of Peace, who cure their Fiſh in Pickle, commonly called <hi>Mud-Fiſh,</hi> make their Voyages on the Banks of <hi>Newfoundland</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entering a Port in <hi>America,</hi> and their largeſt Ships to the Number of <hi>two hundred</hi> Sail, conſtantly uſe <hi>Fiſhot
<note n="*" place="margin">Captain <hi>Rous</hi> in a <hi>Bilander</hi> of <hi>fourteen</hi> Guns and <hi>our hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> Men, with a Ship of near the ſame Force attacked this Port in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1744; It was defended by <hi>five</hi> Ships navigated with <hi>four hundred and fifty</hi> Men; <hi>two</hi> of <hi>eighteen</hi> Guns each, <hi>one of ſixteen, one</hi> of <hi>fourteen,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> of <hi>twelve,</hi> drawn up in a circular Line round the Harbour, and altho' both his Veſſels grounded at the Entrance, and were expoſed to a continual Fire for <hi>five</hi> Hours from all the Ships within point-blank Muſket-ſhot, he bravely took them all with the Loſs of no more than <hi>eighteen</hi> Men; he took another Ship at <hi>St. Julian's</hi> of <hi>ſixteen</hi> Guns and <hi>ninety</hi> Men, <hi>ten</hi> Ships on the Banks with <hi>three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſix</hi> Men, retook a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Ship, burnt all the <hi>French</hi> Houſes, and Stores in <hi>ſeven</hi> different Flarbours, with <hi>four</hi> Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, and upwards of <hi>eight hundred</hi> fiſhing Shallops, all within a Month.</note>, St. Julian</hi>'s, and other Harbours on the North-Eaſt

            <p>In order to rival the <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>Cod-Fiſhery,</hi> 'tis neceſſary to confine them to the Limits ſtipulated by the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> which will exclude them from all the Banks of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> and it does not appear by that, or any other Treaty, that they have a Right to fiſh to the Southward of Cape <hi>Bonaviſta</hi>

            <p>This would deprive them of a great Part of their Fiſhery, employing near <hi>two hundred and Fifty</hi> Sail of Ships in Time of Peace, and furniſhes the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets in <hi>France, Spain, Portugal,</hi> and the <hi>Streights</hi> with <hi>Mud Fiſh;</hi> and as to the remaining Part, the Settlement of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> would ſoon enable the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to catch, and export larger Quantities, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Quality, and cheaper than the <hi>French</hi> could poſſibly afford their own, whereby the whole would be of little Value to them more than for their own Conſumption.</p>
            <p>The Iſle of <hi>Sable,</hi> and Cape <hi>Sable</hi> Banks on this Coaſt are ſo commodiouſly ſituated as to admit of a fine Fiſhery in the Winter whenever the Country is ſettled and ſtocked with Proviſions: At preſent the Fiſhermen from <hi>New-England</hi> make three Fairs there in a Year, the firſt of which being proſecuted in <hi>March,</hi> is worth both the other, as the Fiſh taken then exceed any in the World, and if they could be landed and cured in the Winter Months, five Fairs might be yearly made inſtead of three, and the two additional ones equal to the beſt of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which would in a few Years be of more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> than any thing the <hi>French</hi> are capable of proſecuting to ſupport their Rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>If this Point had been well attended to <hi>twenty</hi> or <hi>thirty</hi> Years paſt, their Fiſhery might have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced before this Time to a contemptible Situation; but the Caſe was ſo different, that they not only fiſhed where they pleaſed, but commonly inſulted our Veſſels whenever they met them, for excepting ſome of their <hi>Fiſhermen</hi> which were ſeized by Captain <hi>Smart</hi> on the <hi>Canſo</hi> Station, for fiſhing without their Limits contrary to Treaty, they never met with any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006346_0041_102885D0B3ADA510"/>but to prevent ſuch Accidents for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as our Ships were earlier out than theirs, they ever after ſent a ſuperior Force to deter our <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>War</hi> from the like Practice, and have ruled abſolute Lords of thoſe Seas.</p>
            <p>As that Treaty is the Baſis of the preſent Peace, and the Terms of it in relation to the Fiſhery are plain and intelligible, it cannot be doubted but the Adminiſtration will cauſe them to be punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, more eſpecially as they fall under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the <hi>Britiſh Flag,</hi> whoſe Honour is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concerned in ſecuring the Rights of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom againſt all Encroachments, and in protecting its Subjects from Inſults on every Part of the Ocean.</p>
