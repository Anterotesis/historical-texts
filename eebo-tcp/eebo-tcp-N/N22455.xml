            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>And</hi> David'<hi>s anger was greatly kindled againſt the man; and he ſaid to</hi> Nathan, <hi>As the</hi> LORD <hi>liveth, the man that hath done this thing ſhall ſurely die.</hi>

            <p>UNWARY and vindictive monarch! He clearly ſees, in its full magnitude, the mote that blemiſhes another's eye, while, at the ſame time, without his ſeeming to be ſenſible of it, a beam is in his own eye.</p>
            <p>And we are his legitimate children. The blood of this royal diſpenſer of juſtice flows in our veins. <hi>We</hi> ſentence the Algerines, as <hi>he</hi> that villainous ſheep-ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. We want only the <hi>power,</hi> and they would expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience a moſt exemplary chaſtiſement; and, if ſome could be gratified, would be craſed from the catalogue of nations.</p>
            <p>Prepare your ears to hear a moſt extraordinary anath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ema, pronounced againſt that infatuated people by one of our firſt poets and eminent ſtateſmen.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>Great maledictions of eternal wrath,</hi>

                  <hi>Which like heaven's vialed vengeance ſinge and ſcathe!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Transfix with ſcorpion ſtings their callous heart,</hi>

               <l>

               <l>
                  <hi>For balm pour brimſtone in their wounded ſoul,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then ope perdition and ingulph the whole!</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>In the name of horrour, why this raving and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! O, the Algerines have captured and enſlaved five or ſix ſcore of Americans, and keep them in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſervitude and diſtreſs. For this they are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death and perdition; and I know not but heaven ſuggeſted the verdict.</p>
            <p>But if this thing muſt be done in the green tree, what ſhall be done in the dry? In theſe United States, not five or ſix ſcore, but five or ſix hundred thouſand
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:029669_0003_0FE217BEE1A75B40"/>
perſons, are enſlaved;—not captured, like thoſe Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans, upon the high ſeas, where no one goes unappri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed of the danger; but dragged defenceleſs from their native fields; and frequently treated, as might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be made to appear, in a manner barbarous as our people are treated at Algiers.</p>
            <p>In Maſſachuſetts the negroes were freed long ago. In New-Hampſhire and Vermont, they are few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but <hi>ſome</hi> were found, at the taking of the laſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, to be ſtill in ſlavery even here. They might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be free, did they know how to avail themſelves of the bill of rights, which declares, that all men are born equally free. But to our diſgrace, they are and ought to be conſidered as ſlaves, till government ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>l take effectual meaſures, as their guardians, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that they are in fact free; and till, for the ſake of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, their freedom ſhall be made known to the world.</p>
            <p>What if ſome ſtates have paſſed acts of non-impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? That, ſo far as reſpects the negroes now in ſlavery, is juſt nothing at all. How will the non-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of others repair the wrong done to theſe? Or, if no wrong is done, why ſhould importation be ſtopped? Thoſe who are now ſlaves may pray, it is true, like the rich man in hell, that none of their brethren may be brought to this place of torment; but their prayers would avail but little, if granted, in mitigation of their own tortures.</p>
            <p>The injuſtice of enſlaving our fellow-creatures, even though they are black, is pretty generally acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and in reſpect to <hi>our</hi> ſlaves, people affect to lament their misfortune in being brought into a ſituation, which renders it <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that they ſhould be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in bondage. It is juſt, no doubt, that the negroes ſhould have remained free; but they are ſlaves, and therefore let them continue ſo. Let them, however, have this conſolation, that we will leave off our injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice gradually. There ſhall be an abolition; but it ſhall begin moderately, and proceed leiſurely, and be completed ſometime or never. Thus the poor ſlave may comfort himſelf, that at ſome diſtant period, <hi>when</hi> GOD only knows, he, or his children, or his children's children, may hope for deliverance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:029669_0004_0FE217C06BE7F5B0"/>
Some are for ſetting them free immediately. They are not for continuing an abuſe of the moſt cruel na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, under any pretext whatever. And why are not all of this opinion? It is becauſe many are prejudiced, and many are indolent, and very many are intereſted; not to mention, that moſt people pay but very little attention to the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Hence it has happened, that every advocate for an immediate emancipation has been immediately ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by ſome ſpecious objection. The indolent have by this means ſound repoſe for their conſciences; and the intereſted have rid themſelves of much odium, without any great danger of loſing their vaſſals.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is plead, that ſlaves are <hi>property.</hi> "The operation (ſaid Mr. Madiſon in Congreſs) of <hi>redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the number of ſlaves</hi> was going on as quickly as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. The mention of ſuch a thing in the houſe had in the mean time <hi>a very bad effect on that ſpecies of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Secondly, without negro ſlaves the ſouthern planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can not be managed to advantage.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the moſt plauſible and confounding plea of the whole is, that if they were all at once and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſet at liberty, to run at large, they would be a dangerous parcel of vagabonds, more unhappy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves than at preſent, and the terrour and vexation of the community.</p>
            <p>O, it is doubtleſs cruel, to deprive a maſter of the ſlave for whom he paid perhaps forty guineas, and has had his labour for not more than forty years. But to whom did he pay the guineas? In the name of conſcience, who had any right, in the firſt place, to ſell negroes? If a ſhipload of Frenchmen were offered for ſale, the enquiry would quickly be made. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would ſoon be eſtabliſhed, that man could not be made the property of man.</p>
            <p>But we ourſelves are too ſecure to <hi>imagine</hi> the caſe our own; otherwiſe we might appeal to that eternal rule of right, to do by others as they ſhould do by us. And with what feeling ſhould <hi>we</hi> ſtand forth for ſale, be ſlaves, be called <hi>that ſpecies of property;</hi> we, who deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our parent country the right of taxing us, and edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029669_0005_0FE217C75370CA98"/>
our ſwords to maintain our liberty, or to die! Should we endure the oppreſſor's rod?</p>
            <p>Money has been paid by the purchaſer; but no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent has been given or can be given to the negro. Liberty can not be eſtimated by guineas. If ſo, have I no claim to my liberty, becauſe a tyrant, ſtronger than I, has robbed me of it, and ſold me? This ſpecies of property, upon that principle, is not ſo highly privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged as other ſpecies; for the laws take care, that ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len goods, though purchaſed by an honeſt man at their full value, ſhall be given up to the right owner; and ſhall they tolerate ſlavery?</p>
            <p>But if there ſeems injuſtice, that individuals ſhould wholly loſe the labour of thoſe for whom they have paid ſo much money; let the ſtate under the countenance of which they have carried on this accurſed traffic, make them ſome conſideration, and let every one who has acquieſced in the ſyſtem of ſlavery contribute to its abolition.</p>
            <p>Yet every maſter is holden by every tie, whatever government may ſee cauſe to do or not to do, to grant manumiſſion to his ſlaves; and woe to the man who takes advantage of any human inſtitution, to injure his fellow creatures, when his conſcience teſtifies that it <hi>is</hi> an injury, and that the law is cruel, and repugnant to all right.</p>
            <p>A regular importation of negro ſlaves into America took place in conſequence of a ſuggeſtion of Caſas, a Spaniſh clergyman. When the Spaniards conquered Hiſpaniola, they reduced the Indians to ſervitude, and treated them with ſuch cruelty, that multitudes periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Caſas ſtrove to relieve them; but failed in every meaſure. At laſt he propoſed the importing of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes; in order, by enſlaving them, to free the Indians. So blind is man!</p>
            <p>The ſecond objection in my enumeration is no more an argument in favour of continuing what negroes in ſlavery we already poſſeſs, than of importing new ones. But experiments have proved, in different parts of the world, that freemen will do more labour than ſlaves. Beſides the objection is too iniquitous to be harboured a moment; and I have been pained at hearing it urged
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029669_0006_0FE217C9E0A31E28"/>
by ſome, who ſeem in other inſtances to be philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropic.</p>
            <p>The third objection pretends kindneſs to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, and a regard to our own ſecurity.</p>
            <p>It is quite faſhionable to obſerve, under colour of the former principle, that freed negroes generally go more meanly dreſſed than ſlaves. What then! Is freedom to be ſold for a fine coat, for calicoes? And what i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſome ſlaves fare better than we? Who would be even a ſycophant, much leſs a ſlave, for the ſake of better fare?</p>
            <p>But the obſervation, made as a general one, is falſe. The bulk of ſlaves in the ſouthern ſtates can not be more naked, and ill-uſed, and defenceleſs, than they are now. Soul and body would ſeparate. And even if freedom ſhould be the occaſion of their being ſtill more deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and it were poſſible that they ſhould yet continue to live; would they not likewiſe, on the other hand, get clear of inceſſant drudgery, of diſpiriting menaces, of mercileſs flagellations? What they would loſe in dreſs and diet they would ſave in ſweat and blood.</p>
            <p>And do thoſe who live worſe with freedom than when ſlaves, if there are ſuch, do they commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their <hi>cidevant</hi> maſters, and ſay, I had rather be your ſlave than be free? Such a thing may ſometimes happen; but if it were a general practice, where would be the hazard of ſetting them in general free? It would only be loſing their labour, while they could make a little experiment, and then return to their abject con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, more obſequious than before.</p>
            <p>The truth is, liberty is ſweet, and ſlavery is horrible; and nothing can be an equivalent for the one, and nothing but inſenſibility or a hope of deliverance can render the other ſupportable.</p>
            <p>The principle we are now examining talks of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It would keep the negroes in ſlavery for their own good, A very ſuſpicious ſort of humanity! Why not re-enſlave thoſe who have been once freed? Why not import more? Or do they live better in Congo, than thoſe happy wretches who have had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to become ſlaves? Why not ſubjugate the Indians to this enviable condition; or raiſe the few indigent

of our own nation to the rank of bondmen? Why does this benevolent ſyſtem embrace only negroes now in ſlavery? Perhaps we are under peculiar obligations, to regard their good. Yes, GOD knows it, and I wiſh we may be wiſe enough to diſcharge theſe obligations in due ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>But this pretenſion of kindneſs is only a cloak. The other part of the objection is all that creates any difficulty. <hi>That</hi> I confeſs is of great importance, and merits a wiſe and candid diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>We are in this dilemma: there is ſuch a number of ſlaves in the country:—and, on the one hand, we can not continue them in bondage without doing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to our conſciences, and incurring the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of heaven; nor, on the other, can we free them without extraordinary meaſures. It will require money, and labour, and wiſdom, and vigilance. Of two evils, if the latter can be degraded to ſuch a name, we have to determine which is the leaſt.</p>
            <p>There is no reaſon to expect, but that, if ſo many myriads of wretches were turned out of doors, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, to live as they liſt, uncultivated as they now are, they would be a nuiſance in ſociety. Probably, beſides idleneſs and beggary, we ſhould ſee uncomfortable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, perhaps outrages, perhaps fatal crimes; ſome through ignorance, ſome through wantonneſs, ſome from impelling hunger, and ſome from revenge. They are not fit to be their own guides; they have been habituated, not to reaſon, but obey; their wills have been cruſhed; they are ſcarce conſcious of the power of willing; and, what is worſe, they are not taught the duties that ariſe from ſocial relations, nor diſciplined to good morals.</p>
            <p>What then can be done? This is the momentous queſtion. But whenever we are as ſincerely deſirous of freeing the negroes as we are of aggrandizing our own nation, we ſhall ſoon deviſe ways and means ſufficient for the purpoſe. We, who deſcant upon the rights of man, who boaſt our improvements, our reſources, our enterprize, our energy, our patriots, our territory, and, in fine, our "aſylum for the unfortunate of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries";—we, the moſt flouriſhing nation on the globe,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029669_0008_0FE217CDDBA57FD8"/>
if our hearts were engaged, ſhould aſk for no foreign aſſiſtance, to liberate our ſlaves.</p>
            <p>But the queſtion ſtills recurs, What can be done? The anſwer is, If they are not fit for freedom, they muſt be fitted. They muſt be conſidered, for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>me, as in a ſtate of minority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It muſt be a ſtate of dependence and diſcipline, not ſervitude. They muſt therefore be taken away from their maſters, and, by direction of the magiſtrate, put under temporary guardians, governours, and inſtructors, to be educated, to be made acquainted with their rights and duties, and ſome honeſt method of acquiring a livelihood; to be prepared for citizen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>I do not ſay, that all ſhould be treated alike. I do not know, but <hi>ſome</hi> ſhould be returned to Africa. Many are worn out with age and ſore travail. They muſt not be caſt helpleſs into the high ways; but let them hear the glad news of liberty to the captive, that tears of tranſport may run down the furrows which have been deep-worn by tears of affliction. Does his maſter aſk, how he ſhall live—who will ſupport him? Live, wretch! how long have you revelled upon the fruit of his labours, ungratefully; and do you aſk, how he ſhall live, how he ſhall be ſupported through the painful reſidue of a devoted life? Give him food from you own table, and beg him to pray for your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicious ſoul.</p>
            <p>After all, ſome may chooſe, though under no ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or bias, to remain with their maſters. But, in this caſe, government ought to conſider, whether it is not their duty, to interfere ſo far, as to ſee, that, if any remain, they do not remain <hi>ſlaves:</hi> and that, like other free perſons, they can go whenever they pleaſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the eſtabliſhed principles of reciprocal contract. In ſhort, they ought to have guardians.</p>
            <p>Maſſachuſetts gave a noble example; but, had they fallen upon the plan of carrying their negroes through ſuch a preparation ſtate before manumiſſion, they would, I firmly believe, have found i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Miſerable indeed! And yet, they have no fellow-ſufferer to expoſtulate, like O'Brien at Algiers. They have no friends to redeem them. In general they can neither read nor write, and have, therefore, no way to fill the world with complaints. Their ſufferings are their own, and they muſt bear them in ſilence. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited, trodden down, and trampled upon, they have loſt all manhood, and find relief only in their ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he effect of cruelty and deſpair.</p>

            <p>Much has been ſaid, volumes are on the ſhelves, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the origin of nations and their difference of colour. Curious, but of little ſervice; the philoſopher's paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. To reſcue a perſon from ſufferings is an act of more merit, than to trace back his pedigree to the firſt progenitor. Nay; I would rather give happineſs to an individual, than ſpeculate upon the genealogy of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with unrivalled ſucceſs, or be the inventor of the moſt unexceptionable hypotheſes reſpecting the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of human complexions and features. But I muſt not prolong the diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Let us thoroughly contemplate the ſubject, and act the conſiſtent and the beneficent part. Like the royal convict whoſe name is in the text, let us acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge our guilt; and, like people of the moſt noble ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, let us immediately change our ſyſtem of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. We ought to ſign a proteſt againſt ſlavery; and publicly to declare our abhorrence of this national ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and abomination. In ſhort, we ought to do every thing in our power, to bring about a conſtitutional reform; that there may be a univerſal abolition thro' the ſtates—I might have ſaid, through all nations. In particular, we ought religiouſly to refrain from vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for any man to ſuſtain a public office of any kind, whatever may be his abilities, if he is known to be the owner of a ſlave. This ſhould debar him from every place of truſt and honour in the commonwealth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, we ought to implore the PARENT of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to diffuſe every where a ſpirit of chriſtian charity, that oppreſſion may ceaſe through the world, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gentleneſs mark all the dealings of man with his fellow-pilgrims, till all are brought into ONE FAMILY.</p>
