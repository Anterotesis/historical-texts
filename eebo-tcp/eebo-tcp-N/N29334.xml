            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF GEORGE WASHINGTON, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr>
            </head>
            <p>THIS truly great man, the third ſon of a Mr. Auguſtin Waſhington, was born in Weſtmoreland county, Virginia, on the 22d day of February, 1732. He was the firſt ſon of a <hi>ſecond</hi> marriage; a circumſtance which ought, in all conſcience, to quiet the minds of thoſe who have their doubts with reſpect to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſecond marriages. His education was of the <hi>private</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> ſort. Dead languages, pride, and pedantry, had no charms for him who always preferred ſenſe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound, the kernel to the ſhell. <hi>A grammatical knowledge of his mother-tongue</hi>—<hi>the mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics</hi>—<hi>geography</hi>—<hi>hiſtory</hi>—<hi>natural and moral philoſophy,</hi> were the valuable objects of his youthful ſtudies: And in theſe he made the proficiency of one who always loved to go deep. At ſchool he was remarkable for <hi>good nature</hi> and <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndour;</hi> qualities which gave him ſo entirely the hearts of his young companions, that a reference to him was the uſual mode of deciding all differences. After leaving his tutor he acted, for a few years, as a county ſurveyor, in which profeſſion, his induſtry, as alſo the <hi>neatneſs</hi> and regularity with which he did every thing, were <hi>univerſally admired.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1753, the French and Indians began to make inroads on our weſtern frontiers along the Ohio. Governor Dinwiddie was in a peck of troubles, to get a letter of <hi>remonſtrance</hi> to their comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in chief. He had applied to ſeveral young gentlemen of his acquaintance; but they were all ſo exceedingly tender of their <hi>night-caps,</hi> they could not be prevailed on, for love or money, to venture out among the ſavages. WASHINGTON happening to hear of it, inſtantly waited on his excellency, and offered his ſervices, but not without being afraid l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t his want of a beard ſhould go againſt him. However, the governor was ſo charmed with his modeſty and manly air, that he never aſked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

of ſervants, he ſet out on his expedition, which was, from ſtart to pole, as diſagreeable and dangerous as any thing <hi>Hercules</hi> himſelf could have wiſhed. Soaking rains, chilling blaſts, roaring floods, pathleſs woods, and mountains clad in ſnows oppoſed his courſe; but oppoſed in vain—The glorious ambition to ſerve his country imparted an animation to his nerves, which rendered him ſuperior to all difficulties, and happier far than the little ſouls he left behind him in Williamſburg, fidling and feaſting in the Rawleigh.<note n="*" place="bottom">Note.

            <p>Returning homewards, he was waylaid and ſhot at by a French Indian, and though the copper-coloured ruffian was not 15 ſteps diſtant when he fired at him, yet not even ſo much as the <hi>ſmell</hi> of lead paſſed on the clothes of our young hero; ſo true ſtill is the promiſe on record in the good old book, <abbr>viz.</abbr>

            </lg>
            <p>On his return to Williamſburg it was found that he had executed his negociations, both with the French and Indians, with ſo much fidelity and judgment, that he received the heartieſt thanks of the governor and council for the very important ſervices he had done his country.</p>
            <p>HE was now (in the 20th year of his age) appointed major and adjutant general of the Virginia forces. Soon after this, the French continuing their encroachments, orders were given by the Engliſh government, for the colonies to arm and unite in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy.

WASHINGTON, not yet 23, boldly puſhed out into the Indian country, and there for a conſiderable time, Hannibal-like, maintained the war againſt three times the number of French and Indians. At the Red-Stones he came up with a ſtrong party of the enemy, whom he engaged and effectually defeated, after having killed and taken thirty-one men. From his priſoners, he obtained undoubted intelligence, that the French forces on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

looked in vain—nobody came to his aſſiſtance. Not long after this, his ſmall force, now reduced to three hundred men, was attacked by an army of 1100 French and Indians. Never did the true Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian valour make a more glorious ſhine than on this trying occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>To ſee three hundred young fellows—commanded by a ſmooth-faced boy—all unaccuſtomed to the terrors of war—far from home and from all hopes of help—ſhut up in a dreary wilderneſs, and ſurrounded by four times their number of ſavage foes, and yet, without ſign of fear, without thought of ſurrender, preparing for mortal combat. Oh! it was a glorious ſight! never ſince the days of Leonidas and his three hundred deathleſs Spartans had the ſun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held its equal. With hideous whoops and yells the enemy came on like a hoſt of furious tygers. The woods and rocks and <hi>tall tree</hi> tops were in one continued blaze and craſh of fire arms. Nor were our young warriors idle, but, animated by their gallant chief, plied their rifles with ſuch ſpirit, that their little fort reſembled a volcano in full blaſt roaring and diſcharging thick ſheets of liquid fire and of leaden deat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s among their foes. For three glorious hours, Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-like, inveloped in ſmoke and flame, they ſuſtained the attack of the enemy's whole force, and laid two hundred of them dead on the ſpot! Diſcouraged by ſuch deſperate reſiſtance, the French general, the count de Villiers, ſent in a flag to WASHINGTON, extolling his gallantry to the ſkies, an offering him the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable terms. It was ſtipulated that COL. WASHINGTON and his little band of heroes, ſhould march away with all the honors of war, and carry with them their military ſtores and baggage.</p>
            <p>IN the ſpring of 1755, WASHINGTON, while buſied in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt military operations, was ſummoned to attend general Braddock, who, in the month of February, arrived at Alexandria with 2,000 Britiſh troops. The aſſembly of Virginia appointed 800 provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials to join him. The object of this army was to march through the country by the way of Will's-Creek to fort du Queſne (now Pittſburgh or Fort-Pitt). As no perſon was ſo well acquainted with the frontier country as WASHINGTON, and none ſtood ſo high in military fame, it was thought he would be infinitely ſerviceable to general Braddock. At the requeſt of the governor and council he cheerfully quitted his own command, to act as volunteer aid-de-camp to that very imprudent and unfortunate general. The army, near 3,000 ſtrong, marched from Alexandria to the mournful ditty of "over the hills and far away," and proceeded unmoleſted within a few miles of Fort-Pitt. On the morning of the day (9th of July) on which they expected to arrive, the provincial ſcouts diſcovered a large party of French and Indians lying in ambuſh. WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, with his uſual modeſty, obſerved to general Braddock

what fort of enemy he had now to deal with. An enemy who would not, like the Europeans, come forward to a fair <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>uffle in the field, but, concealed behind rocks and trees, carry on a deadly warfare with their rifles. He concluded with begging that general Braddock would grant him the honor to place himſelf at the head of the Virginia riflemen, and fight them in their own way. And it was generally thought that our young hero and his 800 hearts of hickory, would eaſily have <hi>cleared them</hi> out too, for they were not ſuperior to the force, which, (with only three hundred) he had thrown into ſuch a ſweat a twelve month before. But gen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock, who had all along treated the American officers and ſoldiers with infinite contempt, inſtead of following this truly ſalutary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſwelled and reddened with moſt unmanly rage: "High times, by God," he exclaimed, ſtrutting to and fro, with arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kimbo, "High times! when a young Buckſkin can teach a Britiſh general how to fight!" Waſhington withdrew, biting his lip with grief and indignation, to think what numbers of brave fellows would draw ſhort breath that day, through the pride and obſtinacy of one epauletted fool. The troops were ordered to <hi>form</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in <hi>columns</hi> through the woods!!!! In a little time the ruin, which WASHINGTON had predicted, enſued. This poor devoted army, puſhed on by their mad-cap general, fell into the fatal ſnare which was laid for them. All at once a thouſand rifles began the work of death. The ground was inſtantly covered with the dying and the dead. The Britiſh troops, thus ſlaughtered by hundreds, and by an enemy whom they could not ſee, were thrown irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably into panic and confuſion, and in a few minutes their haughty general, with 1200 of his <hi>brave,</hi> but unfortunate countrymen, bit the ground. Amidſt all this fearful conſternation and carnage, amidſt all the uproar and horrors of a rout, rendered ſtill more dreadful by the groans of the dying, the ſcreams of the wounded, the piercing ſhrieks of the women, and the yells of the furious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting ſavages, WASHINGTON, calm and ſelf-collected, rallied his faithful riflemen, led them on to the charge, killed numbers of the enemy who were ruſhing on with tomahawks, checked their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, and brought off the ſhattered remains of the Britiſh army.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>glorious action</hi> confirmed his admiring countrymen in the very high opinion which they had conceived of their WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON. His valour and military talents were extolled to the ſkies. The bravery of the Virginia troops on this trying occaſion, rejoiced the good old mother-country, and was ſurely enough to have taught her to deſpiſe that execrable fire-brand, general Amherſt, who, a few years afterwards, moſt impudently aſſerted, that <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>WITH reſpect to our WASHINGTON, I cannot but mention here two very extraordinary ſpeeches that were uttered about him at this time, and which, as things have turned out, look a good deal like prophecies. A famous Indian warrior who aſſiſted in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of Braddock, was often heard to ſwear that WASHINGTON <hi>was not born to be killed by a bullet, "for,"</hi> continued he, <hi>"I had</hi> SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENTEEN <hi>fair fires at him with my rifle, and, after all, I could not bring him to the ground."</hi> And, indeed, whoever conſiders that a good rifle, levelled by a proper markſman, hardly ever miſſes its aim, will readily enough conclude, with this unlettered ſavage, that ſome inviſible hand muſt have turned aſide his bullets.</p>
            <p>THE Rev. Mr. Davies, in a ſermon occaſioned by Braddock's defeat, has theſe remarkable words—<hi>"I beg leave to point the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the public to that heroic youth, colonel</hi> WASHINGTON, <hi>whom I cannot but hope Providence has preſerved for ſome great ſervice to this country."</hi> Yes reverend Sir, for ſome <hi>great ſervice indeed.</hi>—He was preſerved of God to be the political ſaviour of his country. He who inſpired the flaming fancies of a BARLOW and a DWIGHT; He who imparted the ken of angels to FRANKLIN and to RITTEN-HOUSE, even he, the ſame all-gracious power, raiſed up <hi>WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON,</hi> to be his miniſter of mercies to America. Oh! that there were an heart in us to adore the giver, and to emulate the bright virtues of his precious gift.</p>
            <p>After the defeat and death of general Braddock, WASHINGTON continued to preſs forward, the foremoſt man to fail upon every difficulty or danger that threatened his beloved country. <hi>And the Lord was with him whitherſoever he went, and whatſoever he did the Lord made it to proſper.</hi> On every occaſion he diſplayed ſo much of wiſdom, induſtry, and valour, as gained him his country's heartieſt approbation, a reward which, next to the ſmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he valued more than all things elſe.</p>
            <p>IN 1759, he reſigned his command, and entered into the married ſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the 27th year of his age, with the young and amiable widow of Mr. Cuſtis, with whom he received one of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt eſtates in Virginia. From this period he became as aſſiduous to ſerve the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

leaped for joy, as at the name of a great and venerable mother, and that mother felt an equal tranſport at thoughts of us, her flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing colonies—When all the produce of theſe vaſt and fertile regions was poured into her beloved lap, and ſhe, <hi>in return,</hi> not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing us the trouble to make even a hob-nail, heaped our families with all the neceſſaries and elegancies of her ingenious artiſts.—When, tho' far ſeparated by an ocean's roar, we were yet ſo <hi>unite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> by love and mutual helpfulneſs, that the ſouls of Rawleigh and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus, looking from heaven on the enchanting ſcene, enjoyed the conſummation of their wiſhes, and felt an acceſſion to their bliſs: At this happy period, lord North brought in a bill <hi>to tax the colonies without allowing us a voice in their councils!!!</hi> The colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were thunderſtruck, and Britain herſelf, "ſighing through all her iſland, gave ſigns of woe that all was loſt."</p>
            <p>Millions of that magnanimous and <hi>freedom-loving</hi> people execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the meaſure as unconſtitutional and wicked.</p>
            <p>London, Liverpool, Glaſgow, Briſtol, &amp;c. poured in petitions on petitions, praying the miniſter, in compaſſion to their half-ruined trade and families, to repeal the act. Petitions and remonſtrances, without number, were ſent alſo from America to the king, to the parliament, and to the people of Great-Britain; but theſe, like the unfortunate petitions juſt mentioned, were all conſigned to the <hi>"com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee</hi> of <hi>oblivion,"</hi> as the oppoſition humorouſly ſtyled it. The miniſtry would not honor them even with a reading! They had attempted in 1765, eight years ago, to impoſe on the colonies an unconſtitutional tax, under cover of the <hi>ſtamp-act.</hi> This had blown up ſuch a flame of oppoſition throughout the continent, eſpecially at Boſton, that the miniſtry prudently ſuffered the matter to die away. But the gall of diſappointment was ſtill bitter on their minds, and they now thought to have ſatisfaction by laying a tax of three pence in the pound on all teas conſumed in the colonies.* This ſet the old flame agoing again. The coloniſts at firſt employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as we have ſeen, moderate meaſures, but finding that theſe were treated with contempt, and that the face of North, black as the cloud of winter, was hard ſet againſt them for evil, they roſe up as one man, from Dan to Beerſheba, reſolved, like true ſons of Britons, to live <hi>free,</hi> or <hi>not to live at all.</hi> Soon, therefore, as the ſhips, laden with the ill-fated tea, arrived at Boſton, in the fall of 1773, immenſe quantities of it (£.18,000 ſterling's worth) were trundled into the ſea; large parcels were deſtroyed in other colonies, and ſtill larger parcels were returned unſold.</p>
            <p>On the arrival of this news in England, the countenance of the miniſter was dark with fury, and he proceeded, without delay, to mix up for the colonies a cup of fiery indignation, of which Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, it ſeems, was to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>On the receipt of this intelligence at Boſton, the paſſions of the people flew up, five hundred degrees above blood-heat! through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the continent the fever raged with equal fury. The colonies all extolled Boſton for the firmneſs with which ſhe had ſtood up for her chartered rights—liberal contributions were made for her relief—and this miniſterial attack on her liberties, was conſidered as an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack on the liberties of the whole, which were now thought to be in ſuch danger, as loudly to call for a general Congreſs from all the colonies, to deliberate on their common intereſts. This moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly body ſat down, for the firſt time, in Philadelphia, Sept. 5th, 1774. They began with publiſhing <hi>a bill of rights,</hi> wherein they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated their loyalty and love to the mother country, together with an earneſt wiſh for a <hi>conſtitutional</hi> dependance on her; but, at the ſame time, they begged leave to aſſure, that though ſhe, in her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of parental fondneſs, might ſuffer herſelf to be bound and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted by North and Bute, and other Philiſtine lords, yet they, for their parts, were reſolved, like true ſons of Britiſh Sampſons, to riſe and fight to the laſt hair of their heads. They aſſerted, and, begged leave to do it pretty roundly too, as it was getting now high time to ſpeak plain, that, by the <hi>immutable laws of nature</hi>—by the <hi>principles of the Britiſh conſtitution</hi>—<hi>and by their ſeveral charters,</hi> they had a right to liberty, the liberty of Britiſh colonies; and, moreover, that their ever-honored <hi>fathers,</hi> at the time of their emigration to this country, were entitled to all the rights of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and ſince, by ſuch emigration, they had neither forfeited nor ſurrendered theſe rights—that they, their children, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, at the riſk of every thing ſhort of their eternal ſalvation, to defend and to tranſmit them entire to their poſterity.</p>
            <p>Millions of choice ſpirits in England, Scotland, and Ireland, cried out <hi>"that's well ſaid, and</hi> may <hi>God's arm ſtrike with our Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican brother's;"</hi> this was coming to the point, and produced the effect that might be expected. For, inſtantly, all exportation of arms and ammunition to America was prohibited—large reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſent to the king's troops at Boſton—and every ſtep was taken to compel the colonies to ſubmiſſion. This filled up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of American hatred to the miniſtry, and called forth the moſt vigorous preparations for war. Every ounce of gun-powder was
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:039062_0011_10138EE430CC2830"/>
huſbanded like ſo much gold-duſt; powder-mills and muſquet-manufactories were erected in moſt of the colonies, while others, as not liking this ſlow way of doing things, laid violent hands at once upon all the king's arms and ammunition that came in their way. The hell fraughted cloud of civil war was now ready to burſt, and April the 19th, 1775, was the fatal day marked out by myſterious Heaven, for tearing away the infant colonies from the old mother country. Early that morning, General Gage, whoſe force in Boſton was augmented to 10,00 men, ſent a detachment of 1,000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to deſtroy ſome military ſtores which the Americans had collected in the town of Concord, near Lexington. On com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the place, they found the town militia aſſembled on the green near the road. "<hi>Throw down your arms,</hi> and <hi>diſperſe,</hi> you rebels," was the cry of the Britiſh officer which was immediately followed by a general diſcharge of the ſoldiers; whereby eight of the Americans were killed and ſeveral wounded. The Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials returned the fire with good intereſt, and ſtrewed the green with the dead and wounded. Such fierce diſcharges of muſquetry, produced the effect that might have been expected in a land of freemen, who ſaw their brave countrymen engaged in the ſtrife of death. Never, before, had the boſoms of the ſwains experienced ſuch a tumult of heroic paſſions. They flew to their houſes, ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up their arms, and in ſpite of their wild ſcreaming wives and children, darted to the glorious field where liberty, heaven-born goddeſs, was to be bought for blood. Pouring in now from every quarter, were ſeen crowds of ſturdy peaſants with <hi>fluſhed cheeks,</hi> and <hi>flaming eyes,</hi> eager for battle! Faſt as they came up, their long black muſquets began to pour the red ſtreams of fiery vengeance. The enemy fell back appalled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Every ſtep of their retreat was ſtained with trickling crimſon; every hedge or fence by which they paſſed took large toll of hoſtile carcaſes. They would, in all probability, have been cut off to a man, had not General Gage, luckily recollecting, that born of Britons, theſe Yankees might ſtill perhaps retain ſome of the old <hi>lion's fire,</hi> ſent on 2,000 men to ſupport, if neceſſary, his troops. This reinforcement met the poor fellows, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>On the night of June 16, with a view of driving the Britiſh from Boſton, the Provincial Generals ſent a body of fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, to throw up ſome works on Bunker's hill. Next morning General Gage puſhed off a detachment three thouſand ſtrong, with a ſuitable train of artillery, to diſlodge them. The attack was made with great fury on the part of the Britiſh, while the Americans did not return a ſhot, until the enemy had come up within ten ſteps of the works. A well directed and moſt horrid fire then took place. The Britiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell back. Their gallant offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers led them a ſecond time to the charge; a ſecond fire equally cloſe and deadly, drove them back again. But, led on a third time, by dint of bayonet they at length carried the works; and the Americans deſtitute of that weapon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were obliged, after an obſtinate reſtance, to quit their little dirt fort, the <hi>ever green</hi> grave of the immortal Warren, and many more of weeping Liberty's martyred ſons. On the other hand, the Britiſh drew back to town with <hi>ſolemn ſtep and ſlow,</hi> having nearly one half of their whole detachment killed and wounded.</p>
            <p>The bloody Rubicon was now paſſed, and Congreſs, having cloſed with the Britiſh in an awful appeal to the ſword, ſaw the neceſſity of appointing a <hi>Commander in chief.</hi> In a moment the great name of Waſhington was buzzed from Georgia to New Hampſhire. Congreſs haſtened to meet the wiſh of the nation; and Waſhington was unanimouſly elected Commander in chief of the armies of his country. On the third day of July<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1775, he arrived at the continental camp near Boſton, where he was received with great joy, after having been treated on his way through the ſtates, with all the attention due to that great and virtuous man, to whom, under God, the whole continent looked for ſafety and freedom. During this autumn and winter of 1775.

            <p>In the ſpring of 1776, Waſhington gave orders to erect on the heights near Boſton, three large batteries, whoſe heavy fire both of balls and bombs ſoon rendered the town ſo intolerably hot, that General Gage was glad to evacuate it on the 17th of March, when Waſhington marched in with the honours of a triumph, and was welcomed by the people and by the ſtate aſſembly, as Heaven's agent of their deliverance. In conſequence of ſome diſturbances, this year in Carolina in favour of the miniſtry, Sir Peter Parker was diſpatched with nine ſhips of war, from fifty to twenty guns each, with a large land force commanded by Clinton and Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis, to make an attempt on Charleſton the capital of South Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina. Before the ſhips could be brought to pay their reſpects to the town, they muſt, it ſeems, paſs a little <hi>fort</hi> on Sullivan's iſland. This, however, being defended only by the raw militia, was hardly looked on as any obſtacle. Happily for America, Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d committed the command of it to General Moultrie. About ten o'clock, June 28th, Sir Peter Parker having brought his ſhips of war cloſe along ſide the fort, began a tremendous can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonade upon it, not without expecting to ſee the militia fly, like frightened rats from an old barn on fire. But, very contrary to his hopes, the Provincials ſtood their ground as though they grew to the ſoil, and levelling their eighteen pounders with good aim, they bored the miniſterial ſhips through and through at every fire. Their third broad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The ſlaughter on board the ſhips was very great. The quarter-deck of the Briſtol (the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore's ſhip) was at one time cleared of every ſoul, except the Commodore himſelf, whoſe ſmall clothes were rudely torn off by a cannon ball. So that Sir Peter was the firſt Sans Culotte ever heard of in America. Would to God he had been the laſt.</p>

Another, while roaring away with his 18 pounder, was terribly ſhattered by a Cannon ball. When about to expire, he lifted up his dying eyes and ſaid—"<hi>My brave Countrymen. I
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:039062_0014_10138EEB90B607C8"/>
die, but don't let the cauſe of liberty die with me.</hi>" Now louder and louder, ſtill peal on peal, the American thunder burſt forth with earth trembling craſhes; and the Britiſh ſhips, after a long and gallant ſtruggle, hauled off with a good fortnights worth of work for Surgeons, Carpenters and Splicers.</p>
            <p>About this time the great queſtion of <hi>independence,</hi> was propoſed in Congreſs. The honourable Samuel Chaſe, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> the Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Maryland, was the firſt who had the honour to ſay on the floor of Congreſs, that, <hi>"he owed no allegiance to the King of Great Britain."</hi> On the ever memorable 4th of July, 1776, the United States were declared a FREE AND INDEPENDENT NATION. God Admighty grant us virtue enough, for ever to live ſo!!</p>
            <p>A few days after this, Lord Howe came upon the coaſt with a huge foreſt of men of war and tranſports, ſhading far and wide the frightened ocean, and bearing nearly forty thouſand men, Britiſh Heſſians, and Waldeckers. Suppoſing that this had intimidated the American commander, Lord Howe wrote a letter to him, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected <hi>"to George Waſhington,</hi> 
               <abbr>
                  <hi>Eſq.</hi>
               </abbr>" This Waſhington refuſed to receive, looking on it as an inſult to Congreſs, under whom he had the honour to bear the commiſſion of Commander in Chief, and ſhould have been addreſſed as ſuch. General Howe then ſent an officer to converſe with him on the ſubject of <hi>reconciliation.</hi> Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard what he had to ſay, Waſhington replied, "by what has yet appeared, ſir, you have no power but to grant <hi>pardons;</hi> but we, who have committed no fault, want no pardons, for we are fighting only for our rights, as the deſcendants of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men."</p>
            <p>The unfortunate defeat, of Long Iſland, now took place, on Auguſt 28th, which though the <hi>hotteſt</hi> day in the <hi>year,</hi> had like to have been the <hi>freezing point</hi> in the American affairs. For, on this day, the Britiſh, with an infinite ſuperiority of force, after having defeated the Americans with great loſs, were inveſting the ſlender remains of their army, and had actually broke ground within ſix hundred yards of the little redoubt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that feebly covered their front. Soon as it was dark Waſhington ordered the troops to convey their baggage and artillery to the water fide, whence it was tranſported over a broad ferry all night long, with amazing ſilence and order. Providentially a thick fog continued next morning till ten o'clock; When that paſſed away, and the ſun broke out, the Britiſh were equally ſurpriſed and enraged to ſee the rear guard with the laſt of the baggage, in their boats and out of all danger.</p>
            <p>Lord Howe, ſuppoſing that ſuch a run of miſfortunes muſt have put Congreſs into a good humour to think about <hi>peace,</hi> ſignified a willingneſs to have a <hi>grand talk</hi> on the ſubject. Congreſs ſent

But finding that his lordſhip was ſtill harping on the old ſtring, <hi>pardons, pardons;</hi> not liking ſuch muſic, they took up their hats, and very <hi>erectly</hi> ſtalked off. Towards the cloſe of this trying campaign, it is a fact that Waſhington had not 3000 men, and even theſe were ſo deſtitute of <hi>neceſſaries,</hi> that nothing but their love and veneration of him kept them together. And with this handful he had to opppoſe a victorious army of nearly fifty thouſand veterans!! But Jehovah the God of Hoſts was with him, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Waſhington hovered around them waiting for an opportunity to ſtrike. An opportunity ſoon offered. Learning that the enemy at Trenton, (in number about 2000, chiefly Heſſians) were lulled into that ſtate of ſecurity which frequent victories and a contempt of an enemy, too naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire; he formed the deſign to ſurpriſe them. Chriſtmas night (76) was pitched on for the purpoſe. Having divided his little force into three bodies, he gave the command of two of theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to generals Ewing and Cadwaliader, with orders to croſs the river juſt <hi>below</hi> Trenton. Aſſiſted by general Green, Waſhington him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf led the principal body over M'Konky's ferry, 9 miles <hi>above.</hi> It was his plan to reach town about day <hi>break,</hi> but by reaſon of the immenſe quantities of ice in the river, and a violent ſtorm of hail and ſnow, he did not arrive till 8 o'Clock. The troops under Cadwallader and Ewing, could not croſs at all. The inſtant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the attack, he animated his men by the following ſpeech.</p>
            <p>"<hi>My brave Countrymen,</hi> now is the the important moment to ſtrike a blow, which, however inconſiderable in appearance, may draw after it conſequences the moſt deſirable and glorious.

He would have proceeded, but was interrupted by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ager cries of his men—<hi>Lead us on; lead us on to the enemy."</hi> In an inſtant, like lightning, they came up with the out guards, and pouring in their fire, drove them back into to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n, ſeized their artillery, and were on the eve of diſcharging on their main body, a ſtorm of cannon and muſquet balls, when they prudently threw down their arms and cried out for quarter. The brave col. Rhal, with 40 of his men were killed, and 1000 taken priſoners. The reſt, at the beginning of the <hi>rumpus,</hi> took down the road to Bordentown, and ſo <hi>cleared</hi> themſelves. If Ewing and Cadwallader could but have croſſed the river, and ſeized the Trenton bridge according to Waſhington's orders, the whole of the Britiſh forces at Trenton, Bordentown and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington, would have been as completely taken as ever was a gang of partridges in a fowler's net. However, this bold ſtroke threw gen. Howe into ſuch a tremor, that he inſtantly called off all his cantonments from the Delaware to Brunſwick and Amboy, within the welcome ſight and ſmell of their men of war.</p>
            <p>Tho' this victory was gained on the 26th of December, and Waſhington, in order to animate his country men, had marched his priſoners to Philadelphia, yet we find him again, on the 1ſt of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, acroſs the angry Delaware, and raiſing aloft his Country's flag, bold-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>tack him. Finding that the enemy, greatly ſuperior in numbers, were endeavoring to ſurround him, and ſeeing no poſſibility, on account of the ice, to re-croſs the Delaware; Waſhington was obliged again to recur to ſtratagem, of which no general perhaps ever had a larger ſtock. He kept up a heavy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonade on the enemy till night, then lighting a vaſt number of fires, and leaving guards at the bridges, he puſhed off about mid-night for Princeton, and at ſun-riſe, came down upon another heavy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Britiſh, who had juſt ſtruck their tents, and were coming on in high ſpirits to attack him at Trenton. To it, in a moment, both parties <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The great name of Waſhington imparted its uſual animation to his troops. The enemy gave way in all quarters, and were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued 4 miles. The victors returned with 400 priſoners; the bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onet had ſtopp'd 120 on the field. But they fell not alone. The Gallant Mercer and 63 of his brave countrymen ſleep with them. But the ſtri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Britiſh officers gave our Waſhington full credit for ſuch fine ſtrokes of generalſhip, and began to look thoughtful whenever his name was mentioned.</p>
            <p>The enemy now (January 15th.) drew in all their forces to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quarters at Brunſwick, where Waſhington continued to thin their number by cutting off their foraging parties; ſo that every load of hay or diſh of ſprouts they got, was at the price of blood.</p>
            <p>Thus gloriouſly, in ten days, was turn'd the tide of victory in favor of America, by him whom heaven, in mercy, not to America alone, but to Britain and to the world, had raiſed up to found here a wide empire of liberty and virtue. The character of Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington was exalted to the higheſt pitch even throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> where he was generally ſtiled the American Fabius, from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Roman general of that name who oppoſed Hannibal with ſucceſs. A diſtinction to which he was juſtly entitled, from the invincible firmneſs with which he rejected every bait and fineſſe of the Britiſh generals; as alſo, from that admirable judgment with which he ſuited the defence of his country to the genius and abilities of the people, and to the natural advantages of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try itſelf; thereby not allowing the enemy to profit by their great ſuperiority of <hi>numbers, diſcipline,</hi> and <hi>artillery,</hi> and conſtantly cutting them off by ſkirmiſhes and ſurpriſe.</p>
            <p>The miniſterial plan for this year (1777) was to reduce the Americans, by cutting off all communication between the northern and ſouthern ſtates!! To effect this, general Howe, with 20,000 men, was to go round from New-York to the head of Elk, and thence march on, due north, thro' Philadelphia, while general Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne, with 10,000 men, ſetting out from Canada, was to paſs along down the lakes, and thence due ſouth to meet his brother Howe; the ſtrait line, formed by the junction of theſe two gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, was to poſſeſs ſuch virtue, that, it was ſuppoſed, no American could ever be found hardy enough to ſet foot over it!!</p>
            <p>Accordingly, July 23, general Howe left Sandy Hook, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ailed up the Cheſeapeake, and landing at the, mouth of <hi>Elk River</hi> marched on with but little interruption, except at Brandy wine, to Philadelphia. Into this elegant city, on the 26th of September 77, he entered in triumph; fondly ſuppoſing, that, in America as in Europe, the capture of the city, was the ſame thing as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the country. But inſtead of finding himſelf maſter of this great continent, whoſe Rattle Snakes alone, in the hand of heaven, could ſcourge his preſumption; it was with no ſmall diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty he could keep poſſeſſion even of the little village of German<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town. For on the morning of the 4th of October, Waſhington made an attack on him with ſuch judgment and fury, that his
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:039062_0018_10138EF8CCBBA4C0"/>
troops gave way in every quarter. <hi>"The tumult, diſorder</hi> and <hi>diſpair</hi> in the <hi>Britiſh Army,</hi> ſays Waſhington, <hi>were unparelled.</hi> But in the very moment of the moſt deciſive and glorious victory, when ſome of the Provincial regiments had more priſoners than men, the Americans began to <hi>retreat!!</hi> Waſhington's grief and mortification, were inexpreſſible.</p>
            <p>But while he was annoying the enemy by land, he did not loſe ſight of their fleet, which was now forcing its way up the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, to keep open to the army a channel of ſupplies. They ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived without moleſtation, within 8 miles of Philadelphia, at a marſh called Mud-Iſland. On this poor harmleſs ſpot, the fitteſt however that nature in this peaceful land of Friends could furniſh, Waſhington had ordered a fort to be thrown up, the command of which with 230 men, he aſſigned to lieutenant col. Sam. Smith. On the eaſtern or Jerſey ſide of the river, at a place called Red Bank, he ordered a ſtrong redoubt; the command of which with 205 men, was given to Col. Greene. Theſe, with ſome chevaux de frize ſunk in the river, and a few gallies, formed all the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier that Waſhington could preſent againſt the Britiſh navy. The ſtrength of this barrier, was ſoon put to a fiery trial. Great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations were made to attack the Americans, at the ſame inſtant, both by land and water. Count Donop; with a hoſt of Heſſians, was ſent over to be in readineſs to attack Red Bank, while the tide of flood, groaning under their enormous weight, brought up the men of war. The morning was ſtill, and the heavens overeaſt with ſad clouds, as of nature ſympathiſing with her children, and ready to drop ſhowers of celeſtial pity on their ſtrifes. No ſooner had the ſhips floated up within three cables length of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ort, than they began a moſt tremendous cannonade: while cannon ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and fire tailed bombs, like Comets, fell upon it thick as hail. The gallant Smith and his myrmidons ſtood the ſhock to a miracle, and like men fighting under the eye of their Waſhington, drove the two and thirty pounders thro' them with ſuch ſpirit and ſucceſs, that, in a little time the Auguſta, a heavy 64 gun ſhip, took fire and blew up, the horrid balloon of the greateſt part of the crew. Another ſhip, called the Merlin or <hi>Black Bird,</hi> ſoon got on the wing and followed the Auguſta.</p>
            <p>At the ſame moment, col. Donop, with his Heſſians, made a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant attack on the fort at Red Bank. After a few and well direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fires, Greene and his men artfully retired from the <hi>out-works.</hi> The enemy now ſuppoſing the day <hi>their own,</hi> ruſhed on in vaſt numbers along a large opening in the fort, and within twenty ſteps of a maſked battery of 18 pounders loaded with grape ſhot and ſpike nails. All at once, Hell itſelf ſeemed to open before their affrighted view. But their pains and their terrors were but for a moment. Together down they ſunk by hundreds, into the ſweet ſlumbers of death, ſcarcely ſenſible of the fatal blow that ſtruck them.</p>

The widow's wail, the virgin's ſhriek, and infant's trembling cry, was muſic in their ears. In cold blood they ſtruck their cruel tomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks into the defenceleſs head of a Miſs M'Rae, a beautiful girl who was that very day to have been married.

The New Englanders, who were the neareſt to theſe infernal ſcenes, turned out in maſs.

The firſt check given to Burgoyne's career, was at Bennington. Hearing that the Americans had laid up large proviſions in that town, he detached a colonel Baum with 600 Germans to ſurpriſe it; and at the ſame time, poſted colonel Breyman in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, with an equal number, to ſupport him if neceſſary. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place too well guarded either for ſurpriſe or ſtorm, Baum fortified himſelf at a little diſtance, and ſent back for Breyman. The American commander, the brave general Starke, thinking theſe enemies fully enough, at leaſt, not wiſhing for any more, ſallied out and with great fury attacked Baum's intrenchments. At the firſt onſet, the Canadians and Britiſh markſmen took to their heels, and left the poor Germans in the lurch. After a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant reſiſtance, Baum was mortally wounded, and his brave coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen killed or taken to a man. In the mean time, Breymen, who had not heard a ſyllable of all this, arrived at the place of action, where, inſtead of the cheering huzzas of joyful friends, he was ſaluted, on all hands, with the deadly whizzing of rifle-bullets. After receiving a few cloſe and ſcorching fires, the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ain to try their ſhanks. The enemy loſt in theſe two engagements not leſs than 800 men, in killed, wounded, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time, all their forts on the lakes were ſurpriſed—Colonel St. Leger was defeated at fort Stanwix—The Indians began to deſert—Arnold and Morgan were coming up like moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-ſtorms—and the militia from all quarters, were pouring in. Burgoyne began to be alarmed, and wrote to New-York for help; but, finding that Clinton could give him none, and that the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his army depended on themſelves, he gallantly determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on the 7th of October, (77) to ſtake his all on the caſt of a general battle.</p>
            <p>His army, in high ſpirits, was formed within a mile of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican camp. Burgoyne himſelf, with the flower of the Britiſh troops compoſed the centre; Brigadier Gneneral Frazer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the left; the Germans headed by Major Generals Phillips and Reidſdel, and Colonel Breyman, formed the right; with a fine train of artillery, flying colours, and a full roll of martial muſic, from wing to wing the towering heroes moved. On the other hand, <hi>fired</hi> with the love of liberty and their country, the Americans poured out by thouſands, eager for the glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. The action began by a moſt furious attack on the centre of the Britiſh army, and extending along the left wing. The Grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers behaved with their uſual gallanty, but were obliged to give way. Perceiving that they were ſinking under the weight of the American fire, Gates ordered a ſtrong body to march <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ank, while Morgan, with a heavy reinforcement, haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the left to decide the action there. Theſe charges was made with ſuch impetuoſity, that the enemy was thrown into the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:039062_0021_10138F03B96C16A8"/>
utmoſt confuſion. To ſave them from total deſtruction, the brave General Frazer flew to their aſſiſtance. In this attempt he loſt his life and great numbers of his men were ſlain. The ſituation of this part of the Royal army becoming now exceedingly critical, and the danger encreaſing every moment, a retreat was ordered. But ſcarcely had they entered their camp, when the Americans ſtormed it with all the fury of Lions: with trailed arms ruſhing to the charge through a ſevere fire of grape ſhot and muſquetry. The Britiſh fought with equal deſperation, for their <hi>all</hi> was at ſtake, and the Americans, like a whelming flood, were burſting over their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, and hand to hand with arguments of bloody ſteel, were pleading the cauſe of ages yet unborn. For ſome time, the mortal ſtrife was maintained on both ſides, with a bravery that was never exceeded. But in that moment of danger and of glory, the impetuous Arnold who led them on, was dangerouſly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and forced to retire, and ſeveral regiments of Britiſh Infantry pouring in to the aſſiſtance of their gallant comrades, the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, after many hard ſtruggles, were finally repulſed. In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quarter, where the ſtrength of the Germans fought, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans led on by Morgan, carried the entrenchments ſword in hand. Colonel Breymen, with the greateſt part of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, was killed, and their baggage, tents and artillery, all fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Conquerors. This was a bloody day to both armies; but ſo peculiarly diſheartening to the Britiſh, that they were obliged to retreat that night to Saratoga, where, in a few days (on the 13th of October 1777.) they ſurrendered to Gates and the Americans, by whom they were treated with a generoſity that perfectly aſtoniſhed them. For when the Britiſh were marched out to lay down their arms, there was not an American to be ſeen! They had all nobly retired, for a moment, as if unwilling to give the pain, <hi>even to their enemies,</hi> of being ſpectators of ſo humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſcene! Worthy countrymen of Waſhington! this deed of yours ſhall out live the ſtars; and the bleſt Sun himſelf, <hi>ſmiling,</hi> ſhall proclaim, that in the wide travel of his beams, he never looked upon its like before.</p>
            <p>Thus gloriouſly for America, ended the campaign of 77. 78 began as auſpiciouſly. In May, Silas Deane arrived from France with the welcome news of a <hi>treaty</hi> with that powerful People; and a letter from Louis XVI<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Congreſs, whom he ſtyled—<hi>Very Dear Great Friends and Allies.</hi> On the 6th of June commiſſioners arrived from Britain with Lord North's conciliatory plan, wherein was offered every thing that America <hi>once</hi> contended for, or co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

On the 18th of June, the Britiſh army, now under the command of Clinton, evacuated Philadelphia for New-York. The figure they made on the road had ſomething the air of the <hi>ſublime;</hi> for their baggage, loaded horſes, and carriages, formed a line not leſs than twelve miles in length. General Waſhington, whoſe eye, like that of the ſacred Dragon, was always open and fixed upon the enemies of America, immediately croſſed the Delaware after them—puſhed on detached corps to obſtruct their advance—gall their flanks—and fall on their rear, while he himſelf moved on with the body of the army. By the 27th, Clinton had got on as far as Monmouth, and Waſhington's troops were cloſe on his flank and rear. Next morning he ordered general Lee with 5000 men, to begin the attack; himſelf moving on briſkly to ſupport him. But to his aſtoniſhment, as he advanced, he met Lee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating, and the enemy impetuouſly purſuing. Here Waſhington was ſeen in all his ſplendor; for the moment of danger and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was always the orb in which he ſhown the brighteſt. At <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ight of <hi>him</hi> his troops recovered their wonted ſpirits and wheeled around furiouſly to the charge. The enemy finding themſelves now warmly oppoſed in front, made an attempt to turn his left flank, but were gallantly attacked and driven back. They then made a rapid puſh to the right, but the brave Green with a choice body of troops and artillery, repulſed them with conſiderable ſlaughter. At the ſame inſtant Wayne advanced with his <hi>Game Chickens,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Every body has heard of Paoli.</note> and poured in ſo ſevere and well directed a fire, that the enemy were glad to get back to their defiles. Morgan's rifles were full hot that day. Waſhington and his heroe's lay upon their arms all night, reſolved to fall on the enemy the moment they ſhould attempt their retreat next morning. But during the night they moved off in <hi>ſilence,</hi> and got ſuch a ſtart that Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington thought it dangerous in ſuch hot weather, to make a puſh after them. Waſhington loſt fifty-eight killed—140 wounded. The Britiſh had 249 killed, and the wounded in proportion. Numbers, on both ſides, died of the extreme <hi>heat,</hi> and <hi>cold water,</hi>

            <p>In September 1780, an attempt was made to take off our Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, and by means which I can hardly believe the old Britiſh Lion was ever well pleaſed with. The brave General Arnold, having been appointed to the government of Philadelphia, was alas! over-perſuaded by the devil to make a <hi>ſhaving buſineſs</hi> of it. But, unſkilled in the uſe of the ſwindling razor, he unfortunately cut many of his cuſtomers, ſo near the quick, that they never gave over bawling untill they got him into the Star chamber. Congreſs, unwilling to expoſe the man who had fought ſo bravely in the cauſe of liberty, thought they would make what the muſicians call, a <hi>piano ſlur</hi> of it, and be done with it; for it was a piece of vile diſcord to generous American ears. For the ſame reaſon, the god-like Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:039062_0023_10138F0A57E4E1E0"/>
hurried it over, and after a gentle reprimand of Arnold, gave him the command of Weſt-point with a large body of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican troops. The hiſtory of Arnold's embarraſſments and his quarrel with his countrymen, ſoon got down to New-York to the Britiſh commander, who, well knowing the tickliſh ſituation of a <hi>proud</hi> man caught on the horns of <hi>poverty,</hi> ſends him up a Major Andre with money in his pocket. The Major, by means yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the public, got near enough to Arnold to <hi>probe</hi> him, and, alas! found him, both in principle and purſe, hollow as an exhauſted receiver, and very willing to be filled up with Engliſh guineas. Engliſh guineas are offered him; and Arnold agrees, Oh ſhocking to humanity! Arnold agrees to ſacrifice Waſhington to the Britiſh! To be certified of this delightful truth, Andre, during Waſhington's abſence from Weſt-point, comes aſhore from a ſloop of war, with a ſurtout over his regimentals, ſpends a day and night with Arnold, ſees, with his own eyes, the dear train laid, the matches lighted, and every thing in readineſs, a few nights hence, to ſend the old Virginia farmer and his republic a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Every thing being ſettled to ſatisfaction, Andre wiſhes to ſet off to carry the glad news to General Clinton, But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, by a fine ſtroke of Providential interference, he cannot get on board the ſhip!! Arnold gives him a horſe and a paſs to go to New-York by land. Under the name of Anderſon he paſſes, in ſafety, all the guards. Now, like an uncaged bird and light as the air he breathes, he ſweeps along the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But why ſhould I tell how Major Andre died? The place where his gallows ſtood is overgrown, with weeds—but ſmiling an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels often viſit the ſpot, for it was <hi>bathed with the tears of his foes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His candour, on his examination, in ſome ſort expiated his crime, it melted the angel ſoul of Waſhington, and the tears of the hero were mingled with the ink that ſigned the death warrant of the hapleſs youth. The wretched Arnold fled. Britiſh hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians have wondered that he left his wife in the dangerous power of Waſhington. But Arnold knew in whom he truſted; and the god-like man behaved exactly as Arnold had foreſeen; for he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent him his clothes and baggage, and wrote a polite letter of condolence to his lady, offering her a conveyance to her huſband, or, to her friends in Pennſylvania. Waſhington now waged the war with various ſucceſs. On the one hand, his hero of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratoga (Gates), was defeated with conſiderable loſs at Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; On the other, the Britiſh loſt, on the King's mountain, the brave Colonel Ferguſon with all his army, 1,400 Men. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the defeat of Gates, Waſhington ſent on his favourite Greene to head the Southern Army againſt the victorious Cornwallis and Tarleton. With Greene he joined the famous Morgan, whoſe riflemen had done ſuch ſignal ſervice during the War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In order</hi> to draw Cornwallis's attention from a blow meditated againſt the Britiſh poſt at Ninety-ſix, Greene detached Morgan with 300 regulars, 500 Militia and 100 Horſe, to Paulet's river, near the neighbourhood of Cornwallis and Tartelon. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the pride of Tarleton roſe. He begged of his friend Lord Rawdon to obtain for him the permiſſion of the Commander in chief, to go and attack Morgan. <hi>"By heaven, my Lord,"</hi> ſaid he, <hi>"I would not deſire a finer feather in my cap, than Colonel Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. Such a priſoner, would make my fortune." "Ah Ben, replied Rawdon, very cooly, you had better let the Old Waggoner alone."</hi> As no refuſal could ſatisfy, permiſſion at length was granted him; and he inſtantly ſet out with a 1000 choice Infantry, 300 Horſe and two pieces of cannon. His force was to Morgans, at leaſt as 5 to 4. At parting, he ſaid to Lord Rawdon with a ſmile; <hi>My Lord if you will be ſo obliging as to wait dinner, the day after to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, till 4'o clock, Colonel Morgan ſhall be one of your Lordſhips' gueſts." "Very well, Ben,"</hi> ſaid the other, <hi>"we ſhall wait."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Morgan bravely ſtood his ground, and, at a place called the Cowpens, drew up his men with moſt admirable judgement.—He paraded his Militia in a large field, but near a piece of thick woods: this was made to appear as his whole force; but cloſe behind them and in the edge of the woods, he concealed his Regulars. Scarce was this arrangement made, before the thundering rattle of Tarleton's drums was heard, and the Enemy, Horſe and Foot, poured in on the other ſide of the field in all their glittering ſteel.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:039062_0025_10138F0F026EE8D8"/>
The Militia ſuffered them to advance within a hundred yards, and, then gave them a well directed fire, and, according to orders, <hi>broke,</hi> to gain the woods, and form behind the Regulars. The Britiſh ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Morgan's whole force now put to the rout, advanced with ſuch impetuoſity that Tarleton's horſe had like to have cut down ſome of the fugitives before they reached the woods. Suſpecting no danger nigh, and ruſhing on as to certain victory, the enemy were now within ten ſteps of Morgan's riflemen, with every man his finger on the fatal trigger, and his unerring ſight drawn upon his brothers heart. Sons of Columbia! let the curtain drop: for who, without weeping eyes, can behold the horrid tragedy that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, or the pale cloud of ſhrieking ghoſts that ſuddenly aſcended from the bloody field! Oh! that they may have wing'd their way to that bleſt world, where <hi>ſtrife</hi> and <hi>groans,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known! The ſurvivors, Tarleton and a few horſe excepted, were taken.</p>
            <p>Waſhingtons heroes, continued the war, againſt the Britiſh, till July 81; when Cornwallis reſolved to puſh into Virginia and to fortify himſelf at York-town. But the eye of Waſhington was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and, with an addreſs hardly ever equalled, concerted a plan that ended in his total deſtruction—He artfully wrote letters to Green, informing, that <hi>"in order to relieve Virginia, he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined immediately to attack New-York.</hi> Theſe letters were ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of as to fall into the right hands. Clinton took the alarm. But while Clinton was in daily expectation of a viſit from him, Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington and his army, now acroſs the Delaware, were in full ſtretch to the South, darkening the day with their clouds of rolling duſt. Cornwallis ſaw now that the day of his fall was at hand. He had done all that man could do, but all in vain. On the laſt of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Waſhington ſat down before York with about 100 pieces of heavy artillery. On the 7th, of October, this dreadful train began to thunder; and the Britiſh works ſunk before them. Lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis, unwilling to expoſe his gallant army to the deſtruction of a general aſſault, agreed on the 17th, to ſurrender. This was juſtly conſidered as the cloſe of War; which having been <hi>begun</hi> with <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> Waſhington piouſly ordered to be finiſhed with <hi>thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> In the Seige of Cornwallis, the behaviour of the Americans<note n="*" place="bottom">The Amiable Colonel Scammel, Adjutant General of the American Army, and uncommonly beloved by them, was badly wounded, and taken priſoner by ſome Britiſh Dragoons, who trotted him, on, before them, throe miles, into town, where, he preſently died!! Great was the grief and rage for Scammel. In a few nights, Waſhington gave orders to ſtorm one of the enemy's redoubts, which was carried almoſt in an inſtant. The Britiſh called for Quarters. A voice of death was heard, <hi>"Remember poor Scammel."</hi>—<hi>"Remember, Gentlemen, you are Americans,"</hi> was rejoined by the Commander, and inſtantly the points of the American bayonets were thrown up towards <hi>heaven.</hi>

            <p>At the concluſion of the war this truly illuſtrious man, with a ſoul far ſuperior to the low ambition of governing, ſurrendered up to Congreſs all the authority with which he had been inveſted. Never was there a more glorious diſplay of the power which vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue poſſeſſes over the human heart, than on that memorable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. Congreſs was then ſitting at Annapolis. Waſhington had informed them of his intention to reſign on the following day. The houſe was crouded with the moſt reſpectoble charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the univerſe. Waſhington aroſe, and with a dignified modeſty peculiar to himſelf, preſented into the hands of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Congreſs, the commiſſion which he had received from them ſeven years before. They now ſaw <hi>before</hi> them the man whom they had long conſidered as ſent of God to ſave them and their children from ſlavery—<hi>the man</hi> who for this greateſt of all purpoſes had cheerfully relinquiſhed every pleaſure of life, and bravely expoſed himſelf to all its evils—<hi>the man</hi> who for ſeven long years of difficulty and danger, had manifeſted the moſt unflinching zeal for his country, and had been made the honoured inſtrument of ſecuring to them liberty, property and every thing moſt dear and valuable—<hi>the man,</hi> who, in conſequence of all this poſſeſſed ſo entirely the hearts of his army and of the nation, that he could eaſily have made himſelf their maſter—They now ſaw this man, ſcorning to abuſe his power to the diſhonour of the mother-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but, on the contrary, treating her with the moſt profound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect—dutifully bowing before her <hi>delegated preſence,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs—returning the commiſſion ſhe had entruſted him with—pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly laying down his unbounded power at her feet—and cheerfully falling back into the humble condition of the reſt of her children. The ſight of this great man acting in ſo generous, ſo godlike a manner, produced an effect beyond the power of words to expreſs. Virtue appeared to ſtand before them arrayed in more than mortal charms. Their feelings of admiration and delight were too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious—too big for utterance. A flood of tears guſhed from every eye, which though a <hi>ſilent</hi> was perhaps the richeſt offering of veneration and eſteem ever paid to a human being.</p>
            <p>On the 4th of February 1789, when the Federal Conſtitution was adopted, he was by the unanimous voice of his country elected Preſident of the United States, and before the expiration of four years, for which he had received his appointment, he was with equal unanimity re-elected to the ſame honourable ſtation.

but afterwards when Mr. Pitt was pleaſed to turn looſe his cruiſers upon our defenceleſs commerce, and when the French Directory and their agents, abuſing the friendly ſentiments which we entertained towards them on account of their former ſervices, endeavoured to draw us into their war—when our citizens, impiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgetting their own country, were divided and diſtracted by foreign politics, then it was that WASHINGTON failed to pleaſe ſome. But indeed it was not for an angel of God to pleaſe ſuch oppoſite parties, one of whom was furiouſly clamorous for a war with Britain, the other as keen ſet on a game of logger heads with France. In the midſt of theſe violent commotions, WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON turned not to the right hand nor to the left to humour any party. Placed by his country at the ſacred helm of her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with no pole ſtar but her good, no compaſs but duty, like a brave and heaven-aſſiſted pilot, he ſteered our great national bark ſafely thro' the Scylla and Charybdis, the dangerous rocks and whirlpools of French and Engliſh politics.</p>
            <p>Little minds are dazzled with pomp and ſhow, to ſuch, WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON muſt have appeared little leſs than a God, when at York amidſt the thunder and lightning of the war, the Britiſh Lion crouched before him, and Cornwallis and Tarleton with ſeven thouſand veteran troops, grounded their arms and acknowledged his ſuperiority. But however great, however glorious he might have appeared as a triumphant conqueror, he muſt appear far greater, far more glorious as the noiſeleſs ſtateſman, whoſe wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and firmneſs preſerved his country from the ruin and horrors of war, and ſecured to it all the bleſſings of peace and flouriſhing commerce. And however this wiſe, this beneficent conduct of his may have been reprobated by ſome, yet the day is at hand, when he, whom all the clamours of a too paſſionate party, could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade to let ſlip the hell hounds of war to feaſt on the cries and blood of mankind, will be revered and beloved as one of the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Angels of the human race: Yes, when thoſe unfeeling Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who, to monopolize the ſale of ſugars and of ſpices, could without remorſe, deluge the earth and dye the ocean with human gore, ſhall be remembered only to be accurſed, then ſhall the name of WASHINGTON ſound in the delighted ears of poſterity, as the name of ſome gentle angel of God ſent on errands of love to his country: when bloody Kings and Conquerors, with all their eclat, ſhall have paſſed away like the black ſtorms of night which deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated nations in their courſe, then ſhall our WASHINGTON, like

            <p>When our children and our childrens children, hearing the great name of WASHINGTON re-echoed from every lip, ſhall aſk their fathers "what was it that raiſed WASHINGTON to this godlike height of glory?" Let them be told, that, "it was his GREAT VIRTUES, thoſe precious plants of life, the native ſhoots of a ſoul, like his, early watered with the dews of heaven-born religion." Yes, let them be told; and O! may they never forget! that the ſame of WASHINGTON which hath gone forth throughout the earth, and aſcended the higheſt heavens, aroſe from his early ſenſe of <hi>religion,</hi> that only ſource of human virtue and of human greatneſs. For how ſhall frail man, prone to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious caſe and pleaſure, ever aſcend the arduous ſteeps of virtue and of glory, unleſs animated by the mighty hopes of religion?

No, no, to be truly great, a man muſt have not only great talents but great virtues, and theſe muſt have nerves of ſteel too, to bear him ſtrongly up till death, for if he ſhould ever turn aſide to vice, farewell for ever his reputation as a hero.

But why ſhould I ſummon the Arnolds, the Cromwells, the Bacons, the Caeſars and Alexanders of the earth, to give ſad evidence that no valour, no genius <hi>alone</hi> can make men <hi>great?</hi> Do we not <hi>daily</hi> meet with melancholy inſtances of youth, lovely as innocence, ſparkling as wit, and promiſing to the full of their fond parents wiſhes, who, yet, merely for lack of religion, ſoon make ſhipwreck of all this precious cargo; ſacrificing their gold to gamblers, their health to harlots, and their glory to grog; making conſcience their curſe, this life a purgatory, and the next a hell!! In fact a man though of the greateſt talents, without religion, is but like a gorgeous ſhip without ballaſt: highly paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and with flowing canvas, ſhe launches out upon the deep, and during a ſmooth ſea and gentle breezes, ſhe moves along ſtately as the pride of ocean; but ſoon as the ſtormy winds deſcend, and the blackning billows begin to roll, ſuddenly ſhe is overſet and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears for ever. But who is this coming thus gloriouſly along, with maſts towering to heaven, and his ſails white looming like the mountain of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The warm zephyrs of proſperity breathe meltingly upon him, the chill ſtorms of adverſity deſcend in all their fury; the big billows of affliction daſh violently againſt him, but nothing can move him; his eye is fixed on God, his thoughts on the ſame that remaineth after death: The preſent joys of an approving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the glory that ſadeth not away, theſe comfort and ſupport him.</p>
            <p>Never perhaps, had human being a more vivid ſenſe than WASHINGTON, of that great truth which lies at the bottom of all our religion and of all our joys; I mean, the belief of a <hi>particular providence.</hi> His ſtrong, vigorous mind clearly diſcerned that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, whom nature through all her wondrous works proclaims aloud: that mighty God who fills the heaven of heavens with his glory, yet every where preſent with his works, paints the humble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

To this ever preſent parent and preſerver of men. WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON aſcribed all thoſe rich mercies which crowned his life—His favored birth at ſo ſingularly important a time and place—his extraordinary riſe from obſcu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When called by his country in 1775, to lead her freedom-loving ſons againſt the arms of Britain, what charming modeſty, what noble ſelf-diſtruſt, what pious confidence in heaven, appeared in all his anſwers! How widely different from the behaviour of Suwarrow on a ſimilar occaſion! When that butcher of the Poles was appointed by the Emperor of Ruſſia, to command his forces againſt the French, he replied, "I thank your Highneſs, and <hi>will beat the French!!</hi>" Vain mortal! Shall the Father of mercies de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rt the ſouls that he has created, let drop his everlaſting reins of government, and ſuffer a Demon to break the nations before him like a potter's veſſel! No! WASHINGTON thought not ſo. Firmly perſuaded that he who formed "this univerſal frame thus wondrous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>air," formed it on ſome great plan worthy of infinite wiſdom and goodneſs, he wiſely concluded, that God would never give to <hi>another his glory,</hi> the glory of governing it: nor allow to angels, men, or devils to act but in ſubſerviency to his adorable deſign. Filled with this ſublimely delightful idea, WASHINGTON found no place for pride—ſaw himſelf but as a mortal man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils—whoſe place is but a point—his time a moment—and himſelf an atom in the hand of God to accompliſh his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will. Hence when called to the chief command, by his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen who expected every thing from his great abilities, how utterly did he renounce all ſelf-ſufficiency? how earneſtly did he conjure his countrymen "to ceaſe from man, nor truſt in the arm of fleſh, but in the living God, whoſe alone the victory is, with whom it is all one to ſave by many or by few."—Who, in the flame of battle, can ſtrike a ſudden panic through the hearts of the brave, or give the lion's courage to the timid, as may beſt ſerve his all wiſe purpoſes.</p>

And when after, having conducted his countrymen through the great revolutionary war with ſuch ſingular ſucceſs, he again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an unanimous call to the PRESIDENT's CHAIR, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the heartieſt thanks of the Union for his great ſervices paſt, and an aſſured anticipation of equally great to come, read his anſwers <hi>"When I contemplate the interposition of Providence, as it was visibly manifested in guiding us through the revolution, in preparing us for the reception of a general government, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliating the good will of the people of America towards one another after its adoption; I feel myself oppressed and almost overwhelmed, with a sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And when he preſented himſelf, for the firſt time, before that auguſt body, the Congreſs of the United States, April 30, 1789—when he ſaw before him in full conclave the pride of Columbia in her choſen ſons, her Adamses, her Jefferſons, her Jays, her Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, her Lees, &amp;c. &amp;c.—Immortal heroes! whoſe wiſdom and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor had ſtood around her a wall of fire, during her long and ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtruggle for liberty and independence—when he ſaw thoſe illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious faces, which his knowledge of their GREAT VIRTUES ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſtill more illuſtrious; and whoſe eager eyes all fixed and ſhining on HIM, darted the ſweeteſt beams of admiration and of filial affection, then it was, that our WASHINGTON <hi>felt sensations unutterable; sensations that were left to more expressive silence</hi>—that ſacred pauſe of exquiſite bliſs which belongs alone to virtue to impart! and one moment of which far outweighs a whole eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of proſperous vice. And his addreſs to congreſs on that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant occaſion infinitely deſerved the ſolemn ſilence with which it was heard; infinitely deſerves to be remembered by every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, parliament, or congreſs, that may be held to the end of the world!</p>
            <p>The delegated Fathers of his country were before him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult on meaſures, of all others, the neareſt to his heart, on mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the beſt calculated to ſtrengthen the chain of love between the ſtates—to preſerve friendſhip and harmony with foreign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers—to ſecure the bleſſings of civil and religious liberty, of peace and proſperity to the union, and to build up our young republic, a great and happy people, among the nations of the earth. Never patriot entered on ſuch important buſineſs with fairer hopes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we conſider the unanimity and confidence of the citizens, or his own and the abilities and virtues of his fellow-counſellors; but all this would not do, nothing, ſhort of the divine friendſhip, could ſatisfy WASHINGTON.

In tendering this homage to the great author of every public and private good.

            <p>And after having come near the cloſe of this the moſt ſenſible and virtuous ſpeech ever made to a ſenſible and virtuous repreſentation of a free people, he adds—<q>I ſhall take my preſent leave; but, not, without reſorting <hi>once more</hi> to the benign parent of the human race, in humble ſupplication, that, ſince he has been pleaſed to favor the American people with opportunities for deliberating with perfect tranquillity; and diſpoſitions for deciding with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallelled unanimity on a form of government for the ſecurity of their union, and the advancement of their happineſs; ſo his divine bleſſings may be equally conſpicuous in the enlarged views, the temperate conſultations, and the wiſe meaſures, on which the ſucceſs of this government muſt depend.</q>

ſame Rev. gentleman, that it produced the happieſt effect on my whole congregation, and greatly aſſiſted and comforted me in my moralizing labours; and he always made it a point to bring with him to church whatever friends happened to be at his houſe!! The amiable Judge Harriſon, ſecretary to Waſhington, uſed often to ſay, that, <hi>whenever the General could be spared from camp on the Sabbath, he never ſailed riding out to some neighbouring church, to make one of those who were publicly worshipping the great Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And while he reſided in Philadelphia, as Preſident of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, his chearful and conſtant attendance on divine ſervice, was ſuch as to convince all who were deſtitute of religion and true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſte, that he deemed no pleaſures equal to thoſe of devotion, and no buſineſs a ſufficient excuſe for neglecting his ſupreme benefactor. Greateſt of ſentimentaliſts! Patron of propriety! Noble devotee of duty! No wonder that he, whom thou ſo ſignally honoredſt through life, ſhould through life, ſo ſignally have honored thee!</p>
            <p>The pillars of heaven are not more immoveable than is this great truth; which in WASHINGTON's own language, runs beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully thus—<q>
                  <hi>there exists in the oeconomy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness; between duty and advantage</hi>
               </q>—between religion and glory. For what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion but a firm belief of the great things of eternity, and a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential, affectionate intercourſe between the ſoul and its almighty Creator? Now what motives could human wit deviſe, comparable with theſe of religion, to kindle our love, to enrapture our hopes, to alarm our fears, to inflame our ambition, and, in ſhort, to touch every ſpring and paſſion of our ſouls, in favor of virtue and happineſs?</p>

            <p>Did the ambition of a civic crown animate Scipio to heroic deeds? Religion holds up a crown, at ſight of which the laurels of a Caeſar fade to weeds. Does the hope of gain call forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt induſtry and worth? Religion points to treaſures in heaven, compared with which, whole beds of diamonds, and rocks of maſſy gold are traſh. Did Titus and Aurelius ſtudy the happineſs of their ſubjects, for the ſake of this world's fame? Religion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays that world of glory, where good kings, who have made their ſubjects happy, ſhall ſhine like the ſtars for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Are ſubjects withheld from crimes ruinous to ſociety, through fear of death? Religion adds infinite horrors to that dread, it warns them of a death both of ſoul and body, in hell, in torments exquiſite and eternal.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:039062_0034_10138F2871E53180"/>
In ſhort, what motives under heaven can reſtrain men from vice and miſery, or urge them on in full ſtretch after individual and national happineſs, comparable with thoſe of Religion? Hence, thoſe great Legiſlators of nations, Moſes, Lycurgus, and Numa, deſired nothing for their dear countrymen, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Religious Principles. <hi>"I ask not gold for the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> ſaid Lycurgus, <hi>virtue is better than gold."</hi> The event ſhewed his wiſdom. The Spartans were invincible all the days of their virtue, even 500 years! "I aſk not wealth for Iſrael, cried Moſes, but, <hi>O! that they were wise, that they did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> fear God and keep his commandments! The Lord himself ſhall be their sun and shield."</hi> The event proved Moſes a true prophet. For while they were virtuous they were independent and happy. In ſhort, look throughout the world, and you will ſee this eternal truth written on the fates and fortunes of all nations, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they were virtuous or vicious, they were ſtrong or weak, united or divided, proſperous or unfortunate.</p>
            <p>Hence, WASHINGTON, in his conſultations for our good, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Human laws!—Human nonſenſe!—How often, even where the cries and ſcreams of the wretched call aloud for lightning-ſpeeded vengeance, have we not ſeen the ſword of human law loiter in its coward ſcabbard, afraid of angry royalty? Did not that vile Queen Jezebel, having a mind to compliment her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with a vineyard belonging to one of her poor ſubjects, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born a couple of villains to take a falſe oath againſt innocent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, and then cauſe him to be dragged out with his little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, crying babes, and moſt barbarouſly ſtoned to death?</p>
            <p>Great God! what bloody tragedies have been acted on the poor ones of the earth, by kings and great men who were above

The mere politician equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the pious man, ought to reſpect and to cheriſh them.</q>
            </p>

Do not we daily hear of men of honor, by dice and cards, draining their fellow citizens to the laſt guinea, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them to a dunghill, or driving them to a piſtol? Do not we daily hear of men of honor corrupting their neighours wives and daughters, and then murdering their huſbands and brothers in duels? Bind ſuch ſelfiſh, ſuch inhuman beings, by a ſenſe of honor!! Why not bind roaring Lions with a cobweb? "No." exclaims WASHINGTON, <q>Whatever a ſenſe of honor may do on men of refined education, and on minds of a peculiar ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, reaſon and experience both forbid us to expect that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional morality can prevail, in excluſion of religious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</q>

               </gap>ight of the importance of religion to national ſafety. When he was told that the Britiſh troops at Lexington, on the ever memorable 19th April, 1775, had fired on the Americans and killed ſeveral of them, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <q>I grieve for the death of my Countrymen, but rejoice that the Britiſh are ſtill ſo determined to put God on our ſide:</q> alluding to that noble ſentiment which he has ſince ſo happily <hi>expressed,</hi>

               <q>The ſmiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that diſregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itſelf has ordained.</q> And truly WASHINGTON had abundant reaſon, from his own happy experience, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend religion ſo heartily to others. For, as religion never had a more dutiful ſon than WASHINGTON, ſo WASHINGTON never had a more generous mother than religion. Setting aſide all thoſe ſecret comforts and joys with which ſhe refreſhed him in his frequent viſits to the great King; ſetting aſide all thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calculable favors which he received from her at the hands of her celeſtial daughters the virtues, that fine health which <hi>rosy-cheek'd temperance</hi> gave him—that clearneſs of head which <hi>genteel sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> furniſhed him—that firm tone which <hi>blushing chastity</hi> diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him—that horn of abundance which <hi>firm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:039062_0036_10138F2E1A434440"/>
on him—that tranquillity which <hi>prudence in business,</hi> preſerved to him—that cheerfulneſs which <hi>smiling innocence</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him—that bold undaunted heart which <hi>good conscience</hi> gave him—I ſay, ſetting aſide theſe, and the ten thouſand other choiceſt preſents which religion ſent him by the hands of her daughters the virtues; ſhe threw over him her own venerable mantle, which, like the AEgis of Minerva, makes little men great and great men little leſs than gods. It was this mantle of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which immortalized our WASHINGTON. By inſpiring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body with the profoundeſt veneration for him as the beſt of men, it naturally ſmoothed his way to the ſupreme command. For when war, that monſter of hell, came on roaring againſt us with all his deaths-heads and garments rolled in blood, we u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimouſly elected WASHINGTON our commander in chief, from a natural perſuaſion that ſo good a man muſt be the peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar favorite of heaven, and the faſteſt friend of his country. How far this precious inſtinct of nature in favor of goodneſs, was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, or how far WASHINGTON's conduct was honorable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and glorious to himſelf and country, bright ages to come, and happy nations yet unborn, will, I truſt, declare.</p>
            <p>The life of WASHINGTON adds one more to the already innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable proofs of the incalculable importance of good character to all men, but eſpecially to great men. "Very gladly, ſaid George Villars, would I give ten thouſand pounds for a good character, becauſe I could eaſily make thirty thouſand pounds by it." But WASHINGTON's good character was worth to himſelf and to his country, more thirty thouſand pounds than all the Golden Sands of Ganbia, and precious ore of Potoſi could furniſh! It obtained for him the ſupreme command of the American armies! a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which his great abilities conducted with ſuch ſkill and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that he fully eſtabliſhed the liberties of his country; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for himſelf a monument whoſe baſe covers the United States and its ſummit reaches the ſky: a monument that ſhall ſhine in the Cabinets of the Almighty, when the moon has ſhrouded for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her ſilver face, and the great ſun himſelf has ceaſed to gladden the earth with his golden beams.</p>
            <p>But before I quit this article, permit me to add, (for which I hope his brethren in arms will thank me) that WASHINGTON's piety rendered him one of the brighteſt ornaments of his profeſſion as a ſoldier. It inſpired him with that HEROIC kind of courage, ſo honorable to <hi>reason</hi> and to <hi>man,</hi> and ſo neceſſary to a General; that calm deliberate valor, which, even in the maddeſt rage of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, enabled him to look coolly on, and improve every advantage which the errors of the enemy offered. Braddock's bloody field
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:039062_0037_10138F318AC48FB0"/>
bears glorious teſtimony to this. For there in the midſt of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors unparalleled, while profane dram-drinking veterans were flying in every direction, like gun-ſhot deer, this virtuous youth, unconcerned as Mars, was riding along the line of his Virginia Riflemen, inceſſantly calling out <q>well fired, my brave fellows remember the fate of our little army depends now on your rifles,</q>
            </p>
            <p>An officer ſaid one day at head quarters, that in his opinion a field of battle called for valor not virtue. "There is no call, ſir," replied WASHINGTON, <q>prior to that of virtue, none of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable magnitude and importance. By fighting we ſerve our country; by virtue we ſerve him who made us, we ſerve man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, we ſerve ourſelves and even we ſerve our country the better in the article of valor. For how a man can fight in a bad cauſe and under a guilty conſcience, I do not know. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch circumſtances I think I ſhould be the verieſt coward alive; but give me the happineſs to live and to fight, ſo as to have God on my ſide, and I hope I ſhall never know fear.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is near a-kin to a noble ſentiment of a great captain in former ages "I fear my God, O Abner, and know no other fear."</p>
            <p>The great Guſtavus Adolphus uſed conſtantly to ſay, that "a ſoldier always fights the better for being a good man."</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON proved to a demonſtration that virtue is the ſoul of courage. No beau ever went with more compoſure to a ball than he did to a battle. Hannibal-like, he was the firſt on the field, and the laſt off. Providence, in love to America, made his body bullet-proof, and his great virtues rendered his mind fearleſs of fear</p>
            <p>His conduct in camp was correſpondent with his principles.—He was never abſent from public prayers. And as to his private devotions, we have every evidence ſave that of the eye, that they were duly diſcharged. He whoſe feelings through life, were ſo exquiſitely alive to duty and propriety, that he could not lie down under the weight of a <hi>hundred pence</hi> due to his neighbour; ſurely could never have ſlept under the enormous burden of <hi>ten thousand talents</hi> due to his God.</p>

               <p>In this firſt of all Republican virtues, the whole life of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON may juſtly challenge a compariſon with that of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Heroes, whether we conſider the majeſty of its ſtream or the

When Carthage, proud Miſtreſs of the Sea, made war, with all her wealth againſt the Roman poverty, ſhe found the reſult ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different from her expectations.

Every citizen threw aſide his own buſineſs and preſſed to take up arms in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his country; and not only refuſed to receive pay, but eagerly offered for the public good, all the gold and ſilver in his poſſeſſion. The <hi>behaviour</hi> of the women, to their immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal honor, was equally great and diſintereſted. The Romans-prevailed. Indeed it is hardly poſſible for <hi>human</hi> force to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt ſuch magnanimous patriots who <hi>feel,</hi> that, <q>
                     <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out virtue, life is pain and woe, and that without liberty, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven virtue mourns and looks around for happineſs in vain.</hi>

               <p>Such was the patriotiſm which raiſed the republics of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Greece and Rome to be the Miſtreſſes of the world. And ſuch, thro' life, was the patriotiſm of WASHINGTON. While yet a youth, the tender down hardly formed on his ruddy cheek, he hears that the French and Indians have lifted the tomahawk and are butchering the frontier inhabitants.

               <p>And in 1774, when Lord North had reſolved, Uzzah-like, to lay his unhallowed hand upon the ſacred ark of our liberties, then it was that the patriotiſm of WASHINGTON broke forth in a blaze of glory to himſelf, and of honor to human nature.</p>

yoke. Poſſeſſing a princely fortune WASHINGTON might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſlipped away from a ſtorm which, indeed, he had very little of <hi>this world's reaſon</hi> to perſuade him to encounter. For he knew very well what ſort of promotion the Scotch Lairds met with in 1745, and had abundant cauſe to expect, that, in caſe of equal ſucceſs, he ſhould be equally promoted. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he had no children for whoſe dear ſakes nature might rouſe him up to meet ſuch riſks. No daughters, meanly ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of ornaments to pleaſe the enſlavers of their country; no ſons to wear the galling chain, and tread lightly in preſence of her haughty Lordlings. Hence one of his European friends adviſed him to quit a ſcene of danger to which he had ſuch ſlender ties, and fly with him to the ſafe and pleaſant ſhores of Europe. <q>
                     <hi>What,</hi> replied WASHINGTON, <hi>ſhall I forſake my mother, becauſe ſhe is in danger?</hi>
                  </q> The other obſerved that COL. WASHINGTON had not perhaps duly appreciated the pleaſures, he was renouncing, the dangers he was incurring. <q>

                  </q> His conduct was agreeable to his principles. In the ever memorable 1775, he embraced his weeping conſort, and went forth the Leonidas of his country, reſolved to fix her liberties or find a glorious grave.

               <p>On his farm, his huſbandry of time was equally exemplary. He contemplated a great object; an object worthy of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON.

               <p>If ever man rejoiced in the divine adminiſtration, and cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavoured to imitate it, by diffuſing bleſſings around him, it was WASHINGTON. Taught by <hi>religion,</hi> that <hi>"God is love,"</hi> and that he muſt, by the laws of his own nature, delight moſt in thoſe of his rational creatures who moſt reſemble him in love, and in doing good to their brethren.—Taught by <hi>experience,</hi> that, betwixt <hi>souls,</hi> love is the only principle of <hi>union</hi> and of bliſs, which, by uniting our hearts gives us the fulleſt and ſweeteſt participation of each other's joys, and at the ſame time enables us to bear one another's infirmities and injuries, with a brotherly generoſity.—Taught by <hi>observation</hi> that love is the only coſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, or beautifier: that however youth, beauty, and wit may dazzle for a moment, it is goodneſs alone that can captivate our hearts forever: convinced, I ſay, of theſe three precious perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites of love, WASHINGTON ſeems early to have been ſmitten with her heavenly charms, and early to have ſtudied that goodneſs which made him ſo ſingularly the delight of all mankind. It was this amiable quality which compleated the character of our WASHINGTON, and by ſpreading over his great virtues and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents the ſweetly-beaming veil of goodneſs, rendered him at once the moſt endearing and venerable of human beings.</p>

that offended Payne, whereupon the <hi>little</hi> gentleman, who, though but a cub in <hi>size,</hi> was the old Lyon in heart, raiſed his ſturdy hickory, and, at a ſingle blow, brought our hero to the ground. Several of WASHINGTON'S officers being preſent, whipped out their cold Irons in an inſtant, and it was looked that there would have been murder off-hand. To make bad worſe; his regiment hearing how he had been ſerved, bolted out from their barracks, with every man his weapon in his hand, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening dreadful vengeance on thoſe who had dared to knock down their Colonel after that ſort. Happily for Mr. Payne and his party, WASHINGTON recovered time enough to go out and meet his enraged ſoldiers, and after thanking them for this expreſſion of their concern for him, aſſured them that he was not hurt in the leaſt, and begged them, as they loved him or their duty, to return peaceably to their barracks. As for himſelf, he went to his room, generouſly chaſtiſing his imprudence which had thus ſtruck out a ſpark, that had like to have thrown the whole town into a flame. Finding, on mature reflection, that he had been the aggreſſor, he reſolved to make Mr. Payne honorable repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by aſking his <hi>pardon</hi> on the morrow! No ſooner had he made this noble reſolution, than, recovering that delicious gaiety, which ever accompanies good purpoſes in a virtuous mind, he went to a ball in town that night and behaved as pleaſantly as though nothing had happened: Glorious proof that great ſouls, like great ſhips, are not affected by thoſe little puffs which would overſet feeble minds with paſſion, or ſink them with ſpleen!</p>
               <p>The next day he went to a tavern, and wrote a polite note to Mr. Payne, whom he requeſted to meet him. Mr. Payne took it for a challenge, and repaired to the tavern, not without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to ſee a pair of piſtols produced. But what was his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe on entering the chamber to ſee a decanter of wine and glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on the table! WASHINGTON aroſe, and, in a very friendly manner met him, and gave him his hand. <q>Mr. Payne, ſaid he, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Admirable youth! Noble ſpeech! No wonder ſince it charms us ſo that it had ſuch an effect on Mr. Payne, who from that moment became the moſt enthuſiaſtic admirer and friend of WASHINGTON, and ready at any time, for his ſake, to charge up to a battery of two and forty poun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

to the ball, and acting the lively agreeable friend, as if nothing had happened, he would, like an angry viper that had been trod on, have retired to his chamber. There he would have found no ſuch entertainments as WASHINGTON had at the ball; no ſprightly muſic—no delicious wines—no ſweetly-ſmiling friends: on the contrary, all the tortures of a ſoul brooding over its indignities, until reflection had whipped it up into pangs of rage unutterable, while all the demons of hell with blood-ſtained torches pointing at his bleeding honor, cried out revenge! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge! revenge! There in his chamber he would have paſſed the gloomy night, in preparing his piſtols, moulding his balls, or with furious looks, and hard-gritted teeth, driving his bullets through the body of his enemy chalked out on the wall. The next morning would have ſeen him on the field, and, in language, lately heard in this ſtate, calling out to his hated antagoniſt, <hi>you have injured me, sir, beyond reconciliation, and by G—d I will put you to death, if I can.</hi> While his antagoniſt in a ſtyle equally muſical and chriſtian, rejoins, <hi>kill and be damned!</hi> Pop go the piſtols, down tumbles one of the combatants; while the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer with knocking knees and looks of Cain flies from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of blood. The murdered man is carried to his houſe a ghaſtly, bloody corpſe. Merciful God! what a ſcene enſues! ſome are ſtupified with horror, others ſink as lifeleſs to the floor.

               <p>Thus bloody and miſerable might have been the end of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON or of Mr. Payne, had WASHINGTON been one of thoſe poor deluded young men, who are determined to be great, and to be talked of in news papers, in ſpite of God or devil. But, WASHINGTON was not born to exemplify thoſe horrid trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which <hi>cowards</hi> create in ſociety by puſillanimouſly giving way to their bad paſſions. No! he was born to teach his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, what ſweet peace and harmony might for ever ſmile in the habitations of men, if all had but the <hi>courage,</hi> like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to obey the ſacred voice of JUSTICE and of HUMANITY. By firmly obeying theſe, he preſerved his hands unſtained by the blood of a fellow man; and his ſoul unharrowed by the cruel tooth of never-dying remorſe. By firmly obeying theſe, he won thoſe ſmiles of God which convey to the ſouls of the virtuous, that joy which the ſtranger meddleth not with. By firmly obeying theſe, he preſerved a life, which crowned with deeds of Juſtice and benevolence, has brought more glory to

               <p>Sons of Columbia! would you know what is true courage? ſee it defined, ſee it exemplified in this act of your great, young countryman. Never man poſſeſſed a more undaunted courage than WASHINGTON: but in him, this noble quality was the life-guard of his reaſon, not the aſſaſſin; a ready ſervant to <hi>obey</hi> her high commands, not a bully to inſult them; a champion to defend his neighbour's rights, not a tyrant to trample them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot. Tranſported by a ſudden paſſion, to which all are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he offended Mr. Payne who reſented it much too roughly, by knocking him down on the ſpot. WASHINGTON had it in his power to have taken ample revenge; and cowards, who have no command over their paſſions, would have done it; but duty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade him, and he had the <hi>courage</hi> to obey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reaſon whiſpered the folly of harbouring black paſſions in his ſoul, poiſoning his peace; he inſtantly baniſhed them and went to a ball, to drink ſweet ſtreams of friendſhip from the eyes of happy friends. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, reaſon whiſpered him that having been the aggreſſor, he ought to aſk Mr. Payne's pardon, and make friends with him. In this alſo he had the courage to obey her ſacred voice.</p>

But yet none of them have gone beyond WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON in the affair of Payne.</p>
               <p>A few years after this, Payne had a cauſe tried in Fairfax Court, and WASHINGTON happened on that day to be in the houſe. The lawyer on the other ſide, finding he was going faſt to leeward, thought he would luff up with a whole broadſide at Payne's character; and after raking him fore and aft with abuſe, he artfully bore away under the lee of the jury's prejudices which he endeavored to inflame againſt him. "Yes, pleaſe your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, continued be, as a proof that this Mr. Payne is a moſt tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent fellow, and capable of all I tell you, be pleaſed to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Gentlemen of the Jury, that this is the very man, who ſome time ago ſerved our beloved Col.

               <p>This roared out in a thundering tone, and with a tremendous ſtamp on the floor, made Payne look very wild, for he ſaw the countenances of the court beginning to blacken on him. But WASHINGTON aroſe immediately and addreſſed the Bench—</p>

                  <q>As to Mr. Payne's character, may it pleaſe your worſhips, ſaid he, we all have the ſatisfaction to know that it is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unexceptionable; and with reſpect to the little difference which formerly happened between that gentleman and myſelf, it was inſtantly made up, and we have lived on the beſt terms ever ſince: and beſides, I could wiſh all my acquaintance to know, that I entirely acquit Mr. Payne of blame in that affair, and take it all on myſelf as the aggreſſor.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Payne uſed often to relate another anecdote of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, which reflects equal honor on the goodneſs of his heart.</p>
               <p>"Immediately after the war, ſaid he, when the conquering hero was returned in peace to his home, with the laurels of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry green and flouriſhing on his head; I felt a great deſire to ſee him, and ſo ſet out for Mount Vernon. As I drew near the houſe, I began to experience a riſing fear leſt he ſhould call to mind the blow I had given him in former days. However, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating myſelf, I puſhed on. WASHINGTON met me at the door with a ſmiling welcome, and preſently led me into an adjoining room where Mrs. WASHINGTON ſat. <q>Here, my dear, ſaid he, preſenting me to his lady, here is the little man you have ſo often heard me talk of, and who, on a difference between us one day, had the reſolution to knock me down, big as I am. I know you will honor him as he deſerves, for I aſſure you he has the heart of a true Virginian.</q>—He ſaid this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> continued Mr. Payne, with an air which convinced me that his long familiarity with war, had not robbed him of a ſingle ſpark of the goodneſs and nobleneſs of his heart. And Mrs. WASHINGTON looked at him. I thought, with a ſomething in her eyes which ſhewed that he appeared to her greater and lovelier than ever.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In conſequence of his wealth and large landed poſſeſſions, he had viſits innumerable from the poor. Knowing the great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of time and of good tempers to them, he could not bear that
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:039062_0057_10138F6E569EF078"/>
they ſhould loſe theſe by long waiting, and ſhuffling, and blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their fingers at his door. He had a room ſet apart for the reception of ſuch poor perſons as had buſineſs with him, and the porter had orders to conduct them into it, and to let him know it immediately; and ſo affectionately attentive was he to them, that, if he was in company with the greateſt characters on the continent when his ſervant informed him that a poor man wiſhed to ſpeak to him, he would inſtantly beg them to excuſe him for a moment, and go and wait on him.</p>
               <p>WASHINGTON'S conduct ſhewed that he diſliked another prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice too common among ſome great men, who, not having the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſay yes, nor the heart to ſay no, to a poor man, are fain to put him off with a <hi>"come again, come again,"</hi> and thus trot him backwards and forwards, waſting his time, wearing out his patience and his ſhoes, and after all give him the mortification of a diſappointment.</p>
               <p>WASHINGTON could not away with ſuch CRUEL KINDNESS. If he could not oblige a poor applicant he would candidly tell him ſo at once; but then the goodneſs of his heart painted his regret ſo ſenſibly on his countenance, that even his refuſals made him friends.</p>
               <p>A poor Iriſhman wanting a little farm, and hearing that WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON had ſuch an one to rent, waited on him. WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON told him that he was ſincerely ſorry that he could not aſſiſt him for he had juſt diſpoſed of it. The poor man took his leave, but not without returning him a thouſand thanks! <hi>Ah! do you thank me so heartily for a refusal?</hi> "Yes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon my ſhoul, now pleaſe your Excellency's honor, and I do thank you a thouſand times.

               <p>The Potomac abounds with the fineſt Herrings in the world, which, when ſalted, furniſh not only to the wealthy a charming reliſh for their tea and coffee, but alſo to the poor a delicious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> call it, many of them have not the means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it. WASHINGTON'S heart felt for theſe poor people and provided a remedy. He ordered a ſeine and a batteau to be kept on one of his beſt fiſhing ſhores on purpoſe for the poor. If the batteau was loſt or the ſeine ſpoilt, which was often the caſe, he would have them replaced with new ones immediately. And if the poor who came for fiſh, were at any time too weak-handed to haul the ſeine themſelves, they needed but to apply to the overſeer, who had orders from WASHINGTON, to ſend hands to help them.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:039062_0058_10138F719DE41598"/>
Thus, all the poor of his large neighbourhood had it in their power to come down in the ſeaſon, and catch an abundance of the fineſt fiſh for themſelves and their families. In what ſilver floods were ever yet caught the herrings, which could have given to WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON what he taſted, on ſeeing the poor, driving away from his ſhores with carts laden with delicious fiſh, and carrying home, whooping and ſinging, to their ſmiling wives and children, the rich prize, a whole year's joy and plenty!</p>
               <p>In all his charities, he diſcovered great judgment and care in ſelecting proper objects. Character was the <hi>main chance.</hi> Mount Vernon had no charms for lazy, drunken, worthleſs beggars. Such knew very well that they muſt carry their pigs (their vices) to another market. He never failed to remind them of the great crime of robbing the public of their ſervices, and alſo the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cruelty and injuſtice of ſnapping up from the really indigent, what little charity bread there was ſtirring. But if the character was good; if the poor petitioner was a ſober, honeſt and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon whom Providence had by ſickneſs or loſſes, reduced to want, he found a brother in WASHINGTON. It is incredible what quantities of wool, corn, bacon, flour, clothes, &amp;c. &amp;c. were annually diſtributed to the poor from that almoſt exhauſtleſs heap, which the bleſſings of heaven had heaped on this its ſo <hi>industrious</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> ſteward.</p>
               <p>"I had orders, ſaid Mr. Peake, a ſenſible, honeſt manager of one of WASHINGTON'S plantations, to fill a corn houſe every year for the ſole uſe of the poor in my neighbourhood, to whom it was a moſt ſeaſonable and precious relief; ſaving numbers of poor women and children from miſerable famine, and bleſſing them with a chearful plenteouſneſs of bread."</p>
               <p>Mr. Lund Waſhington, long a manager of his mount Vernon eſtate, had ſimilar orders. In one year when corn was ſo dear (a dollar per buſhel) that numbers of the poor were on the point of ſtarving, Mr. L. Waſhington, by order of the General, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave away all that could be ſpared from the granaries, but bought at that dear rate <hi>several hundred bushels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for them!</p>
               <p>But it were an endleſs taſk to enumerate all the thouſand, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſweet and ſeaſonable charities of this good angel of the poor. The wondering ſtranger beheld them in the ſhining eyes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring looks of ALL, wherever he went.</p>
               <p>When the young men ſaw him they flocked to the door, and the aged aroſe and ſtood up.</p>
               <p>The great men refrained from talking in his preſence, and the hearts of the LITTLE ONES leaped for joy.</p>
               <p>Becauſe he fed the poor that cried unto him, and his garment covered the naked.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:039062_0059_10138F75822E51B0"/>
He was a father of the fatherleſs, and ſtood up mightily for him that had none to help him.</p>
               <p>The bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon him, and he cauſed the heart of the widow to ſing for joy.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed be thy ſoul, O WASHINGTON, child of generous love! Thou waſt as the black ſtorm of winter to the foes of thy country; but to the children of the poor, like the ſoft cloud of ſummer that droppeth down marrow and fatneſs! Thou haſt ceaſed among men, and the tears of millions have flowed; but thou art with HIM who is MIGHTY to REWARD. For the bread which thou gaveſt to thy poor brethren, thou art now fed with pureſt manna, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the rocks of heaven, even Angels food. And for the cloth with which thou didſt cover their nakedneſs, thy covering now is from the looms of Paradiſe, even robes of floating gold. Bright ſun beam of glory, thou haſt ceaſed among men, but thy ſhining is with him who is mighty to reward!</p>
               <p>But though ſo kind to the bodies, WASHINGTON was ſtill more kind and coſtly in his charities to the minds of the poor. Senſible that a republican government, that is, a government of the people, can never long ſubſiſt where the minds of the people are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened; he earneſtly recommended it to the citizens of the United States, to promote, as an object of <hi>primary importance,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions for the general diffuſion of knowledge. In this, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in all other caſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where any thing great or good was to be done, WASHINGTON led the way.</p>
               <p>He eſtabliſhed a Charity-School in Alexandria, and endowed it with a donation of <hi>four thousand dollars!</hi> The intereſt was regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly paid and expended on the education of fifteen boys. In 1785, the Aſſembly of his native ſtate, Virginia, deſirous—"to embrace, as they ſaid, every ſuitable occaſion of teſtifying their ſenſe of the unexampled merits of GEORGE WASHINGTON, <abbr>ESQ.</abbr> towards his country, preſented him with fifty ſhares in the Potomak, and one hundred ſhares in the James River Navigation Company; making in the whole, not leſs than the enormous ſum of fifteen thouſand pounds ſterling!</p>
               <p>Of this public act, they requeſted the Governor to tranſmit WASHINGTON a copy. In anſwer to which he addreſſed a very elegant letter to the Governor, "in which I take the liberty" ſays he, <q>of returning to the General Aſſembly, through your hands, the profound and grateful acknowledgments, inſpired by ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal a mark of their beneficent intentions towards me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He goes on to beg that they would be ſo good as to excuſe his determined reſolution not to accept a farthing of it for his <hi>own use.</hi> "But," continued he, <q>if it ſhould pleaſe the General Aſſembly to permit me to turn the deſtination of the fund veſted

               </p>
               <p>They were very chearfully ſubmitted to his diſpoſal; and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to promiſe, he appropriated them to works of the greateſt public utility; <abbr>viz.</abbr> His ſhares in the James River Canal, to a College in Rock-bridge County, near the waters of James River, and his Potomak Shares to a National Univerſity to be erected in the Federal diſtrict, on the Great Potomak.</p>
               <p>How immortal were his wiſhes for the good of his country! As if incapable of being ſatisfied with all that he had done for her while living, he endeavoured be founding theſe noble inſtitutions for the diffuſion of knowledge and virtue, to make himſelf her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor when he could live no more.

               <p>Being aſked which he thought the greateſt man, Ariſtides the juſt, or, Caeſar the generous; <hi>Oh! Aristides, a thousand times!</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="unknown:039062_0061_10138F79FAAA6308"/>
replied he, with eyes ſparkling with admiration and love of that great man, <q>Had every body been as juſt as Ariſtides, there would have been no Caeſar. The one was more than a man, the other worſe than a beaſt of prey.</q> With ſuch exalted ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of juſtice, no wonder that the firm-toned WASHINGTON ſtood through life ſo immoveably by her ſacred ſtandard: So im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably, we truſt, will our Captains of men of war ſtand by the <hi>Four and twenty Pounders</hi> of their country, with duty and her ſixteen ſtripes waving over their heads.</p>
               <p>The great Turenne is deſervedly celebrated by his countrymen the French, for his delicate ſenſe of juſtice. The magiſtrates of a large diſtrict, dreading the march of his numerous army through their fields, vineyards, &amp;c. waited on him and offered a bag of <hi>one hundred thousand crowns,</hi> if he would take another route. He refuſed their money. Seeing them greatly diſtreſſed he haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to relieve them. "Gentlemen, ſaid he, I did not <hi>intend</hi> to march through your country; juſtice therefore will not allow me to pocket your money for not doing what I really did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do." Glorious Turenne! Equally Glorious WASHINGTON! For when offered by his native ſtate the enormous ſum of ſeventy thouſand Dollars! he refuſed it all, becauſe he had formerly made ſomething like a promiſe that he would never take pay for any ſervices done to his mother country.

               <p>It was partly on account of his veneration for juſtice, that he always held ſlanderers and ſlander in ſuch utter abhorrence.—"Vile practice" ſaid he, <q>Vile offſpring of injuſtice, cowardice and ſpleen.</q> For the ſame reaſon, he was, through life, the declared enemy of <hi>gambling.</hi> There are perſons, now living, who have often heard him ſay that he looked on the practice of ſitting down to play, with the wiſh to get a man's money from him, as having ſomething in it ſo <hi>mean, selfish,</hi> and <hi>dishonest,</hi> that it was to him inconceivable how a gentleman could ever reconcile it to his feelings! <q>To give an equivalent for what we receive, ſaid he, is the ground of all dealing amongſt honeſt men; but to take a ſum of money from a man, (and what is ſtill worſe from his wife and children) and give him nothing in return but heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches,

WASHINGTON would have died a thouſand deaths, rather than have allowed the ſlighteſt ground for ſuch vile dirt to be thrown on him, as Quin the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er daubed on a <hi>Nobleman</hi> with whom he had ſupped.

The reaſon is, acts of Generoſity give great pleaſure to ourſelves; they attract on us the admiration and love of others; and every ſermon we hear, every novel we read, dwells on the praiſes of charity.

From the ſame divine principle <hi>(the love of juſtice)</hi> Waſhington, though the moſt <hi>benevolent</hi> of men, was the moſt rigid of econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts. <hi>"We ſhould all,</hi> ſays he, <hi>calculate on great and continual expence.

               <p>It was a remark of Waſhington, that, he who would enjoy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed, the pleaſures of <hi>honeſty,</hi> muſt learn, ſometimes at leaſt, to ſay <hi>No,</hi> even to his deareſt friends.

               <p>Of all men, Waſhington was the moſt correct and regular in his buſineſs and dealings:—The richeſt fruits of induſtry," ſaid he, <q>may eaſily be loſt by confuſion. To finiſh one piece of buſineſs before you begin another—to put every thing in its proper place,—to give and take ſhort memorandums of your bargains, what you are to perform, and what to expect—to keep receipts and vouchers of every thing you pay—to enter carefully your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences and incomes—and to poſt<note n="*" place="bottom">He was taken ill on Friday. An intimate friend aſked him, if he wiſhed to have any thing done on the arrangement of his <hi>temporal affairs;</hi> he ſhook his head and replied, "no, I thank you, for my books are all poſted to Tueſday!" That induſtry and method muſt be truly aſtoniſhing, which, in the management of poſſeſſions ſo vaſt and complicated as his, kept every thing, ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly adjuſted, that when he was called at a ſhort notice, to leave the world, he had not a wiſh to add or alter a tittle.</note> all theſe ſo correctly, that by a ſingle glance you may tell the true ſtate of your affairs; and never ſuffer the vexation of being called on by a creditor, without being in readineſs to diſmiſs him with a <hi>light</hi> heart. Theſe are, what ſome have been pleaſed to call, ſmall matters, but they are ſuch ſmall matters as will yield you a great deal of ſafety and comfort, ſave you much time and trouble in the courſe of life, ſnatch you from many a diſpute and law-ſuit, and preſerve perhaps your purſe from a ſecond payment of the ſame money, and your character, from ill-natured ſuſpicion. It is a ſad thing to ſee a young man, ſuddenly called on for a valuable paper, at his wits end to know where he has laid it, turning the houſe upſide down, and, after all, unable to find it, obliged to ſit down in a high fever of rage and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</q>

like Waſhington, to do his buſineſs with regularity and exactneſs, with writings and receipts; though the neglect of theſe gives riſe to more than half the quarrels, law, ſuits, and duels, that diſtract the world! Waſhington paſſed through life without any of theſe curſes; for in all his dealings, every thing was ſo clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſo fairly expreſſed, that there was no room for heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. His exactneſs in buſineſs extended to all, not excepting even thoſe whom he moſt dearly loved. He ſaid, <q>It was one of the beſt means to preſerve love. Some think exactneſs unneceſſary between relations and friends. But alas! love is apt to wax cold, and then ſelfiſhneſs returns.

                  <hi>Such are the ſorrows of the debtor, while he continues honeſt. But alaſs! ſuch trials are found too heavy for moſt men. By degrees they undermine the moral principle, and reconcile a man to practices which he once abhorred. His firſt failure of payment, or breach of promiſe is painful to him; when he conſiders at how low a rate his word muſt hereafter paſs, he ſinks in his own eyes; but by degrees his difficulties bring him to ſtudy deceiving as an art, and at laſt he lies to his creditors without a bluſh!!

"This," ſaid he, by his prophet Samuel, "will be the character, (meaning the <hi>general</hi> character) of the king that ſhall reign over you: he will take your ſons and appoint them for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his chariots, and to be his horſemen, and ſome ſhall run before his chariots. And he will appoint them captains over thouſands, and captains over fifties; and will ſet them to ear his ground, and to reap his harveſt, and to make his inſtruments of war, and inſtruments of his chariots. And he will take your daughters to make his paſtry, and to be cooks and bakers, And he will take your fields, and your vine-yards, and your olive-yards; even the beſt of them and give them to his ſervants and his officers. And he will take your men ſervants and your maid ſervants; and your goodlieſt young men, and your aſſes and put them all to his work: and ye ſhall be his ſervants. And ye ſhall cry out in that day becauſe of your king which ye ſhall have choſen unto you; and the Lord will not hear you in that day."</p>

Merius firſt opened the horrid ſcene and glutted, his followers with the blood and wealth of the friends of Sylla; Sylla repaid the Marian faction in the ſame coin, and with intereſt. In theſe unnatural conteſts thouſands of Roman citizens were but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chered; their wives and children barbarouſly turned out of doors, and their eſtates confiſcated and ſold to cram the purſes and to fatten the vices of their diabolical deſtroyers. Bloody battles were often fought in the very ſtreets: and wretched Rome more than once experienced from her own citizens all the horrors of a city taken by ſtorm.</p>
               <p>And in the hiſtories of the civil wars of Great-Britain, and, here lately of France, we may behold the ſame horrid features of faction. Here are the two parties, Whigs and Tories, or Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocrats and Democrats. A little time ago, while they had a government, though a very imperfect one, they loved each other as children of the ſame country and conſtitution, and would in a moment have fought for one another with all the heroiſm of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous brothers: But now, ſplit into parties and driving at different intereſts, they regard each other as <hi>enemies.</hi> Jealouſy and hatred, true miſcroſcopes of hell, are before their eyes and conceal from <hi>each</hi> all the good <hi>qualities</hi> and <hi>intentions</hi> of the <hi>other;</hi> and at the ſame time, ſo <hi>diſtort, magnify</hi> and <hi>blacken</hi> all their deſigns and actions, that they appear to each other as little better than Devils. Their News-Papers too, as if warm and ſmoaking from the preſſes of the damned, lend all their fire and brimſtone to feed the infernal flame. <hi>"The Ariſtocrats!</hi> (cries the paſſion-choaked Printer on the other ſide). <hi>The Aris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocrats! A ſet of unfeeling Kingly Villains! Monſters of Pride, who would as lieve drive their guilt Chariots over a poor Man, as over a dog: and would devour widows houſes for a ſtake at an E. O. Table! Vile miſcreants, who only want a Kingly Government that they may fleece and lord it over the poor!"</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other hand, the Ariſtocrat Gazettes give chapter and verſe for it, that <hi>"The Democrats are a lazy vicious race, whoſe poverty and lice make them envy and hate the rich; and who will never be at reſt, until, having trampled down Religion, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Laws, and Government, they are at full liberty, like wild Arabs, to rob and plunder their wealthier neighbours."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Grounded now on ſomething like love of public good, the bad paſſions of the two parties rage with redoubled fury.

faces and glaring eyes. The horrid tragedy ripens faſt, and the dreadful ſtorm is on the very eve of burſting. Numerous Ravens, with ill brooding croaks and terrifying ſcreams, are ſeen flapping their wings flow and ſad, over the fated city. All night long fearful noiſes are head in the air, as of groans from dying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; while frightful meteors, in ſhape of fiery balls, ſhoot through the gloom leaving long hideous tracks behind them like ſtreams of blood. In the morning, the awful roar of guns is heard in the midſt of the city. Trembling ſeizes on the aged, while the feeble ſex ſicken with terrors unfelt before. The men ſnatch up arms, and ruſh, in tumultuous crowds, to the place whence the noiſe proceeds. Immenſe is the concourſe. The orators on both ſides get up to addreſs the eager throngs, and with bittereſt abuſe inflame their paſſions againſt each other to madneſs. The fierce uproaring crowds can withhold no longer. With horrid impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with faces black with rage, and eye balls flaſhing fire, they fly at each other like tygers. They plunge their knives, ſwords and daggers into each others hearts. Pale and ſtaggering, with mutual curſes in death, they ſink to the ground. The ſtreets are floated with blood. The dead bodies lie heaps on heaps, while women and children, with wringing hands, and heart-piercing cries, demand their huſbands, their fathers, and their brothers.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>O accurſed Faction and Party!</hi> Theſe are your bloody fruits!

               <p>In the foregoing pages we have ſeen a ſketch of the life of Waſhington; of <hi>him,</hi> who was the pride of America, and boaſt of humankind; who united in himſelf ſuch a Conſtellation of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues as <hi>ſweetly</hi> aſſure us of <hi>Immortality,</hi>—of our relation to ANGELS—and of our capacities for glories and felicities, that ſhall know no bounds.</p>
               <p>It is hardly exaggeration to ſay that WASHINGTON was pious as Numa; juſt as Ariſtides; temperate as Epictetus; patriotic as Regulus; in giving public truſts, impartial as Severus; in vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, modeſt as Scipio; prudent as Fabius; rapid as Marcellus; undaunted as Hannibal; as Cincinnatus diſintereſted; to liberty firm as Cato; and reſpectful of the laws as Socrates. Or, to ſpeak in plainer terms; he was religious without ſuperſtition; juſt without rigour; charitable without profuſion; hoſpitable without making others pay for it; generous but with his own money; rich without covetouſneſs; frugal without meanneſs; humane without weakneſs; brave without raſhneſs; ſucceſsful without vanity; victorious without pride; a lover of his country, but no hater of French or Engliſh; a ſtaunch friend of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but reſpectful of thoſe who pointed out its defects with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; true to his word without evaſion of perfidy; firm in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; moderate in proſperity; glorious and honoured in life; peaceful and happy in death.</p>
               <p>Thus ſingularly virtuous was the man, whom Heaven was pleaſed to ſelect as his honored inſtrument to eſtabliſh this great WESTERN REPUBLIC. And if every thing be duly conſidered, I truſt it will appear WASHINGTON was raiſed up of God as a forerunner to ſome mighty event.

When nation ſhall no more lift up the ſword againſt nation, nor torrents of human blood flow down from ſhameful variance betwixt man and man.—When the creature traveling in pain, ſhall no more lift the piteous eye, with groans unutterable, to God—But, when the uninjuring, the unſuffering kingdom of Chriſt being come, men ſhall no longer hurt nor deſtroy in the earth, but the Leopard and the Kid ſhall lie down together; and the young Lion and the Calf; and a little Child ſhall lead them—When glad ſongs of peace ſhall warble through every land, and the fruits of love ſhall overſpread the earth as waters cover the ſea.</p>

And it is in our power to invite it—Yes, if our country were filled with ſuch men as Waſhington, that glorious day would this moment ſhine upon us. For whence are the ſweet beams of peace and happineſs but from the ſun of Virtue? And if the ſun of virtue did but gild our plains, how ſoon would our deſert rejoice and bloſſom like the roſe? How ſoon would Earth reſemble Heaven? Temperance would pour her ruddy bleſſings around our land. Induſtry would fill our barns with plenty, and cauſe our preſſes to burſt out with new wine. Righteous dealing would make us to be reſpected and beloved of one another, while mutual affection would render our ſociety ſweet and harmonious as that of deareſt friends and brothers, Foreign nations, hearing that the vine of Paradiſe was planted in our land, would haſten to feed on its delicious cluſters. God even our own God would give us his bleſſings, the little hills would clap their hands with joy, and conſenting clouds ſhower down their marrow and fatneſs upon us. Since then it is "righteouſneſs that exalteth a nation; ſince the eternal decree is paſſed, that the glory of nations ſhall forever riſe and fall with their virtues, let us then if we do indeed love our country, and would have her and her children to be free and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, for all generations; let us now, while it is called to-day, vow a vow to God, that we will endeavour through life to become what Waſhington was, in his virtues. O! let us conſider that crown of glory which he now wears, the bright reward of his virtues; and that the ſame crown is prepared, the ſame virtues expected of us—Let us conſider that theſe form the great errand on which we were ſent into this world—That Heaven and earth are waiting on us for this purpoſe—That the eyes of God and angels are fixed on us with eager expectation—And that the venerable ſhades, of Waſhington, and our fathers, are anxiouſly looking on us for theſe virtues, to make happy this great Republic which their toil, and ſweat, and blood ſo dearly bought. Since then, we are <hi>moral</hi> ſoldiers, fighting for an immortal prize, for ourſelves and for our children; "Let us be of good courage, and play the men for our people and for the cities of our God, and let the Lord do for our country that which ſeemeth him good."</p>

WASHINGTON had wiſely ſpent his life in acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe immortal virtues. "<hi>He had fought the good fight</hi>—againſt his own unreaſonable affections—<hi>he had glorified God;</hi> by exemplifying the charms of virtue, to men—<hi>he had finiſhed the great work which God had given him</hi> to do; for himſelf and for his country. <hi>He had borne the heat and burden of the day</hi>—his <hi>great</hi> day of duty; And the evening (of old age) being come, the ſervant of God muſt now go to receive his wages. Happy, happy WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON! If Crowns and Kingdoms could purchaſe ſuch ſweet peace like thine, ſuch ſmiling joy, ſuch hopes big with immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; with what begging earneſtneſs, would Crowns and Kingdoms have been offered by the mighty conquerors of the earth, in their dying moments of <hi>terror</hi> and deſpair!</p>
               <p>On the 14th day of December, 1799. (when he wanted but 9 weeks, and 2 days of bing 63 years old) he rode out on his planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The day was very raw and ſnowy. The ſame night he was attacked with a violent pain and inflamation of the throat. The lancet of one of his Domeſtics was employed, but with
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:039062_0079_10138FAF18077958"/>
no advantage. By times in the morning, Dr. Craik, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in peace and war, the friend and phyſician of his youth and age, was ſent for. Alarmed at the leaſt appearance of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger threatening a life ſo dear to him, Dr. Craik adviſed to call in, immediately, the conſulting aſſiſtance of his friends, the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and learned Dr. Dick of Alexandria, and Brown of Port-Tobacco. They came on the wings of ſpeed. They felt the awfulneſs of their ſituation. They knew that never again ſhould they be called to fight the king of terrors in defence of ſuch a prize.—They ſaw the MOURNFUL GENIUS of AMERICA, with the red eyes of her grief bathed in tears, fixed on her ſon; ſometimes caſt on them anxiouſly aſking their aſſiſtance. The greateſt of all human beings was now lying low; a life of all others the moſt revered, the moſt beloved was at ſtake. Craik, Dick and Brown, the ableſt GUARDS of life, were ſtationed around him bending o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the proſtrate hero. If human ſkill and ſolicitude could have availed; if the ſword of genius and the buckler of experience could have repelled the blows of death, WASHINGTON had ſtill lived. Defeated a thouſand times by their ſuperior ſkill, when lives leſs valuable were contended for, Death began to fear left this great prize ſo long coveted ſhould be ſnatched from him.—But he ſoon felt his arm invigorated by a ſtrength <hi>not his own.</hi>—The great hour was <hi>come</hi> and WASHINGTON muſt die. Yes his Manſion is prepared above. The crown of his rejoicing is bright. The harps of the bleſſed are ſtrung. "Let the angel of Death conduct the Soul of WASHINGTON to the feaſts of Heaven."</p>
               <p>It appears, that, from the commencement of the attack, he was favoured with a preſentiment, that, he was now laid down to riſe no more. He took however the medicines that were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him, but it was principally to oblige the long-loved partner of his heart and bed.</p>
               <p>It has been ſaid that a man's death is a true copy of his life. This is generally the caſe with thoſe who die in their ſenſes. It was WASHINGTON'S caſe exactly. In his laſt illneſs he behaved with the undaunted firmneſs of a ſoldier, and the calm reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a chriſtian.</p>
               <p>The inflammation in his throat was attended with great pain, which he bore with the fortitude that became him. He was once or twice heard to ſay that had it pleaſed God he ſhould have been glad to die a little eaſier; but that he doubted not that it was for his good.</p>
               <p>Every hour now ſpread a fader gloom over the ſcene. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair ſat on the faces of the phyſicians; for they ſaw that their art had failed. The ſtrength of the mighty was departing from him; and Death, with his ſad harbingers, chills, and paleneſs, was coming on apace.</p>

Mount Vernon, which had long ſhone above all families, the Queen of elegant joys, was now about to ſuffer a ſad Eclipſe! an Eclipſe which would ſoon be mournfully viſible, not only through the United States but throughout the world.</p>
               <p>An awful ſilence prevails throughout the ſpacious Dwelling.—The big grief has ſealed every lip and darkened every countenance. His ſervants are now about to loſe their long loved maſter and protector; and his friends to bid a laſt adieu to the endearing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of the greateſt and beſt of human kind. Their faces are ſwollen with weeping, and torrents of bitter tears roll down their cheeks. But though bitter, yet ſhallow are their ſtreams of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when compared with that flood of unutterable woe, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelms the ſoul of his life's dear companion. Bleſſ'd with a ſoul, capable of loving an angle ſpirit inhabiting the nobleſt form, ſhe had given her heart and hand to her WASHINGTON in early life. Forty happy years had they lived together like two <hi>lovers</hi> joined in wedlock. Every year, ſweet as it rolled along, marked their ever growing loves—Loves, which, fed by mutual tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and virtue, were continually aſcending with a brighter flame, nearer and nearer to their native ſkies—Loves, which by a forty years inter-growth, were become ſo incorporated, as to render each <hi>a part of the others ſelf.</hi> O! how heart breaking!—How ſoul rending the ſeparation! But the hour of ſeparation is come! She can keep her WASHINGTON no longer! He, whoſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was the perpetual feaſt of her ſoul, muſt now be taken from her! That voice which was ſweeter to her ear than the muſic of ſongs, ſhall charm her ear no more. She ſhall ſpeak to him but he will not anſwer. The echo of her voice will frighten her own ſoul. That face which was welcomer to her eyes than the ſtreaks of the morning, ſhall rejoice her eyes no more. She ſhall awake in the morning; but ſhall not ſee him—She ſhall ſeek him early; but ſhall not find him. The place where her beloved lay, will be empty. The heavineſs of her heart returns; her tears of grief roll down.</p>
               <p>Great, honoured Lady! what but the arm of the mighty God of Waſhington, could have ſupported thee in that diſmal hour of darkneſs and diſtreſs! And he did ſupport thee. The conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of religion were thine; and her conſolations are mighty. Oft had thy WASHINGTON reminded thee, when the tear ſwelled in thine eye, and the ſigh of thy boſom aroſe at the thought of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; oft had he reminded thee of thoſe bliſsful ſhores, where the ſouls of the virtuous, eſcaped from the ſorrows of mortality, ſhall <hi>ſoon meet again,</hi> infinitely improved; and there in the preſence of <hi>HIM WHO MADE THEM,</hi> ſhall pluck and eat together, in communion ſweet, the rich <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Sons and Daughters of Columbia! gather yourſelves together, around the bed of your fallen hero; around the bed of him to whom (under God) you and your children are indebted for the richeſt bleſſings of life. When Joſeph, the great prime miniſter of Egypt, heard that his <hi>Shepherd</hi>-Father was ſick, he haſtened up to ſee him, and fell on his neck, and kiſſed him and wept. Joſeph had never received ſuch ſervices from Jacob, as you have received from WASHINGTON. But we call you not to weep for WASHINGTON. We aſk you not to view thoſe eyes, now ſunk and hollow, which formerly darted their lightening-flaſhes againſt your enemies; nor to feel that heart, now faintly-labouring, which formerly throbbed with more than mortal joys, when he ſaw the young heroes of Columbia, ruſhing on in rattling ſteel to charge the foe; nor to mark that arm now feeble, which ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten waved the fiery-circled ſword of war, pointing where the roar of battle ſhould begin. No, we call you not to <hi>weep</hi> but to <hi>revere.</hi>

               <p>The Great <hi>Star,</hi> lighted up of God, to lead America to freedom, is now ſetting, but he ſets in glory.

               <p>Feeling that the hour of his departure out of this world was at hand; he deſired that every body ſhould quit the room. They all went out; and according to his wiſh, left him—with his God.</p>
               <p>There, by himſelf, like Moſes alone on the top of Piſgah, he ſeeks the face of God.

Theſe, and ten thouſand other precious gifts heaped on him, unaſked, many of them long before he had the knowledge to aſk for them; overwhelmed his ſoul with gratitude unutterable, exalted to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite heights, his ideas of eternal love, and bade him without fear, to reſign his departing ſpirit into the arms of his redeemer God, whoſe mercies are over all his works.</p>
               <p>He is now about to leave the great family of man, in which he has ſo long ſojourned as a brother! His cheeks are bathed with tears, the yearnings of his ſoul are over his brethren! How fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently does he adore that <hi>goodneſs,</hi> which enabled him to be ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to them!

How fervently does he pray that the <hi>uninjuring, unſuffering kingdom of God may come,</hi> and that the Earth may be filled with the richeſt fruits of righteouſneſs and of peace.</p>
               <p>He is now about to leave <hi>his country!</hi> that dear ſpot which gave him birth—that dear ſpot for which he has ſo long watched and prayed, ſo long toiled and ſought; and whoſe beloved children he has ſo often ſought to gather, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings. He ſees them now ſpread abroad like flocks in goodly paſtures; like favored Iſrael in the land of promiſe. He remembers how God, by a mighty hand, and by an out-ſtretched arm, brought them and their fathers into this good land, a land flowing with Milk and Honey; and bleſſed them with the bleſſings of Heaven above, and of the Earth beneath; with the bleſſings of LIBERTY and of PEACE, of RELIGION and of LAWS, above all other people—He ſees, that, through the rich mercies of God, they have now the precious opportunity to make their Country, the GLORY of the Earth, the <hi>bleſſed</hi> among nations, and a refuge for the poor and for the outcaſts of all lands! The tranſporting ſight of ſuch a cloud of bleſſings, trembling cloſe over the heads of his Countrymen, together with the diſtreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncertainty whether they will put forth their hands and enjoy them, ſhakes the parent ſoul of WASHINGTON with feelings too ſtrong for his dying frame. The laſt tear that he is ever to ſhed, now ſteals into his eye, while a deep groan iſſues from his burſting heart.</p>
               <p>Feeling now, that, the ſilver cord of life is looſing, and that his ſpirit is ready to quit her old companion the body, he extends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on his bed, cloſes his eyes, for the <hi>laſt</hi> time, with his own hands, folds his arms decently on his breaſt, then breathing out with his laſt parting breath. <hi>"Faller of Mercies!

               <p>Loud were the burſts of grief, and many the tears that were ſhed, when the fall of Waſhington was known; but in the ear of wiſdom a voice was heard from his awful ſhade—"Children of Columbia, <hi>"weep not for me!"</hi> My ſtreaming eyes are cloſed in death; my throbbing heart ſhall beat no more.
