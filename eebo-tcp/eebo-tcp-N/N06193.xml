            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AT the requeſt of the worthy author of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing eſſays, I have peruſed them; and obſerve nothing in them, but what is agreable to the ſacred ſcripture, to the form of ſound words, to the analogy of faith, and the doctrine of the goſpel; and cannot but be of opinion, that they may be uſeful to illuſtrate and confirm the doctrines of grace, to reſolve the doubts and remove the difficulties which may attend many with reſpect to ſome things herein handled; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrote with clearneſs of thought, ſoundneſs of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſtrength of argument: And as ſuch I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily recommend them to the peruſal of every enquirer after truth; and that they may be of uſe to inſtruct the ignorant, to eaſe the minds of doubting Chriſtians, to ſtrengthen the weak and eſtabliſh the wavering in the truth of the goſpel, is the hearty deſire of him, that wiſhes well to the ſouls of men, and to the intereſt of the Redeemer.</p>

                     </gap> knoweth right well,</hi> Pſal. cxxxix. 14.</p>
               <p>Query,—<hi>If God be the creator and maker of man, and man is born into the world a corrupt creature, both filthy and guilty in his ſight, is not he the author of this corruption and depravity? Are not all men, when born into the world, as God made them?</hi> Anſwer: I believe God is the creator of man, both body and ſoul; every perſon that comes into the world receives his breath and being from him: I alſo believe that every ſon and daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> is born into the world a corrupt, depraved creature, and guilty in the ſight of God, being <hi>ſhapen in iniquity, and conceived in ſin. And by the offence of one, Judgment came upon all men to condemnation,</hi> Pſal. li. 5. Rom. v. 18. But God is not the author of that corruption; nor is he unjuſt in paſſing the ſentence of <hi>condemnation upon all mankind,</hi> for that firſt ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi> In ſome reſpects it may be ſaid, God is the remote cauſe of every thing; <hi>for in him all live, move, and have their being,</hi> Acts xvii. 28. No perſon can move, or act, but as he is ſupported and uphold by God, who gives him ſtrength to move and act.</p>
               <p>But, the doing an action wrong, is not from God, but the creature, and proceeds from the corruption of human nature. We muſt diſtinguiſh between an action, and the evil of the action; for the ſame action may be good or bad; good, if done according to the rule, and as God hath commanded; bad, or evil, if done contrary to it.</p>
               <p>For inſtance, ſpeech, or ſpeaking, is an action which may be good or bad; to ſpeak the truth, is a good action; but to ſpeak a falſhood, or tell a lie, is an evil
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007860_0006_102DE93CAE0DBFC8"/>
one: therefore, though the act may, in ſome reſpect, be aſcribed to God, yet the evil of the action cannot.</p>
               <p>The ſun, when it ſhines upon a dunghill, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale, or draw from thence, a diſagreable ſmell; now, though the ſun be the remote cauſe of the dunghill's ſending forth ſuch a nauſeous ſteam, yet it is not the immediate cauſe of it; none can juſtly blame the ſun, but the dunghill, which is the chief and immediate cauſe, being made up of ſuch matter as contains in itſelf that diſagreable ſmell; the ſun only diſcovers what is in the dunghill, it puts nothing into it.</p>
               <p>But, to anſwer more directly; man's body and ſoul, as to the eſſence of both, are from God, and we ought to bleſs him for all our natural powers and faculties, of body and mind; but ſhould take care we do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt human nature ſo as to make a Saviour unneceſſary. We muſt obſerve, that the corruption of human nature is no part of it; 'tis what cleaves faſt to it, but is no part of it; 'tis conveyed by generation, but doth not conſtitute our being, nor any part of it; it is no part either of the ſoul, or of the body: Man, before he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fell, had the ſame members of body, and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſoul, that he hath now. Therefore, God may be and is, the creator of man, both body and ſoul, and yet not the author of that corruption which cleaves to him, but is no part of him. But, ſuppoſe there be a myſtery in it, ſhall we, therefore, deny it? and, becauſe we cannot fully comprehend it, ſhall we not believe it? Should we take this liberty in ſome other matters, we muſt caſt away ſome of the fundamental doctrines of Chriſtianity; and, in things natural, muſt reject ſome that we know to be true, ſuch as we cannot fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the manner of. For inſtance, is there not a myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in the union of the ſoul and body? One might
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007860_0007_102DE93F714B1078"/>
aſk, how are the ſoul and body united? By what ſecret ties and bands are they knit together? When the time, and what the mode of this union, who can conceive or fully explain? And yet who dares deny that ſo it is?</p>
               <p>And is it not equally as evident, that the nature of man is corrupted? or how ſhall we account for thoſe irregular paſſions in little children? whence thoſe early buddings of ſin, thoſe youthful follies? And are not pain, ſickneſs, and death, the lot of many in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, before they have committed actual ſin? Would theſe things be thus, if the nature of man was pure when born into the world? and is it not ſpeaking phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophically, when we ſay, <hi>like begets like?</hi> and is it not alſo ſpeaking ſcripturally, when we aſk, <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> not one, <hi>Job</hi> xiv. 4.</p>
               <p>As God made man, ſo he made him an upright and perfect creature; God never made any thing otherwiſe than pure and perfect. In the account <hi>Moſes</hi> gives us of the creation in general, he tells us, that <hi>God ſaw it was good,</hi> Gen. i. 10, 12. But when God had finiſhed his works, and took a view of them, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>All very good,</hi> Gen. i. 31. Never any thing came out of God's hand with the leaſt ſtain or blemiſh upon it: <hi>He is a rock, his work is perfect,</hi> Deut. xxxii. 4. God is the author of all rectitude and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is or ever was in angels or men; all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments <hi>Adam</hi> had in his innocency, was the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of heaven; the purity and rectitude wherewith he was adorned, was a tranſcript of the divine image. God is the ſource and fountain of all holineſs; and if any of the fallen and ſinful race of <hi>Adam,</hi> have on them the glorious and bleſſed image of God, it is the Lords work and free donation, <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 24. <hi>Col.</hi> iii.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007860_0008_102DE941F9851518"/>
10. Holineſs is in God eſſentially, but in the creature it is derived; and a rational being may exiſt without it, as the apoſtate angels do, and fallen man till he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored: it is what God puts into the creature, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to his glorious ſelf; and, it may be truly affirmed, that God cannot make a reaſonable being, without making it in his own image. It is no ways marvellous that God, when he makes a rational being, ſhould make it in his own image; but, it is very ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous, that when the creature man had loſt the image of God, he ſhould put it on him again. God was at liberty to make man or not, but not at liberty to make him holy or unholy; this were to ſuppoſe God capable of erring, and ſo doing what he hates in others, which were blaſphemy once to think: but when man had loſt the image of God, he was at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty whether he would imprint it on him again; and the imprinting it on any, is an act of his mere ſovereign grace and unmerited love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God made man upright. And God ſaid, let us make man in our own image, after our likeneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Gen. i. 26. It doth not ſeem conſiſtent with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, that he ſhould make any order or rank of beings, without imprinting on them his image, a reſemblance of his moral perfections; endowing them with ſuch powers and abilities, which, if rightly improved, are ſufficient to ſuch a creature's ſtanding. And it muſt be maintained, that <hi>Adam</hi> had ſufficient powers and abilities to ſtand; it was not for want of power that he fell, but for want of exerciſing the power he had aright; the ſame my be affirmed of the fallen angels.</p>
               <p>To ſuppose a creature puniſhed for apoſtatizing from its maker, it is neceſſary to ſuppoſe alſo, that

that creature had power to ſtand in the ſtate in which it was made; or otherwiſe the puniſhment would not be juſt; for to puniſh the creature for a fault it could not avoid, is acting againſt all reaſon and juſtice. But if the creature's apoſtatizing from the Creator, be the effect of an abuſe of the power which the creature had; this being the fault of the creature, may very juſtly be puniſhed.</p>
               <p>Query,—<hi>If it be ſo, that it is unjuſt to puniſh a creature for a fault, or faults, it cannot avoid; how then can God in juſtice puniſh mankind for their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his law, if man in this preſent fallen ſtate has loſt the power to obey or keep the law, and it does not pleaſe God to reſtore this power, to man again?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſwer: That man has loſt the power he once had to keep the law of God, and is now become weak, yea quite void of ſpiritual ſtrength, is an undeniable truth, if the ſcriptures are to be taken as a rule of our faith; for thus it is written, <hi>For when we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly. And the carnal mind is enmity againſt God; for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither, indeed, can be. So then they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Rom. v. 6. and viii. 7, 8. And that God will puniſh the finally diſobedient, is as true as the former: <hi>For as many as have ſinned in the law, ſhall be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the law.</hi> God will certainly revenge all diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,—<hi>And the wrath of God will come on the children of diſobedience.</hi> Rom. ii. 10. 2 Cor. x. 6. Col. iii. 6, And that God is juſt in puniſhing the finally diſobedient, is alſo true; for, <hi>Shall not the judge of the whole earth do right?</hi> Yea, <hi>He ſhall judge the world with (or in) righteouſneſs, and the people with his truth. Is God unrighteous who taketh
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007860_0010_102DE946299917F8"/>
vengeance?—God forbid, for then how ſhould God judge the world?</hi> Gen. xviii. 25. Pſal. xcvi. 13. Acts xvii. 31. Rom. iii. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>But then we muſt obſerve, that the puniſhment which will be inflicted on the finally diſobedient on the judgment day, will not be for unavoidable faults; they will not be condemned for not doing what they could not do; but for not doing the good they might have done, and for wilful ſins committed. Thoſe we have an account of in St. <hi>Matt.</hi> xxv. 41, to 46. that were ſent away <hi>into everlaſting puniſhment,</hi> it was for not doing the good they might have done; for they could have viſited the ſick and relieved them, but they would not. For though the moral liberty of the will be loſt, the natural liberty remains; perſons have power to read the word of God, to ſpeak the truth, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend divine worſhip, give alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And where the goſpel is preached, man has power, and ability to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or give his aſſent to it; and unbelief is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning ſin. <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the only begotton Son of God. And this is the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil,</hi> Joh. iii. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>But then, perſons will not be condemned for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt in a right goſpel-manner, or for being deſtitute of true faith, <hi>the faith of God's elect;</hi> but for not believing in ſuch a way and manner, and ſo far as they might, according to the revelation made unto them; their faith will be found to come ſhort, far ſhort of what it might have attained unto; had they been dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in reading and ſearching the word of God, and not have pinn'd that ſmall degree of hiſtorical faith which
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007860_0011_102DE9483B3BB240"/>
they had, on other men's ſleeeves; and ſo indulging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in idleneſs, giving more credit to men than to the Lord, and what he hath told them in his holy word. Man hath power to reform from open vice, to be moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſober and juſt, and to do many things morally good, which he doth not; and, upon this footing, conſcience itſelf will condemn, and very juſtly too. But as to true evangelical faith in the Son of God, called <hi>precious faith,</hi> and <hi>the faith of God's elect,</hi> 2 Pet. i. 1. Tit. i. 2. being given to them, and not to others; this is what none have by nature, nor can it be acquired, (though <hi>it comes by hearing</hi>) neither can any man have this faith except God give it unto him, <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 8. <hi>Phil.</hi> i. 29. Neither will any perſon be condemned for the want of ſuch a faith; 'tis unreaſonable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt to think, or affirm this: there will be enough as matter of condemnation without this, as the wilful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of known duties, and wilful commiſſion of known ſins, oppoſition to Chriſt and his goſpel; for he that knowneth his Lord's will, and doth it not, will be very juſtly puniſhed; for <hi>when the Lord ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire;</hi> (it will be) <hi>to take vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (ſo far as they might have obeyed it) <hi>ſuch ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power,</hi> 2 Theſ. i. 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, Though it would be unjuſt to puniſh a creature fallen from a ſtate of innocency, if the creature had not been endowed with ſufficient power to have ſtood in that ſtate of innocency, and to have kept the law it was placed under; yet, we may very well juſtify the equity of God's proceeding againſt
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007860_0012_102DE94AD38E39C0"/>
fallen man, in puniſhing him for his diſobedience to the law, though he has not power to keep it perfectly in his fallen ſtate. For, as perfect obedience is God's right and due from the creature, ſo it muſt be the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's duty to give it; for though man has loſt the power to obey, and is become unable to give God his juſt due, God has not loſt his right and authority over the creature, to command and require it.</p>
               <p>The fallen angels have loſt the power which once they had to love and obey God; yet, no perſon, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, will affirm, that God has not authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them, or that it is not their duty to love and ſerve him. If the power of the creature (man) was the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the creature's obedience, and God required no more of man than he in his fallen ſtate can, or is able to give, then the creature's works would not be great, and God's demands muſt be but ſmall.</p>
               <p>We ſhould conſider, that all mankind were included in <hi>Adam</hi> as their public head and repreſentative, and fell in him, and his loſs was their loſs. But, perhaps, ſome may ſay, what is it to me what <hi>Adam</hi> did? I never knew him, nor gave my conſent to what he did; therefore, what concern have I with <hi>Adam?</hi> To which I anſwer; every one that knows himſelf, has ſome knowledge of his father <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſenſibly (to his grief and ſorrow) feels what concern he had in his firſt tranſgreſſion, and conſequently in his tranſactions in the garden, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his ſinning.</p>
               <p>I might aſk theſe perſons in like manner, what it is to you what Chriſt did, the ſecond <hi>Adam?</hi> you never knew him, nor gave your conſent to what he did; therefore, what concern have you with him? For, if it be a juſt and concluſive way of arguing, to exclude ourſelves from having any concern in what <hi>Adam</hi> did, becauſe
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007860_0013_102DE94D1553A010"/>
we never knew him in perſon, or gave our explicit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to what he did; why ſhould not the argument be as juſt and concluſive when applied to Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> whom we never knew perſonally, nor gave our conſent to what he did? And it is a queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe who deny the headſhip of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> believe, or care much about, the headſhip of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
               <p>Denying the headſhip of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> is the way (in my humble opinion) to bring us into greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in accounting for, and clearing the juſtice of God in his proceedings towards mankind, than owning it. For, do not all mankind ſuffer upon the account of the firſt ſin, ſickneſs pain and death? Now, I aſk, where doth the juſtice of God appear, in inflicting theſe things on mankind, if they are innocent? theſe things come upon many, before they have committed actual ſin; for how much do infants, many times undergo, and ſuffer? and where is the juſtice of all this, if they are innocent? it cannot be for their own actual ſins, for they have none; if it is not for the ſin of another, then it is for no ſin at all; and whether it is unjuſt or not to puniſh an innocent creature, let any man judge. What a contradiction is it, and how ſhocking doth it appear, to ſee thouſands of poor creatures brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, under thoſe deplorable circumſtances, with the marks of God's anger upon them, and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent? ſtrange! <hi>Far be it from the righteous God, that loveth righteouſneſs, to puniſh the innocent as he doth the guilty!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, I aſk, is not the curſe which was inflicted on our firſt parents for their firſt ſin, what their poſterity ſhare in alſo? <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>And unto the woman he ſaid, I will greatly multiply thy ſorrow,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007860_0014_102DE94EC4EE38E8"/>
and thy conception, in ſorrow thou ſhalt bring forth children,</hi> &amp;c. Now, I aſk, did <hi>Eve</hi> alone ſhare in this puniſhment? do not her daughters alſo bring forth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in ſorrow? <hi>And unto</hi> Adam <hi>he ſaid becauſe thou haſt hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and haſt eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, ſaying, thou ſhalt not eat of it, curſed is the ground for thy ſake—thorns and thiſtles ſhall it bring forth to thee,</hi> &amp;c. Obſerve, the earth was curſed for <hi>Adam's ſake,</hi> it was curſed for his firſt ſin; and doth not the earth ſtill bring forth thorns and thiſtles? theſe things were not only a trouble to <hi>Adam,</hi> but they are ſo to his children alſo. <hi>In ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life,—in the ſweat of thy face thou ſhalt eat bread—till thou return unto the ground,</hi> &amp;c. Here I aſk again, did <hi>Adam</hi> alone take his part in theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils? do not all mankind ſhare in them likewiſe? are not all ſubject to labour and ſorrow? Now, where is the juſtice of inflicting all theſe evils upon mankind, on account of <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt ſin, if that ſin is not imputed unto them? And all thoſe moral evils that affect the ſoul, <hi>(viz.)</hi> ignorance and dakrneſs of mind, impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and weakneſs in ſpiritual things, an averſion to good, a proneneſs to evil, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> are likewiſe the fruits and conſequences of the firſt tranſgreſſion; <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſtrength was our ſtrength till he loſt it.</p>
               <p>The death ſpoken of in <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 17. as the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the firſt ſin, is ſet in oppoſition to eternal life. <hi>Death</hi> (is ſaid) <hi>to reign by one man's offence.</hi> i e. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s firſt tranſgreſſion. For, as the life ſpoken of in the other part of the verſe, is a life of glory in heaven, <hi>Reigning in life by one Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> the antitheſis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires death ſhould intend a ſpiritual and eternal one.</p>
               <p>But to conclude this head, from what has been ſaid,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007860_0015_102DE950DAB78210"/>
we may ſee, that thoſe who deny the headſhip of Chriſt, are unavoidably led into the ſame error, they fix on thoſe that own it, <hi>(viz.)</hi> charging God with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. If any will ſay, it is unjuſt to puniſh one man for another man's ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> all mankind for the ſake of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and think likewiſe that it is not right in God to puniſh man for his diſobedience to his holy law, becauſe man has loſt the power he once had; let ſuch perſons conſider, that though it would have been unjuſt to have puniſhed man for his apoſtacy, in caſe he had not been endowed with ſufficient power to have kept the law he was under; yet the caſe is different with reſpect to fallen man: for though man in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fallen ſtate has not power to keep the law of God, yet he has ability to do more moral good than he doth, and to abſtain from many moral evils which he doth not; and therefore, upon his own account, may be very juſtly puniſhed for his diſobedience to the law, and his oppoſition to the goſpel. And alſo the juſtice of God is evident in puniſhing mankind with natural and moral evils upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s account; as they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in him as their head and repreſentative; and the juſtice of God ſhines forth with brighter rays in this ſcheme than in the other. For, if <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin is not imputed to us, then all we ſuffer before we commit actual ſin, we undergo and ſuffer as innocent. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the headſhip of <hi>Adam,</hi> the juſtice of God is cleared with reference to all we ſuffer, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the firſt tranſgreſſion: we being included in him, and as a part of him, it is but juſt and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we ſhould ſhare the ſame fate he did; and as to juſtice and equity of this conſtitution, none can doubt, that conſiders it was the righteous God that had the ſettling and ordering of the whole affair.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of the Fall of Man as a voluntary Tranſgreſſion, and of himſelf, being his own fault; and of the Liberty of Man's Will, and the Decrees of God being conſiſtent.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE fall of man was of himſelf; it was a wilful tranſgreſſion, that might have been avoided; that <hi>Adam</hi> fell therefore was intirely his own fault; he was <hi>made upright,</hi> but he turned aſide. <hi>Man being in honour did not abide long;</hi> how long is uncertain: it was long enough to know what he enjoyed, that when he fell he was ſenſible what he had loſt. Some men have affirmed, that God ordained the fall of man; but others have denied it, and find fault with ſuch an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as being too harſh, and as making God the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſe of the fall, and author of ſin.</p>
               <p>But though to ſay God ordained the fall of man, may ſound harſh in the ears of ſuch as perhaps under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand but little about the decrees of God, and the way and manner in which they are executed; yet I aſk where lies the evil, or harſhneſs of this propoſition, (God ordained the fall?) ſome perſons may be ſo ignorant as to think, that what God ordains ſhall be, he is the agent to effect, and the immediate cauſe thereof; but it is not always ſo, for wicked men, when they are doing their own work, and the will and work of the devil; they are at the ſame time fulfilling the righteous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God. This is undeniable in the <hi>Jews</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to death our bleſſed Lord. None will affirm that
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007860_0017_102DE956476DB7D8"/>
God was the immediate cauſe of perpetrating that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed act; it would be blaſphemy ſo to ſay: and yet none can deny (who believes the word of God) that the death of Chriſt was fore-ordained of God; for thus it is written,—<hi>Him being delivered by the determinate counſel and fore-knowledge of God, ye have crucified and ſlain—For of a truth againſt thy holy child</hi> Jeſus, <hi>whom thou haſt anointed, both</hi> Herod, <hi>and</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>with the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and the people of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>were gathered together, for to do whatſoever thy hand and thy counſel, determined (before) to be done,</hi> Acts ii. 23. iv. 27, 28.</p>
               <p>I might aſk, is there any thing cometh to paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God's ordination? If ſo, then it muſt be what he hath no concern with; for whatſoever God doth either immediately by himſelf alone, or mediately, <hi>i. e.</hi> what he permits to be done by means and inſtruments, is what he firſt purpoſes shall be done. For, whatſoever God permits to be, he firſt ordains ſhall be, having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, he permits; if it were not ſo, it would follow, that God permits ſome things to be, which he never purpoſed or ordained ſhould be, which muſt be falſe and abſurd. Beſides, it ſhould be obſerved, that as permiſſion includes the ways, means, and inſtruments, which effect and bring to paſs what is permitted, theſe can't exiſt, much leſs operate and move, without the will and pleaſure of God they ſhould. If any perſon ſhould aſk, where then is the difference between God's ordaining and permitting? I anſwer, the difference is not ſo great perhaps as ſome may imagine; the word <hi>permit,</hi> or <hi>permiſſion,</hi> is proper enough; but as it ſtands in ſuch near connection with the word <hi>ordain,</hi> we muſt take care not to admit wrong ideas.</p>
               <p>That <hi>permiſſion</hi> conveys a different idea from the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007860_0018_102DE957F242E9B0"/>
word <hi>ordain,</hi> is evident. For, the word <hi>permit,</hi> or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, refers to the execution of God's decrees, and what he is not the immediate cauſe of; for what he has decreed to be done, that is, effected by himſelf, without means and inſtruments, cannot come under the notion of permiſſion; but when he accompliſheth his decrees by means and inſtruments, he is ſaid to permit; he permits it to be done.</p>
               <p>Thus it may be truly ſaid, God permitted the death of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for, every circumſtance relating thereunto was permitted; he permitted <hi>Pilate</hi> to condemn him, and the <hi>Jews</hi> to crucify him: but this doth not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not fore-ordained, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther implies it was. Permiſſion ſeems to me to include in it a purpoſe of mind to permit. When Agrippa <hi>ſaid unto</hi> Paul <hi>thou art permitted to ſpeak for thyſelf,</hi> Acts xxvi. 1. muſt we not ſuppoſe that <hi>Agrippa</hi> firſt came to a determination in his own mind, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have liberty to ſpeak and make his defence; and having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, he permits? We ſhould conſider God may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain a thing to be done, and not be a doer of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but it is effected by means and inſtruments as they fall out in their common way of working.</p>
               <p>And though God is not the auther of ſin, neither doth he approve it as a thing agreeable to his nature; yet we muſt grant (except we deny the univerſal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God) that all means and ſecond cauſes are under his direction, and that the whole courſe of nature moves on in a direct line, as it was at firſt fix'd, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the original laws of nature; or, as it was the good will and pleaſure of God it ſhould; and his will is the ſame as at the beginning: otherwiſe he could alter the courſe of nature, or put a ſtop to the whole in a moment. And one would think, if the purpoſe,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007860_0019_102DE95A0C69BC00"/>
or decree of God may (as we know it may) be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the crucifying of the ſon of God; ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, barbarous, inhuman, and bloody an act <hi>(for by wicked hands he was crucified and ſlain;)</hi> I ſay, if it be granted (and who dares deny it?) that his was fore-ordained by God, ſurely there can be no danger in extending his decrees to any thing elſe. For, nothing can be ſo horribly impious as the crucifying of the only begotten ſon of God, <hi>the prince of life ſlain and hanged on a tree!</hi> And yet, <hi>all that</hi> Herod, Pilate, <hi>the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and the</hi> Jews <hi>did, was what the hand and counſel of God had before determined ſhould be done,</hi> Acts iv. 27, 28.</p>
               <p>We muſt alſo conſider, that the decrees of God, in the Execution of them, no ways infringe the liberty of the creature's will: this is evident in the caſe of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s being ſold (by his brethren) into <hi>Egypt;</hi> his brethren acted as free agents; it was a wicked act in them, proceeding from hatred and envy; and yet it was what God had appointed, or determined ſhould be, in order to bring about and accompliſh many and great things, both in providence and grace. <hi>God ſent me</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi> Joſeph) <hi>before you to preſerve life&amp;And God ſent me before you to preſerve a poſterity in the earth, and to ſave your lives by a great deliverance. So now, it was not you that ſent me hither, but God,</hi> Gen. xlv. 5, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>This thing is no leſs evident, in the revolt of the ten tribes, which was a voluntary tranſgreſſion in them; and yet, when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> was going to fight againſt <hi>Iſrael, That he might bring the Kingdom again to</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam, <hi>the Lord forbid him, and ſent</hi> Shemaiah, <hi>the man of God, ſaying, thus ſaith the Lord, ye ſhall not go up, to fight againſt your brethren, return every
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007860_0020_102DE95CA327DCD8"/>
man to his houſe, for this thing is done of me,</hi> 2 Chron. xi. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing is equally plain in the death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And theſe are but a few of the many inſtances which might be produced out of the word of God, proving theſe two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that what God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, he firſt ordains. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that neither the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God, nor the execution of them, infringe the liberty of man's will.</p>
               <p>Sometimes God himſelf is the immediate agent to effect his own purpoſes, and in the execution of them makes uſe of no means or inſtruments, as in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, the reſurrection of the dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whenever his purpoſes are executed by good and lawful means, he is the chief cauſe, though inſtruments be imployed; but, when the purpoſes of God are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by means which in themſelves are not good, God is not the chief cauſe; he permits it ſo to be.</p>
               <p>And things which are in themſelves ſinful, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be done; the doing of which is an accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's decrees, as the inſtances before named manifeſt; (viz) the ſelling <hi>Joſeph</hi> into <hi>Egypt;</hi> the revolt of the ten tribes; and the crucifying of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> all which were in themſelves ſinful; and yet the doing of them was the executing, or fulfilling of God's eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal counſel, particularly the crucifying of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> which was not only the accompliſhment of God's eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal counſel, concerning the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but led on towards the effecting all thoſe things which God had purpoſed concerning the ſalvation of his choſen people; looking backward or forward, all center in the death of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That God foreknew from eternity, all creatures and actions, even the moſt contingent, will, I preſume, be
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007860_0021_102DE95EE2AD6160"/>
granted by all that believe divine revelation. And from the foreknowledge of God may be argued the certain future exiſtence of whatſoever was foreknown. For whatſoever is foreknown by God, or viewed as exiſting, which yet is future, muſt exiſt in time, according as it was foreknown, or viewed before time; or, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God would not be certain: for as nothing can exiſt that is future, without being firſt viewed, or foreknown by God, muſt neceſſarily exiſt in time; or God would be liable to be deceived, and which muſt be the caſe, if any thing was foreknown by God as what would be in time, and yet did not exiſt.</p>
               <p>But this neceſſity of exiſtence, puts nothing into the creature, when it exiſteth; it is not thereby impelled, or forced to act in the manner it doth: neither doth the foreknowledge of God alter the nature of any creature or action, whether good or bad; but conſiders things barely in the mode and manner in which they exiſt in time: and whatſoever is foreknown by God as what would exiſt in a certain way, 'tis his will and pleaſure to permit it ſo to exiſt; and this permiſſion muſt include in it, a purpoſe to permit. For what God foreknows before time, that comes to paſs in time; he either determines within himſelf to permit the ſame to come paſs, or he doth not; if the latter, <hi>(viz)</hi> if he doth not determine to permit it to come to paſs, then his foreknowledge and his decrees are at odds; but if the former, <hi>i. e.</hi> if he did determine to permit, then it will follow, that permiſſion includes in it, or ſtands in cloſe connection with, a purpoſe as antecedent to permiſſion.</p>
               <p>As every thing, <hi>i.e.</hi> very creature, circumſtance, and action, which exiſt in time, were before time taken up in the great Jehovah's all-comprehending mind; and as nothing of all that was foreknown could
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007860_0022_102DE9608D561000"/>
take place, without his will and pleaſure it ſhould; therefore, to ſuppose any thing falls out contrary to his intention, or what was his ſecret will ſhould not be, is to deny his omnipotency; although at the ſame time it may be prohibited in his revealed will; which is no contradiction: for when God wills to permit things that are in themſelves ſinful, it is not as approving of them conſidered in their nature as ſinful, for God doth not abſolutely will evil conſidered in itſelf as a thing repugnant to his holy nature; but he wills it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to other views and ends; ſo that what God prohibits in his revealed will, as things contrary to his holy and pure nature, he in his ſecret will determines to permit for wiſe and good ends, which he can, and will, accompliſh thereby.</p>
               <p>Thus with reſpect to the ſin and fall of man, and the crucifying of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> things that are ſinful, and forbidden in God's revealed will, being contrary to his holy nature, and what he could not approve of; yet we ſee it was his ſecret will theſe things ſhould ſo come to paſs; and had ſo purpoſed within himſelf before the foundation of the world; and that his ends and views in all this were wiſe and good, none can queſtion that underſtands and believes what he reads in the word of God. Therefore to ſay it was the will and pleaſure of God to permit <hi>Adam</hi> to fall, and that it is his will and pleaſure to permit (or ſuffer, which is the ſame) whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever falls out and comes to paſs in the world, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing fully my meaning, and what I intend.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if any man like not this way of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (viz.) <hi>God ordained the fall,</hi> he may have it in the following terms, (viz.) <hi>It was the good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God to permit</hi> Adam <hi>to fall.</hi>—And which is the ſofteſt and beſt way of expreſſion; but then it muſt be
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007860_0023_102DE962362B4F40"/>
obſerved, that the good will and pleaſure of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated from his eternal purpoſe, but is the very ſame thing in other words, as may be ſeen in <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 5, 9.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee God permitted man to ſin and fall; he ſuffered the Devil to tempt him, to ſeduce and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him. But the ſin and fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the wickedneſs committed in the world ſince, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with this difference; namely, there is in fallen man a deficiency, a want of ſtrength to ſtand againſt Satan and his temptations, which was not the caſe with reference to <hi>Adam;</hi> he had power to reſiſt and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the temptation: God permitted innocent man to fall into ſin, and he permits ſinful man to go on in ſin.</p>
               <p>It was not a precarious thing with God whether <hi>Adam</hi> would ſtand or fall; as is evident from the early proviſion he made for man's recovery, laying the plan of man's ſalvation in the death of his own Son. This ſcheme of man's redemption from ſin, ſuppoſed his falling into it; and the model of this was drawn, and the whole affair ſettled before man was made. <hi>The Mediator was ſet up from everlaſting—and a people choſen in him before the foundation of the world; and grace treaſured up in the Mediator's hand for all the elect, before the world began,</hi> Prov. viii. 22, to 32. Eph. 1. 4. 2 Tim. 1. 9.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid, I hope it is evident, that the fall of man was from himſelf; it was a wilful tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion; he could not juſtly blame any but himſelf. And yet, previous to this, we may ſay, it was the good will and pleaſure of God to permit or ſuffer it ſo to be; but this no ways affected the will of <hi>Adam,</hi> no not in the leaſt, ſo as to lay any neceſſity upon it; neither doth it ever affect the will of any creature in this ſenſe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Contains an anſwer to the following query, (viz.)</hi> Whether any mere creature will ſtand in the ſtate in which it is created, upon the foot of creation-powers and abilities, without ſupernatural aids, or confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace?</head>
               <p>THE ſubject of this chapter will be to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nature of all created beings, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that of man in the ſtate of innocence.</p>
               <p>The queſtion before us is not, <hi>whether an innocent creature can ſtand, but whether it will?</hi> I ſhall take the liberty to ſearch into this query, not to ſatisfy cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, but to find out, as far as I can, the truth; it will help us to ſee the nature of all created beings; and if we find the anſwer in the negative; if it be no more than ſtrongly probable, that no creature will ſtand upon the foot of creation-abilities, then it will lead our thoughts to the ſpecial love of God, ſecuring, by a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and gracious decree, the happineſs of elect men and angels. The ſtate of the queſtion, is (not whether an innocent creature can ſtand, for that is out of all queſtion, but) whether any mere creature <hi>will ſtand,</hi> in that ſtate in which it is created, upon the foot of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-powers and abilities, without ſupernatural aids, or confirming grace? I ſhall lay it down for a truth that none will, or, that 'tis at leaſt exceeding probable, that no mere creature will ſtand and perſevere long, without being confirmed by the ſpecial grace of God. For the proof of this, I ſhall produce the following argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:007860_0025_102DE967B5099F18"/>I. <hi>The firſt argument ſhall be taken from matter of fact; the fall of man and angels.</hi> Theſe we know did not ſtand in the ſtate in which they were made; they had power to ſtand, but did not: as to thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels which did not fall, their ſtanding is not owing to creation-powers and abilities, but electing grace: they are called <hi>the elect angels,</hi> I <hi>Tim.</hi> v. 21.</p>
               <p>Perhaps ſome men may think, they were elected after they had given ſufficient proof of their fidelity, and had the reſt done the ſame, they would alſo have been elected. To which I anſwer, this is not ſo much as probable, for <hi>two</hi> reaſons; for, <hi>Firſt,</hi> this would make election according to works, which would have given room for boaſting, and is contrary to God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in other caſes, namely, the election of men, <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 5. which is, <hi>according to grace. Secondly,</hi> then they muſt have ſtood the time of their trial, which 'tis evident they had not; for, as we muſt conclude, the angels were all created at once, were all of one ſpecies or nature, ſo the time of their probation muſt be the ſame; and thoſe that fell had not ſtood the full time of their trial, for then they would not have fallen: but they fell ſhort of the limits ſet them, that is, of perſevering to the end. And why did not the others fall? I anſwer, becauſe they were elected, antecedent to, or before the others fell; or, why are they called elect? Thoſe that fell are not ſo or, what can this term, (elect) mean if it mean not that theſe were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by election from falling? Beſides, it ſhould be obſerved, that election refers to a part; had the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels all ſtood the full time of their trial, they might have been confirmed—but not elected: it would not have been proper to have called them the elect angels; election being a taking a part out of the whole, <hi>Deut.</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:007860_0026_102DE9695DA16748"/>
vii. 6, 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 5. We may therefore conclude, that had it not been for electing grace, the now holy and happy angels had fell as their fellows did; and I make no queſtion but they know this, and are deeply affected with it; angels as well as men will bleſs God for electing grace! Perhaps it may be ſaid, that man, if he had not had a tempter, might have ſtood. I anſwer, it cannot be proved that he would have ſtood, ſuppoſing he had no external temper; the contrary is much more probable, as the angels (except the elect) did fall, who had not (at leaſt, not all of them) any external temper, and what angels did, man might have done. However, as angels and man did not ſtand, and we know not that God hath made any other order, or rank of rational and intellectual beings which have ſtood upon the foot of creation-powers and abilities, the concluſion from hence, that no creature will ſtand muſt carry in it at leaſt a ſtrong probability.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>The ſecond argument is taken from the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary dependance of the creature on the Creator, for the continuation of it's happineſs, and the liableneſs there is of the creature's getting off from that dependance, and ſo loſing its happineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As all creatures muſt be dependant on their creator, for the whole of their happineſs, both as to the thing itſelf, and the continuance of it; there may be, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing I can ſee, a very great liableneſs of getting off from their dependance; the conſequence of which muſt be the loſs of their happineſs. In which caſe there is nothing withheld (by God) from the creature, but 'tis the creature withdraws and gets off from its creator, the conſequence of which muſt be apoſtacy. This was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s caſe, ſo long as his dependance was firm he
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007860_0027_102DE96B742BD1D8"/>
ſtood; but no ſooner did he hearken to the tempter but it affected his dependance: every inch of ground the devil<note n="*" place="bottom">Though I ſpeak of <hi>Adam</hi> as being tempted by the Devil, I do not ſuppoſe he was tempted by him in the ſerpent as <hi>Eve</hi> was; yet I judge it proper to ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> was tempted by him; for though it was <hi>Eve</hi> which tempted <hi>Adam,</hi> yet ſhe was, at that time, the Devil's inſtrument, and might as well be called Satan, as <hi>Peter</hi> was upon another account, when the Devil made uſe of him to tempt <hi>Chriſt, Mat.</hi> xvi. 23. For as the woman was tempted by the Devil in the ſerpent; ſo <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was tempted by the Devil in the woman; or, at leaſt, by his making uſe of the woman, <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 17.</note> got here, was of the greateſt prejudice to <hi>Adam;</hi> his dependance upon God being gradually wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, till he gave more heed to what the tempter ſaid, than to what God ſaid, and this was the fatal blow; no ſooner had Satan gained this point, but his work was done.</p>
               <p>Had <hi>Adam</hi> been upon his guard in the exerciſe of thoſe powers he was endowed with, and cleaved faſt to God's word, the enemy had not prevailed.</p>
               <p>Now, what <hi>Adam</hi> did, another creature might do, and angels did. Therefore, as all creatures muſt be dependent upon their creator for their happineſs, and their continuance of it; and can ſtand and enjoy it no longer than they cleave faſt to God and his holy word; I ſee not why a mere creature may not be exceeding liable to fall; and it is at leaſt very probable, a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without ſupernatural aids will fall.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>The third argument ſhall be drawn from the nature of all created eſſences, and mere creature-abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as being liable to change.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No being is, or can be, by creation, unchangeable; no created eſſence hath this property belonging to it,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007860_0028_102DE96F3382F360"/>
by virtue of its creation: God alone (who is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created eſſence) is unchangeable. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not,</hi> Mal. iii. 6.</p>
               <p>All creatures are mutable and liable to change, though they be the moſt excellent; for, if you ſuppoſe a creature of the higheſt rank, bleſt with created powers and abilities to the higheſt degree poſſible, yet 'tis but a creature, and no more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could we ſuppoſe a mere creature unchangeable by nature, it would no longer be a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but God. It is true, God can put a creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fix'd ſtate, as the elect angels are and as ſaints will be in heaven: but this will be owing to the ſpecial grace of God confirming them in that bleſſed ſtate; and not to any natural powers and abilities in themſelves: 'tis an act of ſovereign grace, and muſt be reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that glorious and irreverſible decree which he hath paſt, <hi>that ſo it ſhall be.</hi> Therefore from the nature of all created beings, ariſes a ſtrong preſumption that no mere creature will ſtand long upon the foot of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-abilities, without ſuper-added ſtrength, or confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>The fourth argument ſhall be grounded on the liableneſs there is in all created beings to err.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a queſtion; whether any mere creature from its creation-powers and abilities can be exempted from a liableneſs to err, and that for two reaſons, (1.) One reaſon of this is, the creature's knowledge muſt be bounded; for that knowledge which is not infinite muſt have bounds; but a creature's knowledge is not infinite, therefore has bounds. From hence ariſes a liableneſs to err, not knowing (always) certainly, what may be the event of ſuch or ſuch a courſe if taken by the creature. A creature may be perfect in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:007860_0029_102DE970DA05AAB8"/>
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> be as perfect in knowledge as the nature of the creature will admit of, but its knowledge cannot reach to all that is future. I do not ſay, a creature cannot be exempted from erring; for it is evident elect angels are, and the ſaints will be in heaven; but this is not to be aſcribed to creature-abilities, but to the grace of God confirming them in that ſtate where it is impoſſible they ſhould err. God alone is <hi>the only wiſe,</hi>—infinite in knowledge; and one reaſon why God cannot err, is, becauſe he knows all things; whatſoever is future, <hi>he ſeeth from the beginning to the end;</hi> his knowledge hath no bounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> was as knowing as ſuch a creature could be; but 'tis a queſtion whether he certainly knew what would be the conſequence of eating the forbidden fruit: ſuppoſe he knew that death would follow (which he might know from the threatning) did he know what death was? or was he capable of knowing to the full extent the evil and miſery would follow? or did he believe (when he took and eat) what was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the prohibition, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely die?</hi> (May we not conclude, that not only <hi>Eve</hi>'s faith, but <hi>Adam</hi>'s alſo, was weakened, if not quite deſtroyed, with refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God's word, and when credit was given to what the ſerpent ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall not ſurely die.</hi> And it ſhould be conſidered, whether ſin be not always purſued under the notion of ſome good. In <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 7 'tis ſaid, after they had eat, <hi>the eyes of them both were opened,</hi> &amp;c. Not only the woman's eyes, but the man's alſo; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Adam</hi>'s eyes were not opened before he eat the forbidden fruit: for what can be meant by the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the eyes, but ſeeing and knowing what he did not before <hi>(viz.)</hi> to diſcern between good and evil; ſeeing the difference, and experimentally feeling the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007860_0030_102DE97301438C20"/>
ſad conſequences of eating the forbidden fruit; <hi>They knew that they avere naked.</hi> Not only that their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies wanted cloathing, but they knew that their ſouls were naked, ſtript of thoſe excellencies which they had before, <hi>i. e. the image of God.</hi> Had <hi>Adam</hi> known certainly what would have followed upon eating—then it might be ſaid his eyes were open before he eat; which is contrary to the expreſs words of the text—<hi>She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave alſo unto her huſband with her, and he did eat. And the eyes of them were opened, and they knew that they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp;c.</hi> Gen. iii. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee there is a liableneſs to err, ariſing from the creature's knowledge being bounded.</p>
               <p>II. This liableneſs to err, ariſeth alſo from innocent nature being capable of ſeduction. Though there was nothing, in the innocent nature of man, nor angels, that naturally led on towards apoſtacy, yet that, that upright principle which was in innocent nature was liable to be corrupted, or, take a wrong and ſinful bias, is evident, in that it did ſo, both in man and angels: and when that innate principle, which is the governing principle in the ſoul, is corrupted, then the creature can no longer ſtand, but muſt fall, nay is fallen. And may we not conclude, that this innate principle in man and angels included in it a very peculiar taſte of true greatneſs and honour. This principle lay in the ſoul, till the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came which drew it out; but then there muſt be ſuch a principle in nature, or it could not have been drawn out. And is not this very apparent from this conſideration, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that it was honour and preferment the devil made uſe of as the lure or bait; that which ſeemed to prevail was this, <hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:007860_0031_102DE974AED39C20"/>'Tis true, this is what the Devil in the ſerpent ſaith to <hi>Eve;</hi> but then, as the woman was the Devil's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to tempt <hi>Adam,</hi> is it not very reaſonable to think that ſhe made uſe of the ſame way in tempting her husband as the ſerpent had done in tempting of her? That ſhe uſed ſome arguments with him is very plain from <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 17. where <hi>Adam</hi> is charged by the Lord with <hi>hearkening to the voice of his wife.</hi> And 'tis obſervable, that the honour and preferment propoſed by the ſerpent, was under the colour of true greatneſs and honour; as there can be no greater honour than to be a God, <hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods.</hi> Now had there been no ſuch principle in innocent nature, it may be enquired, whether this temptation would have had any hold. And what further confirms this to me is, the account we have of the woman before ſhe eat, <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 6. <hi>And when the woman ſaw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleaſant to the eyes, and a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe, ſhe took,</hi> &amp;c. Obſerve, <hi>ſhe ſaw the tree was good—a tree to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to make one wiſe,</hi> &amp;c. Or, as it is in ſome verſions, <hi>A pleaſant tree to give underſtanding—or, a tree to be deſired to get knowledge,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I do not ſuppoſe this principle was corrupt, or ſinful, but pure and holy, 'till it took a wrong bias, and was indulged beyond its proper bounds. And it is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing probable to me, that <hi>Satan</hi> knew there was ſuch a principle in innocent man which might be drawn forth to aſpire after greatneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not ſuppoſe but <hi>Adam</hi> was perfectly well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſtate in which he was placed; he had no uneaſy propenſities, or longings after more knowledge: but what I ſay is, that it appears to me very plain, that there was ſuch a principle in innocent nature, which
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:007860_0032_102DE977B0D436B0"/>
being touch'd, would immediately catch fire, if a ſtrict watch and guard were not kept over it. And the ſparks of temptation being by the Devil caſt upon this tender and delicate part of the ſoul, preſently took fire; and thus man inwardly burned with reſtleſs and ſinful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after forbidden knowledge: but this was after the temptation had taken hold of him, and that innate prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple was corrupted, which before was a main part of the glory of human nature. And it is very reaſonable to think, that <hi>Satan</hi> knew, or at leaſt, might imagine there was ſuch a principle in innocent man; as there was, I make no queſtion, ſuch an innate principle in the angels, which they that fell abuſed to their ruin: and they might very reaſonably conclude upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of man in the ſame way; accordingly the Devil tries the experiment, and finds his account in it.</p>
               <p>That there was a likeneſs between the fall of man and angels, is evident enough, in that pride was the cauſe of both; as may be ſeen in comparing, <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 5. with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 6. There is this difference, as ſome may think, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> had a tempter, but the angels had none. That <hi>Adam</hi> had a Tempter is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, but that the fallen angels had none is not ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. I do not ſuppoſe they (at leaſt not all of them) had any other tempter, but as they might be their own tempters; ſo that though they had no external tempter, as man had, they might have an internal one; or one, or a few might fall firſt, and tempt and ſeduce the reſt; as <hi>Eve</hi> was firſt ſeduced by the ſerpent, and then the means of drawing the man into rebellion: ſo one of the chief of thoſe ſpirits might rebel firſt, and then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the reſt, and ſo the moſt had a tempter, if not tempters: <hi>(viz.)</hi> Beelzebub <hi>the chief of the Devils,</hi> Luke xi. 15. Or poſſibly they might be their own tempters, by raiſing in their minds forbidden ideas,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007860_0033_102DE97A18C35718"/>
which being raiſed, and indulged, became a ſnare to them. And had not <hi>Adam</hi> indulged ſomething of this kind, the external temptation had not hurt him, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fall of man and angels, it may be thought, there is on man's ſide this favourable circumſtance <hi>(viz)</hi> the external temptation, this might be a means of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing in him thoſe forbidden ideas: But if he had not had an external temptation, he might have erred as the angels did. Some perſons may call this mere conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, things that are not revealed. To which I anſwer, the fall of man and angels is revealed, <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. <hi>John</hi> viii. 44. <hi>Jude</hi> 6. And I think it muſt be lawful, and in ſome reſpects commendable, to draw from things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the moſt evident and rational concluſions, guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt poſitive aſſertions: whether theſe concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I have drawn, and laid down, are the moſt evident and rational, is left to ſerious and pious conſideration.</p>
               <p>But to conclude this ſubject, <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationer, and there muſt be ſomething as the teſt of his obedience; this we are told was a tree bearing fruit ſtanding in the midſt of the garden, called, <hi>the tree of knowledge of good and evil,</hi> Gen. ii. 9, 17. Now there being ſuch an innate principle in innocent nature, which on the firſt notice, or hint, was liable to be drawn forth in aſpiring after honour and preferment, or being more knowing and wiſe; this tree was a teſt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s obedience; prohibiting him from any new and curious enquiries after hidden things. And here it was <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have been perpetually upon his guard, and not have ſuffered that innate principle to rebel, but kept within its preſcribed limits. For the ultimate end of this innate principle was to glorify God, in ſhewing man's juſt ſubjection to his makers righteous commands. This was <hi>Adam</hi>'s paradiſe, this his bounds; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

theſe ſacred limits he was to dwell; contemplating the perfections of his creator, and thoſe excellent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments wherewith he himſelf was bleſt. As it muſt afford a very peculiar joy, yea, give the moſt refined and exalted pleaſures to innocent man, beholding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf adorned with the bright image of his maker; and the pureſt joys muſt ſweetly flow into his ſoul, when turning his eyes from himſelf to view the grand origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, the fountain from whence he had received his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all the embeliſhments of nature: and this could not fail of producing in him the moſt unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thanks and gratitude to his great and liberal bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor. And here it was <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have reſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf contented, in this delightful, clear, and aſſimilat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſight of the great Jehovah. But, giving way of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring thoughts, ſeeking after a falſe greatneſs was his ruin; ſuffering that innate, and powerful principle, to take a wrong turn. If he had ſought after honour, it ſhould have been in the exerciſe of the powers of nature, in ſuch a way as was conſiſtent with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon, and rightful obedience to his great creator.</p>
               <p>Had any thing been propoſed by God as a motive to honour and preferment, may we not conclude that, that innate principle in innocent nature, would immediately have taken the hint, and been as quick and powerful in its operation in ſeeking after true greatneſs. For, the preferment ſought after was under the colour of true greatneſs, <hi>Ye ſhall be as gods.</hi> Had they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known, that inſtead of being <hi>as Gods,</hi> they ſhould be <hi>like Devils;</hi> is it ſo much as probable they would have taken and eat? for as the woman, ſo the man alſo affected Deity<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. GILL'S annot. on <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 6.</note>. And I think, of all expedients that
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:007860_0035_102DE97F908AC590"/>
could be found out, to turn man into a Devil, none more proper than to tempt him to aſpire to be a God.</p>
               <p>And as it may be a queſtion, whether Satan could have prevailed (ſo well) any other way; ſo, it may be enquired, whether he could have done it this way, if the nature of man, in the ſtate of innocency, had not been endowed with a very peculiar and delicate taſte of true greatneſs.</p>
               <p>But here lay the miſchief, in miſtaking a falſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for a true one; it was very unlikely, nay, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to obtain this end, in going contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs word of God: and this they ſoon ſaw; and by ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful experience found they were deceived, and inſtead of riſing to honour and prefrement, they ſunk down into poverty, diſgrace, and ſhame. Now, from the liableneſs there is of this innate principle of rectitude in innocent nature being corrupted, ariſes a very great improbabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any meer creature's ſtanding on the foot of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation-powers and abilities, without ſuper-added ſtrength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all that I have ſaid in anſwer to this query <hi>(viz.)</hi> whether any meer creature will ſtand the time allotted for trial, on the foot of creation-abilities&amp;without ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-added ſtrength, or confirming grace; I have not poſitively affirmed, none will ſtand upon ſuch a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but that there is a very great probability none would, and to this opinion my mind ſtrongly inclines.</p>
               <p>Since man did not ſtand upon the foot of creation-abilities, nor the angels, and as we know not of any other creatures that God hath made that have ſtood; for all created beings muſt be dependant upon their creator for their happineſs, and are not exempted by their creation from a very great liability of getting off from their dependance, and ſo loſing their happineſs;
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:007860_0036_102DE981B9485650"/>
and as all created eſſences, and meer creature-abilities are liable to change, and the higheſt rank of creatures may err, as their knowledge muſt be bounded, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent nature itſelf is capable of ſeduction. But the creature's fall is from itſelf; both angels and man had ſufficient power to ſtand: it was altogether man's fault; <hi>he was made upright, but they ſought out many inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> That proved their ruin, and brought ſin, and ſorrow; and death upon themſelves and their poſterity. And, was this but thoroughly conſidered, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the conſequence of the creatures having their happineſs in their own hands, and at their own diſpoſe, to keep or loſe; one would think no man would deſire ſuch a jewel in his own keeping.</p>

               </head>
               <p>TWO very evident concluſions drawn from what has been ſaid in the foregoing chapters, ſhall conclude this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>(1.) Conluſion—<hi>If the continuance of the creature's happineſs, when it depends upon the creature itſelf, be ſo very uncertain, as we ſee it is; then we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the happineſs of fallen, ſinful man, cannot be certain upon any other foot, or foundation, than that of God's eternal and immutable counſel, ſecuring the ſame by covenant in his own dear Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, if man and angels (except the elect) loſt their creation-happineſs; if when they were in poſſeſſion of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:007860_0037_102DE98367E84730"/>
it, they did not keep it; how very unlikely (might I not ſay impoſſible) is it for man himſelf to obtain ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs? The ſalvation of any of the fallen race of <hi>Adam</hi> cannot certainly be concluded upon from the ſuppoſed free agency of man. If the whole, as to the event and final iſſue, be left to turn upon the will of the creature; and if it be entirely in man's power to win or loſe heaven; then what certainty can there be, that any will poſſeſs eternal life? The creature's will is changeable; and what the creature-abilities, and common aſſiſtances, when ſet in oppoſition to the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and enemies that obſtruct and hinder perſons in their ſeeking after happineſs in a future ſtate? But on this foundation <hi>(viz.)</hi> that God hath taken this great affair into his own hands, and laid up, or depoſited our happineſs in the hands of the faithful mediator; from hence 'tis certain, that ſome of the fallen race of <hi>Adam</hi> will poſſeſs and enjoy it; for God ſaid, <hi>A ſeed ſhall ſerve him</hi> (i. e. <hi>the mediator</hi>) <hi>it ſhall be accounted to the Lord for a generation. And he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hands. He ſhall ſee the travail of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied, and by his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtify many; for he ſhall bear their iniquities,</hi> Pſal. xxii. 30. Iſa. liii. 10, 11. It is not an uncertain thing whether God's elect, true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, ſhall enjoy eternal life. <hi>For God that cannot lie, promiſed them eternal life in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began. And he is faithful that hath promiſed, who alſo will do it,</hi> Tit. i. 2. Heb. x. 23. 1 Theſ. v. 23, 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heaven is prepared</hi> for true believers, <hi>and they are preſerved unto it. Chriſt as their forerunner is gone to prepare manſions for them. And the kingdom of glory
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:007860_0038_102DE9858CB0EAA8"/>
ſhall be given to them for whom it is prepared. And Chriſt will come again, and receive his own unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that where he is, they may be alſo,</hi> Matt. xxv. 34. Jud. i. 2 Tim. iv. 8. Heb. vi. 20. John xiv. 2, 3. Matt. xx. 23.</p>
               <p>O! what a bleſſed foundation is here to reſt eternal life and happineſs upon! But on the foot of works, or the free will of the creature, all muſt be at a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty: ſuppoſe it was in the power of man, with that divine, or ſuper-added aſſiſtance which is common to all where the goſpel comes, to riſe up and ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his feet, yet even then how very unlikely is it that he ſhould ſtand, and perſevere long, if his ſtanding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon himſelf, and what he could do? And was I to put it upon this foot <hi>(viz.)</hi> that man is pure by nature, and that Chriſt hath done enough for all men to anſwer the diſadvantages they receive by the fall; even then it is very uncertain whether any would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eternal life; for if <hi>Adam</hi> loſt his happineſs, why may not man, fallen man, loſe his? Nay, were we to ſuppoſe the preſent ſtate of man every way as good as <hi>Adam</hi>'s was in innocency, even then alſo it would be uncertain, whether any would continue long in ſuch a ſtate: for why may not mankind fall as well as <hi>Adam?</hi> He loſt his paradiſe, and 'tis at leaſt exceeding proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the children will tread in their fathers ſteps, and loſe their paradiſe too. I think none can imagine that mankind in their fallen ſtate have any thing ſuperior to what <hi>Adam</hi> had, or enjoyed in innocency; and we ſee that putting things upon a level, the happineſs of man muſt be very uncertain, and precarious; for <hi>Adam</hi> loſt his happineſs, (I mean his creation-happineſs) and we know that mankind may loſe theirs, except man or his preſent ſtate be better than <hi>Adam</hi>'s was. But the truth
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:007860_0039_102DE9879EFF39F8"/>
is, the preſent ſtate of man is far worſe than that before the fall; the powers of man are not only weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, but man in his natural ſtate is <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins;</hi> deſtitute of ſpiritual ſtrength, averſe to good, and prone to evil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An univerſal recovery, is no recovery at all; for it being conditional, the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theſe conditions, <hi>(viz.)</hi> faith, repentance, and ſincere obedience, are out of the power of man; and if we ſuppoſe them within the power of man, ſtill 'tis very uncertain whether they will be performed. But by God's taking this great and important affair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own hand, the happineſs of man is thereby put upon ſuch a foot as cannot miſcarry: and thus the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of true believers depends entirely on the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign free grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus: which was one main thing I had in view, in enquiring into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all created beings; and which is ſo noble a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſo full of the moſt ſolid peace, and laſting joy, as cannot fail of raiſing up our admiring thoughts, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our delightful contemplations on the everlaſting love of God in Chriſt Jeſus! the ſource and fountain of all our happineſs. Thus we ſee the happineſs of fallen man is not certain, or cannot certainly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded on, upon any other foot, or foundation, than that of God's eternal purpoſe, ſecuring the ſame by covenant in his own dear Son.</p>
               <p>And, which muſt imply alſo, that eternal life and happineſs cannot be obtained by works, or any thing the creature can do. For, this ſeems a clear conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>(viz.)</hi> If our happineſs be ſecured in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with Chriſt (according to the concluſion above) then it cannot reſt upon works. For, as <hi>Adam</hi> when he had his creation-happineſs in his own hand, to keep or loſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did not keep, but loſe it; 'tis very unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:007860_0040_102DE989DEE89130"/>
that God ſhould put it upon the ſame footing again, <hi>(viz.)</hi> works. <hi>Adam</hi>'s happineſs, as to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it, was conditional; the covenant was, <hi>do this and live;</hi> or, if not, die.</p>
               <p>But the happineſs we are to ſeek after, as 'tis not in our keeping, nor are we in the actual poſſeſſion of it; ſo neither is it promiſed unto us on condition of any thing done by us in order to purchaſe it; but it is laid up in the free promiſe of God; and this promiſe (of eternal life) as all others are, is <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus, yea and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to the glory of God by us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A condition and a free promiſe are contrary one to the other, as may be ſeen in <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 18. <hi>For if the inheritance be of the law</hi> (or works) <hi>it is no more of promiſe but God gave it to</hi> Abraham <hi>by promiſe.</hi> And that the promiſe of eternal life is a free promiſe, who can queſtion? For was it not an act of God's, ſovereign good will and pleaſure to make ſuch a promiſe to ſinful creatures, who deſerve eternal wrath? And 'tis beneath God to promiſe eternal life (the greateſt thing he could promiſe) on ſuch a mean condition as a poor imperfect obedience of the creature, thus to hang ſo glorious a prize on ſo mean a condition, and ſo expoſe heaven to ſale. No, <hi>eternal life is the gift of God through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord. Not by works of righteouſneſs which we</hi> (who are true believers) <hi>have done, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 'Tis, <hi>they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. vi. 23. Tit. iii. 5. Rom. v. 17.</p>
               <p>Works and grace, law and promiſe, cannot agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; 'tis either by the one, or elſe by the other; they cannot be blended together: heaven is either the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:007860_0041_102DE98C6915E608"/>
free gift of God, what he hath promiſed to man for the ſake of what Chriſt hath done, without the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any thing done by man as a condition to obtain it; or, 'tis promiſed to man upon condition of doing what is enjoined him as a duty: if the former, then works are excluded; but if the latter, then grace is excluded. A thing cannot be ſaid to be freely given, if it be given on conditions; if the perſon to whom it is given be tied up to the performance of ſomething to be done, the doing of which work or ſervice being the condition of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying what was promiſed, cuts off the freeneſs of the promiſe: 'tis not a free promiſe, but a conditional one. And this is what people in common underſtand; for if you offer to give a perſon any thing, and at the ſame time inſiſt upon his doing you a little piece of ſervice, he will plainly ſee, though it was in ſome reſpects a gift, yet in no reſpect a free gift. Therefore to make hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a free gift, 'tis neceſſary to cut off all conditions. To ſay heaven is free gift, becauſe there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between what we do, and what we receive, is ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to the purpoſe: for, if I promiſe a man double wages for his work when he hath done it the wages is due, and doing the work is what procures the reward: it becomes due when the work is done, and not before.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, there muſt be ſomething wrought in, and done by thoſe that inherit eternal life; thoſe that enter into the kingdom of glory are ſuch as are <hi>born of God,</hi> having true faith wrought in them, <hi>that faith which is of the operation of God; precious faith; the faith of God's elect; that works by love, and purifieth the heart,</hi> Col. ii. 12. Tit. i. 2. Gal. v. 5.</p>
               <p>But then, theſe works, or fruits, that proceed from faith, and as done by the believer, are not conditions of life: the believer doth not obey God expecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:007860_0042_102DE98E0FC8E4C0"/>
that account to enter into glory. The obedience which ſprings from faith, follows after a perſon in ſome ſenſe enjoys eternal life, not after he is put in actual poſſeſſion of it; but after he hath had the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtes of it. For, <hi>he that believeth on Chriſt hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life,</hi> John iii. 36. He hath it in the promiſe, and in hope; he hath it in his expectation and experience; he hath the earneſt of everlaſting life. For <hi>faith is the ſubſtance of things hop'd for, the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. xi. 1. As to faith, that is the gift of God, therefore cannot be a condition; and the acting of faith, and the fruits thereof, are no conditions, being the works of God; I mean that he is not only the <hi>author,</hi> but the <hi>finiſher of faith.</hi> And good works are what follow after a perſon hath received the deed of conveyance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the crown and kingdom are made ſure to the believer; Chriſt being <hi>in him the hope of glory.</hi> Suppoſe you beſtow a great favour on an enemy, and he having received it, is convinced of his evil in behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch a manner towards you as he hath done in time paſt; your kindneſs melts his heart, and his hatred is now turned into love, and he is ready to do you all the ſervice he can. Now what he doth is not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to obtain your favour, having no reaſon to think you are his enemy; and as when you firſt beſtowed your favour upon him he was your enemy, his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence goeth not before, but follows after he received the favour; and therefore cannot be a condition of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, but a fruit and conſequent of his receiving it. So in the caſe before us; the elect, as well as others, are by nature enemies to God, and he finds them ſo when he comes to beſtow this great favour (eternal life) upon them, in giving them the earneſt thereof, <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 1, 8. <hi>Col.</hi> i. 21. When ſalvation is made known, and
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:007860_0043_102DE99091E6E2C0"/>
applied to the ſoul, there is a thorough conviction of ſin, the heart is melted down into holy contrition, 'tis won over to the Lord, <hi>it is made willing in the day of his power,</hi> Pſa. cx. 3. The man that before was an enemy to God, is now his friend, and filled with love to him; and the language of ſuch an one is, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me do?</hi> Acts ix. 6. But here is no doing as a condition, 'tis all the fruit and effect of that faith whereby the ſoul hath laid hold on Chriſt as his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; ſuch a perſon hath no view to what he doth as a condition to purchaſe any thing thereby; he hath a kingdom in hope, and is firmly perſuaded he ſhall actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enjoy it in due time, according to <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 3, 4. <hi>For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God. When Chriſt, who is our life, ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, what a true believer doth is not a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the fruit, and effect of God's love, manifeſted in beſtowing ſuch a favour, as eternal life upon him, and follows after the favour is received. When any thing is offered by way of condition, the thing offered cannot be enjoyed, in any ſenſe, 'till the condition be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but this we ſee is not the caſe before us with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to true believers; ſuch an one hath a well-grounded hope, having the firſt, or foretaſtes of heaven; this he hath before he has gone through a courſe of obedience; for this for the moſt part is given in when he is converted to God. Heaven is no ſurer at the end of a Chriſtian's journey, than at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, with reference to the purpoſe and promiſe of God. But if heaven was promiſed on conditions to be performed by man, it could not be ſo; for then there could be no aſſurance of enjoying the happineſs promiſed 'till the conditions are performed; and no
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:007860_0044_102DE993615CB9C8"/>
perſon could be ſure that he ſhould enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of glory 'till he comes there: for as entering into glory would then depend on perſevering in a courſe of ſincere obedience to the end of a man's life, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in holineſs depending on the will of the creature, no perſon could be certain he ſhould endure to the end and ſo be ſaved; the will being fickle and liable to change; and thus a man muſt be all his life-time ſubject to bondage. But bleſſed be God, the promiſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life hangs not upon ſuch a feeble ſtring. 'Tis true, thoſe perſons which enter into glory, are ſuch, and ſuch only, as do perſevere unto the end, <hi>and are faithful unto death;</hi> but their entering into glory doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon this as a condition. I grant, they cannot enter into glory without perſevering to the end, but then that is not condition of it. I aſk, cannot a thing be neceſſary as a <hi>qualification,</hi> and yet not be a condition?</p>
               <p>What is a condition? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> A condition implies a ſtipulation or covenant between two perſons, the one promiſing, the other performing. Or, a condition is the doing ſome work, or ſervice, which hath a promiſe (but not a free one) annexed to the doing of the work; the condition (as to the fulfilling of it) lieth on the doer, and giving the reward on the promiſer; ſo that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is the doing ſome work or ſervice, in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome good, which reward becomes due when the work is done, and not before. Therefore a condition doth not ſuppoſe a proportion between the works and the reward, but always ſuppoſes, that receiving the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward promiſed, depends upon doing; or performing the condition, whatſoever it be, more or leſs, according to the agreement; and is given upon that account, though the full value be not paid down. Therefore, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the condition is not only the way and means
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:007860_0045_102DE9950C586A68"/>
to come at the reward, but it is the purchaſing of it: and to ſay eternal life is promiſed on conditions to be performed by man, is the way to bring man under the covenant of works, God ſtipulating with man, <hi>do this and live;</hi> I promiſe thee life upon theſe conditions.</p>
               <p>It may be thought perhaps by ſome that the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propoſition is true <hi>(viz.)</hi> eternal life is obtained by Chriſt, and promiſed to man on conditions of faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſincere obedience.</p>
               <p>But, in my opinion, this is not true; for as it throws part of the work on the creature, it thereby leſſens, if it does not quite invalidate the performance of Chriſt. For if Chriſt obtained eternal life for all that believe in him, what occaſion is there to hang it upon conditions to be performed by the creature? If the reward be promiſed to man upon conditions of ſomething done to procure it, this muſt ſuppoſe that Chriſt has done but a part, and that the other part belongs to man to do, and upon his doing it the reward is given. Nay, it follows, that what Chriſt hath done is inſufficient, and of no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, without man's part; and how contrary this is to the goſpel, every one I ſhould think muſt ſee, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands what goſpel is.</p>
               <p>Eternal life is promiſed to all that believe in the Son of God, the only mediator and ſaviour of ſinners, and ſhall certainly be given to all ſuch, according to the expreſs word of God.</p>
               <p>But then eternal life is both promiſed and given alone for the ſake of Chriſt, and what he hath done. For, <hi>this is the record, God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Therefore he that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the ſon, hath not life. The promiſe of life is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 John v. 11, 12. 2 Tim. i. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="unknown:007860_0046_102DE996CE8B7320"/>God will give what he hath promiſed, and at the time, and in the way which he hath promiſed: but where hath God promiſed, that if thou believeſt, he will give thee eternal life <hi>for thy believing?</hi> The promiſe is made to <hi>believers,</hi> but not to believing. Therefore if thou believeſt on the Son of God, he will give thee eternal life for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould aſk, where is the difference between promiſing eternal life to the perſon, and to the work, or to the perſon for his work's ſake? I anſwer, there is a great, and very neceſſary difference. For promiſing eternal life to perſons of ſuch characters as believers, upon the conſideration of what another hath done, is very agreeable to, and conſiſtent with <hi>a free promiſe,</hi> or <hi>promiſe of grace:</hi> for, though the promiſe be made to the <hi>believer,</hi> the ground of it lies <hi>in Chriſt, and what he hath done.</hi> But if the promiſe was to run conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, and ſo to reſt upon what the perſon doth himſelf, it could not be of free grace, but of works. <hi>For if the inheritance be of the law</hi> (or works) <hi>it is no more of promiſe,</hi> (i. e. <hi>it is not of free promiſe</hi>) <hi>but God gave it to</hi> Abraham <hi>by promiſe.</hi> If faith, repentance, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere obedience be the terms and conditions of man's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into glory, then heaven muſt be given (in part at leaſt) upon that account: for, if I promiſe a perſon ſuch a reward for doing ſuch a work, I give him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for doing the work; neither do I ſee any way to avoid this, for, if faith, repentance, and ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, be the conditions of life, then heaven is given for the ſake of faith, repentance, and ſincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſo Chriſt is ſhut out; for, it is abſurd, as well as impertinent to ſay, eternal life is given to man for the ſake of Chriſt, and for the ſake of what man doth too. 'Tis written, <hi>The gift of God is eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. vi. 23. Now
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:007860_0047_102DE999A970B038"/>
when it is ſaid, <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> is there any occaſion to add this ſupplement, <hi>through faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſincere obedience?</hi> To ſay that faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſincere obedience, are required as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary qualifications in the ſubjects of ſalvation, is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth; but to ſay they are included in the above paſſage as conditions, is falſe: and whatever any perſon may think, it is plain enough to me, that there is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt diſtinction between theſe terms, <hi>qualification</hi> and <hi>condition,</hi> and that the former only hath place in the matter we are upon. It may be truly ſaid, that faith, and true goſpel-repentance and ſalvation, cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated; and yet, faith and repentance are not conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſalvation. Strange! very ſtrange! that faith and repentance can't be brought in as <hi>qualifications,</hi> without making them <hi>conditions.</hi> Theſe are ways and means which God hath appointed to ſit and prepare perſons for eternal life to ſuch as are poſſeſſed with thoſe qualifications above-named; and they ſhould be put upon ſeeking after faith and repentance, which are the gifts of God, <hi>Acts</hi> v. 31. xi. 18. <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 8. <hi>Phil.</hi> i. 29. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 25.</p>
               <p>And they ſhould not be put upon doing, no, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving neither as a condition of life, for, the difference is not great, between <hi>do and live,</hi> and, <hi>believe and live.</hi> For, believing is an act of the creature (though under the influence of the ſpirit of God) and as ſuch a work.</p>
               <p>The common way of ſtating the caſe is thus—<hi>God doth not now require perfect and ſinleſs obedience of man in order to his entering into life; for Chriſt having by his obedience and death, or, at leaſt by what he hath done, removed the law in its covenant-form, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made way for man's acceptance upon goſpel-ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; life is promiſed not to perfect, but ſincere doing; or,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:007860_0048_102DE99C411469B8"/>
faith, repentance and ſincere obedience, are now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of life, and terms of acceptance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as this way of ſtating the caſe makes eternal life to be of works, and not of grace, it muſt be falſe. <hi>Not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt. Not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done,—by grace we are ſaved.</hi>—For this reaſon therefore it muſt be falſe, being contrary to expreſs teſtimony of holy ſcripture, <hi>Rom</hi> iii. 19, to 29. <hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 9. <hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 5. The diſtinction of perfect and imperfect, or, perfect and ſincere obedience as a condition of life, I find not in the word of God; it cannot be goſpel to ſay eternal life is put upon, not perfect, but ſincere doing, as the condition whereby it muſt be obtained; for where do we find eternal life promiſed to ſincere doings? 'tis promiſed to no doings at all. '<hi>Tis God's free gift, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. vi. 23. Good works are not the way to eternal life; <hi>Chriſt is the way,</hi> the way of acceptance with God, and the way of admiſſion into heaven; good works are found in and done by all that walk in this way (Chriſt) neither is, nor can true faith be without them, when and where there is opportunity to do them, <hi>Jam.</hi> ii. 17, 18, 20. And yet good works will never be the cauſe of bringing any perſon to the kingdom of glory; no, nor are they ſo much as the condition of perſons entering in there.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears, that the hope of eternal life reſteth on the free promiſe of God in Chriſt Jeſus; whereas, was it conditional, then the whole would reſt upon the performance of thoſe conditions from whence it muſt be very uncertain whether any would enjoy it. But when our hope reſteth on the free promiſe of God, nothing more is neceſſary to give a believer a comfortable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of entering into glory, but a ſteady and firm reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:007860_0049_102DE99DEA802C38"/>
on the power and faithfulneſs of the promiſer, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which can ever fail. He is the Almighty, and the faithful God—<hi>In hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, promiſed before the world began. Therefore it is by faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the promiſe might be</hi> ſure <hi>to all the ſeed,</hi> Tit. i. 2. Rom. iv. 16. Behold the foundation eternal life reſteth upon, God's unchangeable and immutable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe! in which reſpect it was prepared, as well as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, before the world began, <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 2. <hi>Matt.</hi> xxv. 34. His abſolute promiſe in Chriſt <hi>Jeſus;</hi> in which reſpect there is nothing to be done by the creature in order to procure it. And this is a notable ground to reſt upon for ſtrong conſolation; and gives the greateſt encouragement to ſenſible ſinners: for why may not I hope for eternal life, if God has convinced me of ſin, and the need of a Saviour, and kindled in my ſoul ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere deſires and longing after Chriſt, and eternal life and happineſs in and through him? and if I am willing to accept of it as his free gift, though I am unworthy of the leaſt of his favours, yet Chriſt is worthy, and upon his account, I, a poor miſerable ſinner, may expect the greateſt favour, eternal life.</p>
               <p>Once more: That eternal life is not conditional, but a free gift, is further evident, if we conſider when the promiſe was made, and to whom it was made perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: we are told, that <hi>the promiſe of eternal life was made before the world began,</hi> Tit i. 2. Now, to whom could this promiſe be made ſo early? to whom but the Son of God in the capacity of a mediator; and who did actually ſtipulate with the father in behalf of his elect people; and to him was the promiſe made, and to him it was conditional. The thing promiſed was eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and it was the elect, true believers that were to enjoy it: but the promiſe being made to the Son of
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:007860_0050_102DE99F9498D3C0"/>
God, as the ſurety of his people, there were certain conditions injoined him, upon the performance of which, eternal life was to be given to the elect, that is, all that believe in him for life and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>For though heaven be the free gift of God, yet the elect are not put into the actual poſſeſſion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom without the conſideration of what Chriſt hath done in their behalf; 'tis by, and through Chriſt, his perfect obedience, and compleat ſatisfaction, which gives the ſaints a right and title to eternal life. <hi>He came that we might have life</hi>—John x. 10. And <hi>it is thoſe that receive abundance of grace, and the gift of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ſhall reign in life by one Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>—The dear redeemer bled and died upon the croſs, he was made ſin and a curſe for his people, that thereby he might deliver them from ſin, the curſe, and wrath of God; and thus <hi>hath he obtained eternal redemption for all them that obey him. And thus doth God, by making this captain of ſalvation perfect through ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bring many ſons to glory: and herein he hath acted as became himſelf;</hi> as a holy and juſt, as well as merciful God, <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 10. and ix. 12.</p>
               <p>We ſhould carefully obſerve the connection there is between the end and the means; for the though nothing is to be done by man as a condition to obtain life, yet there are ways and means appointed by God, for all thoſe to walk in, which travel to eternal glory: and thoſe ways and means leading on to the end, are included in the fundamental decree of election, as may be ſeen in many places of ſcripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii, 29. 30. <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 4. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> ii. 13. So that thoſe things which are requiſite to be found in, and done, by the heirs of ſalvation, are what they are choſen to, and are the fruits and effects of God's everlaſting love, the foundation of all.—And
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:007860_0051_102DE9A25A34D108"/>
in this righteous and gracious decree of election. God hath ſhewn a ſtrict regard to the holineſs of his people, as well as to their happineſs; theſe things, <hi>(viz.)</hi> holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and happineſs, he has joined together, and no man ſhall ever be able to put them aſunder. How lovely, and how beautiful, doth this connection appear in that famous place of Saint <hi>Paul—Rom.</hi> viii. 29. 30, <hi>For whom he did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firſt-born among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called: and whom he he called, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi> To this I ſhall only add that well known and very excellent paſſage, <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 4. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world,</hi> (obſerve) <hi>that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt alſo diſtinguiſh between what is the ground and foundation, or chief cauſe of giving the kingdom to the elect; and the way and means which bring them to the poſſeſſion of it. The ground o giving the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is God's ſovereign good will and pleaſure, and thus it is abſolutely a free gift. <hi>It is your father's good pleaſure to give you the kingdom,</hi> Luke xii. 32. But then, in a ſecondary ſenſe, what Chriſt hath done is the meritorious cauſe of the elect's enjoying the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and then in the next place come in all the ways and means, as preparatory, or, as fitting and preparing them for the actual enjoyment thereof; theſe ways and means are all included in what is called an habitual and actual meetneſs for death and glory. But then thoſe ways, means, and qualifications, are no cauſes nor conditions of entering into the kingdom; they are things neceſſary and beautiful in their place. And here are two dangerous rocks to be avoided, (1) We
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:007860_0052_102DE9A50AB9B270"/>
muſt be careful not to make the ways and means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of ſalvation. (2) We muſt take care no to be regardleſs of, or lightly eſteem the ways and means which God has appointed for us to be found in the uſe of; and ſo preſumptuouſly expect to enter into glory, while we are in the direct road to hell. For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh. And without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God,</hi> Luke iii. 3, 5. Heb. xii. 14. John iii. 3.</p>
               <p>There is not only an expediency, or fitneſs, but an inimitable beauty, in this connection of ways and means with the end. For, as on the one hand, it would mar the grace of God, to give heaven for the ſake of works; ſo, on the other hand, it would reflect on the purity and holineſs of God, to admit (could ſuch a thing be) perſons into heaven without holineſs, or his glorious image delineated in their hearts. As I would therefore caution all to take heed, not to build their hopes and expectations for eternal life on their works, or any thing in them, or done by them; ſo I would likewiſe exhort all perſons to ſearch their hearts, and ſee whether they are poſſeſſed with thoſe qualifications which are inſeparable from the heirs of ſalvation. And according to the advice of an inſpired apoſtle, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your ſelves whether ye be in the faith, prove your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you be reprobates,</hi> 2. Cor. xiii. 5. Look into the bible, ſee and obſerve what was the temper, and what the conduct of thoſe which are gone before to inherit the promiſes. Heaven is a crown, and kingdom; and none will poſſeſs it but ſuch as are obedient ſubjects to Chriſt the king: <hi>as to thoſe that will not have him to reign over them, he will command them to be ſlain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:007860_0053_102DE9A6C1EE5AB0"/>
him. Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God? be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, (ſuch as bear theſe, or any of theſe characters, ſo liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dying) ſhall inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. vi. 9, 10. But, <hi>let the righteous rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great will be their reward in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Matt. v. 12. Which brings me to the</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That as the happineſs of the ſaints is ſecured in ſuch ſafe hands, in the covenant made with God's own dear Son, and reſteth not on ſuch a precarious foundation as the happineſs of man in a ſtate of innocency did; from hence we may conclude, <hi>that the people of God have the higheſt reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice and triumph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With the greateſt pleaſure I congratulate you, O ye ſaints of God, ye redeemed ones, who are working the work of God, labouring in your Lord's vineyard. I know you don't expect to enter into glory without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of heart and life, and yet expect eternal life <hi>as the free gift of God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, though you have loſt that happineſs which was put into the hands of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> you have found a better, a far better happineſs, laid up in the hands of the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> O! ſtupendous wiſdom! to order matters in ſuch a way, that our greateſt loſs, proves our greateſt gain. Glory was never put into the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s hands; but into the hands of the mediator, the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi>—It was well for us that <hi>Adam</hi> was not intruſted with this jewel; for if this had been loſt, then we had loſt all; but this never was, nor ever ſhall be loſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:007860_0054_102DE9A86343A238"/>O believer, live by faith, and under the influence of this bleſſed hope of the glorious goſpel; and ſo live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the world, yea, above frames and duties, on the free and abſolute promiſe of God in Chriſt Jeſus. This jewel, this crown of glory, will not, cannot be loſt; <hi>But it ſhall be given to them, for whom it is prepared of the Father,</hi> Matt. xx. 23. This glorius prize will be forth coming; the promiſe that was made before the world began, ſhall be made good when the world is no more, <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 2.</p>
               <p>This is the principal thing, the moſt material of all, to have eternal happineſs inſured; without this what would health, or wealth, or life ſignify? nay, what would the goſpel and all the bleſſings of it avail, while the crown and kingdom lieth at ſtake? To ſuppoſe man to ſtand as a probationer for eternal life, is to put him into a far worſe ſtate than <hi>Adam</hi> was in, and yet he fell—The free agency of the creature, or what is commonly called free-will, is ſuch a ſtate and condition, that if rightly underſtood cannot (one would think) fail of exciting compaſſion in every breaſt, the conſequence of which muſt be ſtrong deſires, and earneſt prayer to God to be delivered from ſuch a ſtate, a ſtate that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes mankind to the moſt eminent danger every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I deſire to be found in all God's ways, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, <hi>to be holy as the Lord is holy, and to walk even as Chriſt walked.</hi> But I deſire not to be my own keeper, or to have eternal life in my own hand; for this would fill me with ſuch a fear as would intimidate me in my courſe, and ſubject me to a life of bondage; knowing there is ſtill ſin dwelling within and <hi>Satan</hi> ſtanding without: amidſt ſo many ſnares and enemies, what a ſweet relief is it to know that <hi>we are kept by the power of God, through faith unto ſalvation!</hi>
               </p>

What wiſe man would deſire his richeſt jewel with him while travelling in a ſtrange land among thieves and enemies. No, good Lord, I beſeech thee, keep my jewel, my life, my heaven and all in thy cabinet; I tremble at the thoughts of being intruſted with this treaſure!</p>
               <p>Haye we not a precedent before our eyes, in the fall of man, and angels, enough to fill all the ſaints upon earth with tremendous horror, in caſe they ſtood upon no better footing? No, it is our great and unſpeakable mercy, <hi>that we are not our own, but are bought with a price.</hi> Chriſt hath the keeping of us (if we are his) and ours; our perſons, our graces, our heaven, and all are in his hand; and there they are ſafe, and would be ſafe no where elſe, <hi>Luk</hi> xxii 32. <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> X. 27, 28, 29.</p>
               <p>Not only ſalvation itſelf, but the ſecurity thereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our particular notice. O, Sirs, conſider what a ſure footing it is put upon: the happineſs of God's dear people is put upon a better foot and foundation than the happineſs of man was in a ſtate of innocency, or that of angels.

               <p>A child of God hath many things in this life to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and trouble him, but in this he may rejoice always; that he is <hi>built upon a Rock, and the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt him,</hi> Mat. xvi. 18. <hi>My ſheep hear my voice</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and I know them, and they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me.

But when the ſpirit of God is graciouſly pleaſed <hi>to witneſs with my ſpirit, that I am a child of God, an heir of God, and a joint hear with Chriſt;</hi> then I have no ſcruple upon my mind about enjoying the kingdom, but enter into full conſolation. And this is ſo far from weakening the nerves of my obedience, or making me idle in my Lord's vineyard; that 'tis the ſtrongeſt incentive to obedience: and I leave it upon record, as a teſtimony to the divine goodneſs and grace of God, that I am never ſo cheerful, lively, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in ſpirit, as when I attain the greateſt degree of aſſurance; then, O then I rejoice and triumph! when faith looks of thoſe everlaſting ſettlements of the crown and kingdom!

            <head>AN ESSAY ON THE DOCTRINE OF MERIT.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Doctrine of Merit</hi> makes but little noiſe in the world, being generally denied by <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or ſuch as live under that name, except thoſe called <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and every one thinks he can ſee there is no merit in the creature, that ſinful man can merit no good thing at the hand of God. But, it is a queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many that diſclaim merit in words, do not own it in fact, tho' they may not be ſenſible of it themſelves. It may, therefore, be of ſome ſervice to have this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cleared up, that ſo it may appear to every ſerious thinking perſon, that the everlaſting ſalvation of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is not owing to the merit of the creature, but to the grace of God in his dear ſon. Free grace is generally talked of, but too little underſtood; and there is, I am afraid, as much ignorance among people about good works; what they are, and what is their proper place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:007860_0058_102DE9B164B9A450"/>The doctrine that I ſhall fix upon, to try this matter by, will be that of juſtification; I mean, the juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſinner in the ſight of God. And my buſineſs will be, to conſider, whether this be owing to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man, or, to the grace of God.</p>
            <p>And, as nothing is authentic that is not built upon the word of God, I ſhall therefore ground my diſcourſe upon that divine paſſage of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. iv. 4, 5. <hi>Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly; his faith is counted for righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe words I ſhall raiſe two obſervations:</p>
            <p>(I.) That whoſoever worketh, with a view to be juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified thereby in the ſight of God, ſeeks juſtification by merit, or deſert; and not according to the pure grace of God: <hi>Now to him that worketh, is the reward reckoned not of grace, but of debt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(II.) That whoſoever worketh not with ſuch a view, or expectation, to be accepted, or juſtified, in the ſight of God thereby, but by faith depends on God, and expects to be juſtified by and through what Chriſt hath done for him; ſuch an one is juſtified by, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the free grace of God. <hi>But to him that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, but believeth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe obſervations are fully contained in the words:</p>
            <p>—And that the ſubject, the apoſtle treats of, is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is evident from the chapter in general, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly from <hi>verſe</hi> the <hi>ſecond. For if</hi> Abraham <hi>were juſtified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:007860_0059_102DE9B30F2336B0"/>The <hi>firſt</hi> thing to be conſidered is, that whoſoever worketh with a view to be juſtified thereby, in the ſight of God, ſeeketh juſtification by merit, and not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true grace of God. Perhaps it may be thought ſtrange by ſome, that I ſhould uſe the word merit, ſeeing all diſclaim every kind and degree of it, except <hi>Papiſts.</hi> But to this I anſwer, I apprehend the word <hi>merit,</hi> to be of the ſame ſignification with the term <hi>debt,</hi> or <hi>deſert;</hi> and, that this matter may be ſet in a clear light, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, what that merit is, that may be aſcribed to man, or to any rational be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and how far a meer creature may be ſaid to merit: and, I hope, if it can fairly be made to appear, that, to ſeek juſtification by works of our own performing, is ſeeking it by our own merits, perſons will be ſenſible of the folly of ſuch a conduct. Now if any thing be done, by way of condition, as the terms of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, then it is of merit, or deſert. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ſalvation, or, conditional juſtification, cannot exclude merit.</p>
            <p>What is merit? Anſwer; There are two kinds of merit; proper, and improper: proper merit, is called merit of condignity; that is, ſtrict and real merit. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper merit is called merit of paction, that is by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or agreement. Now, as to the firſt, merit of condignity, or ſtrict and real merit; this cannot be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to any meer creature, man, or angel; this would be to ſuppoſe the creature not beholden to it's creator; for merit of condignity, or proper merit, ſuppoſes ſuch worth or deſert, or ſuch dignity and real excellency in the perſon and his work, as the reward may be juſtly claimed upon it; and that the perſon is not at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to him who gives the reward, becauſe 'tis meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:007860_0060_102DE9B62DE10690"/>This is proper merit, which may take place between one man and another, but not between man and his maker: mankind, being equal by nature, may oblige one another; that is, one man may lay another under an obligation to reward him; for, when one man me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits a reward of another, he is not at all obliged to him for the reward; he that gives the reward is as much obliged to him that receives it, for his work, or ſervice, as he that receives the reward is to him that gives it; for he that receives, has merited what he receives; and he that gives, gives but what is the other's due: but this cannot take place between God and a meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the creature being dependent upon the creator, muſt be beholding to him for all it receives, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greateſt obligations to the giver; 'tis impoſſible for the creature to lay the creator under any obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:—all the creature receives muſt be of meer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.—We ſee therefore, merit, ſtrictly ſpeaking, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be aſcribed (not only to man, but not) to any meer creature. None but the Son of God could merit, in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe; neither did he abſolutely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in that ſenſe, as I ſhall ſhew anon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Merit of paction, or by covenant-agreement. In this ſenſe, the word merit is often uſed, though it be improper, at leaſt 'tis not ſtrictly merit; but it will bear the term: in this ſenſe it may take place between God and a meer creature; and there can be no other merit aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to a meer creature; for whatſoever God beſtows on a meer creature, is in a way of favour; and this kind of merit is conſiſtent with the goodneſs and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of God to his creatures, but takes place only with perfect beings; it being not conſiſtent with the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God thus to covenant with a ſinful creature, except it be for bleſſings of a much lower nature, than thoſe that relate to the eternal happineſs of ſinful man;
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:007860_0061_102DE9B84F411720"/>
(<hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as relate to this preſent life) for what the creature merits by compact, or agreement, it doth not ſtrictly deſerve; but yet, 'tis due, by virtue of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-agreement. And hence 'tis clear, as the ſun at noon-day, that juſtification, by our own works, is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication according to merit; 'tis a debt, 'tis a due, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to agreement. For, if God promiſe to juſtify man, on his ſincere obedience, then when he has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that obedience, his juſtification follows as a debt, or merit; for no creature can merit any other way: therefore, if you would diſclaim all merit, you muſt diſclaim conditional juſtification; for, to pretend to diſclaim any other merit is impertinent, becauſe no other merit can be aſcribed to men or angels. To ſay we can merit nothing, that is, ſtrictly deſerve, is nothing to the purpoſe: this is no ways peculiar to us as fallen creatures, but may as well be affirmed of an innocent creature. For <hi>Adam,</hi> in innocency, could merit no other way, but by paction, <hi>i. e.</hi> by covenant-agreement; all that was beſtowed on him, and promiſed to him, was of the meer favour of God. I very much queſtion, whether it be not here that many perſons make the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take: they ſay, they do not pretend to merit; they know they deſerve no favour from the hand of God; but then by merit they mean ſtrict and proper merit; which is out of the queſtion in the preſent caſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe merit, in this ſtrict and proper ſenſe, is excluded from all kind of beings; <hi>i. e.</hi> rational and intelligent creatures, perfect as well as imperfect; whereas, if, at the ſame time that we diſclaim all merit, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for juſtification by works, or conditional ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are contending for all the merit that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to any creature. <hi>Adam</hi> could merit no otherwiſe; God made a covenant with him; promiſed him life up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:007860_0062_102DE9B9F5DEE4C0"/>
conditions of perfect obedience: it was the meer favour of God thus to ſtipulate with man; and had he perſevered in perfect obedience, the time allotted for his probation, he would have merited life; it would have been a debt according to agreement and promiſe. —And, to ſuppoſe God has now eſtabliſhed ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with fallen man, that, on his ſincere obedience, he will receive him into favour, and that his own works ſhall be the terms of his acceptance, is, to ſuppoſe man placed on the ſame footing he was before he fell; the difference is this; innocent man was to merit by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience, but fallen man by an imperfect ſincere one. Therefore, if we are contending for juſtification by our own works, we are ſo far from excluding merit, that we are contending for all the merit that can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to any meer creature.</p>
            <p>For, if God hath ſtipulated with man, promiſing to juſtify, and accept him upon certain conditions perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; then, when theſe conditions are performed, the reward is due; that is, God is under obligation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his promiſe, to juſtify and accept him, upon the terms propoſed. And this is the very thing intended in theſe words, <hi>Now to him that worketh, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward not reckoned of grace, but of debt;</hi> i. e. the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is given him not of meer favour, but of merit, as what is due according to agreement.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if we would be clear in this matter of juſtification (and which doubtleſs, is of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance) we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh between proper and improper merit; and, conſider, that no real merit can be aſcribed to any creature; not only fallen man cannot merit in this ſenſe, but that muſt be the caſe with reſpect to perfect creatures; and that improper merit cannot be aſcribed to fallen man, without bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:007860_0063_102DC714E33D6878"/>
him under a covenant of works; God ſtipulating and promiſing, and man performing certain conditions as the terms of his acceptance; which intirely ſhuts out free grace, according to that divine oracle, <hi>Rom.</hi> xi. 6. <hi>But if it be of works, then is it no more of grace; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe work is no more work.</hi> And, furthermore, that no meer creature can properly merit, is evident; becauſe no meer creature can do more than is its indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible duty to do; and, in order to merit, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt do more than is it's bounden duty to do: hence it is, that none pretend to merit, being ſenſible they cannot do more than 'tis their duty to do: but this regards real merit, which, ſtrictly ſpeaking, we have nothing to do with, as no meer creature can merit in this ſenſe. <hi>Adam</hi> did not, elect angels cannot, and all profeſſed <hi>Chriſtians</hi> diſclaim it, except the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> who, to eſtabliſh the doctrine of merit, croud in their ſuppoſed works of ſupererogation, which is giving, or doing, more than is required; doing more good works than a man is bound by the law of God to do. And, could any meer man do this, he might merit; but this is a meer fiction of the brain.</p>
            <p>Therefore, ſeeing no merit can be aſcribed to man, but that of paction, how plain is it that juſtification, by works, is eſtabliſhing the doctrine of merit; not real and proper merit, but all the merit that can belong to man; whether he be conſidered as innocent and free from ſin, or, as a fallen ſinful creature: for, as all the deſert that can be aſcribed to perfect obedience, muſt take its riſe from the meer favour of God, ſtipulating with the creature, and promiſing ſuch a reward upon ſuch an obedience; ſo all the deſert that can be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to a ſincere imperfect obedience, muſt alſo ariſe from the meer favour of God, thus ſtipulating with man,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:007860_0064_102DE9BFDC0A8338"/>
and promiſing him ſuch a reward upon his perorming ſuch obedience.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould from hence argue, that if it is owing to the meer favour of God, that a ſinner is juſtified by his own ſincere obedience, then what hurt can merit do? I anſwer; The favour of God, in the caſe firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is eaſy to conceive of.—And the ſecond is only a ſuppoſed caſe, at leaſt it appears ſo to me. I do not believe God has made ſuch a covenant with man, as that upon his faith, repentance, and ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, he will juſtify and receive him into favour. However, if ſome will maintain that ſo it is,—and that though it be of works, this cuts not off the favour of God,—I cannot, perhaps, tell what they may mean by the favour of God.—However, in that way of ſtating the caſe, it appears to be very different from the love of God, that is ſo highly celebrated in the goſpel; and which I apprehend is abſolutely free and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional.</p>
            <p>However, let it be obſerved, and which I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain muſt be the caſe, that though it be owing to the meer favour of God to make ſuch a conditional cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as before obſerved, yet the conferring the reward on man, when he has performed the conditions of that covenant, cannot be aſcribed to the meer favour of God, but to the merits of man. And as this merit, or deſert, turns intirely on what the creature doth, ſo man hath a right to plead with God on the foot of his own works: for, if God has promiſed to accept ſincere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as the terms of the ſinners acceptance, then it is ſtrictly juſt to plead upon this footing; though there be a very diſproportion between the works, and the reward, yet when the work is done, the wages is due. Suppoſe you promiſe or agree to give me five
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:007860_0065_102DE9C1F0294CC8"/>
ſhillings, upon condition I will go with you one mile, and I agree to the terms and go; are the five ſhillings due to me, or not? Every one will grant 'tis due, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a fair bargain; it might be a favour in you to make the promiſe, but 'tis a piece of juſtice in you to pay the money; and the plea for it muſt be grounded, not upon your favour, but upon the contract.</p>
            <p>The caſe appears to be plainly this:—If God has made ſuch a covenant with man, that his faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſincere obedience, be the terms of his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then it muſt be of debt, or merit; and, if the favour of God, in making ſuch a conditional grant, is all that is intended by the grace of God in the goſpel, I think it is hardly worth while to keep up the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any longer between works and grace, ſeeing the whole centers at laſt in works; and the grace, that is talked of, is ſo metamorphoſed, that there is great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of miſtaking it for works. Every thing we enjoy is owing to the grace of God, as grace ſtands in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to real merit. But the grace of God in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, is ſomething peculiar, and is to be ſeen or diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no where elſe, but in the perſon of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is the ſum of the goſpel. God's juſtifying a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or the foot of works, and on the foot of grace, are as far aſunder as the eaſt and the weſt.</p>
            <p>It is plain, by the apoſtle, in the words under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that debt and grace are two diſtinct things; and, 'tis no leſs evident, that his deſign is to throw out one, and eſtabliſh the other; and which way can this be done, in caſe we are juſtified by our own works? it muſt then be reckoned not of grace, but of debt. If my own obedience be the matter of my acceptance with God, I aſk again, where is <hi>free grace?</hi> admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it was grace to make ſuch a conditional grant, to
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:007860_0066_102DE9C476A620A8"/>
make ſuch a favourable covenant, of ſuch mild terms, yet I am bold to affirm, there is not a mite of <hi>free grace,</hi> in giving forth the bleſſing of the covenant. And, upon this footing, what little occaſion is there for a mediator between God and man; I ſuppoſe it is ſome way owing to him, that God has made ſuch a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal covenant of ſuch eaſy terms; and this is making as little uſe of him as can be, if any uſe is made of him: this is not to make him the <hi>alpha and omega, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the end, all and in all;</hi> which, to do, is to bring in ſalvation by grace.</p>
            <p>To make <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſole meritorious cauſe of our juſtification and acceptance with God, and good works the fruits and effects of true faith, is ſpeaking the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage peculiar to the covenant of grace; which ſhuts all manner of works out as cauſes, conditions, or means of our juſtification in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>For, for the reward to be reckoned of grace, is for it to be reckoned without the conſideration of any thing done by the creature: <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth</hi>—i. e. To him that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms nothing as a condition of his juſtification, but is willing to receive all as the free gift of God,—<hi>his faith is counted for righteouſneſs.</hi> Faith, itſelf, is not the righteouſneſs; for faith, or believing, ſtands in direct oppoſition to working; whereas believing, as 'tis an act of man, is a work: and then where is the antitheſis? The apoſtle is not diſtinguiſhing between works per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and imperfect: works, as to their nature, kind, or degree, are not the thing in debate; but works and grace are the things in diſpute, and to which of theſe our juſtification is to be aſcribed; and 'tis plain that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is ſet in oppoſition to working, therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be faith itſelf, but what faith was fixt upon; which
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:007860_0067_102DE9C68E05A538"/>
was a righteouſneſs diſtinct from faith, called a <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs imputed without works,</hi> i. e. without any works done by the perſon to whom it is imputed; I ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any works done by the perſon himſelf as the ground of his juſtification. This righteouſneſs is plain enough diſtinguiſhed from faith, called the righteouſneſs of <hi>the faith,</hi> Rom. iv. 6,—11. called alſo, <hi>the righteouſneſs which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all them that believe.</hi> Note, 'tis not inherent in them, but 'tis <hi>unto</hi> and <hi>upon;</hi> obſerve alſo, 'tis a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which cometh <hi>by</hi> believing, <hi>'Tis by faith of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. iii. 22. thus it is a froe gift of meer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or pure grace.</p>
            <p>(II.) The <hi>ſecond</hi> obſervation is, Whoſoever worketh with no ſuch view, or expectation, to be accepted and juſtified thereby in the ſight of God, but by faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on God, expecting to be juſtified by and through what Chriſt hath done for him, ſuch an one is juſtified by, and according to, the free grace of God. <hi>But to him that worketh not, but believeth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To him that worketh not,</hi> that maketh not his works a condition of his juſtification,—for the apoſtle is ſpeaking of the end and view which perſons have in working; he doth not condemn works, but is enquiring after the principle they proceed from,—<hi>but believeth, his faith receiveth a righteouſneſs,</hi> whereby he is juſtified in the ſight of God; ſuch an one is juſtified as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, by the ſame righteouſneſs.—<hi>Now, it was not written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him; but for us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, to whom it ſhall be imputed, if we believe on him that raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed again for our juſtification,</hi> Rom. iv. 23, 24. There is no
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:007860_0068_102DE9C8D4F88F90"/>
merit but the merit of Chriſt, who may be ſaid to merit for us; for as it has been obſerved, that a perſon may merit, he muſt do more than is his bounden duty to do. Now, Chriſt certainly did more than the law could inſiſt upon, more than the law could require of man; his obedience being the obedience of God as well as man, <hi>For the fulneſs of the God-head dwelt in him bodily; And he is the true God;—God over all, bleſſed for ever;</hi> the dignity of his perſon, <hi>being the only begotten Son of God,</hi> together with the perfection of his work, made it an exalted merit; he may be ſaid to deſerve at the hand of God. But then this was alſo by paction; by a compact, or covenant-agreement, between the Father and him, and he is called the ſurety of that covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> vii, 22. and viii. 6.</p>
            <p>Could we conſider what Chriſt did as ſeparate from the covenant, would there have been any merit in it? at leaſt, it could not have been available for us; for Chriſt could not thereby have laid God under any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation; he was at liberty whether he would accept of a ſurety, and what he ſhould do for ſinners.</p>
            <p>So that here the very ſtrictneſs of merit ſeems to be cut off; though, I think, it muſt be granted, there was an inifinite merit of condignity in what Chriſt did; yet we cannot argue the juſtification of a ſinner in the ſight of God barely from thence, without a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the covenant. What he did became available for our juſtification, becauſe it was ſo agreed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them both, that his fulfilling or giving the law its full demands, ſhould anſwer for the juſtification and eternal ſalvation of thoſe for whom it was done.</p>
            <p>And this is a way of juſtification becoming God, as his honour is no ways impaired;—<hi>The law is magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and made honourable;</hi> juſtice is fully ſatisfied,—
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:007860_0069_102DE9CB5146E9A0"/>
               <hi>Mercy and truth are met together, righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other,</hi> Pſal, lxxxv. 10.</p>
            <p>And thus the freedom and ſovereignty of God, are ſecured, in diſpenſing his grace to ſinners; for that he is laid under no obligation by what Chriſt hath done, but what he by covenant brought himſelf under. Had Chriſt, by whad he did, laid God under an obligation to juſtify ſinners, had he done this, I ſay, without any conſideration of a covenant between then, then God could not (in the affair of juſtifying ſinners) act as a ſovereign; for he, being obliged by Chriſt, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily have conferred the grace of juſtification upon ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But the great and bleſſed God is above being obliged; and though what he doth, in juſtifying the ungodly, is infinitely, worthy of himſelf, yet he doth it freely; it was a voluntary, yea ſovereign act, in him, to enter into covenant with his own Son, and juſtify ſinners upon his account.</p>
            <p>Thus, God hath eſtabliſhed juſtification in a way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming himſelf; and it is ſuch a way as is highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable to him, and exceeding delightful to men—<hi>For he is juſt, and the juſtifier of every one that believeth in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. iii. 26.</p>
            <p>Such honour is done to the divine law, as could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been done by the obedience of men, no, nor by all the men upon earth, and angels in heaven. So that there is in Chriſt a double merit; a merit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity, <hi>i. e.</hi> of real worth, and a merit of paction, <hi>i. e.</hi> by covenant-agreement; which, both conſidered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the higheſt of perfection of merit, and far above any meer creature to do. And the juſtification of a ſinner, being in and through the merit of Chriſt, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:007860_0070_102DE9CCF315D5C8"/>
of free grace, according to the holy ſcriptures,—<hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace,</hi> Rom. iii. 24.</p>
            <p>And it muſt be obſerved, that the juſtification of a ſinner, in the ſight of God, (for I ſpeak not of declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juſtification, which is the privilege made known to a believer) is alone by and through what Chriſt hath done; there is nothing that man doth is brought into the account; and thus it is purely of free grace; there being nothing conſidered in the creature, or done by the creature, as the cauſe, condition, or mean thereof; <hi>For, if by grace, then is it more of works,</hi> Rom. xi. 6. Whereas, if any thing done by man was brought into the account of juſtification in the ſight of God, it could not be alone by Chriſt, and of free grace; but, <hi>being juſtified from all things by Chriſt</hi> (excluſive of any thing, and every thing, in, or done by, man) it is entirely of meer favour, owing to the free, rich, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign grace of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Free ſovereign grace, reigning grace is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a poor ſinner's juſtification in the ſight of God. It was pure grace in God to enter into covenant with his own Son; and it was equally the ſame grace in the Son to become the meritorious cauſe of our juſtification. To conſent <hi>To be delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification.</hi> To become <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſs, And, the end of the law for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. iv, 25, and, x. 4. Jer. xxiii. 6. Thus is the mouth of man ſtopp'd for ever, as to any boaſting in himſelf; but faith receiving a righteouſneſs can boaſt and glory in the Lord, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that very excellent paſſage of the bleſſed <hi>Paul.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 30, 31. <hi>As it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid on this ſubject, it is very
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:007860_0071_102DE9CE9DA84518"/>
plain, that to exclude the doctrine of merit, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for juſtification by works, is only caſting away the name, while the thing itſelf remains: Men are, it may be, aſhamed to contend for the doctrine of merit, but at the ſame time will boldly contend for juſtification by their own obedience; which is the doctrine of merit; for there can be no other merit aſcribed to man, than that of paction, or, covenant-agreement. The queſtion then may be, what ſhall we do? ſhall we own and contend for the doctrine of merit, or, ſhall we not? would a creed formed after the following manner me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit eſteem among ſuch as are called proteſtants; <hi>(viz)</hi> "I believe in God the Father, who hath made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional covenant with fallen man, in which is required ſincere obedience as the terms of his acceptance. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, who by his death hath rendered God propitious to ſinners on ſuch eaſy terms as ſincere obedience. Alſo, I believe that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that Chriſt hath done, the whole, as to the issue, is left to reſt on the will of man, to make it effectual, or ineffectual. Finally, I believe that good works are meritorious, or, that by them, according to the goſpel-covenant, the ſinner merits heaven." How ſhocking ſoever this may appear to any man, I am not as yet convinced that it is any way inconſiſtent with juſtification by a man's own work. Indeed good works are not to be caſt out of practical divinity: Good works muſt be done; there is a ſtrict and inſeparable conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between juſtification by grace and the performance of good works, as is abundantly evident from that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous place, <hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Not by works of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt: which he ſhed on us abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,

through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour. That being juſtified by his grace, we ſhould be made heirs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the hope of eternal life. This is a faithful ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and theſe things I will that thou affirm conſtantly, that they which have believed in God, might be careful to maintain good works: theſe things are good and profitable to men.</hi> But what I ſay is, good works have no place in the juſtification of a ſinner before God. And, it deſerves to be conſidered, whether juſtification by Chriſt be not ſpeaking more honourably of God, and propoſing a way much ſafer for men than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? I think 'tis more honourable—it brings more honour unto God; for in what an amiable light doth juſtification by grace, repreſent the bleſſed God. As infinitely ready, or, propenſe in himſelf to juſtify the ungodly; for we are not to ſuppoſe that what Chriſt did brought God into a diſpoſition to acquit a guilty creature; No external motives moved him hereunto: but what Chriſt did made it conſiſtent with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfections of Deity to juſtify ſinners. The love of God to his choſen people is an everlaſting free love: God was, I ſay, ready enough to juſtify; but could not in any other way but this, conſiſtent with his juſtice, holineſs, and truth. But now, <hi>he is juſt, and the juſtifier, of him which believeth in Jeſus,</hi> Rom. iii. 26.</p>
            <p>And this way of juſtification is much ſafer for men; is it not a ſurer foundation to reſt upon, to truſt in a perfect righteouſneſs, which is an abſolute ſecurity from condemnation for ever? Whereas, if it depends upon our own performances, then every time a perſon relapſes into ſin he is brought under condemnation: but this is not the caſe with reference to ſuch as are juſtified by Chriſt; though when ſuch an one falleth into ſin he has
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:007860_0073_102DE9D3F26DA718"/>
cauſe enough to mourn, and be deeply humbled before God; but this don't affect his ſtate as to juſtification; the ſentence being paſſed in heaven will never be recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led—Juſtification is an abiding thing. <hi>There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit. Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that heareth my words, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſſed from death unto life.—I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh.</hi>—Rom. viii. 1. Joh. v. 24. and x. 28. And I muſt affirm, (whatever any perſon may think to the contrary) that this doctrine of juſtification by Chriſt alone, I mean as before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, juſtification in the ſight of God, I treat of no other now; therefore as to what hand the grace of faith may have in the application of this bleſſing, and how far works, as fruits of faith may evidence our juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification before men, I determine not now to conſider. This doctrine, I ſay, of free juſtification by Chriſt alone is a doctrine of godlineſs; and, in my opinion, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail of influencing thoſe that heartily embrace it, to practical godlineſs. Corrupting and denying this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of juſtification, is one chief cauſe of the ſo great abounding of ſin amongſt us; corruption of doctrine produces corruption of manners; communion and cloſe walking with God are the effects of receiving <hi>the truth in the love of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The clearer views I have of this doctrine, and the ſtronger my faith is, the more humble I am, and the more abundantly is my heart drawn forth in unfeigned thankfulneſs, and lively and chearful obedience. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us.</hi>—O what returns ſhall I make for love ſo vaſtly great. I am nothing—Chriſt
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:007860_0074_102DE9D59BBF12B8"/>
is all and in all. In him I am compleat.—And how exceeding lovely and engaging doth he appear, as <hi>the Lord our righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though juſtification, by an imputed righteouſneſs, be a riddle that many cannot unfold, yet certainly—<hi>out of the ſtrong cometh forth ſweetneſs.</hi>—No doctrine ſo ſweet, ſo full of the moſt ſolid joy. Free grace! O de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful theme! with how much pleaſure could I dwell upon the harmonious ſound! my ſoul is almoſt ready to melt within me, in the delightful views of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by free grace! And how am I tranſported at the thoughts of what many of the dear children of God have ſuffered for this precious doctrine. Hark! from the dungeon, how the poor priſoners ſing for joy of heart!—And what their notes?—O 'tis grace! Rich grace! Free grace! Chriſt, none but Chriſt and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!—Salvation alone by Chriſt—O how did the priſons, in perſecuting times, ring with this doctrine!—Look yonder! methinks I ſee a pile of wood lighted up, and cloſe by it ſtand, in appearance, a poor object con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to the flames! ſee how he ſmiles, while death in all its dreadful forms ſtares him in the face, yet hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is in his countenance; Behold the executioners, full of rage and fury, ſtand aſtoniſhed to ſee with what heroick courage and divine pleaſure the poor ſufferer embraces the flames,—counting it all joy. Why ſo? Becauſe <hi>Chriſt is in him the hope of glory.</hi> With a heart, overflowing with joy, he cries, O ſweet <hi>Jeſus!</hi> Lamb of God! my hope, my life, my all! in thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed garment I ſhall appear without ſpot ſoon—and I ſhall ſhine in paradiſe in the ſpotleſs robes of Chriſt's righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Therefore this doctrine I muſt abide by, 'till I can find another that will produce better effects,—cloſer
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:007860_0075_102DE9D743404E50"/>
walking with God, and more joy and peace in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghoſt. And as I do not expect, ſo neither can I deſire, a ſweeter doctrine than this is, a doctrine that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſes the creature to the loweſt, and exalts the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to the higheſt. The chief thing I want, is, to enter further into the knowledge of it, and by faith live more upon it. And I am confidently perſuaded the heavens will ſweetly ring of free juſtification by Chriſt alone; every ſaint, being a miracle of grace, will labour to raiſe his notes to the higheſt key, 'till the glorious manſions reſound with loud hoſannas, all <hi>ſhouting, grace, grace unto it.</hi>
