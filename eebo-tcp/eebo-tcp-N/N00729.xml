            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſeveral Holy <hi>Acts</hi> of the Thrice Holy God, in giving a Sinful man up unto a <hi>Reprobate Mind.</hi> When God <hi>Puniſhes one Sin,</hi> with leaving a man to Another, 'tis by doing that Stupendous Thing, whereof we often Read in His Word; Namely, <hi>The Hardening of the Heart</hi> in ſuch a man.

                  <p>In general; We all Agree with <hi>Auſtin,</hi> That God <hi>Hardens</hi> not the <hi>Heart</hi> of any man, or gives him up to a <hi>Reprobate Mind, Infundendo Maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> or, by Infuſing of <hi>Sin,</hi> into his Heart: but He rather does it, <hi>Non Infundendo Gratiam,</hi> or, by not Infuſing of <hi>Grace.</hi>

After this awful Admonition, I am now to propound unto you, the offer of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt! an offer, which I would preface with the All-Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning Words of <hi>Micajah, Hearken O all ye people every one of you.</hi> Ti's This; <hi>Periſhing Soul! Shall I Reconcile thee to God, and Furniſh thee with Everlaſting Righteouſneſs? And ſhall my Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit now take Poſſeſſion of thee, and Subdue Iniquity in thee &amp;, preſerve thee from Iniquity, and Guide thee by Counſel, and Bring thee to Glory?

of God? If your hearts do not Readily, Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, Sincerely Accept this <hi>Grace</hi> of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, no man can ſay, what <hi>Sin</hi> you may be left unto! There is no <hi>Sin</hi> but what you may be left unto: You have no Aſſurance, but that you ſhall <hi>Sin</hi> Extravagantly, <hi>Sin</hi> Impenitently, yea, <hi>Sin</hi> unpardonably.

               <p>ABout the Year, 1646. here was one <hi>Mary Martin,</hi> whoſe Father going from hence to <hi>England,</hi> Left her in the Houſe of a Married Man, who yet became ſo Enamoured on <hi>her,</hi> that he attempted her Chaſtity.</p>
               <p>Such was her Weakneſs and Folly, that ſhe yielded unto the Temptations of that miſerable man; but yet with ſuch horrible Regret of Mind, that begging of God, for Deliverance from her Temptations, her plea was, <hi>That if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhe were Overtaken again, ſhe would Leave her ſelf unto His Juſtice, to be made a publick Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>I <hi>James Morgan,</hi> being Condemned to Dye, muſt needs own to the glory of God, that He is righteous, and that I have by my ſins, provoked Him to deſtroy me before my time. I have been a great Sinner, guilty of Sabbath-breaking, of Lying, and of Uncleanneſs; but there are eſpecially two Sins whereby I have offended the Great God; one is that Sin of Drunkenneſs, which has cauſed me to commit many other Sins; for when in Drink, I have been often guilty of Curſing and Swearing, and quarrelling, and ſtriking others: But the Sin which lies moſt heavy upon my Conſcience, is, that I have deſpiſed the Word of God, and many a time refuſed to hear it preached. For theſe things, I believe God has left me to that, which has brought me to a ſhameful and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable death. I do therefore beſeech and warn all perſons, young men eſpecially, to take heed of theſe Sins, leſt they provoke, the Lord to do to them as He has juſtly done by me. And for the further peace of my own Conſcience, I think my ſelf obliged to add this unto, my foregoing Confeſſion, That <hi>I own the Sentence</hi> which the Honoured Court has <hi>paſs'd upon me,</hi> to be exceeding juſt; inaſmuch as
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:000877_0073_0FAC95792AB2BD88"/>
