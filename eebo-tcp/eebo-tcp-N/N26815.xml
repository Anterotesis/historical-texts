            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE Author's Dedication. TO MY FRIEND CHARLES GEORGE GRAUMANN, ST. PETERSBURGH.</head>
            <p>"OLD love ruſts not," ſays our German adage, and, like many others, it is falſe; for a thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and times in my life have I ſeen old love ruſt, nay, ruſt, and ſo completely moulder away, that not the leaſt memory of the fondeſt and moſt endearing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections ſeemed to remain.</p>
            <p>Let us my dear GRAUMANN, ſubſtitute friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for love, and ſay, "Old friendſhip ruſts not." With grateful heart, then, I can raiſe my eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and exclaim, "The adage is true!"</p>
            <p>My faithful, my generous friend for eighteen years, far diſtant removed as ſometimes lay the paths we have purſued in the journey through life, we have never forgotten to cheriſh our acquaintance with kind remembrances. Allow me, then, to indulge the delightful hope, that in thoſe regions to which death is our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon guide, and where, by various caurſes, our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings muſt all terminate at laſt, you will offer the ſame generous hand to the mature old man, which you gave to the riſing youth.</p>
            <p>The child of my fancy, which I now preſent to you, deign to receive with that indulgence, with which, eighteen years ago, you condeſcended to liſten to the firſt prattle of my nurſe. Whatever faults you may diſcover in it, think ſtill that it is my child, and, for the father's ſake, you will not caſt it from you!</p>

            <head>MY LITERARY LIFE.<note n="*" place="bottom">The following account of the Literary Life of Kotzebue is written by himſelf. Sill preſerving the narrative in the Author's own words, the tranſlator has omitted many things which, to the Engliſh reader, would have been unintereſting, and which would have extended this article to an exceſſive length.</note>
            </head>
            <p>AS an author, I have experienced both good and bad ſucceſs, both in a high degree, both fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently unmerited. I flatter myſelf that it may be uſeful to young men deſirous of entering upon the ſlippery career of literature, to read the hiſtory of a man, who has not reached the goal indeed— for how few ever do reach it!—but who has ſo far advanced before them in the progreſs towards it; one who, without ceremony, joins their circle, and relates without diſguiſe when he fell, when he erred, and when he was deceived; where he enjoyed the aſſiſtance of the Nine, and where he miſtook the ravings of a Bacchante for the inſpiration of the Muſe.</p>
            <p>Come hither, then, ye inexperienced youths, who have, for the firſt time, dipped the tip of your tongue in the honey of Parnaſſus, and think it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable becauſe it is ſweet; ſit down and liſten to me. You ſee I am in the vein; my ſoul is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and my lips are opened to confeſs with candour when I have been deluded by vanity, and when my mind has been warmed with the feelings of the true and the beautiful.</p>
            <p>Riſe then! riſe before me, ye fairy phantoms of my happy childhood! In remembrance you now ſcarce form a part of the being I now am! Riſe and hover round me, ye gentle ſhades!—Gracious Providence! ſuffer once more thoſe delightful hours to riſe out of the ocean of the paſt, like a dim miſt before my fancy!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:035693_0004_10064C59D256FDF8"/>Seize then the fleeting ſhades as they paſs!— Seeſt thou there that boy who hangs with rapt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention on his mother's tongue, as ſhe reads to him and his ſiſter ſome winter evening the intereſting tale?—That boy was yourſelf!—Seeſt thou again how he makes the chair his table, and the footſtool his chair? See how he devours the romance, while ball and playthings lie neglected in the corner!— That boy was yourſelf!</p>
            <p>My honoured mother—Heaven be praiſed ſhe ſtill lives, ſhe hears my grateful acknowledgments— My good mother, when but a very young widow, denied herſelf many of the pleaſures and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life to devote herſelf entirely to the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of her children. She poſſeſſed taſte, reading, ſenſibility, and a rich portion of patient maternal affection. With theſe qualities, her efforts could not be wholly unſucceſsful She provided precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of different kinds, but to her own diſcernment and taſte I owe more than to the tutors to whoſe care my inſtruction was confided.</p>
            <p>In the evening I uſed to read to her in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. The firſt book that made a lively impreſſion on me was a Collection of Tales ſelected from all languages, then in great repute; the next was Don Quixote; Robinſon Cruſoe then engroſſed my fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and I wiſhed myſelf the poſſeſſor of ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart Iſland.</p>
            <p>Even in my ſixth year I began to compoſe rude eſſays in verſe; not long after I made my firſt dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic effort. I made a comedy, which was juſt the length of an octavo page. I was ſenſible, indeed, that it ought to be much longer, in order to reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a comedy; but who was to teach me the art of ſpinning out the thread, and expanding my mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials?</p>
            <p>I now come to that incident of my life, which, in its conſequences, produced the greateſt influence on my character, and from my tendereſt childhood
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:035693_0005_10064C5B5E052A58"/>
irrevocably deſtined me to be a dramatic writer. The late Abt, the player, came with his ſtrolling company to Weimar. Since I poſſeſſed any power of thought, there had been no players in Weimar, and my curioſity was unbounded. Muſaeus, the amiable and excellent Muſaeus, who was attached to me from a child, offered to take me to the theatre.</p>
            <p>I went with a kind of reverential awe; my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation was wound up to the higheſt pitch. The piece was Klopſtock's death of Adam. Muſaeus placed me before him on a bench, that I might ſee over the heads of the ſpectators. The curtain drew up. I was all ear, all eye. Not a word, not a movement eſcaped me. Never had I before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſuch powerful impreſſions. I returned home enchanted. Robinſon Cruſoe and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart iſland diſappeared. The theatre now engroſſed my whole ſoul.</p>
            <p>My joy, therefore, was unbounded, when the Ducheſs Amelia, that favourite of the Muſes, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed a theatre at Weimar. Several of the moſt celebrated performers of the time came there, and among others, the admirable Eckhof. I never omitted any opportunity of going to the play, and I wondered that thoſe who could do what they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, could prefer any other ſpecies of entertainment. As a proof of my attention, I could repeat the whole of Leſſing's Emilia Galotti without ever having had the book in my hand. To the honour of the faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble world at Weimar, I muſt confeſs indeed that Emilia Galotti was very often performed, and always to full houſes.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile I was a pupil of Muſaeus in the Gymna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Weimar. Among other things, we had every Saturday an hour dedicated to the reading of little poetical attempts. At this period the rage for ballets was at its height, and the magazines ſwarmed with terrific ſtories of chivalry and ghoſts. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:035693_0006_10064C5D755503E0"/>
a ballet in the taſte of the times. It contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abundance of murder and ghoſts; a Spirit read a lecture on vice, and the ſinner was at length car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by the Devil.</p>
            <p>I read this performance the firſt Saturday after it was ready; and judge my raptures when after it was finiſhed, Muſaeus pronounced thoſe words which I ſhall never forget: "Well, very well! From what magazine have you taken this?" With what tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph did I reply, that it was my own compoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Really!" anſwered Muſaeus: "Bravo! go on." Nothing could exceed my tranſports at this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyric, and my poetic propenſity was confirmed.</p>
            <p>At this time of life every thing is imitation, and I am convinced that there is not a ſingle origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal idea in a man's head till he is of an age to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate his ſpecies. Every thing I now made was only an imitation of the book I had laſt read. I wrote a comedy called All's Well that Ends Well, which I believe had a ſtrong reſemblance to the Count of Ol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bach. Goethe uſed to viſit in our houſe; he heard of my comedy, and was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending, or ſo polite, as to aſk a reading of it. By this wiſh he highly gratified my mother; and this probably was his object, for I never heard more of the comedy. This able man, however, in my boyiſh days always treated me with great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>In my ſixteenth year I went to Iena. At firſt my attention was principally directed to the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the dead and living languages, and in both theſe my knowledge was conſiderably increaſed. At Iena my partiality for the ſtage ſtill continued. Before my arrival, there was a private theatre eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed among the ſtudents, and it was one of my firſt objects to be admitted into the aſſociation. As it is not cuſtomary for ladies to appear in ſuch theatres, on account of my youth female characters of the younger ſort were often aſſigned to me. My
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:035693_0007_10064C60B0839DE0"/>
propenſity for rhyming likewiſe continued, and I produced a number of poetic trifles.</p>
            <p>In my eighteenth year I undertook to write a Romance, which I finiſhed. It conſiſted of eight or ten ſheets, and, in my own opinion at the time, was nothing inferior to Goethe's Werter. The ſtory indeed was much more terrific; for my hero pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated himſelf from the top of a high rock, and was daſhed to pieces. This performance I ſent to the Weygand, then publiſher of moſt faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble romances at Leipzie. After waiting ſome time, however, I had the mortification to receive an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from him, in which he told me that the manuſcript was at my ſervice, and deſired me to order payment of the poſtage of it! I never, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, inquired after it.</p>
            <p>In the year 1779 I returned to Iena from the viſit I had paid to my ſiſter then lately married, and applied with conſiderable zeal to the ſtudy of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence. I likewiſe attended the profeſſors of hiſtory, logic, and metaphyſics, and continued to improve myſelf in modern languages.</p>
            <p>I this year produced a tragedy called Charlotte Trank, which was performed at our private theatre, and I myſelf enacted one of the principal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. The reception of it, however, was rather cold. Soon after I wrote a comedy, which was much better received, and, as far as I recollect, containing ſome tolerable comic touches. I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inſtituted a poetic club, from which I derived conſiderable improvement.</p>
            <p>In my nineteenth year I returned to Weimar, and ſtudied the Pandects with great induſtry; was examined by the Government, and admitted Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate. While I waited for clients, I myſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a zealous client of the Muſes. The ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer after my return I wrote ſeveral little things, which I am not now ambitious to recall into notice. I likewiſe wrote ſome Tales, which were publiſhed
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:035693_0008_10064C658D72DB18"/>
with my name by Dyk, at Leipzic, with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty pages by ſome other hand. Several little dramatic pieces were likewiſe the produce of my partiality for the theatre.</p>
            <p>In 1781 I went to Peterſburgh. For ſome time I repreſſed my turn for poetic purſuits, but I again began occaſionally to indulge my ruling propenſity. There was a German theatre at Peterſburgh. It was then in a very indifferent ſtate; but ſoon after it was put in the number of the royal theatres, and the direction of it given to my friend General Bawr, of the artillery, a German. I now again found myſelf in my element.</p>
            <p>I wrote a tragedy in five acts, called Demetrius Czar of Moſcow. By a whimſical circumſtance the repreſentation of this piece was nearly prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In the hiſtory Demetrius was by many call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an impoſtor. In my play I found it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to make him an hero. It turned out, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that there was an old proclamation of Peter the Great, in which this ſame Demetrius was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be an impoſtor. With much difficulty, however, the piece was allowed to be performed; after I had in a very formal manner been made to declare that I was perfectly ſatisfied of the impoſture of Demetrius, and the juſtice of the proclamation, and that the freedom which I had uſed in my play was merely a <hi>licentia poetica.</hi> I likewiſe wrote a comedy, called The Nun and the Chambermaid, which was performed with great ſucceſs. It was never publiſhed, and the copy of it was accidentally left.</p>
            <p>In the year 1782, ſome of my friends who had influence at court propoſed to procure me a place, and to facilitate their exertions I was requeſted to write a ſmall volume of Tales and Fables for young Princes, to be dedicated to the young Grand Duke. Though I felt no great call for ſuch a taſk, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied;
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:035693_0009_10064C67182C7A00"/>
and the volume was printed in a moſt ſuperb manner by the direction of one of my friends. Finding, however, that I was not qualified for this kind of writing, I reſolved, after the work had proceeded a conſiderable length, to repay the publiſher for his expence, and to bury the four ſheets which were finiſhed in eternal oblivion.</p>
            <p>Ye who ſo often and ſo loudly accuſe me of vanity, to my Fables I appeal as the proof of your falſehood! Their ſuppreſſion coſt me ſome hundred rubles, but my vanity not a ſigh.</p>
            <p>I now come to the period when I went to reſide at Revel. Soon after this I wrote two plays, The Hermit of Formentera, and Adelaide of Wulfingen. The former was performed at a private theatre, and my propenſity for the ſtage revived. To this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity the people of Revel are indebted for a theatre, which for the laſt ten years has had an excellent company, and can boaſt of performers of no common merit. It was opened with a piece of mine, called Every Fool has his Cap. The piece bore a ſtriking reſemblance to Moliere's Miſer, and I have buried it among my papers.</p>
            <p>In autumn, 1787, I was ſeized with a ſevere illneſs, which for ſeveral years reduced me to a ſtate between life and death; or, what is worſe than death, a ſtate of gloomy dejection of ſpirits. In the very height of this malady I wrote Miſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy and Repentance, <note n="*" place="bottom">The Stranger.</note> and ſoon after The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in England. Both of them were finiſhed within about eight or nine weeks. Never in my life, either before or ſince, did I feel ſuch copiouſneſs of ideas, ſuch vigour of imagination, ſuch fertility of diction; and I believe it to be undeniable that there are ſome kinds of maladies (among which may particularly be included thoſe which increaſe the
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:035693_0010_10064C68A1A334C0"/>
irritability of the nerves) which elevate the powers of the mind to an unuſual height; juſt as, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtory, a diſeaſed muſcle forms a pearl.</p>
            <p>In the year 1790 I wrote The Virgin of the Sun, The Child of Love, <note n="*" place="bottom">Lover's Vows.</note> and Brother Montz the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouriſt. I likewiſe proceeded in the collection of my ſmaller works.</p>
            <p>Upon Miſanthrophy and Repentance many fooliſh things were ſaid and written at the time. Among other things, it was objected that it was defective in poetic juſtice, becauſe, by an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional forgiveneſs, I had reſtored the criminal to the enjoyment of all the pleaſures of life. Whether any forgiveneſs could completely remove the cruel puniſhment which her crime carried with it; whether ſuch a woman as Eulalia, <note n="†" place="bottom">Called Adelaide, or Mrs. Haller, in the play as performed here.</note> with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſo awakened, could ever again be happy, are queſtions which nobody thought it worth while to aſk, except Mr. Ziegler, who, however, took up the whole affair erroneouſly, and by the unjuſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble freedom of calling Eulalia's ſeducer from the dead, completely changed the nature of the caſe. I therefore wrote The Noble Lie, in which, although certainly there appears a young lady fallen from virtue, a circumſtance on which the impure imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Reviewers continues to dwell, unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably prevails the pureſt moral that ever was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated from the pulpit or the ſtage.</p>
            <p>In 1790, I experienced one of the ſevereſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Providence in the death of an amiable wife. Grief for this loſs drove me to Paris, and the account of this excurſion I publiſhed under the title of The Flight to Paris, This book was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſeverely attacked by ſome critics.</p>
            <p>Full of indignation againſt the Pariſians, of whoſe exceſſes I had been an eye-witneſs, on my return
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:035693_0011_10064C6A2C35AC38"/>
to Mentz I wrote The Female Jacobin Club, a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rce not without ſome humour. My friend Huber, however, becauſe he happened to be of a different political creed from me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell ſoul of it in the moſt violent manner. Nevertheleſs, however, deſpotiſm is to me as hateful as to him, and this I teſtified ſoon after in my Philoſophical Sketch of Louis XIV. My publiſher at Straſburgh ſent me the work in manuſcript, and the correſpondence which I had with him on the ſubject was broken open before it reached me. I complained to our miniſter at Frankfort on the ſubject, who took my ſide; but it was alleged at Mentz that the letters were open before they arrived there, and I never was able to learn who it really was who did me the honour to miſtake me for a ſpy, or a red-capped Jacobin. It ſeems to be my fate, that while Mr. Huber and Co. exclaim againſt me as an advocate of deſpotiſm, the deſpots around conſider me as a dangerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrat, worthy of their moſt jealous attention. I could give ſignal examples of this, if a man were at liberty to tell all he could.</p>
            <p>Once in my life I had the weakneſs to write a book in complaiſance to another. It was the book on Nobility. I could ſay a great deal on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but I am not at liberty to do it If the world knew—and perhaps they may one day know—into what equivocal reputation of a certain kind I have been thrown by the opinions, which both before and ſince I have expreſſed, and which have been ſo egregiouſly miſrepreſented; if they know how my moſt confidential private correſpondence was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt me; if they knew what inducements I had, and from whom they proceeded, they would decide upon that production upon quite different grounds; they would take into view not only the author, but the citizen and the father. I confeſs, however, that my inconſiderate complaiſance laid
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:035693_0012_10064C6E13846620"/>
me open in ſeveral points to the attacks of criticiſm; but for attack from thoſe with whom I had lived in habits of friendſhip, I was not prepared.</p>
            <p>All that I have written ſince has been received by the public with approbation, and by the critics announced without approbation. Theſe are, Count Benyowſky, The Death of Rolla, The Youngeſt Children of my Fancy, <note n="*" place="bottom">Under this general title the following Novel was firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</note> Poverty and Honour, The Man of Forty Years, The Negro Slave, The Chace, The Count of Burgundy, The Defamers, Falſe Shame, and La Peyrouſe.</p>
            <p>Many of my plays have had the good fortune to be tranſlated into French, Dutch, Daniſh, Poliſh, Ruſſian, Italian: <note place="bottom">

            <p>Is it not matter of ſurpriſe, that at the ſame time, and in ſo many countries, the Public ſhould every where have judged wrong, and approved of things upon which the Reviews had pronounced irrevocable ſentence of condemnation?—The inveſtigation of that phenomenon, however, I muſt reſerve for the continuation of this article on ſome other occaſion.</p>
            <p>What may follow I muſt beg to be conſidered as the defence of a man accuſed; for the critics have to often charged me at the bar of their judges and mine, the Public, that it would ſeem a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for that tribunal never to take the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WILLIAM ſat by the ſide of a brook under an alder tree. He had juſt ſlipped the bark from a willow branch, and formed it into a ruſtic flute. He ſat and drew from his artleſs inſtrument ſimple, plaintive melodies; and now and then he would gaze upon the brook that babbled by, and weep bitterly. A few ſteps from the banks of the rivulet lay his hat, and in the hat a piece of bread. The linnets and goldfinches hopped from twig to twig, approaching nearer and nearer, till at laſt they had the boldneſs to peek the crumbs out of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t. William viewed them with a melancholy
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035693_0014_10064C719B1C0488"/>
ſmile, and ſtruggled to ſuppreſs his ſobs that he might not diſturb the little gueſts.</p>
               <p>"Why do you weep, my boy?" ſuddenly cried a rough voice behind him.</p>
               <p>"Why do you weep, my boy?" repeated a ſweet tender echo. William ſtarted, and bluſhed as if he had been caught in ſome criminal act. Mankind are aſhamed of a gift which teſtifies their noble origin. We are aſhamed to ſhed tears. Nobody chooſes it ſhould appear that he has been weeping. We pull out our handkerchiefs, and preſs them to our red eyes, to wipe away the laſt traces of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
               <p>William had not time to dry up the large drops which trickled over his ſun-burnt cheeks. With his fine black eyes he gazed at the ſtrangers from whom the queſtion proceeded. Before him ſtood a corpulent man, dreſſed in a cloſe dark blue coat and a bob wig. In his right hand, which diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no common ſize, he carried a long Spaniſh cane with a golden head, and in the left he led a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful girl of eleven years of age, on whoſe roſy cheeks the evening ſun played through the trees, while the gentle zephyr wantoned in her fair flowing locks.</p>
               <p>"Why do you weep, my boy?" repeated this benignant creature, and dropped a tear on the bunch of May-flowers which ſhe had newly plucked.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Miſs!" ſaid William, as he roſe from the ground where he ſat, "I weep becauſe I know not what in the world will become of me."</p>

now he has kept me at ſchool. I can read and write, and alſo conſtrue <hi>Cornelius Nepos.</hi> Times, however, are at preſent very hard. My father ſays he cannot any longer afford to ſupport me at ſchool; that I muſt turn porter, and earn my bread.</p>

                  <p>William ſtared at the corpulent man; in his fine eyes it was eaſy to read—"I do not underſtand you."</p>

                  <speaker>CORPULENT MAN.</speaker>

                  <speaker>WILLIAM.</speaker>
                  <p>—I am extremely willing to work, but then I ſhould forget all I have learnt at ſchool. I uſed always to think with myſelf that I ought to be diligent and attentive, for it was poſſible that I too might one day come to be a ſchoolmaſter, and be able to provide for my old father when is no longer able to carry burdens.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>"Give him ſomething, father!" liſped the little Miſs as ſhe clung round the corpulent man, and looked up to him with eager, ſparkling eyes. When ſhe found that her father did not immediately an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſhe added, in querulous accents, "This too, is my birth-day, and you have yet made me no preſent."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:035693_0016_10064C77BA2DFF48"/>The good old man was touched; with a compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſmile he chucked her tenderly under the chin, and ſaid to William, "Dry up your tears, my boy; I will pay the expence of your education at ſchool. Come to-morrow morning early with your father to my houſe, and we will talk farther upon the buſineſs."</p>
               <p>William haſtily ſeized the corpulent man's right hand, and bathed it with his tears; the little girl kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the left; the old man was affected. William gave his flute to the little girl. She accepted it, kindly nodded her head, and in return gave him the bunch of May-flowers. Not a word paſſed between them; but the young Miſs viewed the flute with compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and William preſſed the May-flowers to his heart.</p>
               <p>"Farewell till to-morrow!" ſaid the corpulent man as he went away, and the little girl tripped gaily by his ſide through the willows. William followed her with his eyes. She frequently looked behind, and every time with a kindly nod, till a hillock concealed the lovely angel from his view. William took up his hat, crumbled the piece of bread, and ſcattered it on the graſs for the linnets and goldfinches. He then ſtuck the bunch of May-flowers in his hat with more pride than a young cornet his firſt cockade, and went home in the higheſt ſpirits.</p>

               <head>CHAP II. THE FIRST VISIT.</head>
               <p>HE that goes to bed with his head full of the idea that to-morrow he has ſomething of great importance before him, commonly awakes betimes. Scarce was it day-break, when William ſtood before a ſhattered looking-glaſs to prepare for his viſit. He powdered his hair, and ſpared no pains to deck out his locks in the neateſt ſtyle. A roſe-coloured coat, of pretty fine ſtuff, but now worn thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare, which three years before had been purchaſed from an old-clothes-man, and conſequently now much too ſhort at all points, this day received a new decoration from the half-faded bunch of May-flowers, which William had faſtened upon his breaſt with two large corking pins.</p>
               <p>Old John Meadows ſpread a towel upon his ſhoulders, and pulled the braſs comb at leaſt twenty times through his cloſe-cropped hair. From the cheſt, which he ever kept locked with religious care, he drew out his Sunday's coat of dark blue cloth, and his ſcarlet waiſtcoat. It was trimmed ſuperbly from the ſhoulders down to his thighs; his clean ſhirt was moſt carefully plaited, and diſplayed innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable folds. A dark cane with an ivory head waved in his hand by a leathern thong, and a hat with three huge cocks covered his head.</p>
               <p>Thus proudly arrayed, they bent their way to the houſe of the corpulent man; and as they paced along, old John Meadows thanked God in ſilence, who had inſpired the heart of a heretic to aſſiſt William honorably through the world.</p>

               <p>Yes, courteous proteſtant reader! yet was he no political, but only a theological heretic; and at this time of day ſuch a thing has ceaſed to be a crime.

               <p>Mr. Jerome, whom the inhabitants of the little country town of L * * *, by an eaſy corruption, uſed to call <hi>Skrum,</hi> was a French emigrant—driven from his native land, however, neither by the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the edict of Nantes, nor by the violence of the National Convention. He had left the country of his anceſtors in purſuit of fortune, becauſe ſhe had not chanced to viſit him at home. He was a ſtaunch, thorough Roman catholic; by trade a ſtocking-manufacturer, a calling he had exerciſed for twenty years, during which he had been ſettled in Germany. Here by a pair of fine eyes his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was ſo overcome, that he was fain to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate it to the wiſhes of his heart, as he faſhioned his ſtockings to anſwer every ſize of foot, great or ſmall. In other words, he had ventured to marry a proteſtant heretic, who, however, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her miſbelief, died in childbed a year after their union, leaving him an only daughter, who was called <hi>Jeanette</hi> by her father, and <hi>Jenny</hi> by the reſt of the family.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:035693_0019_10064C7C92BD93B0"/>Mr. Jerome was corpulent; but when a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fellow-creature laid his hand on Mr. Jerome's breaſt, he felt his heart beat loud and kindly enough. He was of a cheerful diſpoſition; well he loved a laugh, heartily enjoyed a glaſs of Burgundy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the ſocial circle, but moſt of all when his morning had been employed in performing a kind and beneficent action. Benevolence, indeed, is the parent of gaiety, and the cheerful man is ever more ready than the gloomy and moroſe to draw his purſe to relieve a brother.</p>
               <p>The doors inſtantly fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Jerome was ſmoking a pipe of tobacco, and Jeanette was ſoaking a roll in tea: beſide her cup lay the flute. She nodded benignantly to the giver, who returned her ſalutation with awkward bows, and bluſhed till his cheeks vied in colour with his father's waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat. She looked at the flute, and then at William, as if ſhe meant to ſay, "Do you ſee how much I value your preſent?" William ſtood with down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt eyes, and played with the May-flowers, as if he would have anſwered—"Nor is yours leſs dear to me."</p>
               <p>John Meadows broke ſilence. He ſpoke at great length of the Chriſtian temper, and of God's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. He even ventured to maintain, that the man who protected and ſupported the poor orphan might, in ſpite of his corrupted faith, be placed among the ſheep on the right hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jerome ſmiled with much good-nature, and glanced at his tobacco ſmoke as it rolled up in ſpreading volumes, as if he would have ſaid, <hi>ſmoke</hi> or <hi>cloud,</hi> it is all one in the end.</p>
               <p>"I ſhall be very happy," ſaid he with a gentle inclination of the head, "if the young lad continues to be diligent and well-behaved. I will pay the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his education at ſchool, and take care like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

that he ſhall not want any thing neceſſary to his progreſs. Let him attend the precentor of the pariſh church two hours a week to learn to ſing, as I underſtand he has a mind to be a ſchool-maſter. He may come here every day, and dine with the ſuperintendant of my manufactory upon what Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is pleaſed to beſtow. I ſhall then have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of hearing what progreſs he makes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu! the table is always covered at two o'clock."</p>
               <p>"Now, William, mind what you are about!" muttered his father, pinching his ſon's arm! "go and kiſs this worthy gentleman's hand!"</p>
               <p>Heaven knows from what feeling it proceeded, but William baſhfully walked up with trembling ſteps to the tea-table, and kiſſed Jeanette's hand. Jeanette bluſhed as red as ſcarlet. John Meadows ſaid: Blockhead! and Mr. Jerome laughed. "Be not diſpleaſed, good John! The lad has done quite right, ſince what I now do to aſſiſt him he owes ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally to my daughter."</p>
               <p>With many bows which no dancing-maſter would have endured, and many cordial bleſſings which God and the worthy old man's heart accepted, the happy pair took their leave. William, at firſt, in compliance with the dictates of politeneſs, was about to withdraw to the door, carefully obſerving always to preſent his face to the company. Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, however, whiſpered him to turn round, that the pretty little girl might have an opportunity of ſeeing his finely dreſſed and powdered hair. He wheeled abruptly round therefore, and with head erect he marched out of the room.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. THE PEAR-TREE.</head>
               <p>WILLIAM continued to advance in ſtature; he learnt to write, to read, to caſt accounts, to ſing, and had Luther's ſmaller catechiſm at his finger's ends. Jeanette likewiſe improved in ſize, and learnt even more than William. When they were together, however, they were wont to forget what they had learnt. William dined every day with Mr. Jerome's overſeers. Frequently upon Sundays he was invited to his benefactor's table, as he was a well bred, modeſt lad. On theſe occaſions he never forget to drink the healths of the whole company, and generally had the misfortune to ſpill a few drops of wine on the table-cloth, becauſe, in making the circuit of the gueſts, his hand trembled whenever his eye lighted on Jeanette.</p>
               <p>Every year William celebrated Mr. Jerome's birth-day in a poem in <hi>Ale andrines,</hi> a yard long, elegantly tranſcribed upon royal paper, ſtitched up in morocco with blue ſilk. Jeanette's birth-day was likewiſe ſung with equal honor, but in <hi>dactyls</hi>; and inſtead of blue ſilk, the binding was ornament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with purple red. The father, on theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, rewarded him with a guinea, and the daughter with a kind glance. The guinea dropped into his pocket, the glance went to his heart. The guinea he uſually carried to his father, and not a halfpenny did he retain for himſelf; the glance he would not have ſhared either with father or mother. He felt ſomething like the ſame ſenſation as the young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of London when they aſcend Dr. Graham's celeſtial bed.</p>

Neither did Jeanette know why at noon, juſt at the time when William came to dinner, ſhe was ſure to ſeat herſelf at the door. As little did ſhe reflect why upon Sundays, in helping about the ſoup, ſhe never failed to give William the largeſt ſhare of the <hi>bouilli.</hi> It proceeded doubtleſs from this cauſe, that, without our ever ſuſpecting it, in the firſt part of our life we are ripening for love, as in the latter part of it we are ripening for death. Love and death have many things in common. No mortal can defy their power. Both come upon us by ſurpriſe, like a thief in the night; both tranſport us in Elyſium. A dying man and a lover reſemble each other in this too, that the ſpectators generally diſcover before the perſon himſelf, what is his real ſituation. Fortunately this was not the caſe with William and Jeanette. Mr. Jerome never dreamt that Jeanette could ever forget in the amiable youth, poor William the porter's ſon; or that William would ever aſpire to the daughter of a manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. He did not conſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>One harveſt day Jeanette happened to long for a pear, which hung deliciouſly tempting on the top of a branch. William inſtantly proceeded to climb the tree. The wiſh to gratify her was combined with the little vanity of ſhowing with what ſpeed and adroitneſs he could mount the higheſt tree; for it is a delightful ſenſation to extort admiration from thoſe we love. He ſoon aſcended the trunk, and lightly ſwung from branch to branch.</p>
               <p>"William! William! you will fall," cried the old man from the bower. "There is no danger," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned William careleſsly, and ſtretched out his hand to ſeize the tempting fruit. As his arm, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was too ſhort, in leaning forwards he loſt his balance, tumbled, graſped a rotten branch; the branch broke, and William fell to the ground like a piece of lead.</p>
               <p>Jeanette ſcreamed. "There it is!" cried the old man, and waddled up in all haſte quite breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. In the fall the ſplinter of the branch tore the thoughtleſs boy's temple. "William!" cried Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette with trembling voice; "William! you bleed!"</p>

He was immediately laid upon a barrow, conveyed home with all poſſible tenderneſs, and lodged in Mr. Jerome's houſe, where he was attended with the utmoſt care for ſix weeks. Twice a day came Jeanette with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her father to viſit him, and twenty times a day did ſhe come without her father's knowledge. She brought him preſerved fruits, ſtrengthening ſoups, and kind glances, endued with the moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful healing powers.</p>
               <p>"How are you now?" ſaid ſhe one day at the beginning of the ſeventh week. "Alas!" ſaid William in a querulous tone, "I am well, and the happieſt of my days are flown!"</p>
               <p>"You dream dear William. Have you not lain conſtantly in bed, and endured the moſt violent pain?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! how ſoon was it forgotten when I ſaw Jeanette enter the room!"</p>
               <p>At theſe words, he concealed his glowing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance with the bed-clothes; and Jeanette, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread with the moſt captivating bluſhes of modeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, pretended ſome buſineſs at the window; in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which ſhe awkwardly overturned three phials with medicines. Of theſe, however, there was ſtore remaining. The ſurgeon declared what Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam of his own free impulſe would never have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that his patient was completely cured. William, with a deep ſigh, left the houſe in which his heart had enjoyed more delightful emotions than his leg had coſt him painful hours. Winter cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſnow the garden in front of the houſe, and the glimmering ſparks of firſt love. Jeanette and

               <p>Meanwhile the youth received the moſt flattering teſtimonies from his inſtructors. "He is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent," ſaid they, "and he has talents; it is a pity indeed that he is ſometimes a dreamer. For hours together he will ſit with open mouth, and gaze.

There would Jeanette often ſit under the fatal pear-tree, and wonder that her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, which was now ſo much enlarged, ſhould feel even more confined than when ſhe wore frocks. With the frocks of childhood its joys too had flown. Laſt harveſt the pear-tree was intereſting only on account of its fruit, but now ſhe preferred the bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms. Formerly ſhe delighted to ſee the linnet
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035693_0026_10064C8DB6D0D258"/>
with his clipped wings hop through the room, but now ſhe would rather liſten to his ſong in the groves. <hi>Childhood</hi> loves to demoliſh; <hi>youth</hi> to enjoy; <hi>manhood</hi> wiſhes to build up, and to repair, but in the midſt of its ſchemes is ſurpriſed by <hi>old age,</hi> which loves to lie down beneath a ruin, and doze away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of exiſtence.</p>
               <p>Out of the abundant treaſure of her youthful joys, Jeanette had nothing now remaining but a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite canary bird, which, by the help of a violin, had been taught to ſing the melodies of the ſong, <hi>"Marlborough's to the wars gone.</hi>" He would often fit upon her ſhoulder, and peck the ſugar from her mouth. As her father and this canary were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly living creatures ſhe could venture to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, either to herſelf or to others, that ſhe paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately loved, ſhe ſoon became perſuaded that little <hi>Marlborough</hi> was indiſpenſible to her. "I ſhould fret to death," would ſhe often ſay, "were he to die." This in other words meant, "I cannot live without love, and I know not yet how eaſy it is to ſupply the place of a canary bird."</p>
               <p>One hot ſultry ſummer day it happened—and William chanced to be in the garden—that all the windows of the houſe were thrown open to invite the breeze, which gently waved the vine-leaves that arched round the window. While little Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough hopped at liberty through the room, the reſtleſs ſpirit of his great anceſtor ſuddenly began to move in him. Perhaps he was enticed by the twit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of a ſparrow on the outſide, which reminded him, that in ſpite of his golden plumage, and his preſent delicate ſtyle of living, he was originally ſprung from the ſparrow race. He reſolved, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to teach the courtier a leſſon, by condeſcending to acknowledge his humble relation. Preſto! in a moment he was out at the window, and Jeanette had well nigh leaped out after him. She ſtood with
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035693_0027_10064C8FA6114CE0"/>
uplifted arms, and ſcreamed as if ſhe had ſeen ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body murdered below in the garden.</p>
               <p>It was long before the cauſe of her ſcreams could be aſcertained, ſince nobody had obſerved the little fugitive, and Jeanette was ſo frightened that ſhe could not for her life ſtammer out the word <hi>Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough.</hi> William ſtood before her, moved his lips, twiſted his fingers, and with anxious looks ſeemed labouring to draw the words from her mouth. When he at laſt learnt what was the matter, he took the ſhorteſt way out at the window; and Jeanette was on the point of following him, had not female delicacy in the critical moment pulled her by the ſleeve, and held her back. She flew out at the door, and ſoon joined William, whoſe eyes wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from tree to tree.</p>
               <p>"There he ſits!" cried he at laſt, pointing to a cherry-tree, where Marlborough perched, and devoured with keenneſs a May cherry. "But how are we to entice him down without frightening him away?"</p>
               <p>William whiſtled; Jeanette cried, but all in vain! A lump of ſugar was ſhewn him at a diſtance; but he eyed it aſkance, like a contented peaſant who is invited to the table of a prince, and yet would eat his buttermilk at home with much greater pleaſure and appetite. After the little fugitive had pecked the cherry to the ſtone, he flew merrily away, like the favorite of ſome great lady, who is compelled to give the tone to the feelings of his miſtreſs, though his heart refuſes to beat in uniſon, and at laſt has the good fortune to fall into diſgrace. His purſuers followed him cloſe. He then perched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a birch, and the feelings of liberty appeared quite to overcome the duty of gratitude; for he took not the leaſt notice of Jeanette's fond, enticing complaints.</p>
               <p>William was preparing to climb the birch, but Marlborough ſaved him the trouble, and flew from
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035693_0028_10064C9440345E40"/>
tree to tree. At laſt he flew over the hedge into the adjoining meadows. Without wings, and in ſpite of the thorns, William ſoon contrived to find his way over the hedge. Poor Jeanette, however, was obliged to remain behind, and content herſelf with her tender hands to make a little opening in the thicket, through which ſhe could have a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the meadow, and at leaſt follow the beloved fugitive with her eye.</p>
               <p>"Ah! William! William! get me him back" cried ſhe to the youth with a voice ſo touching<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y ſweet, that he would have purſued the bird into the very cage of the fairy <hi>Strigillina,</hi> for whoſe acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance we are indebted to the facetious <hi>Cazotte.</hi> The meadow was but thinly planted with trees, and at the diſtance of a few hundred paces was bounded by a river of conſiderable breadth, though not very deep. On the banks of this ſtream Marlborough perched on a willow, ſo low, that he ſeemed eaſily within reach. William ſlipped up upon tiptoe, and when he was opening his hand—away the little fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive took his flight acroſs the ſtream, ſat down upon an aſpen tree, and began to ſing merrily—not <hi>Marlborough's to the wars gone</hi>—but the ſong which nature had taught him without the help of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. It is thus that we all do. Every one has his piece which he has learnt by rote, and he ſings it no longer than he is obliged. The parſon drones it from the pulpit, and at home reſigns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſpirit of the cloth, while he calculates the amount of his tythes.</p>
               <p>There was no time to be loſt. William ſprang forward into the water without conſideration, clothes and all, waded up to the ſhoulders, and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gained the oppoſite bank, but not the object of his purſuit.</p>
               <p>Jeanette through the hedge ſaw what William had done, and the big tear of anguiſh which rolled
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035693_0029_10064C95CA474190"/>
down her cheek changed into the ſilent ſtealing tear of tenderneſs. She trembled ſtill, but it was not for Marlborough. "Kind William!" ſaid ſhe aloud: "Dear William!" ſoftly re-echoed her heart.</p>
               <p>He had now, together with the bird, diſappeared from her view. He leaped and ſprang over hedges and ditches, keeping the runaway favourite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in ſight. His ſtrength now began to fail; his breath was nearly exhauſted; the agitation of his breaſt was viſible; the moment ſeemed at hand when he would be compelled to drop down with fatigue, and the reſuſcitated Marlborough would be abandoned to his fate.</p>
               <p>Unexpectedly a third party now came into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who, unobſerved, had long watched his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. A hawk ſoared in air, lurking like a villain that prowls abroad to ruin innocence. Ah! that nature had not beſtowed upon man the inſtinct of the feathered creation, to detect wickedneſs and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery at a diſtance, when they ſeem to hover care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs over him without menacing deſtruction! Little Marlborough, in his golden priſon, had never ſeen a hawk, but nature diſtinctly told him—"Above you there is your foe!" What neither ſeducing love nor tempting dainties could accompliſh, fear at laſt effected. He ſhaped his flight lower and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; at laſt, but juſt above the ſurface, he perched upon a juniper buſh—the hawk darted down—and Marlborough leaped for refuge into William's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting hand.</p>
               <p>"I have got him!" cried William panting for breath; "thank God, I have got him." He for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got that his ſtrength was exhauſted; he thought only of Jeanette's tranſports, and the idea inſpired him with new vigor. He could not allow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to think of going round by the high road over the bridge, and through the town to Mr. Jerome's
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035693_0030_10064C97585CC548"/>
garden. With the bird in his hand he leaped more lightly than before over all the hedges and ditches which ſeparated him from Jeanette; with the bird in his hand he plunged again into the river, and held his captive over his head.</p>
               <p>"I have got him!" exclaimed he, when he ſaw the white robes of his beloved waving through the hedge. A tender tear ſtole down her cheek when ſhe at laſt ſaw William ſtanding before her breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, drenched to the ſkin, his hands torn and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, his face inflamed and diſcoloured, his hair as wet with perſpiration as his clothes with water. She darted an animated glance which betrayed her whole ſoul; ſhe forgot Marlborough and her diſordered morning gown, ſuddenly threw herſelf round his neck, and with loud ſobs kiſſed his glowing cheek.</p>
               <p>Poor William, indeed, had earned well his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. He was ſo much exhauſted that he could not even return Jeanette's careſſes. He ſunk down on the graſs, and panted for breath; Jeanette could not ſpeak her thanks—ſhe was ſilent; but this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment decided the fate of her life. William was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to go to town and change his clothes. He would not go. Next morning he was ſeized with a fever and ague.</p>

                  </gap>ſe low-bred worthy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who have nothing to pretend to but their hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty. This celeſtial divinity too has it in common with the gods of the earth that he ſubmits to the tyranny of favorites, provided they never fall into diſgrace with him. Gentle reader! do you gueſs the names of theſe favourites? They are called <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Senſe.</hi> Love, indeed, has alſo a <hi>friend,</hi> leſs a favorite, as uſual, it is true, than the flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but often poſſeſſed of the greateſt influence. This friend is <hi>Pity!</hi> and when, as it ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, the friends and the favorites combine toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the moſt rigid heart muſt open to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes.</p>
               <p>William, without being aware of it, had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in intereſting both the friend and the flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his favor. As early as the day when his tears dropped into the brook, and the flute breathed the ſimple tones of his plaintive melody, <hi>Pity</hi> firſt ſtole into the gentle boſom of Jeanette. The broken leg of laſt year nouriſhed this feeling, and the ague now lent it incalculable ſtrength. Hence was formed the triple alliance to which we have juſt alluded. Vanity whiſpered in ſoothing accents: "For thy ſake it was he climbed the tree; for thy ſake he plunged into the river."—<hi>Senſe</hi>—Fy! fy! what has an innocent girl of ſixteen to do with the ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Senſe?</hi>

to you as a crime?—William was a tall handſome ſtripling; he had the glow of health upon his cheek; his countenance diſplayed the freſh bloom of youth; he had a fine intelligent eye, purple lips, white teeth—Is it my fault that nature has communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to theſe qualities the power to pleaſe? When all is done, muſt we not exclaim with Boufflers:

               <p>The very ſame apartment where laſt year Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am had found his health but too ſpeedily re-eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, was on this occaſion likewiſe the ſcene of his joys and ſufferings. He entered it with delightful warmth of emotion, to which the ſhivering fit of his diſtemper was for a moment forced to yield.</p>
               <p>Almoſt the whole day Jeanette was wont to ſit by his bed-ſide. Her father troubled himſelf little about the matter, partly becauſe the ſlighteſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion never entered his imagination, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his affairs, for ſome time fallen into diſorder, occupied his attention, and ſoured his temper.</p>
               <p>Jeanette had learnt botany from an old French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a pupil of <hi>Rouſſeau,</hi> and inherited from her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a number of notable receipts. She liked to dabble a little in medicine too, and ſhe reſolved to undertake in perſon the cure of her beloved patient; a deſign, in which ſhe very probably would have ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately ſucceeded without the aſſiſtance of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts whatever. Sometimes ſhe prepared for him freſh decoctions of creſſes, borage, and other herbs; again ſhe would give him mint leaves with honey; and ſometimes ſhe made him drink coffee with lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on juice. William, without reluctance, ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whatever her fair hand preſented to him; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:035693_0033_10064C9F34AC8328"/>When he at length perceived that the fever had left his body, but that his love for Jeanette was not likely to be ſoon expelled from his heart, he became penſive and melancholy. Jeanette daily made ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and preſſing inquiries after the cauſe; but in vain! no decoction could looſen his tongue. Moſt willingly indeed would he have rolled away the heavy burden that lay upon his heart, but where could he find courage for the attempt?</p>
               <p>"Baſhful boy! when love is deficient in cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, it has recourſe to art. You dread Jeanette's reſentment? Why, well! Try then to diſcover your love without betraying the deſign. Have you not a fever? Cannot you affect delirium? The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of a diſtempered fancy ſhe cannot take amiſs."</p>
               <p>Something, <hi>I know not what,</hi> whiſpered theſe ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions to William's heart, and to its ſoothing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents William lent a willing ear. Several days he revolved his little plan of impoſture, and watched only for a favorable opportunity to put it in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>One evening Jeanette amuſed him in reading the celebrated <hi>Reinecke Fuchs,</hi> which M. Goethe has dreſſed out in a new garb. He was ſo wearied with the pranks and the jokes of maſter <hi>Reinecke,</hi> that he had abundance of time to ſtudy his part. Twenty times was Jeanette, yawning with fatigue, on the point of laying the book aſide; but as William was ſilent, and his eyes, ſteadily fixed upon her, ſeemed to indicate that he was intereſted in the ſtory, ſhe concluded that it muſt be very entertaining, though ſhe could not comprehend it. She continued to read on to the ninth canto, and kept herſelf from ſleep as well as ſhe could. She was at the place which ſays that the "hero <hi>boldly</hi> addreſſed himſelf to all the barons," when the word <hi>boldly</hi> ſtruck William's ear, and vibrated to his heart. "Why do you heſitate?" whiſpered Love; "take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage!
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035693_0034_10064CA0C5167D80"/>
be <hi>bold!</hi>"—Here, however, it was no barons that William had to deal with; and he would have thought it far eaſier to addreſs himſelf to all the barons in Chriſtendom, than to expoſe himſelf to the offended looks of Jeanette.</p>
               <p>Suddenly William began to toſs himſelf about in bed, and to utter unintelligible jargon. Jeanette looked up: "William, are you not well?"—He returned no anſwer. Jeanette repeated her queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and William ſtill refuſed to anſwer. Alarmed, ſhe threw away the book, roſe, leant over him, and gazed upon his countenance with inquiſitive looks. His cheeks glowed—and that appeared a ſuſpicious ſymptom; his brow was hot—it was a return of the fever; his eyes rolled—he breathed quick—ſhe was ſeriouſly alarmed. Silent and anxious ſhe ſtood beſide him to watch the ſymptoms.</p>
               <p>William now began to give looſe to his tongue: "Jeanette!" exclaimed he without turning his eyes towards the place where ſhe ſtood, "my belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jeanette!" Then he proceeded to talk enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtically of palaces and cottages, which he would inhabit with his Jeanette. Now he would ſuppoſe that he ſaw Mr. Jerome before him; with tears he entreated and conjured him not to refuſe him Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette becauſe he was poor. Now he thought he ſaw her in the arms of another; then wept and raved, complained and ſtormed.</p>
               <p>Jeanette was terribly frightened. She attempted to run away, but did not go; ſhe was about to cry for help, but ſhe did not. William's ravings were ſo intereſting that they fixed her whole attention, and the confeſſion of his love ſhe heard with rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as his ſituation ſpared her bluſhes.</p>
               <p>After the pretended ſick man had played his part for a conſiderable time with great ſucceſs, and had unveiled the moſt ſecret wiſhes of his heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out embarraſſment, he ſunk down upon the bed as
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035693_0035_10064CA2E0013108"/>
if exhauſted, and peered at Jeanette with half-ſhut eyes, in order to aſcertain the effects of his talents for theatrical performance. His ſinking down ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to Jeanette to be a ſwoon; and when he gazed ſteadily at her, ſhe thought that his eyes were ſet in his head. Away ſhe ran to the window, where ſtood a phial with cordial drops, took a cup, and intended to pour out twenty; there were at leaſt eighty however, partly becauſe her hand trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and partly becauſe ſhe reckoned as much out of rule as if ſhe had in her life heard no more of addition or multiplication than of <hi>Kant's</hi> Criticiſm on pure Reaſon. Had this cordial been applied as it was intended, the roguiſh patient would indeed have ſuſtained no injury; for on the way between the window and the bed her trembling hand had ſpilt four parts of the potent drug. With the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder ſhe approached the patient's lips, and with ſoothing accents ſaid, "My dear William!"—At theſe words, inſtead of the cup he ſeized her hand, preſſed it ardently to his mouth, and gazed upon her with languiſhing ſoftneſs.</p>
               <p>"You will ſpill the drops!" cried Jeanette con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. But the drops were already ſpilt. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam troubled himſelf no more about them; he threw his arms round the lovely girl, hid his face in her boſom, and ſtammered, "Forgive me, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, I do not rave!"</p>
               <p>"What is the matter with you, William?"</p>
               <p>"Alas! I am poor! I have nothing but a heart that dotes upon you!"</p>
               <p>"You are ſick!"—</p>
               <p>"O yes! to death if you diſdain me!"</p>
               <p>It was indeed an excellent, though a very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faſhion among the old Germans, which aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the fair ſex the practice of the healing art. What extraordinary cures might not in thoſe days a young handſome baggage have performed! How
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035693_0036_10064CA6A40B5738"/>
often, on the other hand, might ſhe not have been the victim of her humanity! How often has the patient been cured when the phyſician caught the diſtemper!</p>
               <p>Jeanette felt that ſhe had more occaſion for the cordial drops than William. She would have run out of the room, but ſhe wanted ſtrength to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle herſelf from his arms. She would have chid, but ſhe wanted breath to ſpeak, as William's glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lips were preſſed to hers. At this moment the <hi>juggler</hi> Cupid, with inconceivable dexterity, exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their hearts; and ſhowed them, by the help of a little of his Necromantic ſkill, inſtead of a yawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abyſs under their feet, a diſtant proſpect of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery fields and beds of roſes.</p>

               <p>THERE are four kinds of happy mortals in the world. With three of them happineſs glides ſwiftly away, like the light clouds which the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs mariner, as he clings to the ſhattered helm of reaſon, at a diſtance miſtakes for land. With the fourth only is it permanent; provided no phyſician happens, uncalled, to interfere. The three firſt are, the <hi>drunk man,</hi> the <hi>lover,</hi> and the <hi>child.</hi>—The laſt— alas! why muſt I acknowledge the unwelcome truth?—the laſt is—the <hi>madman.</hi> All the four have this in common, that they are contented with what they poſſeſs; they enjoy the preſent, and entertain
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035693_0037_10064CA82F718DB8"/>
no apprehenſions for the future. On account of the coincidence which we have mentioned, it is uſual to call lovers childiſh, drunk, or mad; and I have nothing to ſay ſhould the reader be inclined to apply theſe honorable appellations to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal perſonages of my ſtory; for it was <hi>childiſh</hi> at their age to permit love to ſteal into their hearts; it was <hi>intoxication</hi> to acknowledge their mutual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment; it was <hi>madneſs</hi> to dream of future bliſs.</p>
               <p>William's moſt ambitious hopes ſcarcely aſpired ſo high as the rank of a ſchool-maſter. Jeanette, indeed, thought that love ennobled every ſtation, and conſtituted the happineſs of the beggar as well as the prince. She already anticipated in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how ſhe would feed the hens and geeſe, and bake cakes at Chriſtmas. Even the difference of their religious faith gave her no uneaſineſs. Lovers have only one religion.</p>
               <p>William thought theſe ſentiments extremely well founded, and did not fail to add many other reaſons no leſs concluſive. If a warlike prince, would he argue, returns his ſword into the ſcabbard to repoſe in the arms of his confort, why 'tis the ſame thing exactly when the ſchoolmaſter lays down the rod and embraces his helpmate. The prince adorns his brows with laurel, and the ſchoolmaſter at Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuntide decorates his apartment with birch. The laurel is dyed with blood, but the birch ſheds a ſweet perfume.—Love delights to amuſe itſelf with ſuch companions. The imagination admits them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcruple; but as with infants, who thruſt every thing indiſcriminately into their mouth, it is ſoon diſcovered that ſome things will not go down.</p>
               <p>William, whoſe fever had now taken a different turn, appeared endued with ſupernatural powers ſince Jeanette's lips had been preſſed to his. His maſters no longer called him dreamer. He was
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035693_0038_10064CA9BB8A4B58"/>
the moſt attentive, the moſt ſtudious ſcholar in the ſchool. He acquired every branch of knowledge with extraordinary expedition, and never loſt ſight of the object of his exertions, the valuable prize for which he ſtruggled. He now learnt more in ſix months than formerly in as many years; and at a public examination, in preſence of the ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant-general <hi>Hori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Prouder than a cardinal who has received from the viſible head of the church the right to wear a purple robe, and to lead a great white horſe by a golden bridle; happier than a ſhipwrecked naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who for many weeks has defied the attacks of hunger and thirſt in a crazy canoe, and at laſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries a friendly South Sea iſland at hand, on whoſe coaſts the bread-tree invites him to allay his hunger; prouder and happier did Wiiliam now ſly home to revive his ſick father with the news.</p>
               <p>Good old John Meadows was not deſtined to enjoy the fruits of his ſon's induſtry and preferment, for he died a few weeks after. To the day of his death, however, he continued to amuſe himſelf with a hundred little plans how he ſhould ſpend an eaſy old age, how he ſhould ſuperintend the kitchen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garden and the orchard, or undertake the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſchool upon occaſion, when urgent bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs took his ſon to town In the midſt of theſe flattering dreams John Meadows fell aſleep—the happier for him, perhaps!

               <p>"I am extremely happy to hear it," ſaid Mr. Jerome; "God bleſs you, my ſon!" Jeanette's cheeks glowed with tranſport; and ſhe could ſcarce reſiſt the impulſe to throw herſelf round his neck, and kiſs the beloved youth. The word <hi>ſon,</hi> which her father had employed, awaked in her mind a train of ſmiling images.</p>
               <p>William was invited to ſtay dinner. He ſat in ſpeechleſs joy; he could not eat a bit, and ſatisfied himſelf with feaſting his eyes; and when the old man poured out a glaſs of wine, and kindly ſaid, "Your health, Mr. Meadows!"—the tears burſt into Jeanette's eyes; ſhe was obliged to riſe from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is a good old practice to drink healths. It is indeed the moſt inſipid thing in the world when it is merely a piece of ceremony in a polite company. But upon particular joyful occaſions, when heart drinks to heart, the tear ſtarts into the eye of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the youth exclaims with the old man—</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. PATIENCE!</head>
               <p>A FEW days after this joyful incident, death ſummoned ſome half-dozen princes and lords to the other world, and by the ſame conveyance diſpatched likewiſe John Meadows the porter, there to be interrogated, by a more penetrating examiner than the ſuperintendant-general <hi>Horiſtophilius,</hi> how each of them had borne his burden through life, and whether they had dragged it without ſtumbling from the cradle to the grave?</p>
               <p>After William had dropped a tear of filial piety upon his father's grave, and taken poſſeſſion of his whole inheritance, conſiſting of the blue Sunday's coat and the ſcarlet waiſtcoat, he departed in good ſpirits for Walldorf. He found on his arrival a delightful country; a hoſpitable manſion, inhabited by a good old lady, the widow of the deceaſed ſchoolmaſter; a kitchen-garden and orchard, a bower formed of honeyſuckles and jeſſamines; a piece of arable land, a ſmall meadow, an honeſt peaſantry, and a worthy clergyman! All, all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his wiſhes and his hopes. Happy as a child, he made his little domeſtic arrangements in the gaiety of a benevolent heart. His arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val had alarmed the old widow of his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, as ſhe was afraid that ſhe would be thruſt out of the little cottage, in which for more than thirty years ſhe had lived in peace. Her fears were groundleſs. "You may live in my houſe, mother!"</p>
               <p>William, "till death ſummon you hence, and God may perhaps provide in the ſame manner for my widow when I am gone." He thought of Jeanette. She is unacquainted with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035693_0041_10064CB142244760"/>
of a family, and the old woman will teach her both by her advice and example. The old woman underſtands cookery as well even as the parſon's wife; and when I bring home the bride, ſhe will treat us with a diſh of pancakes, which I know Jeanette dearly loves. Then ſhall we dine in the honey-ſuckle bower, and after dinner ſhall I lead her through the fields, and ſhow her all our riches. In the orchard are pears, and as good too as thoſe for which I broke my leg; and in the kitchen-garden are ſallads, which little Marlborough will reliſh ſweetly.</p>
               <p>With thoughts like theſe did William nightly lull himſelf to ſleep, till he had fairly ſettled in his new habitation; and according to his opinion, every thing was properly dreſſed out and prepared for the reception of the bride. One Morning then, with anxious beating heart, he ſat out for town, and, as he went, conned over a ſpeech, which was quite to overwhelm Mr. Jerome; every word of which however, he forgot the moment he laid his trembling hand upon the door of the room. "Hah! welcome, Mr. Meadows!" cried the old man when he entered, "how goes it with you?"</p>
               <p>"Thank God, Mr. Jerome, matters ſucceed very well. I have enough for all that I want, and ſomething over."</p>

                  <speaker>WILLIAM.</speaker>
                  <p>—Dear Mr. Jerome! you are my benefactor! you have raiſed me from nothing, and made me a man—Complete your work!—Give me Jeanette to wife!</p>
               </sp>
               <p>"What! what! are you out of your wits?" ſaid Mr. Jerome, and the pipe dropped from his mouth.</p>
               <p>William ſeized the old man's hand, devoured it with kiſſes, and bathed it with his tears as he ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered the words: "Jeanette loves me!"</p>
               <p>"This is very abſurd in you," ſaid Mr. Jerome, after he had a little recovered from his ſurpriſe; "very childiſh and thoughtleſs in both of you.

In ſhort, my friend, I can forgive you for hankering after Jeanette; for you are young, and ſhe is a handſome baggage: but I hope you will give up all ideas of matrimony, and never return the benefits I have conferred upon you with ingratitude."</p>
               <p>This was the firſt time in ſeven years that Mr.
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035693_0043_10064CB480B7B740"/>
Jerome had dropped a hint of the word benefit; ſo it went the more ſeverely to poor William's heart. "Ingratitude!" ſaid he, while his quiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lips drank up the falling tear: "No! God preſerve me from that crime! Befall me what may, God preſerve me from ingratitude!"—He ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hat between his hands, looked to heaven, his eyes bedewed with tears, and exclaimed: "I may be wretched, but never ungrateful!"</p>
               <p>With theſe words he ſtaggered to the door. The old man was affected. A compaſſionate emotion pleaded the cauſe of his adopted ſon; but reaſon interfered, and proteſted with deciſive voice: "it muſt not be!"—So he bade him go in God's name.</p>
               <p>When William opened the door, Jeanette lay upon the threſhold and ſobbed. From the threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old ſhe crept to her father's feet. She could not ſpeak, but her eyes ſpoke a language which her father's heart underſtood. Mr. Jerome was obliged to ſummon up all his firmneſs to withſtand its dumb eloquence. He ſtruggled, and was victorious; for the good man's oppoſition to the marriage was founded neither upon regard to rank, nor to the catholic religion, but upon reaſons which he was aſhamed openly to avow.</p>
               <p>High living, indolence, and diſhoneſt ſervants had ſquandered his means of ſubſiſtence, and for ſome time paſt he had been meditating ſome ſcheme for repairing his fortune. The eaſieſt and moſt commodious appeared to be to marry his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a rich young tradeſman who had lately ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled at L***, and ſeemed to be much attached to Jeanette.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. THE SOLDIER.</head>
               <p>THERE are a number of virtues of which we are unable to form any juſt eſtimate. A number did I ſay?—Perhaps all!—Climate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and age here form a ſaint, and there a villain. If the Indian, whoſe fruitful ſoil returns his increaſe an hundred-ſold, is more beneficent than the native of Findland, who muſt draw his ſcanty bread from the rugged rock, in what does the ſuperior merit of the former conſiſt? When Boileau preaches chaſtity, becauſe a cold-blooded tutor had in his boyiſh years taught him to be a woman hater, in him it is no virtue. And if Mr. Jerome, in the ſixtieth year of his age, ſhould prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the patience which he recommends, he is indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it to the ſober temperament of his blood, which no longer darts rapidly through his veins, but creeps on in a ſlow and eaſy current.</p>
               <p>The exiſtence of youth is compoſed of <hi>wiſhes</hi> and of <hi>hopes</hi>; that of the old man, of <hi>habits.</hi> Wiſhes and hopes, the youth may change or renew; but
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035693_0045_10064CBA21F33538"/>
the old man clings to his habits like an oyſter to his ſhell; tear him from his habits, and he dies. Mr. Jerome felt that an eaſy life, a well covered table, and a glaſs of good wine, were become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible to him. William was unable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him with theſe, and accordingly he perſiſted reſolutely in his refuſal.</p>
               <p>William and Jeanette parted as life parts from youth, with ſtruggles and convulſions. "Alas! had fate but ordained me to be a porter!" exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed William, as he tore himſelf away. "Even then ſhould I have loved you!" returned Jeanette in a voice almoſt ſtifled with ſobs. In vain her father employed every means to divert the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the doting maid. He took her out to the garden—but there lay William under the pear-tree!—He walked with her in the meadows—there ſprang William into the river!—He invited com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany—but among them at table ſhe ſtill ſaw the image of William!—He preſented her with new dreſſes—but for whom ſhould ſhe now adorn her perſon? Her hair remained uncurled; her flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were no longer tended; and poor Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough was almoſt ſtarved. She exchanged her apartment for that where ſhe had nurſed William in his ſickneſs. There ſhe would ſit upon the bed where firſt he had encircled her in his arms; there ſhe would rivet herſelf to the ground where the fatal drops he had ſpilt yet ſtained the floor.</p>
               <p>William returned to his village with a ſtern in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference to every thing that is called mankind and the world. The good old dame at home obſerved with ſorrow, that he gave to the dog the ſavoury pancakes ſhe had ſo carefully prepared for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. He went out to the fields, and ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led when he ſaw that the vermin had deſtroyed the green ſhoots of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Suddenly he heard the voice of ſorrow moaning at a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. He awaked for a moment from his ſtupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, raiſed his hat from his eyes, and diſcovered a country woman weeping and wringing her hands in deſpair. William, the once tender, kind-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed William, ever ready to comfort and to relieve, now did not think it worth his pains to inquire the cauſe of her ſorrow. "What can be the matter?" thought he. "She has perhaps been robbed, or her cow-houſe has been burnt down. Poh! a trifle!" He was paſſing on.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Mr. Schoolmaſter!" cried the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, "help me, for God's ſake!" "God help you!" ſaid William careleſsly.</p>
               <p>"Ah! the cruel ſoldiers! they have taken from me my only ſon!"</p>
               <p>"The ſoldiers!"—A flaſh of lightning darted into William's ſoul. "Where are they?"</p>
               <p>"There, in the alehouſe.—Alas, my Henry! I ſhall never ſee him more! He is but a weakly lad, and never can ſtand the fatigues of ſervice!"</p>
               <p>"Patience, Goody! We ſhall ſee what is to be done."</p>
               <p>With rapid ſtrides William approached the ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. In his ſoul was a cruel ſtruggle.—Who am I?—What am I?—Is there any thing now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth to which my heart can cling?—My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is dead!

—Uniformity and repoſe were intended for happy mortals. Noiſe, buſtle, and war; here to day, there to-morrow; well to day, to-morrow wounded—This is the life for the miſerable!"</p>

               <p>"There is no help for that," purſued the man of war, "we have no alternative. Food for pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der—food for powder! The French cut out work for us.

               <p>William received a few guineas, and followed the ſergeant into the room. Here he viewed with indifference the joy of poor Henry, And the rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of his mother. Into the hand of the latter he ſlipped the guineas, not for the ſake of doing a beneficent action, but to be rid of the money. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a thouſand bleſſings, which neither mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved nor gratified him, he went home to pack up his linen in a bundle. The old dame looked at him with aſtoniſhment, and twenty times aſked him what he meant, but received no anſwer. In the evening the ſergeant whiſtled. "Farewell! good mother!" ſaid William, and threw his bundle over his ſhoulder.</p>
               <p>"Gracious God! Where are you going? and ſo late in the afternoon too?"</p>
               <p>"Go to ſleep in peace, good mother! When the morn ſhall dawn in <hi>that place</hi> where merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and ſchoolmaſters, catholics and proteſtants, awake together, we ſhall meet again!"—The old lady underſtood him not. She looked after him till the hawthorn hedge concealed him from her ſight. She ſhook her head, waddled away to a neighbour, with whom ſhe puzzled her brain till midnight in vain, to conjecture what could have befallen the ſchoolmaſter.</p>
               <p>The ſun roſe majeſtic in the eaſt, as the ſergeant and his recruits aſcended a hill, from which they could
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:035693_0049_10064CC3A1D57FC0"/>
command a view of the place of William's nativity. William diſtinctly diſcovered the top of the houſe in which Jeanette lived. The garden before the door appeared quite plain to his ſight, and he thought that he could even diſtinguiſh the fatal pear-tree.</p>
               <p>Hitherto he had followed his conductor in gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſilence. Neither words nor ſighs had betrayed the ſufferings of his heart. Now he ſuddenly ſtopped, as if rooted to the ſpot on which he ſtood, ſtretched out his arms towards the place of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and wept bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Courage!" ſaid the ſergeant. "Though you were to ſpend twenty years in his majeſty's ſervice, the town wont ſtir an inch from its place. When you return, too, as a corporal diſcharged, with a medal dangling in your button-hole, it will ſparkle far differently in your ſweet-heart's eyes from that black old-faſhioned coat!"</p>
               <p>"My ſweetheart!" ſaid William, alarmed: "How do you know—?"</p>

                  <p>—Po! 'tis eaſy to ſee that. I have lived too long in the world not to know that ſuch things are. Were there not a ſweet-heart in the caſe, you would not gaze ſo earneſtly upon yonder valley.</p>

               <p>The ſergeant ſmiled ſignificantly, and opened his knapſack. "I ſee you wont tell me. Why, no matter! Here, then, take a glaſs. There is an excellent ſong I have heard ſometimes, which ſays, A glaſs to the ſilent dead!"</p>
               <p>William took the glaſs.</p>
               <p>"To the dead or to the living?" ſaid the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant, archly.</p>
               <p>"Why ſhould I deny it?" returned William, "it is to my Jeanette!"</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. A NEW CHARACTER.</head>
               <p>WERE it not inconſiſtent with the reſpect which I entertain for what is called <hi>ſpirit,</hi> I would ſay, that the ſoul ſometimes reſembles a ſprained joint—you cannot touch it without cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing violent pain. Often, however, a little ſtroking by a ſkilful hand is ſufficient to reſtore every muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to its proper tone. Accident led the ſergeant to quote a few words of <hi>Schiller</hi>'s ſonnet to <hi>Pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>William had the ſong completely by heart; every line ruſhed into his memory, and every one bore the ſtamp of perfection; every one irreſiſtibly rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſoul to heavenly emotions. I know no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ills for which this exquiſite poem will not afford a cordial drop of conſolation. Bleſſings on the poet's head who wrote it! Once in a dreary hour it revived me!—"Bleſſings on his head!" exclaimed William, as a beam of hope dawned in his breaſt, and a ſpark of courage awoke in his ſoul.</p>
               <p>William, with moiſtened eyes, caſt a parting look at his father's grave, the beloved pear-tree, and the ivy mantled roof of Mr. Jerome's houſe. With haſty ſtrides he darted down the hill, and felt a kind of ſatisfaction when he found that it
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035693_0051_10064CC799639A70"/>
concealed the laſt ſpires of the town from his view. <hi>Satisfaction</hi> do you ſay?—Certainly. As long as a man can graſp at a beloved image with the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt probability of reaching it, he is more wretched than when the laſt ray of hope vaniſhes from his breaſt. As often as William ſaw, in the blue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon <hi>behind</hi> him, the hill which the preceding day he had deſcried in the blue horizon <hi>before</hi> him, as often as he croſſed a river, and ſaw the flying bridge again removed behind him, he felt as if his heart was ever collected more firmly within it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the ſtorm in his ſoul was ſilent; and if he did not enjoy tranquility, yet the tempeſt had ceaſed to rage.</p>
               <p>Very naturally, the ſergeant, in this expedition, became his confidante. Communication is indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably neceſſary to a lover; and had no human ear been open to William's melancholy tale, he would have ſtolen a dog in the firſt village he came to, and made him the partner of his ſorrows. William's companion, indeed, was no ſuch rough fellow as his fierce whiſkers and his ſtern voice ſeemed to indicate. He had left a wife and a child at home. He loved to talk of war and battles; but he loved ſtill better to talk of his dear Nancy, and his fine boy at her breaſt. The man who combines affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a virtuous wife and a ſenſe of domeſtic happineſs can never be hard-hearted. Patiently he liſtened to the complaints of his love-ſick recruit, or at leaſt ſeemed to liſten; and that was enough for William.</p>
               <p>After ſeveral days journey they arrived at the place of their deſtination, a fortreſs upon the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, where the recruits were aſſembled, and the new levies inſtructed in military ſervice. The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, regularity, attention, and rapid progreſs of the young man ſoon gained the regard of his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. With eaſe he acquired dexterity in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035693_0052_10064CCBB416C720"/>
exerciſes of his new profeſſion. He was ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and correct in his conduct, and never was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in any unpleaſant adventures. He wrote a fine hand, and inſtructed his captain's children in the rudiments of education. By theſe means he gained univerſal love and reſpect; and even the wildeſt of his comrades entertained no animoſity againſt him, as he pretended no call to the office of a preacher of morality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and never interfered to damp their pleaſures. There was one, however, more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to him than the reſt; and this was preciſely the moſt diſſipated among them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frederick Perlſtadt,</hi> the ſon of a collector of the revenue, combined with an open generous heart a very ſprightly diſpoſition. When a boy he uſed to teaſe and torment his maſter by his miſchievous tricks, and was inexhauſtible in wanton ſallies of waggery. Sometimes he would faſten a hook to the venerable peruke of the ſchoolmaſter, and whip it off, to the infinite entertainment of his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Sometimes he would ſew together the ſkirts of his ſchoolfellows' coats, or ſtick their heads be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſpars of the benches, as if they ſtood in the pillory. Neither admonition nor the rod was ſpared for the good of his ſoul, but the latter ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded worſe than the former. His father, who had been ſeveral years a widower, was diſpoſed to overlook his boyiſh tricks; and perhaps every thing would have gone ſmoothly with him, had not his evil genius curſed him with a ſtep-mother.</p>
               <p>Truth demands the confeſſion, that ſometimes good ſtep-mothers may be found; they are very rare, however, like honeſt divines. Such a rarity the French call <hi>belle mere</hi>; the common ſtep-mother they ſtyle <hi>marâtre,</hi>

phraſe, for which the poverty of our language has no correſponding term. Frederick's peſt was a <hi>marâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.</hi> She hated the wild boy from the bottom of her ſoul, and every childiſh waggery ſhe aſcribed to a rooted bad diſpoſition; every thoughtleſs, youthful extravagance ſhe imputed to a vicious and corrupted heart. His wildneſs daily increaſed; and as no debt on earth is more faithfully repaid than that of hatred, he returned his ſtep-mother's animoſity with ſilent deteſtation. Wherever he found an opportunity to do her a miſchief, he was ſure to ſeize it. His uſual enterpriſes of hoſtility were to throw ſugar into the cream; to catch rats and mice; and then ſet them looſe in her bed-room; to place a number of beetles under her pillow, to keep her from ſleeping. By this conduct he eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally diſturbed the peace of the family; and his father was daily more and more ſpirited up againſt him, till his ſtep-mother began ſeriouſly to conſider of getting rid of the graceleſs youth.</p>
               <p>One day ſhe was to ſtand godmother to the child of ſome perſon of conſequence. For this feſtival ſhe had brought out of her wardrobe a ſplendid white dreſs, which was carefully ſpread out upon the ſofa. Frederick ſaw it and chuckled. He went and brought into the room a large tabby cat, which had the bad cuſtom of conſidering the moſt valuable things of no more importance than the moſt uſeleſs. The cat was laid on the middle of the gown, and the conſequences anſwered Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick's moſt ſanguine expectation.—At laſt, however, the ſtorm which had long been gathering over his head, burſt.</p>
               <p>"It is impoſſible to live any longer with Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick," ſaid the ſtep-mother; "either he or I muſt leave the houſe!"</p>
               <p>"But where ſhall he go?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:035693_0054_10064CCF5D4BB5C8"/>"It is no matter to me! I will no longer live under the ſame roof with him. Is not the raſcal big enough?

               <p>Frederick laughed; his ſiſter wept and prayed; his father made ſome feeble objections, but in vain. The irreſiſtible decree of his ſtep-mother was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, and before a month elapſed Frederick was a fuſilier in the celebrated regiment of <hi>Oſtein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the muſket did not drive the miſchief out of his head. Without being guilty of any very crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal exceſſes, he ſtill continued, as formerly, a wild, thoughtleſs fellow, ever ready to knock his head againſt the wall, and in danger of being betrayed by his impetuous temper into troubleſome ſcrapes. It is difficult to ſay what ſuch a temper, with a mind totally neglected and uncultivated, would have led to, had not chance brought a company of players to his native town. With this intellectual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he was altogether unacquainted. By the help of a few ſhillings, with which the ſavings of his ſiſter enabled her to ſupply him, he had ſometimes an opportunity of going to the theatre. The <hi>Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Son</hi> was the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ece which he ſaw repreſented. It made a wonderful impreſſion upon him. He laughed and wept. They were the firſt tears of ſentiment which he had ſhed. He was aſhamed of them, and was ſtill more aſtoniſhed at the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſations which they produced.</p>
               <p>This moment, however, decided the nobler cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of his ſoul. He was not, indeed, all at once changed into a new mortal, Still he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hurried away by his impetuoſity, and indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his diſpoſition to wild and boiſterous enjoyments. There were periods, however, in which he taſted the pleaſure of reading. There were moments in which he peruſed <hi>Don Quixote</hi> and <hi>Tom Jones</hi> with
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035693_0055_10064CD108B04228"/>
delight; and at laſt he began to reliſh <hi>Don Carlos</hi> and <hi>Oberon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was at this aera that the hero of this hiſtory became Frederick's companion, and the books which William received from him, and read over and over with ſo much rapture, formed the firſt links of their acquaintance. It was yet a ſlender tie, but time gave it ſtrength. The diſſipated Frederick ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times followed the prudent counſels of his ſober friend; could not help entertaining a kind of reſpect for his judgment, and profited by his ſociety. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, too, would ſometimes gratify Frederick by joining his ſocial parties; and often by his preſence prevented many follies and quarrels which ſo natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ariſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> among the votaries of Bacchus. In a word, William deſcended to Frederick, and Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick elevated himſelf to William. He daily diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered in the unexplored regions of his heart new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate emotions; his judgment every day became more correct, his ſoul more refined; and in a ſhort time, of all his youthful foibles nothing remained but his ardent temper and impetuous ſpirit; quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which, if they do not conſtitute a virtuous man, at leaſt are more compatible with goodneſs of heart than inſidious coldneſs and frigid equanimity.</p>

could he expect to hear from ſuch a quarter?— That Jeanette had married ſome rich reſpectable huſband? That now, perhaps, ſhe was a mother?— Melancholy news! ungrateful ever to a lover's ear. William carefully avoided meeting any body from the neighbourhood of his native place; and was even afraid to read the newſpapers, from a fear of finding Jeanette's marriage announced. Still he continued to love Jeanette beyond every one in the world; and, to tell a ſecret, Frederick Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſtadt would not ſo eaſily have gained his friendſhip, had he not chanced to have a ſiſter who was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called Jeanette. It was not that his ſiſter her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could ever have gained an intereſt in his heart. He had not the leaſt deſire to ſee her, though fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently invited by Frederick to accompany him to viſit her. It was enough for him to know that his friend too was affectionately attached to a creature called Jeanette. On this account, he delighted to hear him talk of her; and whenever the word Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette was mentioned, William nodded benignantly, as if he would ſay: "I too have a ſiſter called Jeanette."</p>
               <p>The inceſſant activity of his ſituation alone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented William from falling a victim to the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly of this laſting hopeleſs love. The leiſure hours which the ſervice allowed him were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the inſtruction of ſome children, and in the cultivation of his own mind. It was but ſeldom that his gay friend could contrive to draw him from his books to roam abroad. The weather muſt have been very inviting, and the heavens very ſerene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if William conſented to accompany Frederick in his excurſions. When he did ſo, however, he could be extremely cheerful in his way; for his ſorrows were never ſo intenſe, but that the beauties of Nature were able, at leaſt for a moment, to ſooth his mind to tranquillity.</p>

                  <pb n="59" facs="unknown:035693_0057_10064CD6B0438B88"/>One delightful May-day Frederick came and perſuaded William to accompany him in a walk to a neighbouring village. They went, and ſtrolled along in friendly chat between two blooming haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn hedges. Near the village, where they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to drink a glaſs of beer, another ſoldier, called <hi>Frank Moritz,</hi> joined them. This Moritz was a peeviſh, ill-natured fellow, conſtantly ſeeking quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and taking offence.

               <p>The two friends fell into one another's arms. There was no time now for much reflection. The danger required an immediate reſolution. Every moment they might be ſurpriſed beſide the corpſe. Delay would render flight more difficult. William exerted all his eloquence to convince Frederick that regard for his parents and relations, on whom his diſgrace would redound, impoſed it on him as a duty to allow his friend to fly. He did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, but he ſilenced him. Alas! Frederick, the involuntary murderer, was already ſo confounded, that he knew not what he did. Weeping, he put his purſe into the hand of the generous youth— ſpeechleſs, he preſſed him to his heart. William tore himſelf away. He flew light as a roe; for, inſtead of a murder, he felt in his breaſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of a noble action!</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. THE PRIEST.</head>
               <p>WHEN a fugitive with a few ſhillings in his pocket, and the conſciouſneſs of a good action in his heart, graſps the beggar's ſcrip with more joy and ſatisfaction than the crowned rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his ſeeptre—O God! can man demand from thee a ſtill farther reward for that conduct which, in the moment it is performed, ſo richly rewards itſelf? About the cloſe of day William heard three guns fired, and ſoon after the ſound of bells in the neighbouring villages. He knew that he was the object of purſuit, and he concealed himſelf in a ditch under a bridge that croſſed a river on the high-way. Over the bridge in a ſhort time he heard the trampling of the horſes of the huſſars who were ſcouring the country in ſearch of him. He did not quit his hiding-place till darkneſs favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his flight. Although he was unacquainted with the road, he knew that he was near the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier; and after he had travelled on as faſt as he was able for two hours, a crucifix appriſed him of his ſafe arrival on a foreign ſoil, as the adjoining country was catholic.</p>
               <p>Wearied with his journey, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e threw himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the graſs to reſt himſelf. He had not laid long before the purple morn announced the coming day, and at a little diſtance he diſcovered a village, in which he reſolved to ſeek an aſylum till the evening, ſince even in a foreign territory he durſt not, for fear of the hue and cry, venture to purſue his journey during the day. "That church ſpire
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035693_0062_10064CE2160177F8"/>
before me," thought he, "is a proof that there is a clergyman in the village. He is not of my perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to be ſure, but humanity dwells among all religions; Jeanette, too, was a catholic. If I tell him candidly the circumſtance, which compels me to fly, he will not refuſe me a corner of his hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft till it grow dark."</p>
               <p>Having formed this reſolution, he entered the village, and knocked at the prieſt's door. A win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow opened, out of which locked a chubby round head with the clerical tonſure. A pair of ſmall ſquinting eyes peered with gracious looks over his red bloated cheeks, and played on his purſy double chin.</p>
               <p>"What do you want, my friend?" ſaid the fat prieſt to the fugitive.</p>
               <p>"I wiſh to ſpeak a word in private with your rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence."</p>
               <p>"A little patience, and I will open the door."</p>
               <p>The roſy prieſt drew in his head, ſhut the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, came to the door with ſilent ſteps, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it without noiſe. William now ſaw that the head was only a model of the belly, which, if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jonah had been doomed to be thrown into du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and no whale at hand, would have been able to contain a couple of prophets. That fat men may be generous and beneficent, William had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready experienced, nor was he ſtaggered in his opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion by the tun-bellied figure of the little prieſt.</p>
               <p>Kindneſs, however, is of two ſorts. The one is like the duſt on a butterfly's wings; men's faces are only powdered over with it. The other bears the rich colour of an autumn fruit; it indicates full maturity and exquiſite flavour; it refreſhes the thirſty. When men ſmile, and ſmile whenever you addreſs them; if they are always ſmooth and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering, the kindneſs of ſuch men is only farmed; it is not their <hi>property.</hi> From a leaſe-hold it is uſual
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035693_0063_10064CE3F4E077F0"/>
to draw as much advantage as poſſible; while the proprietor alone has a real regard for his poſſeſſion without continually planning how he is to draw ſome profit from it. The little fat prieſt farmed his kindneſs, and it brought him annually large ſums from his pariſhioners. He looked with the ſame gracious ſmile on the bride and bridegroom whom he married, and on the poor ſinner whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved when doing penance before the congregation.</p>
               <p>William had not ſufficient ſkill in the ſcience of phyſiognomy to determine whether the kindneſs of his hoſt bore the ſtamp of the heart, or of cuſtom. With courage and calmneſs, ſince he was no crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, William informed the prieſt of his difficulties, who liſtened to him without altering his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>"Very well, my ſon," ſaid he with a ſoft and gentle voice; "follow me without apprehenſion." He conducted his gueſt to a loft, which was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a partition of boards, and ſhewed him a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of hay for his bed.</p>
               <p>"It is probable you have wandered about all night, and will require repoſe. Here nobody will diſturb you. At dinner time, I myſelf will fetch you a baſon of broth, and whatever kind Providence may ſend. When it is dark you may, with the bleſſing of God, proceed on your journey. Two leagues hence lies a market-town, the mayor of which is my friend. I will give you a recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to him that you may procure a paſſport, for without a paſſport you will find it difficult to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. I adviſe you likewiſe, as ſoon as poſſible, to exchange your uniform for a peaſant's jacket."</p>
               <p>William, affected and tranſported by this active and voluntary attention, kiſſed with ardent expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of gratitude the fat hand of the prieſt. "I thought indeed," ſaid he to himſelf after he was alone, "that a religion which Jeanette profeſſes
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035693_0064_10064CE8A53CDA28"/>
muſt teach humanity." Free from all care and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, he ſunk down upon the new-gathered hay, and ſlept ſweetly for ſeveral hours. When he awoke about noon, the prieſt ſtood before him with a baſon of broth, a ſlice of bread and bacon, and a bottle of beer.</p>
               <p>"Here, my friend, take this and refreſh your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. There alſo is the letter to the mayor. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you, however, not to quit my houſe till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. There are Pruſſian huſſars in the village; the alehouſe where they are quartered is not far off, and you had better not ſtir till the landlord and his gueſts are all gone to ſleep. If you had only your dreſs changed, and the paſsport in your pocket, you are ſafe."</p>
               <p>William renewed his expreſſions of gratitude. The prieſt took leave of him with his uſual kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. William ate, drank, and again fell aſleep. Towards evening he awoke refreſhed and invigora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in this ſolitude reſigned himſelf to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. With melancholy emotion he reviewed the paſt; hopeleſs he looked to the future. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould he go? What was to become of him? He knew not, and indeed it was almoſt indifferent to him. A man who can work, thought he, may earn a ſubſiſtence any where; and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e he finds a livelihood.</p>
               <p>Till now the moſt profound ſilence had prevailed in the houſe. William heard not a footſtep, not a word, not a whiſper. Two or three mice attracted by the ſavour of the bacon, and which ran about quite tame, ſeemed the only inhabitants of the place. In the duſk of the evening, however, William thought he heard a feeble moaning in the room be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. He liſtened—and again all was ſilent. I muſt have been miſtaken, thought he, and took no farther notice of the circumſtance. Scarcely had
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035693_0065_10064CEA2ECFA868"/>
his mind turned to ſome new object, when the moans he had heard again ſtruck his ear. He held in his breath, and again liſtened. He now diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard, ſometimes with longer, ſometimes with ſhorter intervals, ſighs and groans. They appeared to iſſue from the apartment directly under his place of refuge. The houſe was built entirely of wood, and the thin floor favored his curioſity. He laid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down, and put his ear to the boards. He now heard quite diſtinctly that he was not miſtaken; but from whoſe breaſt the complaining proceeded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by what ſufferings it was occaſioned, he could not gueſs.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he thought he heard the voice of the prieſt. From this he concluded that there muſt be another wretched ſufferer in the houſe beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who was treated by the benevolent prieſt with the ſame kindneſs and hoſpitality. Still, however, he could not conceive from what the accents of grief and pain which he had heard could ariſe. If it was a ſick perſon, the illneſs muſt be ſevere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed which could extort ſuch violent expreſſions of pain and anguiſh. His heart ſympathiſed with the unknown ſufferer; and in that feeling he forgot his own danger.</p>
               <p>As night advanced the groars became more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and more inceſſant; at laſt they changed to ſhrieks. They were the ſhrieks of a female, and they cut William ſo cruelly to the heart that he wiſhed himſelf with the huſſars in the alehouſe. In about half an hour all was ſilent; he liſtened, and heard ſome one ſtep ſoftly; in a little time the houſe door creaked on its hinges. Curioſity led him to the window; the moon ſhone bright. He ſaw the prieſt ſlip through the court to the garden, and he ſeemed to carry ſomething under his caſſock. William's eyes followed him into the garden. The prieſt ſtopped under a large tree, laid his burden on the ground, took up a ſpade, and began to dig.</p>

He ſlipped down ſtairs upon tiptoe, and, keeping in his breath, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the apartment from which the voice of anguiſh proceeded. A glimpſe of light diſcovered to him that the prieſt as he went out had left the door a-jar.

               <p>Cold as a ſtone, and deprived of ſenſation, ſtood the wretched youth. His feet were rooted to the floor, his knees knocked againſt each other, his hair ſtood on end, his eyes gazed motionleſs on the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre that threw around a doleful glance, and groaned. He attempted to cry, but his throat was choaked; he attempted to fly, but his limbs were nerveleſs.— How long he ſtood, how at laſt he had torn himſelf from the frightful ſcene, how he reached the ſtreet-door and gained the high road, and of every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which had paſſed, he had next morning no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a confuſed remembrance. When he firſt recovered his ſenſes, he found himſelf ſeated under a tree; the ſun was high, and a young peaſant girl that ſtood before him aſked kindly whether he was ill; offering him at the ſame time a pitcher of milk for his refreſhment.</p>
               <p>He gazed at this girl with wild looks. He felt as if he had recovered from the delirium of a fever. "I thank you, my girl," ſaid he in ſeeble accents, "I want nothing."—The girl threw a compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate glance at him, ſhook her head, and went away.</p>

               <p>WHEN God ſent grief into the world he gave inſenſibility as its beneficent companion. Grief ſometimes would, in a moment, annihilate the machine, if it did not plunge us into the boſom of inſenſibility.</p>
               <p>William flew, unconſcious, from the ſcene of horror. Haſtily, and without reflection, he contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to walk on. He went paſt the alehouſe; by the moon light he ſaw two huſſars ſleeping upon a bench, and never mended his pace. After walking ſeveral hours, exhauſted with fatigue, he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the graſs, under a tree. The chill morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing due wet him to the ſkin—he felt it not.—Night ſucceeded to day—he ſaw it not.—The lark mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>About noon a ſtorm aroſe, and the diſtant thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der rolled. William heard it, as through a ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and it was pleaſant to him.

The lightning flaſhed more and more vivid; the thunder p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſhower of hail, accompanied by a furious whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, ruſhed from the black boſom of an angry cloud. A little penthouſe offered a ſafe ſhelter to the traveller. William ſaw it, but he moved not from his place.</p>
               <p>At this moment, a party of huſſars paſſed by. To ſhield themſelves from the ſtorm, they had drawn their cloaks over their faces, and rode on at a rapid pace. They ſaw him not; but William viewed them without apprehenſion; he recogniſed them to be Pruſſians, and could not comprehend for what reaſon they appeared in ſuch numbers in this neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>The louder the ſtorm howled and the thunder roared, the more he felt his breaſt lightened; with more firmneſs he looked up. The tempeſt now hung over his head. Not an hundred paces from the place where he lay, the lightning, with tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous craſh, ſtruck an oak-tree, and ſhivered it to pieces from the top to the very root.</p>
               <p>"Why not <hi>this!</hi>" ſaid William, pointing to the tree under which he lay. "O God! annihilate me amidſt this conflict of the elements! Take back thy unwelcome preſent of exiſtence, and give it to the fool who thinks it worth his pains to thank thee for it!"</p>
               <p>Happy for thee, wretched youth, that thy lips, which anguiſh had ſealed, are again opened.

riſing thought of ſelf murder. "I am not yet wholly detached from the chain of exiſtence," exclaimed he, "I have ſtill a friend whom I muſt ſave! a friend to whom I have pledged myſelf to defend my life.—Fly! fly! every ſtep increaſes his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, and removes you from the faithleſs woman on whom you doted!—Ah! Jeanette! Jeanette! how low art thou fallen!</p>
               <p>He now roſe, and proceeded on his journey. Towards evening, he arrived in the town to which the prieſt had directed him. Here he recollected the letter he had received to the mayor; and though his heart revolted at the idea of obtaining a favour by the aſſiſtance of a man who had violated the ſanctuary of his heart, yet the conſideration that the ſafety of his friend was now his only duty, prevailed, and reluctantly compelled him to take this ſtep. He went to the mayor's houſe, was uſhered in to an old ſilver-haired perſonage with a benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent countenance, to whom he preſented the letter.</p>
               <p>The old man took the letter, peruſed it with amazement, threw an inquiſitive look at William, and the ſymptoms of diſſatisfaction were viſible in his face. He took off his ſpectacles thoughtfully, laid the letter on the table, and paced ſilently through the room. At laſt he pulled a bell, his trembling hand ſeemed reluctantly to perform the ſervice. An officer of juſtice immediately appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>"My friend," ſaid the old man to William, "I am ſorry to inform you that you have been betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. You have fallen into a prieſt's hands, and of courſe into bad hands. Were you merely a deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I would willingly overlook the circumſtance; but this letter charges you as a murderer. You are my priſoner. Officer do your duty."</p>
               <p>William ſtood petrified. "Is it poſſible," exclaimed he, "that ſo much villany ſhould lurk
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035693_0070_10064CF4CBFD2B08"/>
under the maſk of friendly tenderneſs? This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful prieſt, who has ſo ſcandalouſly abuſed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of a perſecuted man, has ſeduced an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent girl, murdered his own child, and buried it, laſt night, under a tree in his garden."</p>
               <p>The honeſt old man heard this charge with ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which William, whoſe natural feelings of reſentment were rouſed to the higheſt pitch, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantially related, without conſidering the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to which he thus expoſed the wretched Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette. With feelings moſt cruelly diſtracted, his reliance upon love, faith, and the whole human race ſeveraly ſhaken, he followed the officers of juſtice to priſon, where an heavy chain upon each leg faſtened him to the wall. In other reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects he was treated with as much indulgence as the ſtrict duty of his judge would permit.</p>
               <p>The following night the magiſtrate repaired, with a party of officers to the houſe of the prieſt. The mother did not deny her ſituation. When aſked what had become of her child, ſhe replied, that it had been taken from her, and given to a country woman to nurſe, though ſhe would willingly have ſuckled it herſelf. She ſpoke this with the tone of innocence and truth; but terror and anxiety ſat on the prieſt's countenance, and betrayed his guilt.</p>
               <p>They went out to the garden, and found under a tree the earth n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The officers ſeized the culprit, and threw him in irons into a dungeon, from which the ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual power ſoon after removed him. He did not, as he deſerved, expiate his crime upon the ſcaffold, for the honor of the church was concerned in huſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the affair. He was ſhut up in a diſtant cloiſter, and nothing more was heard of him.</p>
               <p>When poor Jeanette was informed of the murder
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035693_0071_10064CF659F04240"/>
of her child, ſhe lay three days ſenſeleſs; on the fourth ſhe was delirious. The humane juſtice did not attempt, in this ſituation, to throw her into cloſe confinement. He ordered a phyſician to be called, and appointed nurſes and midwives to attend her; and after the lapſe of a month, when the phyſician declared that ſhe could be removed without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſhe was carried to priſon.</p>
               <p>During this period, William languiſhed in his cell, without knowing what was determined reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fate. Legal forms had retarded his being delivered up. It was neceſſary to write to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and receive anſwers backwards and forwards, till at laſt the news arrived that a party of ſoldiers were ſent to take him into cuſtody. The juſtice was anxious to accelerate William's removal; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the place where he was confined was the only apartment in the priſon in which a man could be lodged without danger to his health.</p>
               <p>One morning when the youth was buſy in trying to entice, with crumbs of bread, a mouſe, which was his only companion, to come nearer, he heard, at an unuſual hour, the doors of his priſon grate harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on their hinges, and the heavy keys rattle. The officers of juſtice opened the door, and puſhed in a woman, who ſunk ſenſeleſs on the threſhold.— "Jeanette!" e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>claimed William, and tore his chains, and tugged with all his might at the rings which faſtened him to the wall. In vain, however! His hard fate denied him the feeble conſolation of lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his aid to the faithleſs beloved. He roared out with agony!—The noiſe he made, and the clanking of his chains, awoke the wretched girl from her ſwoon. She opened her eyes, and ſhuddered with horror, for ſhe thought the figure ſhe ſaw was Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam's ghoſt.</p>
               <p>William ſtretched out his arms to claſp her. She roſe to throw herſelf into his arms, but ſuddenly

the burden of her conſcience again weighed her to the ground.</p>
               <p>"No! I am unworthy of your embrace! You know not why I am in this place!"</p>
               <p>"I know it," cried William: "you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited your innocence—but I truſt in God you are no child-murderer!"</p>
               <p>"No! of that I am innocent!" She crawled upon her knees to her beloved, ſeized his chain, and preſſed it to her ſtreaming eyes.</p>
               <p>What imagination can deſcribe the ſcene of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which the firſt melancholy hours exhibited? Broken ſentences choaked with tears, woful looks, and lengthened groans—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"GOOD William," ſhe began, "it was neither pride nor a difference of religion which ſteeled my father's heart againſt our wiſhes. We and the whole town thought him rich. He was indeed ſo once, but diſhoneſt people had cheated him out of his property. He was anxious to have an opulent ſon-in-law to re-eſtabliſh his affairs. Alas! had I known the reaſon why he ſo earneſtly wiſhed ſuch an alliance; had I known that he dreaded poverty in his old age, I would have made

At laſt a diſtant relation came, examined the papers of the deceaſed, and very coldly informed me that I was a beggar, a beggared orphan! Unaccuſtomed to earn my ſubſiſtence by the labour of my hands, without friends, without acquaintances; a ſtranger in the wide world—whither could I fly?

Had I patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waited in my lonely cottage for the ſupport of God, who crowns true love as well as virtue, for they are ſiſter graces, we ſhould now have lived in ſweet tranquility and union, rich in content. How could I impute my thoughtleſſneſs to you as a crime!—I—I alone am guilty of your undoing!"</p>
               <p>Thus did this luckleſs pair mingle their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and mutually exculpate each other, till in about an hour the doors of the priſon were again opened, and a party of ſoldiers entered, to whom the gaoler delivered up William. Jeanette ſunk to the ground inſenſible, and claſped the pillar to which her beloved was chained. By force they tore him from her. She remained lying upon the ground in convulſions; and ſeveral hours after, when ſhe opened her eyes, ſhe found herſelf aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to darkneſs and ſolitude.</p>

               <p>"MY friend," ſaid the captain to William, "you have here played a fooliſh trick. As to running that miſcreant Moritz through the body, any one in your ſituation would have done the ſame thing; as he knew from Perlſtadt's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation that the fellow was drunk, provoked you for a long time, and at laſt rouſed your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by a box on the face. But why did you run away for this?—Means might have been found to aſſiſt you; but now God knows what will be the conſequence!"</p>
               <p>"Whatever God pleaſes!" ſaid William, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out betraying the leaſt fear or anxiety.</p>

                  <speaker>CAPTAIN.</speaker>
                  <p>—I pity you very much. You were ever an excellent lad; my children inquire daily what is become of you. Would to God I could be of any ſervice to you! Without running the gaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let you can ſcarcely get off; but we ſhall try to ſave your life.</p>

                  <speaker>WILLIAM.</speaker>

                  <speaker>CAPTAIN.</speaker>
                  <p>—Po! for ſhame! What! if you have a mind to die, go face the enemy's cannon; but keep out of the hangman's way as long as you can. To-morrow your firſt examination will take place; be rational; ſay nothing but what you anſwer to the queſtions propoſed; and in God's name lay all

the blame upon the deceaſed, who cannot contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict you.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>With theſe words the good-hearted captain left the guiltleſs priſoner. William was put into cloſe confinement, again chained to the wall, and fed upon bread and water. There was a little grated window, through which you might ſee into the cell. Almoſt all his comrades came to the grate to ſee him, and to ſympathize with his ſituation— Almoſt all—except Frederick Perlſtadt.</p>
               <p>"He is right," thought William. "His heart is made of too ſuſceptible ſtuff; he would betray himſelf."—In tranquil expectation he awaited the coming day, in order to confirm the ſuppoſition of his guilt by a ſolemn confeſſion upon his trial.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the ſcene was ſuddenly changed. Two hours after William's arrival, Frederick Perl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadt came pale as death, but firm and collected, to the guard-room, took off his ſword, gave it to the corporal, and deſired to be taken into cuſtody, as he was really Frank Moritz's murderer. They ſtared at him and thought him out of his wits; but he perſevered in his purpoſe. The commanding officer of the watch was called. Frederick repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſtory. He was therefore taken into cuſtody, and the affair reported to the commanding officer.</p>
               <p>Next morning a court-martial was aſſembled, which was not a little confounded, at the behaviour of both the priſoners, as each of them reſolutely perſiſted in ſaying that he was the criminal. They were confronted, ſunk into each other's arms, and kindly reproached one another with their mutual obſtinacy. The circumſtance was ſo ſingular that it excited great attention. The duke of Brunſwick, the commander in chief of the Pruſſian troops, happened to be then in the garriſon. His curioſity was raiſed, and he ordered the priſoners to be brought before him. Frederick, without heſitation, relate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:035693_0080_10064D0CDCA93438"/>
the affair as it had really happened, and how his friend had ſacrificed himſelf on his account to ſpare the ſufferings of an old drooping father. He had accepted the magnanimous offer of his friend, in hopes that he would make his eſcape, and becauſe by his talents he would be able to provide for himſelf every where. Now, however, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent young man had been apprehended, it was impoſſible for him to derive any advantage from his generous devotion. He knew that he muſt die, but death would be leſs bitter to him than the thought of having brought his friend to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>William contradicted this ſtory in every point, told how Frederick from his youth had been the victim of a cruel ſtep-mother, and at laſt had been driven by her artifices to enliſt. He had embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the life of a ſoldier with reluctance; ſince ever he had known him he had been overwhelmed with diſguſt at exiſtence, and he had often expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed how eagerly he wiſhed for ſome favourable opportunity of ſacrificing his life for a man of worth and honor. He entreated the duke not to aſk him to profit by this mental malady of his friend. He only in an unlucky hour had done the act, and was willing to ſuffer the puniſhment which it involved.</p>
               <p>The excellent duke eyed them alternately. "You are a couple of brave lads," ſaid he with emotion; "one or other of you muſt have done it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to me candidly: I will report the affair to the king, and who knows what may happen?"</p>
               <p>His arguments, however, were in vain. The two friends perſiſted in their ſtory, and Heaven knows how the affair would have terminated if the <hi>viſum repertum</hi> had not contributed to unravel the myſtery. The body of Moritz had been examined with the uſual formalities, and a detailed account
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035693_0081_10064D0E68E6EAB0"/>
of it drawn up. From theſe minutes it appeared that the wound had been inflicted with a ſword, which, a few inches from the point, had a pretty deep notch. The auditor availed himſelf of this hint, cauſed the ſwords of the two delinquents to be examined, and it was diſcovered that Frederick's ſword had this identical notch. William's denial was now in vain; the affair was decided. Frederick reſigned himſelf to joy, and William to deſpair.</p>
               <p>But the generous conteſt between the two young men had made a deep impreſſion upon the mind of the duke. He reported this extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence to the court, and employed his intereſt to procure a pardon for the parties. William ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly was liberated without puniſhment, and Frederick condemned to a year's labour on the ramparts.</p>
               <p>William now applied himſelf to the ſervice as before; and when he could ſpare an hour, he flew to the ramparts to viſit his friend, and to carry him refreſhments and conſolation; or, when duty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted he would labour for half a day inſtead of his companion. By this generous proceeding, by his attention to his duty, his ſobriety and fidelity, he gained the friendſhip of his ſuperiors in ſo high a degree, that in a year's time he was promoted to be a ſergeant. The period of Frederick's ſentence was now expired, and the two friends were more inſeparable than ever. Officers and privates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered them with ſome degree of reſpect, and William was rendered particularly intereſting by a ſettled melancholy which hung upon his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Alas! how could his heart enjoy tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity when he thought of Jeanette's fate!</p>
               <p>He had received intelligence, that although pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced innocen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

her pregnancy; that this ſentence had been put in execution, and that Jeanette now daily moiſtened her taſk with tears. The image of this ſufferer, ſtill ſo dear to him, haunted his imagination inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly. He could not drink a drop of wine while he knew that Jeanette was languiſhing upon bread and water. He could not be gay while ſhe pined in tears.</p>

               <head>CHAP XV. FORTUNE OF WAR.</head>
               <p>WILLIAM's regiment received ſudden orders to march. The victorious enemy revenged the diſgrace with which their capital had raſhly been threatened. They ruſhed over the boundaries of the German empire, and every effort was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to check their impetuous career.</p>
               <p>William and Frederick fought with diſtinguiſhed courage; for the one fought death, and the other an opportunity to ſave the life of his friend. Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is a quality which combines with every other paſſion; it equally aſſociates itſelf with love and honour, with hatred and revenge. Towards the end of the campaign, one day the grenadier com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the regiment of Oſtein received orders to ſtorm an enemy's redoubt immediately under the eye of the commander in chief. They advanced under a ſhower of grape ſhot. The captain loſt an arm, the firſt lieutenant a leg, and the ſecond was left dead on the ſpot. The enſign, a delicate
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035693_0083_10064D11DC66E790"/>
milkſop, took to flight. The brave grenadiers depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their leaders, expoſed to an horrible diſcharge of artillery, began to give way, and but a moment longer and they would have fled. William then ſprang forward, and exclaimed with animation: "Follow me, my friends! for the king and for our country!"</p>
               <p>With fixed bayonet he aſcended the hill; his companions preſſed round him with wild cries; Frederick was at his ſide. A ſhot carried off his grenadier's cap and half of his ear. Bleeding vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, his head bare, William reached the top of the eminence, and ran through the body the engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer as he was on the point of applying the match to the touch-hole. The conflict was now decided by the bayonet. William received a thruſt through his ſide. Frederick ſtretched upon the ground the man who did it. William ſunk down, and ſhouted "Victory!" Frederick thought his friend was killed, and raged like a lion among the enemy. A private ſoldier here decided the event of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. Reader! you are ſurpriſed?—The gazette, it is true, ſays nothing of the matter. Often, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, has the courage of a common grenadier, whoſe exertions are afterwards rewarded with a crown, atchieved exploits which in future periods, ſhine in the biography of the general.</p>
               <p>The redoubt was taken; the enemy fled; Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam was carried to the hoſpital. His wounds were no farther dangerous than from the loſs of blood they had occaſioned, and in three weeks he was perfectly recovered. He received a meſſage to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at head-quarters.</p>
               <p>"Enſign Meadows," ſaid the general, preſenting him with a ſword, "it gives me pleaſure to reward your gallantry. The king allows you an hundred ducats to provide your accoutrements."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:035693_0084_10064D14B0324D78"/>The modeſt young man was almoſt aſhamed of a diſtinction for which he was conſcious that he was indebted to the courage of deſpair. He even ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to repreſent to the general, that, if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of duty conſtituted any claim to reward, Frederick Perlſtadt's pretenſions were perhaps better founded than his.</p>
               <p>"I have not overlooked his merits," replied the general. "Perlſtadt ſucceeds you."</p>
               <p>Ha! What ſneers were thrown out by the little-minded noblemen when they ſaw William the port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's ſon appear with ſcarf and epaulets, and invited to the general's table! "To raiſe him to the rank of enſign might paſs, as it is poſſible that ſuch a thing might be deſerved; but to bring him to the table of a prince, among men of birth and rank, that was too much."</p>
               <p>The ſneers and the whiſpers were ſtill more loud when William, who had juſt enjoyed the honor of dining with the commander in chief, met his friend Perlſtadt at the door of his tent, and embraced him without ceremony. One of his new comrades, a hero over a glaſs and a lamb in the field of battle, tripped up to him with great ſelf-importance, and, pulling him by the ſleeve, whiſpered: "Enſign, that really is improper."</p>
               <p>"Lieutenant," interrupted William abruptly, "my epaulets have within theſe two hours been changed to gold, and his are ſtill of tape, but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has formed our hearts of the ſame materials.

               <p>William ſmiled—"I have often heard," would he ſay, "that family pride is intolerable, but I find the contrary to be the caſe; for it rids us of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome company."</p>
               <p>Modeſt and unaffected, firmly attached to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed principles, indulgent to fools, and haughty to the inſolent, William ſhowed that he knew how to maintain by the dignity of merit what he had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the field of battle by the equivocal courage of deſpair.</p>

               <p>Jeanette received this gratuity with aſtoniſhment. "Lives there yet a human being in the world who pities me? I know nobody but William, and him I have cruelly injured! His magnanimity, indeed, forgav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He never ſaid a ſyllable more, and neither tears nor entreaties could extort a word from him. Jeanette thought him cruel, but he knew nothing of the matter himſelf.</p>
               <p>What rapture did William feel, when firſt he ſaw Jeanette's ſubſcription! what ſorrow when he read: "The unfortunate Jeanette Jerome returns her thanks to her unknown benefactor, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſhes to know his name.

Thus in the moſt deſolate ſituation ſome cheering bloſſoms ſpring up to the noble mind. He that can ſhare his penny with her he loves, is not poor! He that can impart conſolation to the wretched, is not a ſtranger to joy!</p>
               <p>The army paſſed the winter in ſullen repoſe, like a ſick man who ſinks into a ſhort and feveriſh ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to awake to new ſtruggles.

                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:035693_0087_10064D1ADC8963B0"/>The campaign was opened with great fury; ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes and battles were daily occurrences. Diſcord ſat on a ſable cloud, looked down with a ghaſtly ſmile, and with bloody lips kiſſed her general, <hi>Death,</hi> who with unwearied efforts overthrew the hopes of wives and mothers. William and Frederick, as in the former campaign, behaved with great gallantry. Courage without fortune, however, is like merit without birth; neither of them can obtain diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The two young heroes wanted an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to diſtinguiſh themſelves; and to confeſs the truth, William did not covet ſuch an opportunity ſo eagerly as formerly. What had he to loſe the preceding year? At that time death to him would have been a joyful event. Now, however—who would ſhare the ſcanty pittance with Jeanette, ſhould William fall?—Whoever wiſhes to raiſe an army of deſperate heroes, let him admit no lover among them who contributes to the ſupport of his miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>But ſtop! Once indeed chance preſented the young hero with an opportunity of ſignalizing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and he ſeized it with avidity. Under the view of the king a deciſive action was to be fought. Each party endeavored to gain a march upon the other, in order to be able to occupy the moſt advantageous poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the plain where the action was to take place. It was the intention of the general to extend the left wing to a village, which it was neceſſary to occupy before the arrival of the enemy. A ſtrong corps was detached to take poſſeſſion of this village. The enemy, who had gained a march of ſome miles, were approaching very near. They had already advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the village in great numbers, compelled the corps to give way, and were on the point of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certing the king's plan of operation.</p>
               <p>William ſaw how extremely important it was to gain time. He found himſelf in the middle of the
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035693_0088_10064D1D9BDBF928"/>
diſordered crowd, and was hurried along with the fugitives. By threats and remonſtrances he at laſt collected a little troop, and, with a few hundred grenadiers and ſome rifle-men, threw himſelf into the church, which was ſituated in ſuch a manner as to command the whole of the plain. Here he barricaded the doors with the benches and ſeats, and poſted his men advantageouſly at the windows. Grenadoes were ſcattered among the foe wherever they appeared in numbers, and the rifle-men levell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every one who ventured to come too near.</p>
               <p>The enemy, whoſe numbers every moment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, were ungovernable with rage, to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves checked by a handful of men. In vain they poured ſhowers of balls in at the windows. The gallant fellows were ſheltered by the walls. A ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral advanced, and, convinced of the importance of the poſt, condeſcended, at the head of an army, to offer the little party a free retreat. William an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: He was determined rather to bury himſelf under the ruins of the church.</p>
               <p>Already more dead lay on the graves in the church-yard than under the ground; but William's companions had nearly expended all their ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and the enemy were preparing to open their heavy artillery upon the church, when the king, who had availed himſelf of this diverſion, ſuddenly appeared with the whole army. As long as Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam held out, it was impoſſible for the enemy to form their right wing as they wiſhed. They were, therefore obliged to abandon this poſition entirely, and the fortunate iſſue of the battle was partly aſcribed to the gallant officer who had ſo bravely defend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Who is he? What is his name?" ſaid the king.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:035693_0089_10064D20A2F8F508"/>William was preſented to him. With glowing cheeks and downeaſt eyes, he ſtood as if aſhamed of the ſervice he had performed.</p>
               <p>"I return you my thanks, lieutenant," ſaid the king, "You have this day done us moſt noble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Speak, what can I do for you?"</p>
               <p>"Pleaſe your majeſty!" exclaimed William, throwing himſelf at his ſovereign's feet, "I have an unfortunate ſiſter—ſhe does not carry my name in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed—ſhe is but my half ſiſter—yet I love her more than if we had lai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Three years has ſhe languiſhed in priſon, and three years more is the ill-fated girl condemned to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the crime of a villain. I intreat your majeſty for her liberty!"</p>
               <p>The king inquired the particulars of the affair; and when he heard that Jeanette was entirely inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the child-murder, he granted William's prayer, gave him a letter of recommendation writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his own hand, and leave of abſence for ten days, that he might in perſon announce to his beloved ſiſter her freedom.</p>
               <p>William could not expreſs his thanks, he could only weep. It is a charming thing to ſee a man ſhed tears, who two hours before has performed an heroic action. The king was affected. "I will provide farther for you," ſaid he. William flow out of the tent. Frederick in vain aſked him what was the matter. He could utter only a few broken ſyllables, embraced his friend with tears, ordered his horſe to be ſaddled, and ſet off full ſpeed.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. THE MEETING AND SEPARATION.</head>
               <p>MUNSTER is a city of conſiderable celebrity. The traveller, if he is a politician, viſits with reſpect the town-hall, in which the famous treaty of Weſtphalia was concluded, of which the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent contracting parties obſerved juſt no more than they ſound convenient. If he is a curious traveller, he ſeats himſelf with fear and awe in the chair of king John of Leyden, who twice baptized his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, though once ſeems quite ſufficient. The ſentimental traveller, however, will in future viſit the little cell where for three long years Jeanette ſuffered for the abſurdities of the primitive church, and the arts of prieſtcraft which it had produced.</p>
               <p>The ſhades of evening had already begun to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend upon St. Paul's hill, in the neighbourhood of the town, and the harveſt miſts began to veil the tops of an hundred uſeleſs ſteeples, when William allowed his blowing ſteed to ſtop at the barriers, and with haſty impatience anſwered the queſtions of the officer on guard. He diſmounted at the firſt good inn he came to, gave his horſe to the firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he met, called a porter from the ſtreet to guide him, and, covered with duſt and ſweat, was uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>d into the antichamber of the magiſtrate to whom his letters were addreſſed. Some time elapſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he obtained an audience; for the magiſtrate, in company with his confeſſor and an old gouty counſellor, had five points to play out at an intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing game of ombre. William bit his nails, and viewed, without the leaſt intereſt, the pictures of the ſaints which adorned the antichamber.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="unknown:035693_0091_10064D23E7181268"/>At laſt the doors were opened, and he delivered his diſpatches. The king's ſuperſcription produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a powerful effect; the affair was immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided; but the execution of it was poſtponed till the next day, and the lieutenant invited to ſup. Although for three days William had ſcarcely eaten a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, he felt not the ſlighteſt ſenſation of hunger. He could not conceive how the magiſtrate had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him ſo calmly, how the ſervants ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedly waited at table, and every thing procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo evenly in its natural courſe.</p>
               <p>"Speedy aſſiſtance," ſaid William, "doubles its value. Night appears long to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <speaker>MAGISTRATE.</speaker>
                  <p>—You will firſt do me the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to eat a bit of ſupper?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>WILLIAM.</speaker>
                  <p>—I ſhall cut but a ſorry figure at your table.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>His whole appearance prayed moſt affectingly to be excuſed, as he ſaid theſe words, but there was no remedy. Your great people think they can confer no higher honour upon a common untitled man than to permit him to eat in their company; and as they themſelves place ſo high a value upon the favour, they are not pleaſed that others ſhould treat it with indifference. They do not conſider, that a man of ſenſe and independence pays dearer for his dinner by conſtraint and ceremony, than if he went to dine at the moſt expenſive tavern.</p>
               <p>Poor William ſat upon thorns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whenever he ſaw a new diſh placed upon the table, he was ready to expire with vexation. During ſupper, his excellency read a lecture upon politics, in which he declared that he had long ago predicted, in the cabinet, every thing which had lately happened,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035693_0092_10064D288AA5DC50"/>
and every now and then appealed to the counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor for the truth of his ſtory; and the latter corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated every word with "Yes, brother," and at laſt became as eloquent in his turn, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation related to the different flavours of <hi>Rheniſh.</hi> On this ſubject the confeſſor found himſelf at home. He ſwallowed every glaſs with the air of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeur, ſmacked his lips, and began to rail againſt a party of Pruſſian huſſars, who, when he was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendant of a certain convent, had drank a whole caſk of the beſt old hock.</p>
               <p>At laſt the hour of breaking up arrived, and William received his diſcharge. With what ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity did he deſcend the ſtair-caſe! a little fat ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary was ſcarcely able to follow him. In the ſtreet he would have left his companion behind, if he could have found his way to the correction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe without him. His cool-blooded conductor came blowing, a few ſteps behind him, and by his queſtions of What news from the army? almoſt drove poor William to deſpair.</p>
               <p>"You have gained a battle?"—"Yes."—"It was at firſt reported that you had been defeated?" —"Yes, Sir, you are right."—"How? What? I do not underſtand you."</p>
               <p>"My God! Victorious or defeated, any thing you pleaſe. At preſent I have no leiſure to talk of battles. To-morrow, to-morrow, my good Sir, I will tell you things which at preſent I know nothing about!"</p>
               <p>The ſecretary ſhook his head, as if to ſay that all was not well with the ſtrange gentleman. At laſt, however, they reached the gate of the correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-houſe.</p>
               <p>"We muſt ring," ſaid the ſecretary; and in an inſtant William had broke down the bell. Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette was paying her evening devotions. William was the ſaint to whom ſhe commended herſelf;
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:035693_0093_100646C005F6FA40"/>
for ſhe thought him dead, and her unknown bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor ſhe warmly remembered in her prayers.</p>
               <p>Hark! the haſty tread of a man's footſteps ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded through the long empty paſſage.— What can be the meaning of this late viſit?—Hark! ſome one rattles at the door.—What can it be?— Who drives open the door ſo haſtily?—An officer ruſhes into the cell—Jeanette had not time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſe him—he lay at her feet, and breathleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed—"<hi>Jeanette, you are free!</hi>"</p>
               <p>There are ſcenes in human life which after the curtain drops appear a dream to thoſe who have played the principal parts. Such ſcenes defy all the ſkill of art to repreſent; and if the artiſt does not find the picture already ſketched in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the reader, it is better to throw away the pencil.</p>
               <p>Jeanette was unconſcious of what paſſed around her. Inſenſible ſhe lay in William's arms, inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible was ſhe carried to an hackney coach; and when ſhe at laſt recovered from her ſwoon, in a ſtrange room, ſhe began to conſider, with aſtoniſhment, how ſhe had come into this houſe, and lay in this bed.</p>
               <p>All was ſtill around. Near the bed ſtood a night lamp, which ſhed a melancholy light on the old em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered tapeſtry. "Where am I?" ſaid ſhe. "Did not William appear to me? Alas! I have had ſtrange dreams."</p>
               <p>She now accidentally looked round, and ſaw her beloved ſitting at the bed-ſide; the exceſſive fatigue of the three preceding days and nights had thrown him, in ſpite of his efforts, into a ſhort ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. "William!" ſhouted Jeanette. He awoke, and ſunk down on her boſom. A flood of joyful tears eaſed his panting boſom. After many ſilent embraces, William at laſt recovered ſtrength and recollection to relate his ſtory in broken ſentences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:035693_0094_10064D2D0D1384D8"/>Jeanette liſtened with great attention, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly inquired the period when he was raiſed to be an officer. His anſwer coincided with her ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions. The myſtery of the unknown benefactor was now ſolved.—"Yes, it is you to whom I am indebted for every thing! My heart long ſince whiſpered it to me!"—She hung, ſobbing, round his neck. Day found them diſſolved in delightful tears; night ſurpriſed them in innocent endearments. Quicker than thought two days flew away.</p>
               <p>What might not a young man, who had gained ſo many titles to the love and gratitude of his miſtreſs, have aſked? What might he not have ventured to attempt? But William honoured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and virtue, which, though once left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs in the ſpoiler's cruel fangs, had never forſaken the fair manſion in which they reſided. At the word <hi>innocence,</hi> perhaps ſome prudes may ſneer. It is an eternal truth, however, that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is gone only when the purity of the heart is loſt, and many women, who may boaſt themſelves innocent from man, have forfeited theirs.</p>
               <p>When they began to enjoy ſome moments of tranquility, the queſtion naturally aroſe, "What is to be done with Jeanette?"</p>
               <p>"She ſhall be my wife!" exclaimed, William, and preſſed her, bluſhing, to his breaſt.</p>
               <p>"God forbid," ſaid the generous girl, "that one who has ſuffered an ignominious puniſhment ſhould ſtain thy opening fame! How could you ſubmit to the ſarcaſtic jeſts of your comrades?"</p>
               <p>"Ha! I would—"</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, I know what you would do. You would dye your ſword in blood to wipe away my ſhame; you would make me a widow, or yourſelf a murderer.—No, William, the king cannot truſt the honor of a man who could give his hand to a degraded outcaſt like me. Though I may be more
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035693_0095_10064D2EA45F89E8"/>
unfortunate than capable, though I deſerve pity rather than contempt, this I muſt demonſtrate by the refuſal of a hand, the poſſeſſion of which I ſo willingly would have purchaſed with my blood. You have called me ſiſter—Then, brother William, let us for ever forego the ſweeteſt and the moſt endearing of appellations!"</p>
               <p>William exerted all the eloquence of love to ſhake this reſolution. Five days of his period of abſence were now elapſed, the ſixth arrived, and he had no time to loſe. The heart of the poor girl was aſſailed with careſſes and with ſpecious argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which in ſuch caſes commonly paſs for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible reaſons. She felt that longer reſiſtance exceeded her power, and that ſhe muſt at length yield to the ſolicitations of her lover. With great difficulty ſhe obtained a ſhort reſpite from him till next day.</p>
               <p>When he tenderly preſſed her hand, as he retired to bed, and had opened the door to go to his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe threw herſelf abruptly round his neck, and wept bitterly. "What ails you, Jeanette?" —"Nothing! nothing!—To-morrow! to-morrow!" "How? Do you think with alarm of the happy hour which will extort from you the delightful promiſe to be eternally mine?"—"No! no!— Eternally thine!—Go, good William—ſleep ſound —for God's ſake go!—I can endure it no longer!"</p>
               <p>William withdrew. Delightful hopes ſoon lull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to ſleep, and pleaſant dreams hovered over his head. Haſtily he ſprung out of bed next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, threw on his great coat, and ſlipped ſoftly to the door of Jeanette's room. He found that it was only on the latch, opened it without noiſe, and whiſpered, "Are you awake, dear Jeanette?"— There was no anſwer.—He put his head into the room, it was empty—he threw a glance towards
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035693_0096_10064D302F210870"/>
the bed, it was empty! and, alas! not a trace was to be ſeen that it had been uſed that night at all. The blood flew rapidly to his face, a fearful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage aroſe in his breaſt; with beating heart he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the room, looked anxiouſly round, and ſaw a letter lying upon the table. His eyes devoured it.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, good William! I fly from my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. How could I longer have reſiſted you and my own heart? And yet I muſt reſiſt, to ſpare you diſgrace and repentance. In the violence of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion you will reproach me. Ah! William reproach me not! My reſolution has coſt me a dreadful ſtruggle. Acknowledge, that to be worthy of you I muſt fly. Farewell! baniſh all anxiety on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Your kindneſs has placed me in a ſituation to live for months without other aſſiſtance, till I can find employment in ſome reſpectable family, were it ever in the humble character of a ſervant.— Farewell, inquire not the place of my abode. You muſt never ſee me again, till I can call you brother without a bluſh; till the period of my guilt, of my ſhame, and perhaps of thy love, ſhall be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.—Thy love!—Alas! why muſt I wiſh that?— Stop, poor Jeanette, while you yet have ſtrength to fly!—I have been in your bed-room—I have heard you breathe—perhaps for the laſt time in my life! I thought my heart would have burſt.—Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready I held the lock of the door, when an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible power impelled me to ſlip once more to your bed-ſide, to ſee you once more.—I feared you might awake, and that your impetuous love might annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late my honourable reſolution. I withdrew my hand, and covered with kiſſes and with tears the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the door which to-morrow your fingers would firſt touch. I kneeled upon the threſhold, and with folded hands implored the bleſſing of God upon you.—Now it is over!—I fly to conceal my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from my beloved. Farewell, brother! Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy ill-fated ſiſter!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="unknown:035693_0097_10064D32E7C64810"/>William gazed upon the letter with tearleſs eyes; his lips quivered, but not a word could he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce. After a long pauſe he awoke from his trance, wrung his hands and exclaimed: "Ha! this is too much!" His wild look wandered round the room, ſeeking ſome relic of Jeanette. Alas! not a trace of the beloved fugitive could he fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Yet did ſhe not cover the handle of my bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room door with kiſſes? Did ſhe not kneel upon the threſhold and pray for me?"</p>
               <p>William kneeled in his turn, and prayed for Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, and his tears renewed the faded marks of hers.</p>
               <p>Suddenly inſpired by a burſt of paſſion he ſprang up, raged and ſtormed through the houſe; deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from every kitchen wench, an account what had become of Jeanette, and in the heat of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment knocked down a waiter who very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally aſked him whether the young woman had robbed him.</p>
               <p>When he found that nobody could give him the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherever he ſaw two perſons converſing, he liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear if they talked of Jeanette. Wherever he ſaw a female face lurking behind a window-curtain, he remained ſtanding below, and gazed till curioſity induced ſome ſtranger to look out. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſaw a church door open he ſlipped in, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined every corner where he ſaw ſome devotee kneeling before the image of a ſaint.</p>
               <p>Without having received the leaſt refreſhment, and obliged by the coming night to abandon his ſearch, he returned to his inn. As he went back, he even ventured to cheriſh the hope that Jeanette, during his abſence, might have made her appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

The landlord ſat quietly before the door' ſmoking his pipe. "She muſt certainly be come back!" thought William, "how elſe could the landlord be ſo tranquil?" He attacked him with an hundred queſtions; and when to every word he got no anſwer but an indifferent No, he felt the laſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>His leave of abſence was now reduced to four days. Three he had ſpent in travelling to Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, four were ſtill neceſſary for his return to the camp. His horſe, too, was ſo jaded that it ſeemed doubtful whether he could hold out the journey. At day-break he mounted the battered ſteed, in ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſtupefaction, took the road by which he came; and when, as he aſcended an hill, he turned round to Munſter, the morning ſun ſhone upon his tears.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII. THE WANDERER.</head>
               <p>JEANETTE, with a ſmall bundle hanging on her arm, and a few pieces of gold in her pocket, had ſilently ſtolen at midnight out of the inn. She firſt thought of applying to her old aunt; but after what had happened how could ſhe expect a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come reception? Had ſhe, during three years, ever ſhown the leaſt anxiety about the poor orphan, or ever ſent the leaſt refreſhment to her cell? Jeanette preferred throwing herſelf on the wide world.</p>
               <p>With great difficulty, and by doubling the toll at the gate, ſhe prevailed upon the centinel to let her paſs, under pretence of going to viſit a ſick perſon

in the ſuburbs. When morning dawned, ſhe had already walked a mile, and arrived at a village where two roads croſſed each other. She ſat down to reſt herſelf under a row of trees at the entrance of the village, where ſhe had not been long when a ſtage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coach paſſed by. A few hundred ſteps farther on, the carriage ſtopped at an alehouſe, becauſe the poſtillion, according to the laudable cuſtom of his calling, wiſhed to have his morning pint.</p>
               <p>The idea inſtantly ſtruck Jeanette, "What if I ſhould take a place in this coach, and go on with it, in order the ſooner to eſcape from William's inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?"</p>
               <p>She yet was entirely ignorant whither the road on which ſhe now travelled conducted. This, however, was of little conſequence, as ſhe had the world before her, and had left Munſter behind. In the firſt conſiderable town, whatever it was, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to apply for ſervice.</p>
               <p>Engroſſed with theſe reflections ſhe went into the alehouſe, and found the poſtillion at breakfaſt. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He grinned at the ſight of her white teeth, expreſſed his conſent by a nod, and ſeaſoned his complaiſance with ſome dry jokes at the expence of the ſolitary pedeſtrian. After he had finiſhed his breakfaſt, and with ruſtic politeneſs invited Jeanette to drink a glaſs, he went out to the coach: "Gentlemen, ſit a little cloſer if you pleaſe, and make room for a pretty young girl, who has walked herſelf lame." With blunt officiouſneſs he aſſiſted Jeanette into her place; and, as the weather was fine, he took his great coat down from the coach-box, and ſpread it under the ſeat as a bolſter. The power of beauty is felt by the peaſant as well as the poet, and the poſtillion's coat was as great an homage to Jeanette's charms as a ſonnet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="unknown:035693_0100_1006488305B47300"/>When ſhe took her ſeat ſhe apologiſed to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers with modeſt condeſcenſion for incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them. It was impoſſible to be angry with her, and they willingly made room.—A ſtage-coach is often a place where a young woman, like <hi>Greſſet's Vert-vert,</hi> finds herſelf in bad company. Jeanette had already experienced this the firſt time ſhe went to Munſter to her aunt. Scarcely had ſhe now taken her ſeat, therefore, when ſhe began unobſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to examine the phyſiognomies of her fellow-travellers, to diſcover what ſhe had to hope or to fear.</p>
               <p>This ſurvey (for which the penetrating, infallible eye of a woman requires only a ſecond, were the coach ſtuffed as full as Noah's ark) gave her great ſatisfaction, as ſhe ſaw four or five grave old men who had the appearance of merchants, and did not ſeem inclined to interrupt her melancholy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Inſtead of ſaluting her, they had only pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up their night-caps a little, and one of them offered Jeanette a pinch of ſnuff. This how<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er, was all; they gave themſelves no farther concern about her.</p>
               <p>She felt a ſtrong deſire to aſk the perſon who had offered to ſhare the contents of his ſnuff-box with her, to what place the coach was going. She was afraid, however, of betraying by this queſtion that ſhe was ſetting out in the wide world without object or proviſion, and by that means attracting attention. She therefore remained ſilent; her companions continued ſilent alſo, and ſeemed as if they were calculating the profit or loſs of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. The gloomy ſilence, which was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted only by an exclamation of "God bleſs us!" when any of the company happened to ſneeze, cheriſhed Jeanette's melancholy; and the jolting and rattling of the carriage could not withdraw her from her comfortleſs reflections.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="unknown:035693_0101_100648854C64F940"/>For the firſt two days they travelled only through villages and little towns, the names of which were utterly unknown to Jeanette, as ſhe had never troubled herſelf much about geography. As ſhe had no opportunity in theſe obſcure places to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the object ſhe had in view, ſhe purſued her journey. On the evening of the third day, as ſhe gazed penſively on the fields and trees on the right hand, which ſeemed to recede from the coach, ſhe ſuddenly ſtarted, and with difficulty ſuppreſſed a loud ſhriek.</p>
               <p>William rode paſt the carriage!—His horſe moved on at a ſluggiſh trot; William's head was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined upon his breaſt, and his eyes ſeemed to be ſo intent on the pummel of his ſaddle, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once looked at the ſtage-coach. Indeed he could not have ſeen Jeanette, as ſhe ſat back in a corner. A ſingle glance was enough for a lover, and ſhe would have pledged her ſalvation that it was William. How it appeared evident, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ying from him him ſhe was running directly into his arms.</p>
               <p>"My God! what ſhall I do now?—At the next ſtage the carriage will be emptied, I muſt diſmount, and perhaps meet William at the door!"</p>
               <p>She became reſtleſs and uneaſy on her ſeat, her face glowed, her heart beat. The nearer they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the ſtage, the more violent her anxiety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came. One of the paſſengers happened to aſk the poſtillion, "Friend, have we far yet to go?"—"Half a mile farther yet," replied the poſtillion, Jeanette was alarmed, and formed an haſty reſolution. "Stop, friend!" cried ſhe ſuddenly. The poſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion ſtopped. She took up her bundle, put half a guinea into the poſtillion's hand, and bade him drive on.</p>
               <p>"What a God's name do you mean, Miſs? What! It is almoſt dark. You don't mean to ſtay here on the road all night.?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="unknown:035693_0102_10064887069CB7F0"/>"In the next village I am at home," returned Jeanette; "drive on if you pleaſe without me." The poſtillion ſhook his head, mounted his horſe, cracked his whip, and in a few minutes the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age diſappeared from Jeanette's view. She looked after it with a kind of ſtupefaction; and when ſhe ſaw herſelf alone and helpleſs amidſt all nature, when ſhe heard the cricket chirrup its evening ſong, and the graſshopper buzzing in the buſhes, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to weep bitterly.</p>
               <p>"Poor girl! what will now become of you?— Return?—Whither?—Advance—Alas! Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam!"—She paced on a little way upon the high road, till on the left hand ſhe ſaw a little foot-path, which ſhe followed without farther conſideration, and in ſecret prayer ſhe proceeded.</p>
               <p>Hitherto twilight had ſhed a feeble ray upon the pathway, but night darkened round, and ſhe found herſelf at the entrance of a thick wood. A few moments ſhe ſtood irreſolute, but her courage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived. "This foot-path," thought ſhe, "muſt lead to the abode of men. I muſt ſurely find ſome village, or at leaſt a farm-houſe, and the deeper in the wood the better." At firſt ſhe purſued her way with ſpirit; but the darkneſs every moment increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the ſullen ſilence was interrupted only by the diſtant cooing of the wood-pigeon. She felt a fearful oppreſſion ſteal round her heart which ſhe had never before experienced. She redoubled her ſpeed, and terror lent her new ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Till now ſhe thought that ſee had obſerved the marks of a beaten foot-path; but at length her progreſs became ſo embarraſſed by the thick twining buſhes, that ſhe began to fear ſhe ſhould loſe the path altogether. Alas! what ſhe feared ſoon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. She ſuddenly found herſelf in a ſmall opening, bare of trees; and where all around the pines and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

oppoſed their cloſe-grown twigs, and appriſed her that here no human foot had ſmoothed a paſſage. Terror now deprived her of ſtrength and reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſhe groped round as if ſtruck blind, and was unable to find the path by which ſhe had come. Trembling, ſhe ſunk down upon the root of a tree, and recommended herſelf to God and to his angels.</p>
               <p>In about an hour the moon roſe, and with it a beam of hope in her ſoul. She roſe, and choſe the place where it ſeemed eaſieſt to penetrate through the buſhes. After ſhe had wrought her way through with great perſeverance for a conſiderable diſtance, her hands ſcratched and bloody, and her white cloak torn to pieces on the thorns, ſhe came to a hedge, which, as far as the feeb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She had not advanced many ſteps farther when ſhe really ſaw a light at a diſtance. "Ha! a light! ſhe haſtily cried, and felt her ſtrength invigorated. With renewed courage ſhe followed the ſide of the hedge, advanced towards the light, and ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that it iſſued from the window of a little houſe which was thatched with ſtraw, but yet had a better appearance than common cottages. It was ſurrounded by a few out-houſes, and ſkirted all round by the wood.</p>

               <p>Such thoughts as theſe lay heavy upon Jeanette's breaſt when ſhe ſaw the little houſe in the midſt of the wood. "Could I but find an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>She advanced a few ſteps nearer till ſhe came to an aged oak, which ſhaded a ſeat formed of turf. Higher up on the trunk of the tree ſomething glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the light of the moon. It was a white board with ſome inſcription, and faſtened to the tree by a gilt thong. Jeanette ſtepped up on the bench, and by the moonlight read the following lines in French:

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Jeanette, "here lives ſome mortal who has quarreled with the world; he will not ſhut his door upon the wretched."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:035693_0105_1006488DD7E34BA0"/>Animated with hope, ſhe leaped down from the bench, and went ſtraight to the houſe-door. A large dog with a chain about his neck ſuddenly ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of his kennel, and bawled out like a review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Jeanette was frightened, and did not venture to approach. She ſtood like a young baſhful au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, whom the reviewer denies admittance into the temple of fame, the ſacred receſſes of which he himſelf enters as little as the watch-dog the houſe of his maſter. Both are kept only to bark, and to growl at every ſtranger.</p>
               <p>At the noiſe which the dog made, Jeanette thought ſhe ſaw the light in the houſe move paſt the window. She heard a bolt drawn; the door opened, a man looked out, ſaid "Tuſh, <hi>Fagel!</hi>" to the dog; and when the bark ſoftened into a lower growl, the woodman turned to the place where the white figure of Jeanette glanced in his eye, and cried: "Who is there?"—Jeanette told in a few words that ſhe had loſt her way, and begged a night's lodging.</p>
               <p>The ſtranger anſwered not a word. He went in and ſhut the door behind him. The poor wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er could not conceive what this meant. The cur again began to rage as before; the light appeared to be placed in its old ſituation; and, except the dog, nobody ſeemed to think of her being there.</p>
               <p>After a few minutes of anxious expectation, the light again moved through the houſe; the bolt was withdrawn, the door grated on its hinges, the man who had before come out, made his appearance, ſaid "Tuſh, <hi>Fagel!</hi>" to the dog, and to Jeanette two words: "Come in."—Jeanette followed. She now perceived by the light of the lamp that her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor was an old man, with a blue jacket and cloſe cut hair. He did not appear to ſhare the curioſity with which ſhe viewed him, as he ſcarcely once looked at her. He led her into a little room adjoining to
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:035693_0106_10064890E94F2648"/>
the lobby. "Here is a bed," ſaid he; put the lamp on the table, and retired.</p>
               <p>Jeanette knew not well what to think of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary reception. She examined the room, in which a kind of indigent cleanlineſs ſeemed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. The furniture conſiſted of a ſmall folding bed with fine bed-clothes, a looking-glaſs with a brown frame, two tables covered with green cloth, and ſix ſtraw-bottomed chairs. The floor was ſtrewed with white ſand and new cut fir branches. The only articles which ſeemed to indicate the owner to be a man of property, were four valuable landſcapes by <hi>Wouvermann,</hi> which were fixed to the wall.</p>
               <p>When ſhe obſerved that all was quiet in the houſe, and that nobody thought any thing more of her, ſhe threw herſelf in her clothes upon the bed; and exhauſted by three ſleepleſs nights, by bodily exertion and mental diſtreſs, ſhe enjoyed a pretty calm night's reſt. The day was well advanced when ſhe was awaked by a noiſe in the room. It was the ſame ſilent man who had attended her the night before. He entered with a baſket, from which, without ſaying a word, he drew a white cloth, and ſpread it upon the table. He then pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon it bread, butter, cheeſe, honey, a baſon of milk, and a glaſs of ſmall beer. "Here is break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt," ſaid he, and again withdrew.</p>
               <p>This laconic invitation extorted a ſmile from Jeanette. She remained lying on the bed for half an hour, and puzzled herſelf with conjectures to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the ſingular behaviour of her hoſt. She then roſe, and refreſhed herſelf with bread and milk. As ſhe happened to look out at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, ſhe obſerved another man, about forty years of age, in a grey coat, and ſhort hair like the other. He ſat upon the turf ſeat under the oak, reading a book. His pale, haggard countenance bore the traces of ſorrow; his eyes were hollow, and ſhaded
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:035693_0107_1006489477624C88"/>
with ſhaggy eyebrows, which gave his features a gloomy character mixed with ſomething of wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Jeanette conſidered him long with attention. She concluded that he was the maſter of the houſe; and ſhe reſolved, as ſoon as he gave up reading, to throw herſelf in his way, to thank him for his hoſpitable entertainment, and to offer herſelf to him as maid-ſervant. The man in grey, however, did not ſeem diſpoſed to quit his place. Sometimes indeed, he laid aſide his book, ſtroked a ſpaniel, or cut a piece of hazle, in doing which he loſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in meditation; he would then take up the book again, though he ſeemed to read but little.</p>
               <p>About mid-day the ſervant, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch Jeanette con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the man in the blue jacket, placed a table under the oak tree, and carried out a few frugal diſhes, of which the man in grey ſparingly partook. Immediately after the ſervant brought the ſame fare to Jeanette, and ſaid: "Here is dinner," and went away. "Theſe men," thought Jeanette, "are not curious. It appears to be very indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to them who I am. I however am very anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to know who the perſon is to whom I owe this aſylum."</p>
               <p>When the ſervant returned to clear the table, ſhe ventured, for the firſt time, to aſk him a queſtion: "Where am I?"—"Among honeſt people," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the man, and went his way. Jeanette con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that ſpeech was here uſed only as a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not, as at court, as a luxury. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her deſire to gratify her female curioſity, ſhe felt a repugnance equally ſtrong to haraſs by her queſtions; and ſhe ſtruggled with herſelf the whole morning, whether ſhe ſhould go out and ſpeak to the man in grey. More than once ſhe had the door in her hand; but after ſhe had ſummoned courage to make her propoſals, ſhe perceived that the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:035693_0108_1006489763FA7EB8"/>
had left his ſeat, and hid himſelf in the woods.</p>
               <p>The ſhades of evening cloſed around. The man in the blue jacket brought a lamp, and ſaid: "Here is a light." In a little white he covered the table in ſilence; and when he had placed the victuals upon it, he retired, ſaying: "Here is your ſupper." The converſation for the day there cloſed. Jeanet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te remained alone, neither ſaw nor heard any thing farther, and ſlept as well as ſhe could till next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>When next day her breakfaſt was placed on the table, and ſhe had begun to eat, the monoſyllabic man in blue ſaid: "Now you may go. The road on the left hand takes you out of the wood."— "Alas! my friend!" ſaid Jeanette, "does your maſter want no ſervant girl?"—The man in blue for the firſt time looked her broad in the face, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered however not a word, but went out to his maſter, who was ſeated under the oak-tree. In a few minutes he returned, and ſaid: "No. The left hand road takes you out of the wood."</p>
               <p>"I ſhall go this moment," ſaid Jeanette with a ſigh; "but may I not be permitted to return your maſter my thanks?"—"No!" was the rough an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with which the man in blue left her. Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and diſconſolate ſhe went to the window, every moment thought of preparing to ſet out, and ſtill poſtponed it. "Where ſhall I find an aſylum ſo peculiarly adapted for the gloomy temper of my ſorrow? The buſtle of cities, the ceremony of great houſes, the importunity of talkative men—and here—this dreary wilderneſs, the ſolemn firs, the domeſtic ſilence—O! he muſt retain me; the ſtrange mortal there under the oak muſt take me into his ſervice."</p>
               <p>Suddenly ſhe felt, as it were, ſomething whiſper her: "To ſucceed in your object with ſingular characters you muſt yourſelf act in a ſingular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner."
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:035693_0109_1006489A96338478"/>
—The day before ſhe had accidentally obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that at this hour the ſervant had brought ſome pails out of an adjoining houſe, taken them to the well, and waſhed them clean. He had then gone into a little ſhed where a couple of cows were kept, milked them, and brought the milk into the houſe.</p>
               <p>On this diſcovery, Jeanette immediately formed her plan. She haſtily pinned up her gown, went out without heſitation, carefully avoided looking at the man in grey as ſhe paſſed him under the oak-tree, went into the out-houſe, took the pails, and waſhed them clean at the well. She then poſted to the ſhed, milked the cows, and proceeded to carry the milk into the houſe. All this ſhe did with the ſame neatneſs and dexterity as if ſhe had been accuſtomed to it all her life.</p>
               <p>The man in grey dropped his book upon his knees, and eyed her with ſurpriſe. When ſhe came out of the ſhed and was paſſing by him, he ſaid: "What is the meaning of this?"</p>
               <p>"Good Sir!"—"I am no good Sir! But I am a man!"—"Alas! I am unfortunate."—"Who is not ſo?"—"I wiſh to remain with you as maid-ſervant."—"I want no maid-ſervant."—"If you do not want me—Ah! good Sir! I ſtand in need of you!"</p>
               <p>The man in grey remained a few moments ſilent. "Peter!" cried he to the ſervant, "the girl may ſtay." After theſe words he took up the book, and took no farther notice of Jeanette.</p>

Had not Jeanette been a lovely girl, had not her hand excelled the milk in whiteneſs, and her form tranſcended the elegance of the poplars, perhaps the man in grey might have conſidered her unbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den officiouſneſs as extremely impertinent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable. But it was impoſſible to meet the glance of the lovely girl's fine benignant eye, without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome emotion of kindneſs, though you had been ſtretched on a bed of thorns.

"She is unfortunate," thought he, "and imagines that it is poſſible in this world to enjoy happineſs.

All this ſhe did without ſaying a word; for ſhe had already obſerved that in this houſe <hi>ſilence</hi> was the greateſt recommendation, and ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſhew the man in grey, that it was not neceſſary to baniſh the fair ſex from his ſolitude on account of their reputed deficiency in this virtue.</p>
               <p>Peter ſtood and gazed at her. He ſaid not a word indeed, but he ſmiled kindly, and ſometimes with a half nod muttered Ha! hem! However eagerly Jeanette longed to know where, and in whoſe houſe ſhe was, ſhe reflected that her ſilent hoſt had ſtill a better right to anticipate her curious inquiries; and as he allowed her to remain undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, ſhe thought it fair to obſerve a ſimilar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy.</p>
               <p>Thus paſſed a whole month without a human voice being heard in the ſolitude. Every hour of the day was dedicated to its appropriate employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, every employment had its eſtabliſhed form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Good morning! Good night! were expreſſed with a nod of the head, and at moſt by a ſingle word. The diſhes required for dinner were ſettled and communicated to Jeanette by their bare appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Never once had they inquired her name. When ſhe was called, it was, Girl!—The man in grey was called Maſter, and the valet was called Peter.</p>
               <p>Jeanette endeavored, by every little attention, to win the favor of her new maſter. She had now cauſe to rejoice that her old aunt at Munſter had initiated her in the myſteries of cookery. From the happy days of her youth ſhe had ſtill cheriſhed her propenſity for gardening. She was ſkilled in rearing fruits and flowers; and every thing, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In a corner of the kitchen-garden ſhe choſe a ſpot of good rich ſoil for a flower-plot. "Peter," ſaid ſhe, "take the ſpade and dig me this ſpot." Peter looked at her, ſmiled, muttered, with a half nod, Hem! hem! ha! and prepared the ground as he was deſired. In a ſhort time, roſes and hyacinths began to ſhoot up, which Jeanette carefully watered every evening. When they began to perfume the air with their full-blown beauties, ſhe tranſplanted them into flower-pots, and ſtuck them in the ground, by the turf bench, round the oak-tree. When the man in grey repaired next morning, as, uſual, to his favorite ſpot, it ſeemed as if during the night, roſes and hyacinths had ſprung up under his feet.</p>
               <p>When he firſt obſerved this little piece of gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he ſtood a good while gazing at it. Peter brought breakfaſt, and his maſter pointed with his finger to the roſes. Peter underſtood him, and anſwered, "The girl."</p>
               <p>"The girl!" involuntarily repeated the man in grey, and a ſmile eſcaped him which ſtill pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a guinea, gave it to Peter, and ſaid "The girl." Peter carried the money, with the words, "From maſter."</p>
               <p>"For what?"—"For the flowers."—"If the flowers afford maſter any pleaſure, I am rewarded. Kindneſs cannot be purchaſed with gold."</p>
               <p>Peter looked at her with a little aſtoniſhment, and for the firſt time in his life clapped her on her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. He carried the money back, laid it on the table, and ſaid: "She refuſes."—"Why?"</p>
               <p>She ſays, "If the flowers have afforded maſter any pleaſure, ſhe is rewarded. Kindneſs is not to be purchaſed with money."—"Said ſhe ſo?"— "Yes."</p>
               <p>This time the countenance of the man in grey relaxed into a ſmile, in which the ſeverity was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt totally eclipſed. Thus did Jeanette avail her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of every opportunity which preſented to ſmooth the brow or the humouriſt. He was not ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; he was ſenſible of the effort, though he long remained ſilent. When ſhe paſſed him in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to milk the cows, he could not refrain from lifting his eyes from the book, and looking after her. This ſtolen pleaſure had, without his being aware of it, become ſo neceſſary to him, that, if ſhe happened to be longer in coming than uſual, his eye wandered an hundred times from the book to the houſe-door, to catch her dear form. This, however, was all. In the ſame uniformity paſſed a quarter of a year. Jeanette could not help feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her female vanity a little hurt, that with all her efforts, and all her attention, ſhe had not been able to intereſt the man in grey ſo far as to inquire her name. At laſt, however, ſhe hit upon a thought, the execution of which at firſt appeared extremely difficult, but which ſucceeded beyond her hopes.</p>
               <p>"Who made the tablet which hangs on the oak?" ſaid ſhe one day to Peter.—"It was I."—"And
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:035693_0114_100648ADCE234B10"/>
who painted the inſcription?"—"I."—"Are you a painter?"—"I was in my youth."</p>
               <p>"I am glad of that. Make me ſuch a tablet." Peter looked and ſmiled. "Are you ſerious?"— "Yes. You muſt ſay nothing of it, however, to your maſter. I wiſh to procure him an unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pleaſure." Peter laughed, again muttered hem! hem! and made the tablet. When it was ready, Jeanette gave him a ſtanza to be inſcribed upon it. Peter wrought <hi>con amore,</hi> and ſurpaſſed himſelf. The kind thanks with which Jeanette repaid his trouble gave him more ſatisfaction than the celebrated <hi>Caſanova</hi> enjoys in a preſent from the Semiramis of the North.</p>
               <p>When the man in grey, according to cuſtom, ſlipped out one morning to the turf ſeat under the oak-tree, and happened to look up to the trunk, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! the old tablet was taken away; in its place hung a new one, on which he read, with great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, the following words:
<q>

               <p>He read it over twice, three times, and could ſcarcely believe his eyes. Peter brought breakfaſt, his maſter pointed with his finger to the tablet. Peter underſtood the geſture, and replied with a ſmile, "<hi>The girl.</hi>"</p>

                  </gap> involuntarily repeated the man in grey, and ſmiled without any mixture of ſeverity. When Jeanette paſſed by, quite unconcerned, a ſhort time after, to pay her morning viſit to the cows, he could no longer maintain his reſerve. "Girl!" cried he.—"Sir," replied Jeanette, and turned round to him.</p>
               <p>"Who are you?"—"I am unfortunate."—"Can you tell me no more?"—"Excuſe me."—"Well, I am not diſpleaſed to ſee the unfortunate take ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uge with me. Will you remain with me till I die?" —"Moſt willingly."—"What is your name?"— "Jeanette."—"Well, you may go." Jeanette with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.</p>
               <p>The man in grey had not ſpoken ſo much at one time for many years. He was ſurpriſed, even him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, at the effort, and fell into a profound medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which he forgot his morning walk.

This explanation, however, produced no alteration in the mode of life of the hermit and his domeſtics. Every thing moved on in its uſual courſe; and except the new inſcription upon the oak, every thing remained in its former place.</p>
               <p>Winter had now ſtripped the leaves from the trees, covered Jeanette's flower-garden with ſnow, and kept the man in grey confined to his chamber. To the want of exerciſe, perhaps, it was owing that ſecret grief, and inceſſant brooding over a ſilent ſorrow, affected his health this ſeaſon more than he had before experienced. He was attacked by a ſevere illneſs.</p>

diſtreſs. Jeanette never ſtirred from his bed. Botany, formerly the amuſement her youth, ſhe now employed with advantage. In the morning ſhe prepared him cooling draughts, and made him drink potions made from the juice of the moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſalutary fruits. For dinner ſhe made him light vegetable ſoups; in the evening ſhe took a book from his ſmall but ſelect library, and read till he fell aſleep. She then lay down, without throwing off her clothes, on a ſofa in the adjoining room, and if the patient but ſtirred ſhe was with him in an inſtant.</p>
               <p>By her unwearied care his health was in a few weeks re-eſtabliſhed. He appeared ſtill, it is true, as formerly, penſive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>"Go to Jeanette's chamber," ſaid he one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Peter, "and lay this pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Go to your maſter's room," ſaid ſhe to Peter, "and lay this purſe upon his table." Peter obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the purſe was ſent three times backwards and forwards, without any farther explanation taking place upon the ſubject. The man in grey was at laſt obliged to put up his purſe again in his pocket. In the evening, as he ſtood at the window, with his face to the caſement, and his back to Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette, he began, contrary to cuſtom, to whiſtle a tune. Suddenly he ſtopped, and without turning round ſaid, in a low heſitating voice: "you take no money?"</p>
               <p>"No!" replied Jeanette. The man in grey continued to whiſtle, and beat time with his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers upon the glaſs, but ſaid not a word more.</p>
               <p>Next day, however, at dinner-time, when Peter
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:035693_0117_100648B9F708E5D0"/>
began to cover the table, his maſter ſaid, "Lay two covers." Peter ſtarted, and remained ſtanding in the middle of his work, like a clock run out, till his maſter gravely repeated the order. He then placed the two covers, without ſaying a word, and thought with himſelf that company muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. No gueſt appeared, however, and dinner was ſerved up.</p>
               <p>"Call Jeanette!"—Jeanette appeared.—"Sit down, and dine with me."</p>
               <p>Jeanette felt the kindneſs of this behaviour. She ſat down, and attempted to eat; but the tears ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her eye, and ſhe could not ſwallow a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. The man in grey threw a ſtolen glance at her. "Why do you weep?" ſaid he. Jeanette roſe, and ran out of the room.</p>
               <p>"She is a good girl!" muttered the hermit; a ſmile played round his lips, but inſtead of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſeverity it was blended with a look of ſorrow.</p>

The man in grey bowed to the authority, as a loyal old Frenchman would have done to a diſagreeable order announced <hi>de par le Roi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two hundred paces from the houſe lay a little hillock, overgrown with thick buſhes and ſhrubbery. When ſpring began to open the leaves on the trees, Jeanette requeſted the ever obliging Peter to clear the top of the hillock, and to leave only as much as was neceſſary to form a bower. The ivy, the jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamine, and the honey-ſuckles were arched over a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He ſaid nothing; but, when Jeanette retired a few ſteps to pull a bunch of May-flowers, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round, and nodded to Peter with an inquiſitive air. Peter nodded and winked. Another time, Jeanette privately bought a nightingale from a country girl. This was a bird rarely ſeen in this part of the wood, where only owls ſcreeched and hawks ſcreamed. She hung the ſweet ſinger, in the evening, under the window of her maſter's bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room. The bird began his melodious ſong, now in plaintive, now in joyous notes. The man in grey
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:035693_0119_100648C0E2492920"/>
awoke from his firſt ſlumber, liſtened, wondered, and rejoiced at this unuſual viſit; and he even wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the nightingale might not be a paſſing gueſt, but that it might build a neſt in the garden.</p>
               <p>When he opened the window next morning, he perceived from whence the ſerenade had proceeded.

The queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is unneceſſary, thought he: who elſe can it be but the girl?</p>
               <p>Penſive and abſent he ſat down to the tea-table, and ſtirred the tea round and round with the ſpoon, to melt the ſugar which he had forgot to put in.— "Jeanette!" ſaid he in a low voice.—"Jeanette!" repeated he a little louder.—"Jeanette!" exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he the third time, with ſome degree of vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence.</p>

               <p>He was conſcious of this change, and his heart opened to tender ſenſations. How dear Jeanette had become to him, and what might be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the attachment, he had never reflected; and an opportunity alone was wanting to appriſe him of the true nature of his feelings.</p>
               <p>Since the bower on the top of the hillock had been reared, he had, in a great meaſure, deſerted his former favourite ſpot, the turf bank under the oak-tree. He often ſtole, well pleaſed, through the fields, and hied by the winding path to the top of the hill, where an unconfined proſpect no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as formerly, was diſagreeable.</p>
               <p>One day, as he was approaching the bower with ſilent ſteps, he thought he heard an unuſual noiſe. He liſtened, and he imagined he heard ſome one ſob. By a ſudden turn he entered the bower, and diſcovered Jeanette in tears. She had been think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of William, and her tears flowed to abſence and to love. She ſtarted up, and endeavoured to force a ſmile. The man in grey, however, looked her keenly in the face. "Jeanette," ſaid he, "you weep!" She could not anſwer.—"Are you ſtill unhappy?"</p>
               <p>"Alas! No! I am as happy as I can ever be upon earth."</p>

               <p>"Do you mean this ſeriouſly?"—"I ſhould hate myſelf if I thought differently; I ſhould deſpiſe myſelf if I could act differently."—A pauſe enſued. The man in grey ſeized Jeanette's hand with emotion, led her to the turf bank, and ſaid with tender accents: "My good child, I entreat your confidence; tell me the cauſe of your unhapneſs!"</p>
               <p>"Were you to know that, you would expel me from this ſolitude, the only aſylum which is now left me."</p>
               <p>"With you, then, I ſhould baniſh the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my life." And a violent glow ruſhed to his cheeks, as if he had been aſhamed of this invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untary confeſſion.

               <p>"Let us take a walk, dear Jeanette!" ſaid he in the evening. They went up in ſilence to the hill, and ſat down, as the preceding day, upon the turf bank before they exchanged a word. A long pauſe followed. Jeanette looked round with em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment, and twiſted the leaves which hung down from the arching honeyſuckles. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring penetration which is inſeparable from a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male mind in caſes of this nature enabled her to anticipate the ſcene which was impending. The man in grey ſat with his head reclining upon his breaſt, and his heart ſeemed labouring to be deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered from a heavy burden. "Jeanette!" ſaid he at laſt, "do you ſtill continue in the ſentiments which you expreſſed yeſterday?"—"I ſhall never entertain any other."—Then you renounce your William?"</p>
               <p>Jeanette with a ſigh: "I have already renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him forever!"</p>
               <p>The man in grey, with ſaltering voice, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing figures in the ſand with his cane, continued: "Will you marry me?"</p>
               <p>Jeanette ſtarted. A queſtion ſo abrupt ſhe had not anticipated. She gazed at the man in grey with a look which teſtified ſome feeling of horror,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:035693_0124_100648D29EBF5A68"/>
an emotion quite foreign to the ſentiments which he had hitherto inſpired.</p>
               <p>"Yeſterday," proceeded he viſibly relieved, "you honored me with your confidence, and it is juſt that I ſhould return it. My hiſtory you ſhall hear in a few words.—I am a Dutchman, and my name is Van Shipper. My father was a rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who loved money beyond every thing in the world. The little cultivation which my mind has received, I owe to my reſidence in foreign countries, and to the peruſal of good books.</p>
               <p>"When I returned home, I had the misfortune to fall in love with a young lady of great beauty. I wiſhed to make her my wife, but durſt not gratify my deſire for fear of offending my father. The threat of diſinheriting me, added fuel to the flame. I endeavoured to perſuade her to elope with me, and would have ſacrificed for her every expectation of preſent fortune. Before, however, my plan could be accompliſhed, a German coxcomb brought the peſt of ſentimental cant into her family, and ſhe became faithleſs.</p>
               <p>"I now exchanged love to the fair ſex for love to my country. I became what was called a patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, and was baniſhed. A perſon of the name of <hi>Fag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ſhould have forgotten the worthleſs fellow, but that the name of my dog daily reminds me of him. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was offered for my apprehenſion. My father was dead. I ventured to go ſecretly as far as Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, and lived ſome weeks concealed in the houſe of my mother. There I made arrangements for remitting my property out of the country. I had already ſafely transferred one half of it, when I learnt that I was betrayed by my own mother. Party ſpirit and fanaticiſm trample upon the feelings of nature. I was on the point of being arreſted; I
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:035693_0125_100648D66CB1AE50"/>
fled, and truſted the other half of my property with my own brother, by whom I have been cheated of it. Thus did fate diſſolve the bands of love, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and nature. I remained alone in the world, and in vain opened my arms to catch to my heart a being of congenial diſpoſition. I then withdrew into this ſolitude, accompanied by a ſingle domeſtic, whoſe ſtupidity ſeemed a pledge for his honeſty.</p>
               <p>"What I have been able to ſave from the wreck of my fortune is far more than I ſpend, but ſtill leſs than my heart requires. Since I have known you, the paſt ſeems a dream, and the future begins to ſmile upon me. I cannot live without you. A man like me of eight-and-thirty, rough and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withal, can ſcarce venture to pretend to your love. If, however, you are ſerious in your reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſpend your life in this ſequeſtered ſolitude, why not as my wife? as my cloſe united friend and companion?—You have reſtored confidence in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity to my breaſt, if you conſent to confer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and tranquillity upon me, ſay the tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>yes!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"You are ſilent?—You tremble?—Do I gueſs your ſentiments?—The heart can love but once!— No, dear Jeanette, you are miſtaken. Try only to make a human being happy, and you will ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an attachment to your own work.—Come, then! accept the hand of an honeſt man, and let me bleſs the hour which brought you to this wood!"</p>
               <p>Jeanette, trembling and bluſhing, heard only one half of his narration, and of the apoſtrophe at the end nothing at all. An hundred times had ſhe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly lamented that the day before ſhe had not been more candid; that ſhe had not diſcovered all, even at the riſk of being turned once more into the wide world. The man in grey, indeed, was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to her, but the ſentiment he inſpired was not

She opened her mouth to make a full confeſſion, but her tongue refuſed its office, and ſhame cloſed her lips.</p>
               <p>The man in grey looked in her face with pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating eyes; he read confuſion and anxiety, but no repugnance. This obſervation gave him courage, and he became more preſſing. At length, with faltering accents, Jeanette entreated permiſſion to give him her anſwer in writing. "When?" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed he eagerly.—"To-morrow," ſaid the wretched girl, and haſtened away. He was about to follow her—She turned round "For goodneſs ſake leave me alone!"—He withdrew. She plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the receſſes of the wood, where ſhe wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till it was dark, conſidering with herſelf in what terms ſhe ſhould couch her confeſſion. The attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the man in grey flattered her; the loſs of it was inevitable, and it was painful. Yet to loſe his eſteem—the thought was intolerable!—"But it muſt be ſo! Better to ſuffer what I have merited; better to ſink to the ſituation of a deſpiſed woman, than to deceive a worthy man who is my bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor."</p>
               <p>Having finiſhed her ſoliloquies with this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, ſhe returned to the hermitage. She did not make her appearance in the parlour before Mr. Van Shipper, whom ſhe heard pacing through the room. She prepared ſupper as expeditiouſly as ſhe could, and retired to her cloſet.</p>
               <p>Peter covered the table, and laid only one cover. His maſter pointed to it, and ſaid: "Why?"— "The girl does not ſup."—"Where is ſhe?"— "She is in her room."—"What is ſhe doing?"—
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:035693_0127_100648DD4CEEFD48"/>
"I can't tell."—"How does ſhe look?"—"She has been weeping."—The man in grey redoubled his ſtrides. Peter placed the diſhes on the table, took his ſtation with his towel under his arm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the chair, and coughed ſeveral times to make his maſter perceive that ſupper was waiting. When he found that neither coughing nor ſtamping the ground produced the effect, he at laſt took the freedom to ſay: "Supper is cooling." This hint, however, he was obliged to repeat three times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. Van Shipper could be ſo far rouſed from his reverie as to ſay peeviſhly: "I don't chooſe any ſupper!" Nine years had Peter lived with his maſter in this ſolitude, and never had been treated by him in this manner. It was no wonder, then, that this firſt ebullition of paſſion made a ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Mr. Van Shipper immediately recollected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. "Go!" ſaid he, with ſoftened voice, as he clapped him on the ſhoulder, "go, good Peter! Be not offended with me, I am ill." Peter carried the diſhes back to the kitchen, but his appetite was gone alſo.</p>
               <p>The man in grey continued for two hours to pace backwards and forwards in the room. He was at laſt ſo fatigued that his knees trembled, but he found it impoſſible either to ſit down or go to bed. He burned with curioſity to know whether Jeanet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te was aſleep. He ſlipped ſoftly through the court, from which he could have a view of her window, which was on the ground floor. There was light in the room. He approached the window, and found the curtain half open. He ſaw Jeanette writing at a table; often ſhe laid down the pen to wipe her eyes. This picture haunted him in his bed-room, and was not very well calculated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him found repoſe</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="unknown:035693_0128_100648E091D25CD8"/>The morning ſun found Jeanette ſtill at the deſk. She had now finiſhed her ſtory; ſhe reviſed what ſhe had written, ſealed it with trembling hand, and called Peter. The man in grey ſhuddered when he heard her voice. He ſtopped his breath to liſten. Peter now opens the door of Jeanette's room—he returns, and every ſtep he advanced, the heart of the anxious expectant beat more violently. The door opened; he ſaw a letter in Peter's hand, and the laſt drops of blood vaniſhed from his cheeks. Trembling he broke the ſeal; a miſt obſcured his eyes.</p>
               <p>Jeanette, when ſhe had removed this burden from her breaſt, went with lightened heart to perform her uſual occupations in the kitchen. She ordered the fire to be kindled, aſſiſted the maid to gather vegetables in the garden, and, as ſhe prepared din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, liſtened with beating heart when ſhe heard the leaſt noiſe in the adjoining room.</p>
               <p>After the lapſe of an hour, the door opened. Mr. Van Shipper came into the kitchen with Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette's letter in his hand. The poor girl, covered with bluſhes, durſt not look up. The greens dropped from her trembling hands, and the big tears trickled down her cheeks.—"Jeanette!" ſaid the man in grey—"thus do I deſtroy all remembrance of this confeſſion." He threw the letter into the fire.</p>
               <p>Jeanette ſobbed. Mr. Van Shipper gave the maid a hint to withdraw. "Look at me, dear girl," ſaid he, and ſeized her trembling hand.

Never ſhall a word, or even the moſt remote allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, remind you of what you have ſuffered. Once more I ſolicit your heart and hand.—You are ſilent. May I ſend Peter to the next village for the parſon?"</p>
               <p>Alas! poor Jeanette was in a cruel ſituation. On the one ſide her benefactor, a gentleman ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by moſt generous love, who nobly overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her fault, and offered her tranquility and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.—On the other ſide, William!—She had indeed renounced him, but ſhe was not to blame becauſe a ſpark of hope ſtill glimmered in her breaſt; ſhe was unable to extinguiſh it. Could ſhe, in this ſituation, give her hand to another man?—Were William then to make his appearance, ſtill faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and overflowing with love, alas! muſt ſhe not be unſpeakably wretched? Muſt ſhe not render her generous huſband wretched likewiſe?—No! ſhe could not pronounce the word that muſt eternally ſeparate her from William. It coſt floods of tears, and a long ſtruggle between love and gratitude; but love prevailed, and ſhe pronounced an irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable refuſal.</p>
               <p>The man in grey was too noble to preſs her farther, not a reproach eſcaped his lips, he was ſilent, and locked up his grief in his heart. To his former moroſe and auſtere deportment ſucceeded a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found melancholy. He ſpoke leſs than uſual, was abſent when he was addreſſed, wandered the whole day in the wood, and toſſed himſelf, all night long, ſleepleſs on his pillow.

               <p>"My good girl, did you doubt that?"</p>
               <p>"O! I have been frightened to death!"</p>
               <p>"I am ſorry for that. I did not know that you took ſo warm an intereſt in my life. I thank you for it. It is a cordial drop in the cup of my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows!—Be eaſy, riſe, night approaches, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home."</p>
               <p>Jeanette roſe, and tottered to his arm. She was ſtrongly inclined to aſk why he had ſtolen away ſo privately? Where and how he had ſpent the two days he had been abſent? As he himſelf, however, ſaid nothing on the ſubject, ſhe did not venture to put the queſtion.</p>
               <p>Peter came to meet his maſter, with his eyes red and ſwollen, kiſſed his hand with ſobs, and in the evening ſang, in a very audible voice, in his room, "Praiſed be the Lord, &amp;c."</p>
               <p>A few days after this occurrence, the man in grey fell ſick. He himſelf refuſed to take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, and inſiſted that he was very well. But whence that unuſual fluſh upon your cheeks? Whence this want of ſleep and appetite? Whence theſe ſhivering fits which agitate your whole frame? Alas! poor man in grey, in vain you endeavour to
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:035693_0132_100648ECF262C5F0"/>
conceal the violent fever which rages in your veins!</p>
               <p>Jeanette, alarmed and diſtracted, preſſed him to accept her aſſiſtance, <hi>him</hi> who with joy ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the period of his thorny pilgrimage. Every morning ſhe prepared, with the fondeſt care and the moſt tender anxiety, the medicines, which he took from her hands with complacency and with thanks. He placed them on the table, however, and allowed them to remain untouched. In vain did the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Peter entreat leave to call a phyſician from the next town. "You are ſtrange children," would he reply with a ſmile—"I am quite well." Never had he been more ſerene or more affable than now; he even ſometimes indulged a joke. This pierced Jeanette to the heart. Bitter reproaches would have affected her leſs than the ſilent anxiety which he diſcovered to conceal his ſorrow.</p>
               <p>He continued theſe exertions till at laſt nature was too powerful to be reſiſted. He was obliged to confine himſelf to bed. His ſtrength ſeemed to have ſuſtained a rapid decay; his health in a few hours was ſo much altered for the worſe, that Jeanette began to be ſeriouſly apprehenſive for his life. She ſtood by his bedſide, and ſeized his burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand; big tears trickled down her cheeks; ſhe anxiouſly counted his feveriſh pulſe; her heaving boſom ſympathized with the ſhort, quick breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the patient; in his eyes the fever glowed, in hers the tears ſparkled.</p>
               <p>Her grateful heart was cruelly torn. Without knowing well what ſhe did, ſhe ſuddenly preſſed her lips to his burning hand. He made an attempt to prevent her. "What do you mean?" ſaid he in a low voice. "Do not embitter my laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments."</p>
               <p>"My benefactor!" cried Jeanette with extreme emotion. "No! you ſhall not die! I ſhould be the moſt ungrateful wretch in nature if I could
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:035693_0133_100648F24FAC6BB0"/>
endure this ſight."—She kneeled by his bedſide.— "My benefactor!" ſaid ſhe with the utmoſt eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, "if the thought of ſeeing yourſelf united to a faithful, dutiful wife can now cheer you, live ſtill—I am yours."</p>
               <p>Theſe words made a ſtrong impreſſion on the ſick man. For a long time he remained ſilent. At laſt, he tenderly preſſed her hand, and, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> weakneſs, ſaid with great animation: "My good girl! I can perceive what paſſes in your breaſt. A generous feeling has extorted from you an offer which your heart diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims. The ſight of my ſufferings you conſider as a reproach; you would ſacrifice your own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſhield yourſelf from it. Of ſuch a ſtate of your feelings I ought not to avail myſelf, nor would I accept the offer you make, did not my own ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions now tell me—that you hazard nothing. On the contrary, I flatter myſelf with the hope of eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the happineſs of your life on a more ſolid foundation, and turning the compaſſion you have ſhown to your own advantage. <hi>Yes, I will die as your huſband.</hi>—Riſe, dear Jeanette, and, if you are ſerious, haſten to call the parſon of the village. If he cannot unite our hearts, he can at leaſt join our hands. You ſhall beat my name till you change it with the conſent of your heart. And even then —ſurely, dear Jeanette—you will not forget the unfortunate man who acted ſo honorably towards you!"</p>
               <p>Jeanette could not ſpeak. She retired in tears, and ordered Peter to go to the village for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. About noon he arrived. Jeanette was more dead than alive. The man in grey ſeemed for a moment to gain new ſtrength. He raiſed himſelf in bed, propped up by pillows. The bride's hand trembled! his was firm and ſteady. The <hi>yes</hi> which ſhe pronounced was ſcarcely audible; his was manly and unembarraſſed. The prieſt ſpoke the
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:035693_0134_100648F48C21ED30"/>
bleſſing, the bride ruſhed out of the room, and lay for ſeveral hours inſenſible on the floor of her chamber.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the ſick man had a long private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with the parſon. When Jeanette had recovered a little, and dried up her tears, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned as collected as poſſible to the patient's room, and found him weaker than in the morning. With unwearied care ſhe exerted all her medical ſkill, and exhauſted all her recipes. "You have now," ſaid ſhe, "conferred upon me an endearing intereſt in your life. Will you then reject the aſſiſtance of that hand which is your own, and which ſo anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iouſly would contribute to your relief?"</p>
               <p>"Heaven forbid!" ſaid the ſick man with a ſmile: "on the marriage-day we muſt refuſe the bride nothing. Give me, my dear wife, give me whatever you think proper; I am ready to ſwallow every thing."</p>
               <p>He kept his word, and took one ſpoonful after another; though it was eaſy to perceive that he did it merely from complaiſance, and expected no farther relief. Towards night he became viſibly weaker. Jeanette and the parſon ſat by his bedſide. The latter ſpoke to him conſolation drawn from religious views; Jeanette could only weep. Her tears the ſick man repaid with a grateful ſqueeze by the hand. To the parſon he replied, "I have ever endeavoured to act as became an honeſt man, and God will deal graciouſly with me!"</p>
               <p>At midnight his breath became ſhorter. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſtopped altogether. In dumb anguiſh his wife hung over his pale countenance. A cold ſweat covered his brow—her trembling hand was going to wipe it off. Suddenly he ſeized it with a kind of convulſion, and laid it upon his eyes— his throat rattled—he uttered a groan—and expired.</p>

               <p>Jeanette's grief was without bounds. Had William died in her arms ſhe could not have felt a more ſincere ſorrow. She lay in a paroxyſm of grief over the dead body. The houſe rang with Peter's lamentations.</p>
               <p>In vain the clergyman preached comfort. She heard not what he ſaid, till he announced to her the laſt wiſh of the deceaſed, that ſhe ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately leave this ſolitude, and reſide in the parſon's houſe until the firſt tranſports of her grief were over, and her affairs were arranged. She was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the body almoſt by force; in a ſtate of ſpeechleſs ſtupefaction ſhe placed herſelf in the carriage, and allowed them to carry her wherever they thought proper.</p>
               <p>The parſon committed her to the care of his wife, an honeſt good-hearted woman, and returned next day, in order to ſuperintend the burial. Two or three weeks elapſed before Jeanette recovered ſpirits enough to pay any attention to what was paſſing around her; and during this period ſhe had never once thought of William. She now learnt how Mr. Van Shipper had ſpent the two days of abſence in which ſhe had ſuffered ſo much anxiety on his account. He had been at the neighbouring town with a notary, where he formally made his laſt will. Jeanette was nominated heireſs of his
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:035693_0136_100648FC4698A8E0"/>
whole property, conſiſting of thirty thouſand ducats, under the ſingle condition of providing for honeſt Peter till his death, in ſuch a manner as to enable him to ſpend his life agreeably in any way he thought beſt.</p>
               <p>When this was announced to her, Jeanette wept bitterly. Such a diſintereſted proof of hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs love, at a time when ſhe did not yet bear the name of his wife, tore her heart afreſh. "Where is Peter?" ſaid ſhe with emotion. Peter immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately appeared, for he had been in the houſe ever ſince his maſter's burial; and had been kept out of the way, that Jeanette's wounds might not, by ſeeing him, be opened anew.</p>
               <p>Bathed in tears, Jeanette preſented him her hand, which Peter kiſſed with ſobs. "We ſhall never part, good Peter," ſaid ſhe with faltering voice; "I will provide for you as if you were my brother."</p>
               <p>"Alas!" ſaid the honeſt fellow, you are gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous—I know it—but my good maſter—I ſhall never forget him!"</p>
               <p>A few months Jeanette continued in the houſe of the worthy parſon; and willingly would ſhe there have fixed her abode, but ſhe ſaw that his houſe was too ſmall to accommodate her longer. She, therefore, was obliged to think of another aſylum.</p>
               <p>The war, which raged in the adjoining diſtricts, made reſidence in the country very inſecure and unpleaſant, eſpecially for a woman.

               <p>FOR more than a year ſhe had heard no intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of William. The man in grey indeed received the Hamburgh newſpapers, and Jeanette never failed, on the accounts of any battle, to read with great anxiety the liſts of the killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Fortunately ſhe never found William's name among the number; her prayers ſeemed to have made him invulnerable. But among thoſe, too, who had diſtinguiſhed themſelves in a particular manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, ſhe likewiſe ſought in vain for this beloved name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and often ſecretly curſed his unlucky ſtars, which denied him an opportunity of acquiring freſh laurels.</p>
               <p>Now, when a young, rich, and independent widow, it occurred to her an hundred times a day: "Where is William? Does he ſtill love me?" To the laſt queſtion her heart ever replied, Yes; but the firſt nobody could ſo readily anſwer, for the flames of war ſtill raged around, and the country where ſhe reſided, to William was a hoſtile land.</p>
               <p>Could ſhe but find ſome perſon to ſend in ſearch of him—not to renew their old long-forgotten correſpondence—no, God forbid! her heart never confeſſed ſuch a deſign!—but only to inquire whether he was alive? A ſiſter ſurely may enquire, without impropriety, after the life of a brother.— Who can tell too in what circumſtances he may be placed? Whether he is not laboring under the weight of poverty?—Beſides, ſhe is ſtill deep in his debt. Once did he pinch himſelf in the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:035693_0138_10064905558F2A40"/>
of life, to ſave for her the half of his pay. It was indeed but a few crowns. The heart, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, does not calculate by crowns, and, in ſhort, it was the <hi>half!</hi> Ought ſhe not now to ſhare her property with him?—O! yes, yes! Could ſhe but find him! Had ſhe but ſome diſcreet, prudent, faithful perſon to ſend in ſearch of him! Why, ſuch a one is Peter. He is faithful and diſcreet; but is he prudent too? Could it be ſaid of him that he was wiſe as the ſerpent and harmleſs as the dove? Yet what extraordinary wiſdom was neceſſary to inquire for ſuch a perſon, whoſe name was ſuch a thing; to travel as a pedlar through the country where the hoſtile armies lay; to inquire from regiment to regiment, for a certain officer, till he was found; and then to tell him theſe words: —"Your ſiſter Jeanette ſends you her compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſhe lives in R***." This is the whole myſtery, and ſurely Peter is ſufficiently qualified for the taſk. To be ſure, he may very probably give himſelf a great deal of uſeleſs trouble; he will often expoſe the name of Mrs. Van Shipper to the jeſts of the young enſigns and lieutenants; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> where is the harm of that? Who knows Mrs. Van Shipper? Who knows her connections with William?—It is worth a trial!</p>
               <p>Peter received two hundred ducats for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of his journey, was obliged to get his leſſon by heart, and was diſpatched with the injunction, "that he muſt find out the gentleman, though he ſhould be obliged to follow him to the extremities of the Ruſſian empire!"</p>
               <p>He had now been away two months. Jeanette counted every minute, in anxious expectation of his return. During his abſence ſhe ſecluded her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the world, and lived alone in the joyful hope of finding William alive and faithful.—Alive, that was very right—but why faithful?—Had ſhe
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:035693_0139_1006490702F5ACD8"/>
not renounced him? What if, during their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he had found a young, beautiful, and rich lady, with whom he had indiſſolubly united his fate? Ought not Jeanette to rejoice that he had thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the weakneſs of her heart, that he had ſecured her more firmly againſt the danger of a relapſe?— She formerly had conſidered herſelf unworthy of him—had her ſituation ſince been changed? Wealth could not reſtore her loſt reputation.</p>
               <p>No, no! By fidelity ſhe underſtood only the faithful affection of a brother; to this ſhe was ſtill permitted to lay claim!</p>
               <p>Enough! We ſhall not call her to a too rigorous account for the feelings by which ſhe is actuated, but boldly declare that none of my fair readers will be the firſt to cenſure her conduct.</p>
               <p>Two months had ſhe waited in vain. The the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre of war approached nearer and nearer, and ſhe was ſoon obliged to renounce the hope of her meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger's return, as the fortreſs of R*** was ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inveſted, and immediately beſieged in form. No human being was permitted either to enter or quit the place. Spies, indeed, might always contrive to make their way, but honeſt Peter was not formed for a ſpy.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of R*** had little deſire to ſee their houſes reduced to aſhes by the enemy's bombs; they preſented petition after petition to the commandant, entreating him to ſurrender the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. The gallant officer, however, knew his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and as he was wearied at laſt with their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, he ſwore to tuck up the firſt man who ſpoke of ſurrender, upon a tree, on the ram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arts. This threat produced its effect; the citizens were obliged to be ſilent, and endured want and terror with ſecret murmurs.</p>
               <p>The works of the beſiegers were daily brought nearer and nearer to the walls. What the beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:035693_0140_10064909F638A938"/>
with great difficulty deſtroyed in a week, was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repaired, with incredible activity in the ſpace of a night. The people began, at laſt, to be as much habituated to the thunder of cannon as to the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bells upon a Sunday. The enemy, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, had yet done little injury to the fortifications, nor was there any immediate danger of ſcarcity. The place was repeatedly ſummoned. An officer, who one day came for this purpoſe, with a flag of truce, to the gates, was taken to the commandant with his eyes hood-winked.</p>
               <p>Jeanette lived in the ſtreet through which he was to paſs; ſhe heard a noiſe, and went to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.—Ha! among ten thouſand ſhe would have known him to be William!—A white handkerchief indeed covered his eyes, and part of his noſe; but his mouth, his hair, his gait, his ſize!—She would have known him among ten thouſand!—She ſcreamed aloud, and ſtretched her arms out at the window. Fortunately the noiſe of the crowd drowned her ſhrieks; and as every eye was fixed on the ſtranger, her extraordinary agitation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unobſerved.</p>
               <p>With anxious beating heart ſhe waited his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, to be thoroughly convinced of the truth of her obſervation. Half an hour elapſed. Jeanette walked through the room with haſty ſteps, and a magic force irreſiſtibly attracted her to the window. At laſt he came.—O! yes, it was he! At an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe diſtance ſhe recogniſed him!—The unfeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wretches led him paſt.—He is ſo near—every muſcle bounds towards him.—Alas! ſhe dares not call him—ſhe cannot detain him—he diſappears from her ſight, and ſhe ſinks inſenſible upon the ſofa.</p>
               <p>When ſhe recovered her ſenſes, ſhe recollected to have obſerved a croſs hanging at his button-hole. "Noble William!" exclaimed ſhe, "gallantly haſt
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:035693_0141_1006490E2CDB3720"/>
thou behaved, though the lying gazettes have paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over your deeds in ſilence!"—This croſs flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jeanette's vanity not a little. A woman who dotes, thinks herſelf honored in the man ſhe loves. Her eagerneſs to claſp her brave brother in her arms is redoubled. Her thoughts every moment wandered to the enemy's camp to William: and we muſt confeſs, that ſince his appearance ſhe had been a diſloyal citizen; for, had it been in her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the garriſon would, right or wrong, have been ſurrendered.</p>
               <p>She could not conceal her joy whenever ſhe heard that a new battery began to play, that the place was more cloſely inveſted on all ſides, and that all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors were cut off. When the commandant found it neceſſary, to prevent a ſcarcity, to diminiſh the allowance of bread, and a general murmur aroſe among the inhabitants, Jeanette alone remained tranquil and unconcerned, as ſhe conſidered it as a proof that the place would ſpeedily be given up; in expectation of which ſhe would willingly have lived upon an ounce a day. Such is the character of the beſt of men! The paſſion of love for our country excepted, every other paſſion renders us ſelfiſh, and extinguiſhes our feeling for the good of the whole.</p>
               <p>Yet the fulfilment of her hopes was not ſo near as ſhe had expected. In proportion as the ſcarcity increaſed, the obſtinate courage of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant was confirmed; and to the laſt ſummons, in which he was threatened with a ſtorm, he gave the indignant anſwer, that he would bury himſelf under the ruins of the fortreſs. The enemy began ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to make preparations for a ſtorm, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged remained day and night upon the walls, ready to oppoſe the moſt vigorous reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>One rainy September night, the thunder of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non awaked the citizens from their firſt ſleep. The enemy unexpectedly carried their threats into
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:035693_0142_1006490FE4E39A80"/>
execution, and with wild ſhouts attacked the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications. The din in the ſtreets, the wailing of women, and the cries of children, the thunder of cannon, the diſtant ſhouts of the combatants, the bombs in the air, which gleamed a feeble light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the horrid ſcene below—every thing was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined that could ſhake the firmeſt courage. But Jeanette ſcarcely retained any ſenſe of her own danger, ſhe ſaw nothing but William, beſmeared with blood; ſhe lay on her knees, and prayed for William.</p>
               <p>Several hours victory remained doubtful, till day broke, and with it the cry roſe from every quarter, that the enemy were in town!—All that were able to fly took to flight. People concealed themſelves in churches and cloiſters, in cellars and garrets. Like a ruſhing torrent the enemy's legions poured along the ſtreets, the doors were every where bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken open, every merchant's ſhop and every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable houſe plundered. Children were torn from their mother's breaſts, and ſtuck upon pikes; chaſte matrons and innocent virgins were violated in preſence of their huſbands and fathers. In vain the officers endeavoured to ſtem the fury of their troops; the bands of ſubordination were diſſolved, and the voice of command was loſt in the dreadful confuſion.</p>
               <p>A troop of theſe wild rioters broke likewiſe into Jeanette's houſe. She lay on her knees in prayer. The avaricious robbers fell firſt upon the ſilver plate, and broke and plundered every thing of value. At the ſight of the lovely ſupplicant, however, a new paſſion aroſe in their ſavage breaſts. They flew upon their prey with brutal violence. The poor victim maintained an unequal ſtruggle with her executioners—and alas! ſhe had been undone if her ſcreams had not brought a humane deliverer to her aſſiſtance. A young officer entered, ſeized the
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:035693_0143_10064913E0ACF1C8"/>
brutal miſcreant by the hair, and with his drawn ſword threatened to pierce his heart. The firm tone with which he ſpoke, and the ſight of the ſword at his breaſt, compelled the ruffian to abandon his prey; one after another ſtole away with the booty, and left Jeanette alone with her deliverer.</p>
               <p>She awoke from the ſwoon into which ſhe had ſunk. With timid looks ſhe eyed her deliverer, and hoped in him to recogniſe her William. It was not he. A young man of a noble appearance ſtood before her, and congratulated himſelf on being the inſtrument of her deliverance.</p>
               <p>Her ſenſes were ſtill confuſed. She could only utter broken ſentences. With tears of gratitude in her eye, ſhe pulled a valuable ring from her finger, which ſhe preſented to the generous ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

               <head>CHAP. XXIV. CONSTANCY REWARDED.</head>
               <p>WHEN Jeanette had a little recovered from her terror and alarm, ſhe ſpent the remainder of the day at the window, and reviewed the enemy's officers, who now paſſed in crowds. She trembled whenever ſhe ſaw a figure which in ſize and air bore any reſemblance to her beloved brother. Often ſhe thought ſhe deſcried him at a diſtance. "That is he! that is he!" whiſpered her heart. He came nearer, but it was not William.</p>
               <p>"O! why muſt I be indebted to a ſtranger for my deliverance? Why did not fortune and love bring him to his ſiſter's houſe?—Or—Almighty God! Should he be dead!—His courage muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have hurried him too far!—Sure he was the firſt to lead the aſſailants!—Alas! he knew not that here his Jeanette by upon her knees imploring guardian angels for her ſafety!"</p>
               <p>Her ſoul thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> between hope and fear. Longer than till the promiſed viſit of the young officer ſhe was determined not to endure this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſuſpence; and ſhe reſolved immediately to aſk intelligence of William.</p>
               <p>"O! that the ſtranger would come! Why does he tarry ſo long? Why did I indulge this unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able delicacy? Perhaps, now, I might have lain in William's arms!"</p>
               <p>Patience, dear Jeanette! Look down the ſtreet; there comes your deliverer. You may recogniſe him by his elegant form, and his fine blue eye.
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:035693_0145_1006491AC0EEF7C8"/>
Now he ſalutes you kindly—now he knocks at the door—the maid opens—heareſt thou not his foot upon the ſtair? Why do you tremble? Have you not already prepared yourſelf to put the queſtion?</p>
               <p>The officer entered. Jeanette welcomed him with politeneſs, but he allowed her no time to finiſh her compliment. "Madam," ſaid he, "you were ſo good this morning as to offer me a teſtimony of your gratitude. However little claim my ſmall ſervice may have upon you, I feel myſelf at preſent compelled to employ your kindneſs."</p>
               <p>Jeanette miſunderſtood him, and ſeized the ring which ſhe had upon her finger. The officer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly waved with his hand, as much as to ſay that ſhe was miſtaken.</p>
               <p>"No! it is not that which I come to aſk. I take the liberty to requeſt another favor, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may occaſion you inconvenience. I have a friend who is dearer to me than life. He has been dangerouſly wounded in ſtorming the town. In the firſt moments of confuſion he was carried to a houſe, where he is deſtitute of every accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the number of the wounded renders it impoſſible to tend him with ſufficient care. If your houſe were large enough to receive him, you would not only recompence the ſervice I was fortunate enough to render you, but make me eternally your debtor; ſince every thing you can do for my friend, I ſhall conſider more than all the treaſures you could heap on me!"</p>
               <p>At theſe words the tear ſtarted in his eye. Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette was affected. She haſtily replied: "And if I had but this ſingle apartment, I would ſleep on the floor till your friend is out of danger. Here he ſhall want for nothing. May I aſk your friend's name?"</p>
               <p>"Captain Von Eichenwald."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="unknown:035693_0146_1006491D6E5148D8"/>"And yours?"</p>
               <p>"Lieutenant Perlſtadt."</p>
               <p>"Loſe not a moment then, Sir, to make arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for bringing your friend here. This houſe and all I poſſeſs belong to you."</p>
               <p>The officer kiſſed her hand with gratitude, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>low down ſtairs.</p>
               <p>Again ſhe felt herſelf aſhamed to inquire for William. But was this the moment for ſuch an inquiry? The friend of a man to whom ſhe was indebted for the preſervation of her honor lay helpleſs in the hoſpital, and his life, perhaps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon a ſingle minute. What c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> generous young man, who ſpoke of his friend with tears in his eyes, have thought of her unſeaſonable curioſity? No; ſhe could not blame herſelf for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this time poſtponed the feelings of love to the ſacred duties of gratitude. She immediately gave orders to prepare the beſt apartment in her houſe for the reception of the expected gueſt, and in half an hour four grenadiers brought the wounded of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer down the ſtreet upon a litter.</p>
               <p>Jeanette threw a compaſſionate glance at the death-pale countenance of the young officer, who lay motionleſs with his eyes cloſed, and ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of what was paſſing. His friend accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the litter, and watched every ſtep of the bearers with anxiety, and warned them of every ſtone that lay in the way.</p>
               <p>"But, gracious God! what a reſemblance—this Captain Eichenwald and Willliam!—It is he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf!—Impoſſible!—It is he!—No! no!—My God! what a cruel deception!"</p>
               <p>He was now brought into the houſe, where, that he might be leaſt diſturbed, he was laid in a room upon the ground floor. Jeanette was going down ſtairs, but ſhe was not able to reach the door; her knees trembled; ſhe was obliged to ſit down. She
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:035693_0147_10064921A2A33FA0"/>
was quite alone. In vain ſhe called the maid, and a boy ſhe had hired in Peter's room. Both of them had been attracted by curioſity to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bby to ſee the wounded officer brought in.</p>
               <p>Alas! what cruel anxiety ſhe ſuffered! With what painful, impotent ſtruggles ſhe exerted all the power of her mind to animate and put in motion her agitated frame!—"What if it were William, and I cannot quit this ſpot—am confined here— and perhaps he requires my aid—or perhaps the dreadful moment is at hand when he will no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſtand in need of human aſſiſtance!—O God! he dies, and I ſhall never ſee him more!"—She made a ſecond effort to go out, but terror had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely deprived her of the uſe of her limbs.</p>
               <p>Peace, peace, poor Jeanette? Why art thou ſo ingenious to torture thyſelf? What is Captain Eichenwald to thee?—Can a ſlight reſemblance to William ſo violently diſcompoſe your ſpirits, and enervate your body?—Perhaps, too, your imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deceived you. The perſon who thinks he ſees ſpirits glide in every corner, and ſtalk abroad at night, will, in the end, really come to ſee ſpectres.</p>
               <p>Thus did reaſon whiſper conſolation to her when anxiety allowed her to exert her underſtanding. But reaſon communicated as little firmneſs to Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette's mind as an evening zephyr could reſtore ſerenity to the ſtormy ſea. Anxiety and terror were viſibly painted in every feature of her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance when Lieutenant Perlſtadt entered the room to return her his thanks. At the firſt glance he perceived that ſhe laboured under ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary emotion. "Heavens, madam! what is the matter? You appear agitated?"</p>
               <p>"And I am ſo indeed!—Tell me, Sir—repeat to me once more your friend's name?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="unknown:035693_0148_100649241A5B2970"/>"Captain Eichenwald."</p>
               <p>"Are you ſure?"</p>
               <p>"Quite ſure; but how"—</p>
               <p>"Now I am eaſy.—Forgive me, Sir—a ſtrange caprice of nature—an accidental reſemblance—I had a brother in your ſervice—his name was Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows."</p>
               <p>"Is it poſſible! Madam—this Captain Eich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enwald—and that Meadows—but he had no ſiſter"—</p>
               <p>JEANETTE (with extreme emotion)—"Proceed, Sir, for heaven's ſake proceed! What do you tell me?"</p>
               <p>"<hi>Are the ſame perſon!</hi>"</p>
               <p>He uttered theſe words ſo abruptly and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately, that he had not time to catch Jeanette in his arms as ſhe dropped ſenſeleſs to the ground. Aſſiſtance was called, and ſhe was laid on a bed. Perlſtadt, the confidante of William's heart, ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gueſſed who Jeanette muſt be, and bitterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached himſelf for his want of conſideration. He ſat down beſide her, held her hand in his, beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prinkled her with hartſhorn, rubbed her temples, and liſtened with trembling anxiety till ſhe again began to breathe.</p>
               <p>At length Jeanette opened her eyes. "Does he yet live?" were her firſt words.</p>
               <p>"Compoſe yourſelf, madam," ſaid Frederick with friendly anxiety; "if my conjectures do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me—if it be really Jeanette Jerome whom I ſee"—</p>
               <p>"I am ſhe," interrupted Jeanette.</p>
               <p>"Why then! every thing will go well. That name will ſave the life of my friend."</p>
               <p>"Allow me to go to him."</p>
               <p>"What is it you aſk? The ſudden joy would kill him. He muſt previouſly be prepared."</p>
               <p>"Are his wounds dangerous?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="unknown:035693_0149_10064928ABEAD028"/>"The firſt dreſſing has not yet been taken away, but the ſurgeon gives us great hopes."</p>
               <p>"Does he yet love me?"</p>
               <p>"Can you aſk ſuch a queſtion?"</p>
               <p>"But how comes this ſtrange name?"</p>
               <p>"Captain Meadows one day ſtormed an <hi>abbatis,</hi> and took poſſeſſion of an oak wood, <note n="*" place="bottom">Eichenwald.</note> from which with matchleſs courage, he drove an enemy three times ſuperior in number. The conſequence of this achievement procured us a victory. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his gallantry, the king conferred upon him, what nature had long before beſtowed, <hi>nobility,</hi> and called him in memory of the exploit Von Eichen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald."</p>
               <p>Jeanette would have liſtened for hours together to the ſpeaker, for William was the ſubject; but it occurred to her how indiſpenſible Frederick was at his friend's bed-ſide. Abruptly ſhe drove him out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Scarce was he gone when ſhe called him back; for there ſtill was ſomething which ſhe had forgot.</p>
               <p>Frederick brought her the welcome intelligence that William had ſlept well, and now ſhe could not reſiſt the deſire ſhe felt at leaſt to ſee him as he ſlept. She pulled off her ſhoes, and ſtole ſoftly to his chamber door; ſhe liſtened through the key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole; joy, grief, hope, melancholy—all theſe feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings combined, drew tears from her eyes. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick was obliged to bring her away with a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly violence, that her ſobs might not diſturb the patient.</p>
               <p>Several weeks elapſed before Frederick durſt venture to communicate to his friend the joyful

               <p>"Mrs. Van Shipper! And was it poſſible ſhe could give her hand to another man?"—This moderated his raptures, and even made him melancholy.</p>
               <p>Frederick gueſſed what paſſed in his ſoul, and baniſhed his gloomy, jealous apprehenſions by a narrative of Jeanette's fortune. William heard every word with the moſt anxious curioſity. O! his fond heart received with welcome the flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſolation from the lips of his friend! His beloved ſtood juſtified. Scarcely could he wait the moment when he ſhould be permitted to preſs her to his breaſt.

               <p>The wiſhed-for hour at length arrived—the door flew open—Jeanette lay in his arms.—Their feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were too powerful for utterance; feelings, which no tongue can ſpeak, no pencil deſcribe.

               <p>Such were the reflections which William indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when, after the lapſe of a happy winter, he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the unwelcome order to hold himſelf in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to march, to envelope the firſt genial rays of the ſun in clouds of ſmoke, and to tread the riſing ſeed deep in the boſom of the earth. For five months he had now experienced, that wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His intoxication was now gone; he enjoyed the flame, however, which formerly had been expoſed to every puff of wind, and threatened at laſt to conſume the rich fuel by which it was fed. Now, indeed, it reſembled the lamp which has been diſcovered at Portici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; encloſed in the pure chryſtal lamp of marriage, it burnt with a mild and eternal light.</p>
               <p>Large cities, in one reſpect, reſemble a retired cottage; you may live in them juſt as you pleaſe; nobody troubles himſelf how the happy recluſe ſpends his time. If you allow the great to enjoy their feaſts, their routs, and their card-parties undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed,

they will permit you, with a contemptuous ſmile at your ſingularity, to remain happy at home. William had fully availed himſelf of this permiſſion. A fond accompliſhed wife, a proved friend, a ſimple yet plentiful table, a glaſs of good wine, and a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous guinea for a brother in diſtreſs—ſuch were his pleaſures; and he who requires more for the happineſs of life, is indeed to be pitied, were he even poſſeſſed of the wealth for which he ſighs.</p>
               <p>Wiſhes rarely abandon even the happieſt breaſt. But William belonged to that claſs of the peculiar favorites of deſtiny, who feel no other wiſh but "that every thing may continue as it now is;" who wiſh to loſe nothing of what they enjoy, and covet nothing more. The king had preſented him with a ſmall eſtate in the country. "God ſend the king peace!" would he often exclaim, "that I may retire from the army to enjoy what his bounty has beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what love will adorn." The country round it is delightful, and the neighbourhood inhabited by old proud nobility, who would not condeſcend to viſit new-raiſed merit. What tranſporting proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects! Love, friendſhip, a country life, and no company.</p>
               <p>The roſes on Jeanette's cheeks were now indeed a little faded, and the uſual luſtre of her eye was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured; but the happy huſband rejoiced at the ſymptoms, and anxiouſly longed for the pledge of faithful love. Ambition was aſleep in his breaſt. Willingly would he have taken the laurel from his brow to deck the cradle of his ſon.</p>
               <p>Never, therefore, was an order to march more unwelcome than that which William had received. Several days he concealed the diſagreeable intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from his wife, now become doubly dear to him. The penetrating eye of love, however, ſoon diſcovered his anxiety; Jeanette had long trembled at the thought of a new ſeparation; ſhe endeavored
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:035693_0154_100649380B7063F8"/>
to arm herſelf with firmneſs, and ſpeak to William that comfort which ſhe herſelf ſo much required. She concealed her tears, and wept only in the ſilence of the night when William ſeemed to be aſleep at her ſide. If her ſobs waked him from his ſlumbers, ſhe imputed her agitation to an unpleaſant dream.</p>
               <p>His tenderneſs would almoſt have induced him, at the opening of the campaign to quit the ſervice; but Jeanette oppoſed this ſacrifice. "It ſhall not be ſcornfully ſaid of you that you loſt your warlike ardor in my arms; never ſhall it be ſaid that you was ungrateful to your ſovereign. Go to the field— be courageous, but not fool-hardy; remember your duty, but remember too the helpleſs innocent whom yet you have not ſeen. When you return, he will bound to you with cries of fondneſs from my breaſt. When you have fulfilled the demands of duty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gird your ſword, and let our boy play with your arms while you repoſe upon my boſom."</p>
               <p>Thus did ſhe conceal her anxiety and her grief under a feigned heroiſm, while the moment of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was ſtill at ſome diſtance. When, however, the Sunday of the laſt week arrived, and William's regiment for the laſt time marched in proceſſion to church, her courage diſappeared, and ſhe trembled like a condemned criminal as ſhe tied William's belt over his ſhoulder. He went to church—and anxiety and dovotion prompted her likewiſe to go thither. During the ſermon ſhe had frequently, unobſerved, wiped away the falling tear; but when the chaplain of the regiment began to offer up a ſolemn prayer for the ſucceſs of their arms, when he bleſſed the aſſembled warriors, and the tear dropped upon the whiſkers of the old grenadiers, ſhe hid her face in her muff, and prayed in ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs grief.</p>
               <p>With what warmth did her heart repeat the words of the preaches: "Permit me, O God! to
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:035693_0155_1006493A9659E0C8"/>
ſee all thoſe who are now before thee, once more aſſembled in this place; let not one of them be miſſing; and in thy temple let us hear the triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant voice of gratitude, not the complaint of the widow, and the wailing of the orphan!"</p>
               <p>She returned home quite exhauſted. Her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage had fled. In two days the regiment was to march. Every hour ſhe heard the dreadful note of preparation under her window. Baggage and ſtores were continually paſſing through the ſtreets, and the dull ſound of the cannon rattled along. Every thing was alive; every thing was in motion, while ſhe lay weeping before a trunk packing up her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's linen. She had prepared bandages and lint in caſe he ſhould be wounded, and twenty times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his ſervant where he would find every thing the moment it was wanted.</p>
               <p>After this melancholy taſk was performed, ſhe wandered diſconſolate from room to room, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſorrowful eyes on the empty ſpot where Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam's camp bed had ſtood, now on the bare wall where William's piſtols were uſed to hang. When the morning of ſeparation arrived, and William had ſtolen early from her ſide to drown in buſtle and activity the agony of ſeparation, ſhe threw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a carriage, and drove on for half a mile to a cottage, where ſhe was to bid her huſband fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
               <p>A thick cloud of duſt announced the approach of the troops. One regiment after another marched paſt. Women and children preſſed with cries of ſorrow between the ranks; here a weeping grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier led a little girl by the hand, while the pregnant mother walked ſobbing beſide them; here a luſty boy carried his father's muſket; here a rough, blunt ſoldier ſhook his aged mother's hand; there another embraced his wife, who clung in tears round his neck. Young fellows, who had no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:035693_0156_1006493F5B35CA30"/>
laughed and made merry, waving their hats adorned with green leaves. Here and there pedlars and huckſters offered their wares to ſell. Many drank to drown care, and tears trickled into the glaſs.</p>
               <p>Jeanette ſaw nothing that paſſed. Her heart beat, her breath was irregular, her eyes were inflamed. She gazed with fixed attention towards the gate from which the troops ſtill continued to pour. The well-known uniform of William's regiment now glanced in her view. William rode careleſsly on at the head of his battalion. The once fiery ſteed paced along with ſober ſteps. The reins had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived dropped upon the horſe's neck. When William reached the cottage, he leaped from his horſe, and Jeanette from the carriage. He flew to her pale as death, and ſhe ſunk down in his arms. He kneeled by her ſide, preſſed his cold lips to hers, which glowed with feveriſh heat, left the marks of his tears on her cheek, ſprung haſtily up, and mounted his ſteed. Jeanette lay inſenſible. When ſhe recovered, the diſtant drum ſounded in her ear. She roſe, looked down the valley, and ſaw the laſt clouds of duſt driving in the wind.</p>
               <p>She quitted her attendants, retired into a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring thicket, fell upon her knees, and prayed. Spare, ye ſceptres! ſpare the ſorrowful heart this comfort in affliction! which, if it does not heal the wound, protects it againſt the violence of external aſſaults. Happy the mortal who is confident in prayer! Tranquillity and hope are the rewards of his pious conviction. Early in the morning when ſhe awoke, late in the evening when ſhe retired to reſt, Jeanette revived herſelf with this cordial bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam. It ſtrengthened her in the heavy hour of her delivery, and baniſhed every melancholy preſage concerning her huſband's fate.</p>
               <p>Alas! his regiment was but too ſoon engaged in
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:035693_0157_10067293C3C79720"/>
a ſevere action between the advanced poſts. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam fought by the ſide of his friend, and was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded. He ſaw his gallant comrades fall around him, and, overpowered by numbers, was at laſt obliged to yield. He and Frederick were taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. After being plundered by the enemy's huſſars, they were conducted to the camp. There, indeed, they were treated with reſpect, but cloſely watched; and in a few days they were ſent off, with a number of other priſoners, into the interio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WANT and ſorrow accompanied William in his captivity. One conſolation only was left him. He was not ſeparated from his friend, whoſe ear and heart were ever open to his ſighs, and who liſtened to the eternal monotony of his complaints with unwearied attention.

poſſeſſion blow inviſibly from heart to heart, was now awakened by the regret of ſeparation. He thought only of Jeanette. He ſpoke only of her; no privations affected him, no object could engage his curioſity. Plundered and ſtript of the moſt ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent neceſſaries, he leapt for joy when in a corner of his pocket he found a ſmall ink-horn and a ſilver pen, which had eſcaped the avarice of the huſſars. He now daily wrote a letter, at every place where the eſcort ſtopped, when he could find even a ſtone by the road-ſide to ſerve as a table. When others ate or ſlept, his heart was awake. Grief, the pain of ſeparation, the fondeſt conſolation, the moſt glowing hopes of meeting, he painted in his letters with ihe moſt ardent enthuſiaſm; and with what grateful rapture did he preſs to his breaſt the good-natured corporal, who promiſed to forward his firſt letter!</p>
               <p>After a long and fatiguing journey, they at laſt arrived at the place of their deſtination, a little town in Guienne. Here they received permiſſion to go about at large on their parole of honor. They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>During the day, therefore, William and Frederick ſeldom left their ſorry habitation. Commonly they ſtole out in the twilight, ſtrolled through the bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fields, ſtretched themſelves on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>One evening they accidentally met with a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man book; and as they had ſo long been deprived of the pleaſure of reading, they congratulated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:035693_0159_1006729806DEC618"/>
on the feaſt that awaited them next morning. The firſt rays of the ſun found the two friends already in the fields. The unclouded ſky and the dewy graſs ſeemed to threaten a warm day, and they ſought, therefore, at a little diſtance from the town, a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy thicket which lay on the brow of a hill. There they found a delightful retired ſpot, and ſtretched themſelves under an olive-tree. William pulled the book out of his pocket, and Frederick lay care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly on the graſs.</p>
               <p>They had not been here above two hours when a wild din from the neighbouring village ſtruck their ears. They were alarmed, and heſitated whether they ſhould leave their retreat, or conceal them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deeper in the wood. The laſt might appear ſuſpicious; they remained, therefore, where they were, reſolved to return to the town as ſoon as the road ſhould be clear, for it paſſed directly by the village church, from the ſteeple of which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the alarm which had rouſed their apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>As they liſtened, and loſt themſelves in conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures reſpecting the cauſe of the tumult, they ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly heard a ruſtling in the thicket at a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It ſeemed as if a flying roe ruſhed paſt them. It came nearer—again it ſeemed to recede —ſometimes on the right, ſometimes on the left— the irregular breathing of a perſon exhauſted with running appriſed them that ſome one was at hand. The two friends held in their breath, and anxiouſly looked towards the place from which the ſound ſeemed nearer and nearer to approach.</p>

               <p>AS they had now left the dreadful village a good way behind, the fugatives conſidered themſelves ſafe, reſted a few minutes, and then ſlowly purſued their way, bleſſing the generous girl who, notwithſtanding her pride in the title of a French citizen, had ſo kindly appriſed them of their danger. They ſoon perceived, however, that the enthuſiaſtic ſpirit, like a raging lioneſs, had thrown the whole country round into alarm and apprehenſion by its wild roar. They found, that in our times the cutting down of a tree of liberty can excite the ſame fury, which two hundred years ago the deſtruction of a croſs, or two thouſand years ago the violation of a ſacred oak, would have occaſioned.</p>
               <p>When Alcibiades demoliſhed the ſtatue of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, the Athenians raged juſt like the new men of France about their tree of Liberty. On the right and on the left, before and behind the fugitives, the ſullen ſound of bells was heard in all the villages. They redoubled their ſpeed. The road led to a hill, which they endeavoured to reach; but, alas! under the brow of the hill lay a village, from which
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:035693_0163_100672A20763DC68"/>
the confuſed noiſe of ſhouts and the rattling of arms proceeded. Haſtily they wheeled round, ran rapidly down the hill, directly back again, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, at a diſtance, a cloud of duſt, which warn-them that their purſuers were at hand.</p>
               <p>They now flew over hedges and ditches acroſs the fields; ſometimes they thought of concealing themſelves in the ſtanding corn; ſometimes they thought of hiding themſelves in a farmer's hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft; but a loud-mouthed cur or a bawling infant frightened them away. They now knew not whither they went, ran through brooks and moraſſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflection. They heard the alarm all around, and at laſt they arrived, without ſuſpecting it, at the road they had left.</p>
               <p>The danger every moment increaſed. The fields round were covered with their purſuers; before and behind, clouds of duſt rolled; the bells rang from every ſteeple, and the ſhouts of men and the barking of dogs broke on them from every quarter.</p>
               <p>"I can go no farther!" ſaid William. "Heaven protect my wife and child! Here will I die!"</p>
               <p>He ſunk down under a tree. Frederick ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned up all his ſtrength, climbed the tree, and viewed the country around.</p>
               <p>"I ſee a country houſe," ſaid he, "not two thouſand paces diſtant. Belong to whom it may, the owner will ſurely protect us at leaſt from the fury of the mob. If he is a man of honor, he will deliver us into the hands of the civil power, but not permit us—even ſhould he conſider us guilty— to be murdered like wild beaſts by a frantic rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble."</p>
               <p>He came down. William roſe, and they exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every effort to gain the country-houſe. In a romantic valley, through which a branch of the Garonne rolled meandering, lay a ſolitary habitation, ſhaded by lofty elms, on the north ſide bounded
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:035693_0164_100672A3992FC8D0"/>
by a thick grove, which ſtretched down to the banks of the river. The fugitives arrived, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption, at the iron gate that bounded the front lawn, which was taſtefully ornamented with flower-beds. They ſound the doors ſhut and barred. William boldly took a ſtone, and knocked loud at the iron wicket. The grove re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>echoed the ſound, but no dog barked, no living creature ſtirred. They called. Nobody anſwered. The houſe appeared to be empty. A number of broken windows confirmed the ſuppoſition. The railing was too high for them to climb over, and too ſtrong for them to break. The moments were precious. William and Frederick haſtened to the other ſide of the grove, there to look for a place where they might wait the ſhades of night.</p>
               <p>The grove was likewiſe ſurrounded by a pretty high wall, but time had here and there looſened the ſtones; and fear lent them wings, for the voices of their purſuer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> already reſounded through the valley. A gloomy thicket of tall pines received them in its ſhade. Here they liſtened a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and as the whole grove ſeemed to be inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the feathered creation, as the linnets and bullfinches hopped as fearleſsly about them as if they had never ſeen a human form, they ventured to penetrate deeper into its receſſes.</p>
               <p>They ſoon perceived that a little walk, in the ſtile of the Engliſh gardens, ſkirted round the whole of the grove; but the graſs that grew thick through the gravel, which was here and there broken up by the rain, and not repaired, ſeemed to prove that it was long ſince it had been trod by human foot. Courageouſly the two friends advanced, intending, if poſſible, to take poſſeſſion of ſome empty corner of the houſe; when Frederick ſuddenly ſtopped, as William pulled him by the coat and pointed, with a mixture of fear and ſurpriſe, to the mark of a lady's foot in a mole-hill.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="unknown:035693_0165_100672A78A9EDB58"/>It was now plain that this muſt have happened yeſterday or the day before, conſequently the houſe with the broken windows was not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited, and the fugitives remained irreſolute in new embarraſſment and apprehenſion. In ſpite of their dangerous ſituation (for the voice of their purſuers ſtill ſounded more terrible in the valley) their feelings, on perceiving the prints of the foot were very different from thoſe which Robinſon Cruſoe had experienced on a ſimilar occaſion. They could not ceaſe to contemplate with pleaſure the mark, which was that of an elegant foot; and William thought, that if it was poſſible that Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette could be here, it muſt have been made by hers. For a moment fear gave place to ſofter emotions. So feels the traveller, who, ſurrounded by the murky ſhades of night, ſuddenly deſcries at a diſtance a friendly light.</p>
               <p>What a powerful effect does an inch more or leſs produce upon the ſenſes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>en, through them on the imagination, and ſo on upon the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! Had the mark covered the whole of the mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, the idea of beauty, and with it of harmleſs goodneſs, would not have aſſociated with the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our fugitives. Perhaps, alarmed at the appearance, they might have again made their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat over the walls. A creature, however, that had ſuch elegant feet, ſeemed ſo little calculated to inſpire terror, that they were inclined to wiſh rather than to avoid a meeting.</p>
               <p>With more caution and circumſpection they now purſued the winding way, which appeared to lead to the banks of the river. The murmuring of the ſtream ſoon convinced them that they were right; and after deſcending the footpath, winding through a thick ſhrubbery, down a gentle declivity, they commanded a proſpect of the water. They obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little iſland, on which was built, with ſingular
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:035693_0166_100672A90CB66CD0"/>
art and taſte, a grotto, ſurrounded with weeping willows, which bended their branches to the ſtream. A little draw-bridge led to the iſland. This ſecret receſs appeared a ſecure aſylum, and they redoubled their ſteps to reach the bridge. Silently they paſſed over, and drew it up behind them. Silently, and with ſome anxiety, they approached the avenue to the grotto. Frederick was a few ſteps before, as William was detained fixing the bridge. When William had finiſhed, and was running up to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him, he ſaw his friend ſuddenly turn round, his face pale and his knees trembling. He laid his finger on his mouth, waved his hand, and by his geſtures ſignified that William ſhould approach without noiſe.</p>
               <p>William obeyed, and threw a fearful glance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the grotto, which was lighted by a window in the roof. Two coffins lay cloſe together, covered with black, and without any ornament. Upon one of the coffins lay a female figure, in profound grief, her back towards them, and her head leaning upon her hand. She ſeemed to be aſleep, or to be loſt in grief—they did not hear her breathe.</p>
               <p>Dreadfully ſhocked at this ſpectacle, the two friends ſtood motionleſs, and converſed only by doubtful looks. They waited long to ſee whether this ſolemn figure would turn round. As not the leaſt movement betrayed the appearance of life, and they ſaw a beetle crawling on her white neck, without attracting her attention, Frederick began to think that ſhe muſt be in a ſwoon, and ventured to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a few ſteps nearer. His foot trod upon ſome dry leaves: they ruſtled—the figure roſe up. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens! what a creature! with every quality of an angel but fearleſſneſs!</p>
               <p>Fair as a lily, with long flowing black hair, an eye mild as the evening ſtar ſurrounded with light clouds, her boſom negligently covered, whoſe dazz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:035693_0167_100672AA8EA04EF8"/>
whiteneſs was heightened by the contraſt of her black robe, a tall elegant form, a hand which ſeemed formed to wipe away the tears of love, a foot which the fugitives eaſily recogniſed to be that which had left the mark in the grove—Such did the lovely ſtranger ſtand before them, in the firſt bloom of her charms. Had not her full boſom anxiouſly heaved—had not her white hand trembled, they would have dropped on their knees before her, as a ſuperior being. Frederick ſtood ſpeechleſs, with his eyes riveted to this celeſtial figure. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam endeavored to ſpeak, but it was only in broken ſentences. The ſtranger firſt broke ſilence.</p>
               <p>"Who are you?—What do you want?—Why have you intruded upon this ſanctuary of my grief? Would you rob me even of theſe dear remains?"</p>
               <p>At theſe words ſhe haſtily threw the lid from one of the coffins, and diſcovered the corpſe of an old man, whoſe head was ſevered from his body. This ſhocking ſpectacle occaſioned a long pauſe, during which the young lady gazed at the corpſe with fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hands, and ſhed a tender tear. Frederick was unable to ſpeak, nor did he attempt to reply. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam collected himſelf as well as he could, and in ſoothing accents began to relate the accident which had brought them here. He begged for an aſylum for a few hours, till they could elude their purſuers. The uproar which every moment grew louder and louder, teſtified the truth of his ſtory.</p>
               <p>As William ſpoke, the young lady's attention was involuntarily fixed by his figure and diſcourſe. When he had finiſhed, her looks fluctuated doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully between him and his companion. She had not made any anſwer, when a wild mob was heard thundering at the iron gate, and another round the walls of the grove.</p>
               <p>"What can I do to aſſiſt you?" ſaid ſhe: "Where can I conceal you?—Every corner of the
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:035693_0168_100672AC683CBC48"/>
grove is well known to theſe monſters. From its moſt ſecret receſſes they dragged my aged father, and cruelly murdered him!" She burſt into tears, and ſeemed anew to be quite engroſſed with her grief, till a noiſe at the gate louder than before, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced that the mob had burſt it open.</p>
               <p>"They come!" ſaid William. Frederick did not ſeem to hear them. "They come!" repeated the lady with anxiety. "It is too late to take you to the deſolate manſion—there you would be—but no—it is too late. Fly! fly! I cannot ſee you murdered!"</p>
               <p>The frantic rabble now ruſhed through the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in crowds. Nothing remained for the fugitives but to plunge in the river; but it was deep, and neither of them could ſwim. "Ha!" exclaimed William, "for what an inglorious death has fate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved me!"—Frederick ſaid nothing. He gazed at the young lady, and ſeemed to be utterly inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>The young mourner walked up and down, wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hands. She looked compaſſionately at the ſtrangers, and appeared to ſtruggle with a thought which ſhe ſometimes reluctantly diſmiſſed, and again benevolently cheriſhed. William ſaw what paſſed in her ſoul. He threw himſelf at her feet: "If this angel form can give the leaſt pledge of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſave an unfortunate being, who has left in his own land, other helpleſs creatures dependent on him!"</p>
               <p>"Humanity!" repeated the lady, "Alas! that was denied to me!"</p>
               <p>Suddenly the whole grove reſounded with the voices of men, and on all ſides the ſhouts of frenzy were heard. It ruſhed like a whirlwind througn the trees, and the frightened birds forſook their neſts. The mob had already diſcovered the path which led to the grotto; numbers had reached the
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:035693_0169_100672AF31672010"/>
bridge, and began to cut down with their ſcythes the pulleys by which it was drawn up. A glow overſpread the young lady's cheeks; the mild luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of her eye kindled into fire. She threw herſelf on the coffin. Anxiety lent her ſtrength; ſhe lifted out the dead body and laid it on the moſſy bank.</p>
               <p>"Stranger! conceal yourſelf here," ſaid ſhe, pointing to the coffin. William ſprang into it, and in a moment the lid was replaced. She now open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſecond coffin. It was empty. She made a ſign to Frederick, which ſhe was thrice obliged to repeat before he underſtood. At laſt he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the coffin, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The young lady threw herſelf down between the two coffins, with an arm extended over each, and in this poſture ſhe awaited the arrival of the mob.— They came.—Men armed with ſcythes, ſickles, ſwords and muſkets, ſurrounded the entry into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The peaſants looked at one another doubtfully. The contraſt between the beauty of the lady and the bloody corpſe, together with their diſappointed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, made a powerful impreſſion on the rough ſons of nature. The wild clamor was ſucceeded
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:035693_0170_100672B1F1FC0158"/>
by a death-like ſilence. "Come, friends!" at laſt ſaid one of them, "they are not here!"</p>
               <p>"You may be perfectly eaſy, miſs," ſaid ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, "tell us only where the villains have fled."</p>
               <p>"Whom do you mean?" purſued the lady. "Since that old man fell under your weapons, no human foot has entered this ſolitude. If you mean to inſult—if you mean to delight yourſelves with the ſight of a murdered man, come nearer! See how placidly he ſmiles; he has forgiven his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers. Come in, and touch thoſe cold hands, of whoſe bleſſing you have deprived me!"</p>
               <p>At theſe words ſhe ſeized the hand of the corpſe, and held it out to them. The peaſants were ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſtarted back. The hindermoſt diſappeared; the crowd diſperſed, and the laſt went away with fearful looks. "They are not here!" cried they as they croſſed the bridge. "They are not here!" they ſounded through the grove. The noiſe grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually ſubſided, and before a quarter of an hour elapſed, the birds had again taken poſſeſſion of their neſts, and a gloomy ſilence of the ſolitude.</p>

               <p>BABET—for it is now time to diſcover the name of this lovely guardian angel—Babet was the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a nobleman, who had the misfortune to be rich, and to be a man of worth and honor. Of courſe he was obnoxious to the party now in power. They reſolved to get rid of him in the uſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; that is to ſay, they denounced him as an ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocrat; he became a marked man; and the people, ever ready for ſuch deeds, undertook the execution of the ſentence. Two of his ſons were murdered. The third fled, as was ſaid, to America, there to weep in company with young La Fayette.</p>
               <p>The old man himſelf choſe the moſt retired of all his eſtates, and thought to eſcape perſecution by a voluntary ſecluſion. In vain, however!—Party fury traced him to this harmleſs retreat, tore him from the arms of his only daughter, and hurried him to the ſcaffold.</p>
               <p>Babet, in the ſixteenth year of her age, had been educated in a cloiſter; and when the deſtroying angel, called <hi>Liberty,</hi> burſt thoſe holy cells, ſhe returned to the boſom of her family. While ſhe lived im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured within the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lls of the cloiſter, except the old blind gardener, ſhe had never ſeen the face of man; and, except a favorite cat, had never loved any thing. When ſhe became acquainted with her worthy father, and her ſprightly brothers, ſhe loved them with her whole ſoul, and their ſentiments and modes of thinking became hers; for women rarely chooſe their own opinions, they are formed by the company in which they live. They commonly love with great conſtancy; but if they ever change their attachments, they likewiſe change their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p>Babet was a decided royaliſt. The death of her
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:035693_0172_100672B4F6E7AA00"/>
father and brothers at firſt made her quite delirious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſtill nouriſhed by the ſolitude in which ſhe lived, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cidentally preſented; never went beyond the limits of the gloomy grove, was deſerted by the officious ſervants of her former proſperity, and even diſmiſſed the few who offered to ſhare her danger and her poverty.</p>
               <p>Her inflamed imagination had inſpired her with a ſuperſtitious idea, which ſhe neither could nor wiſhed to drive from her mind. Having dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that on the anniverſary of her father's birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, which was to happen in a few weeks, ſhe would be united to her father and brothers by a ſtroke of lightning, ſhe was firmly convinced that the dream would be realiſed; for which reaſon ſhe had prepared an empty coffin to receive her. This firm belief rendered her indifferent to what paſſed around her. She ſmiled when any attempt was made to amuſe her, and wiſtfully ſhook her head when ſhe was adviſed to collect the remains of her eſtates in different provinces, which were left a prey to rapine.</p>
               <p>In this temper of mind the two friends found her; and on ſeeing them, nature, for the firſt time, reſumed her rights, and bound her to life with new and tender ties. A young lady, who, till now, ſeemed to be abandoned by God and the world, who had no relation, no friend to whom ſhe could fly; a young, helpleſs, inſulated creature, could not but feel herſelf in a new element when ſhe ſaw herſelf the deliverer of two handſome, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous young men. When Babet opened the cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin, ſhe felt ſomething as if ſhe ſaw her brother riſe from it. She was no longer without ſupport. She
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:035693_0173_100672B8E545FA18"/>
had purchaſed at the riſk of her life, perhaps of her honor, two grateful protectors.</p>
               <p>The young men lay at her feet, preſſed their glowing lips to her hand, and uttered ſoothing words of gratitude. A new and delightful feeling diffuſed itſelf through that breaſt, which, till now, had heaved only with ſighs. She looked down upon the creatures with complacency; ſhe wiſhed to complete the work of their deliverance; ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got her father's corpſe, and ſhe even forgot to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach herſelf for her negligence.</p>
               <p>"Follow me!" ſaid ſhe. "Your perſecutors and mine might repent their having been ſurpriſed and overcome by a feeling of humanity; they might ſuddenly return. Follow me into the manſion, which they have diſmantled. I will conduct you to a cavern, which, for many weeks, ſerved my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a ſecure retreat. Alas! he would have liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtill had he not left it!"</p>
               <p>Babet went out of the grotto. Frederick and William followed her; the former like a perſon intoxicated; the latter had recovered the perfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of his faculties With politeneſs and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der concern he conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She poſſeſſed ſo much conſideration, as to avoid every open and expoſed place of the garden, and to ſteal along between high hedges till ſhe brought her gueſts ſafe through many a winding alley to the back-door of the deſolate habitation.</p>
               <p>Here they mounted a winding ſtair-caſe, paſſed through a ſmall antichamber, and went into the kitchen; where an old footman and a young ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant girl lay trembling on their knees, emploring
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:035693_0174_100672BA68B1E478"/>
all the ſaints in the calendar for help<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When the frantic mob broke into the garden, they thought that the rabble had come to deſtroy the laſt frail ſhoot of the old ſtem, and gave up their miſtreſs for loſt. When they heard footſteps on the ſtair, they imagined that their own hour was come, and were pronouncing their laſt prayer. At the ſight of Babet their terrors were changed into the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tranſports. They ſprang up, leaped and ſung around her, and it was a longtime before ſhe could make the footman underſtand that ſhe wanted the key of the ſubterraneous cavern. He then ran to find it, ſought it over the whole houſe from the garret to the cellar, and at laſt found it in her own pocket.</p>
               <p>Babet now conducted the ſtrangers into her father's cloſet. Here ſhe took a lighted lamp, opened a concealed door in the tapeſtry, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended a narrow ſtair-caſe, which, through many windings, terminated in a ſpacious vault. She fought and found an iron crow, which accident ſeemed to have left in a corner. She gave it to William, and deſired him, as ſhe pointed out the place in the wall, to remove the ſtones, which were but newly built up, and were but weakly faſtened.</p>
               <p>He did as he was deſired. An iron dooor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, ſo ſmall that a perſon could hardly puſh through. Babet touched a concealed ſpring. The door flew open, and they entered a ſpacious cavern, which was furniſhed only with a few neceſſary articles of furniture, a ſtraw bed, and a mattreſs.</p>
               <p>"Here you may remain quiet and eaſy till night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall. Meanwhile I will diſpatch a perſon to reconnoitre the road, and to bring intelligence. When all is ſafe, I myſelf will return and liberate you from this confinement. My ſervant, in the mean time, ſhall bring you bread and fruit for your refreſhment. Except ſuch ſcanty fare I have nothing to offer.

               <p>She diſappeared. A few minutes after old An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony brought a light and a baſket of fruit. The two friends were then left alone. Frederick threw himſelf on the ſtraw-bed, and hid his face; while William employed himſelf, in ſilence, in rebuilding the ſtones which formed the falſe wall that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed the ſecret door.</p>

               <p>After this common-place remark, (for, alas! there is nothing new to be ſaid under the ſun, and Kant's great diſcoveries, when cloſely conſidered, turn out nothing but new words;) the reader will think it very natural that Frederick's heart, in which no damſel had yet been able to kindle a ſpark, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly burſt out into a flame.</p>

               <p>William, who knew well that there are moments when a man would rather chooſe to be whipped than to be teaſed with queſtions—for the blows you may bear with ſtoical fortitude, but the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you are compelled to anſwer—politely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and began to think of ſome amuſement from the perſecution of ſome ſpiders, which in a vault generally find a moſt ſecure abode. He walked backwards and forwards, whiſtled, ſang, examined the furniture, and ſurveyed the inhabitants, which conſiſted of toads and beetles.</p>
               <p>At laſt, having found a ruſty nail, idleneſs ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him the amuſement ſo natural in inns and
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:035693_0178_100672C320271440"/>
priſons, of ſcrawling his name on the wall. For this purpoſe he took a view of the wall, and pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the largeſt ſquare ſtone, which was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from the reſt by ſome degree of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring mingled with its grey hue. He took a chair to ſtand upon, which ſeemed to have been manufactured in the time of Henry IV. and with the lamp, now quite ſuperfluous to his dreaming companion, in his left hand, the ruſty nail in his right, he mounted up to immortalize his name in this ſubterraneous retreat.</p>
               <p>But what was his aſtoniſhment when he held up the lamp and ſaw an inſcription engraved upon the ſtone? It was clear that it had been formerly employed for the purpoſe he had intended, a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which had made it whiter and more conſpicuous than any of the reſt. The characters were feeble, and in ſome places ſcarcely legible. With conſiderable exertion, however, William made out the following:</p>
               <p>"<hi>Deareſt Babet! If thy innocence at laſt can find no aſylum but this; if you are robbed of all, you will find, under this ſtraw-bed, a proof that, even in his moſt dreary hours, thy father ſtill remembered and cared for thee.</hi>"</p>
               <p>William inſtantly communicated the diſcovery to Frederick, but Frederick ſeemed to treat it with indifference.—"What, don't you hear?" ſaid William. "Riſe, probably beneath that ſtraw a treaſure lies concealed."</p>
               <p>"What is the treaſure to us?" ſaid Frederick, and never ſtirred.</p>
               <p>"But it belongs to our guardian angel—to our generous deliverer!"</p>
               <p>Scarce had William finiſhed this remonſtrance, when Frederick was on his feet, carefully turning over the ſtraw. They found a place where the earth ſeemed looſe. They employed the nail to dig it up, and in a few minutes they pulled out a
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:035693_0179_100672C4E422A410"/>
caſket, which was filled with articles of value. Tranſported at this accident, which enabled them to teſtify their gratitude to their generous hoſteſs, they expected the coming night with redoubled impatience. Almoſt as much as in the diſcovery of the jewels ſeemed Frederick to rejoice in the diſcovery of the name of Babet; for he did noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but repeat this harmonious name, ſometimes aloud, ſometimes quite low, in tender and melting tones.</p>

               <p>ABOUT midnight, gliding ſoftly, like a benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſpirit, the lovely form of their protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs approached.

You muſt remain here till to-morrow night, when, in all probability, tired of the tedious fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſearch, the peaſants ſhall have returned to their occupations.

               <p>"Two hens," ſaid ſhe with a melancholy ſmile
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:035693_0180_100672C67B6AC508"/>
—"two hens are, God knows, all that has eſcaped the general ravage and plunder. Alas! former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our court-yard ſwarmed with poultry, for I delighted to feed them.—Now I have nothing to feed my favorite hens, but they are ſtill alive, and I could not have the heart to kill them.—You muſt be content with the eggs.—I am almoſt ſorry to rob them of theſe."</p>
               <p>"How fortunate is my friend," ſaid William, with a generous ſacrifice of his own accidental merit—"how fortunate is my friend, that he can repay this benevolent kindneſs! While I was aſleep he found a treaſure which will place you, fair Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, in a more comfortable ſituation than that in which you now live."</p>
               <p>Frederick ſtood beſide him, and preſented the caſket. Babet looked with doubtful aſtoniſhment, now at her gueſts, now at the well-known caſket, the appearance of which in the hands of ſtrangers, as well as the mention of her name, ſeemed equally unaccountable. William took hold of the lamp, led Babet to the ſtone, mounted on the chair, and read her father's teſtament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Scarcely had the tender girl recogniſed the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that honored hand, no ſooner had ſhe heard the words "deareſt Babet," than ſhe dropped upon her knees, burſt into tears, and raiſed her hands to the ſacred ſtone.

               <p>"Speak!" ſaid William, while his friend's eyes ſparkled with eagerneſs; and it was eaſy to read in them that he hoped it would at leaſt demand the hazard of his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="unknown:035693_0181_100672CA68CC4660"/>"You will ſoon return to your native country," continued Babet, "and there it is my requeſt that you would endeavour to obtain intelligence of the Chevalier Belloy. He fled to America—perhaps he is ſtill alive!"—She ſaid this with ſuch warmth of feeling, her eye ſeemed to glance to heaven ſo ardent a prayer for the life of the Chevalier, that Frederick was greatly agitated. But he was ſoon relieved from his anxiety when the lovely creature proceeded: "He is my brother—now my only brother!—To him belongs theſe jewels; they may enable him perhaps again to re-eſtabliſh the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of his houſe—for him I commit them to your care. Leave no means untried to diſcover the place of his abode—promiſe me this—ſwear it!"</p>
               <p>She held out her hand to them at once, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their oaths. William preſſed it with firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but his friend was deprived of his conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs when her fingers touched him. He trembled and heſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When William obſerved that ſhe was ſilent, and fixed her tearful eyes upon the ground, he took the liberty to repreſent to her that ſhe was ſtill very young, and ſtood more in need of a proviſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than a brother, who could every where obtain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but no nobleman could live in ſafety. "Such a flight," added he, "is difficult, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money almoſt impoſſible."</p>
               <p>Babet had liſtened to him with ſilence; and with a ſorowful ſmile, "Yes," ſaid ſhe with a look of wild enthuſiaſm, "I will fly!—not fly—but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in triumph—and that is poſſible—it is quite eaſy, without money.—You do not know, "pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſhe with a ſecret horror, while her eye ſparkled benignantly, "you know not, that in ten days I ſhall be with my father!" She looked to heaven with revere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>William aſked her if ſhe was ill, that ſhe felt herſelf ſo near death?</p>
               <p>"O no!" replied ſhe, "God deals very graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with me; he takes me out of this world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſickneſs." (She continued in a low and ſolemn voice) "In ten days, towards evening, a violent ſtorm will take place; the wicked men around ſhall tremble, but I ſhall rejoice.—Then will the lightning ſtrike upon the turret which ſtands there by the water ſide. I ſhall ſtand under the turret, and ſtretch out my hands. Then ſhall the angel of God deſcend from a cloud, and tranſport me to the eternal throne; there ſhall I again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my relations in glory!"</p>
               <p>As ſhe ſpoke this, ſhe betrayed an enthuſiaſtic rapture, and appeared herſelf to be tranſporte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He ſoon perceived that her monaſtic education and her early misfortunes had given her a tincture of ſuperſtitious enthuſiaſm. Se told them, that after her father's death, deprived of her reaſon, ſhe wandered through the grove day and night in wild deſpair, without ſleep or refreſhment. One morning ſhe had ſunk, exhauſted, into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſlumber, and in a dream God had revealed to her that her deliverance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>as at hand.</p>

                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:035693_0183_100672CD6F1592D8"/>"Since that moment," purſued ſhe, "I have been in full poſſeſſion of my ſenſes; my ſorrow has become more placid. I have prepared a coffin to receive my body, and an angel is deſtined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my ſpirit. Congratulate me, the hour is not far diſtant!"</p>
               <p>With ſecret compaſſion William liſtened to the viſionary maid; Frederick turned round, and dropped a ſilent tear. William was too well acquainted with mankind to know that argument and reaſon would here be fruitleſs. He rather appeared to have no doubt of the prophetic dream. He put the caſket in his pocket, and promiſed punctually to fulfil her commands. By degrees he endeavored to awaken other images in her ſoul, to withdraw her attention from that ſingle object on which ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly gazed. He continued to give the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation a direction towards indifferent topics, and even to matters connected with Babet's family. He made her talk of her brothers, their perſon, their character, the regiments in which they had ſerved, and the viſits they had formerly paid her in the cloiſter.</p>
               <p>From this he naturally paſſed to inquiries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the monaſtic ſyſtem of education. He affected to be more unacquainted with it than he really was. He inquired after the mode of life, the plan of inſtruction, the connections and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to which ſuch a ſcene gave riſe.</p>
               <p>At firſt Babet ſeemed to anſwer with reluctance; but, by degrees, ſo many ſcenes were recalled to her remembrance, ſo many youthful incidents oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to her fancy, that at laſt, if ſhe was not talkative, ſhe took part in the converſation. She related many anecdotes; and, at laſt, ſhe felt a pleaſure in relating them. In a word, the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vivacity which gradually diſplayed itſelf in her
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:035693_0184_100672CEF3A95398"/>
whole conduct, clearly ſhowed that ſhe was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for cheerfulneſs, not for melancholy, and that ſolitary grief alone could have produced ſo violent an effect upon her temper.</p>
               <p>She was aſtoniſhed when morning dawned, was vexed at her diſſipation, as ſhe called it, baſhfully apologized, and took her leave, to allow her gueſts to enjoy repoſe. William threw himſelf on the ſtraw. He ſoon dropped into a placid ſlumber, while Frederick paced through the cavern, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill occaſionally on the ſpot which Babet's foot had conſecrated.</p>

it muſt be an inviſible perfume. It muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend in ſhowers like the atmoſphere of our earth, but, like that of the moon, it muſt diſtil in dew. Oh! there is not a ſage in the univerſe who could withſtand the effect of this ſoothing anodyne.</p>
               <p>When Babet returned, about noon, and brought with her, for the entertainment of her gueſts, what nature in the ravaged garden ſtill offered unſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, William began to play his part. He could not calculate indeed upon the aſſiſtance of his friend, for the man who truly loves cannot flatter. He ſummoned all his knowledge of the human heart, and all his experience. What he had often ſeen in the world, and had treated only with contempt, he now endeavored to imitate. Pity and gratitude communicated an irreſiſtible force to his words, and an ardor before which Babet's coldneſs began to melt. Sometimes he was able to extort a ſmile from her; and when ſhe detected herſelf in it, a ſtolen ſigh ſeemed to aſk forgiveneſs of her father's ſpirit. Before two hours had elapſed, William's flattering tongue had ſo far ſucceeded, that the lovely mourner ſat down to table with her gueſts and ſhared the fruits ſhe had provided.</p>
               <p>Day flew rapidly away. Babet with regret ſaw evening approach, for ſhe had inſenſibly acquired a taſte for ſociety. Her eye often dwelt with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular complacency on William, who principally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the converſation. His unembarraſſed heart allowed him to diſplay all his amiable qualities, while Frederick ſat dreaming by his ſide, and, for fear of ſaying ſomething ſilly, choſe to be ſilent.</p>
               <p>When the ſhades of night began to cloſe round, Babet ſent the girl and the footman out, different ways, to learn whether the tempeſt, which had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo violently, was yet allayed. Both returned like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

received with welcome by nobody but William, who was extremely anxious to return to town, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was afraid that he and his companion might be miſſed, and conſidered as deſerters.</p>
               <p>His friend was not at preſent affected by theſe conſiderations. He wiſhed to ſee the villa as thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurrounded by murderers, as the nightly traveller in ſome regions of Africa ſees himſelf ſurrounded by moving fires, for he felt courage to defend Babet againſt a hoſt; and he found that it was in ſuch moments alone that he could teſtify to her his love. As no enemy, however, was to be ſeen, and as the fields were occupied only by crickets and graſshopp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; as the owls glided out and in through the broken windows of the manſion, the two friends prepared for their departure.</p>
               <p>Babet was penſive and melancholy when they went away. She accompanied them to the iron gate, and gave them her hand as they took leave. "Providence above," ſaid ſhe, "has brought us together—be to me as brothers while I continue to ſojourn here below.—It is but ten days to the wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for hour—viſit your ſiſter ſometimes before ſhe goes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They took their leave. Frederick often ſtopped to look back, though it was quite dark. Babet ſtood at the gate, and liſtened to the footſteps of her gueſts, which ſounded through the ſilent night. She then ſlowly returned.—She thought of going to the grotto, to her father's body, yet deſcended penſive to the cavern. She threw herſelf on the bed of ſtraw, to meditate fully on her approaching death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="unknown:035693_0187_100672D63B3A6638"/>Since her acquaintance with William, this idea ſeemed to have acquired new charms, for with the ſolemn image of death ſhe aſſociated the agreeable picture of her new brother. She reſolved, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the eventful day he ſhould not leave her. She ſaw herſelf, ſtruck lifeleſs by the lightning, ſink into his arms—ſhe thought how he would ſtretch her body tenderly upon the graſs—how he would kneel beſide her—A tear dropped from his eye on her cold hand—and at the thought her cheek glowed— he impreſſes a brother's kiſs upon her pallid lips!</p>
               <p>Thus were aſſociated with the thoughts of death many delightful images, drawn by the pencil of pureſt innocence in the moſt pleaſing colours. Death indeed ſtill was in the perſpective of the picture, but with a fainter light than the more cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating features. She expected, with a degree of impatience, a ſecond viſit from her gueſts. She no longer lay unconſcious on her father's coffin, but ſat upon it wiſtfully, and liſtened to the murmur of the waters which daſhed on the banks of the little Iſland. The nightingale ſung in the grove, and ſhe blamed herſelf beauſe his melody gave her pleaſure. The ſervant brought her a pigeon for dinner. She chid him for ſuppoſing ſhe could be hungry; and when he was gone, ſhe ate firſt one wing, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then the whole pigeon.</p>
               <p>A ſoft and ſecret melancholy ſometimes drove her from the grotto to the houſe, from the windows of which ſhe had a view of the road, both on the right and left. She walked up and down through the empty apartment, and ſometimes threw a ſtolen glance on the ſhattered looking-glaſs.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, poor Frederick, ill at heart, ſtalked about like a ſpectre, and muſt have bled to death of the deep wound he had received, had not his friend, with unwearied attention, poured into it the balm of hope.

a lover ſacred as holy writ, Frederick, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his excellent underſtanding, was not diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe that really in ten days a ſtroke of lightning would tear Babet from him; and William was obliged to laugh him out of this conceit, ſince to reaſon him out of it was impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Even although, perhaps, Babet ſhould be ſaved from the dreaded lightning, would ſhe be diſpoſed to forget her grief in his arms? The hope appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too bold, for true love would make even a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus modeſt! William, who coolly conſidered the ſituation of affairs, endeavored to remove every doubt, and to convince the timid lover that Babet's youthful innocence, her deſtitute ſituation, and the unoccupied ſtate of her heart, would enable him to ſecure her affection. He encouraged him, at leaſt, to make his eyes the interpreters of his heart, and not to appear ever before her with downcaſt looks. Frederick promiſed every thing, but did not keep his word; for firſt love embarraſſes every motion, becauſe it is ever fearful to offend.</p>
               <p>They received a very agreeable piece of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence on their return to town. The perſons who had cut down the tree of liberty, had been taken in another village, and condemned to an ignominious puniſhment. The two friends, therefore, were enabled, without danger, to continue their little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, and Frederick wiſhed to avail himſelf of this liberty, though a circumſtance in itſelf very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, to prevail upon William to pay Babet a ſecond viſit the following day. William, however, more cool than his friend, was afraid that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic girl might be diſpleaſed, and thought it better to wait till the day after.</p>
               <p>Frederick curſed the coldneſs of his companion, ſtood the whole day che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="191" facs="unknown:035693_0189_100672DA9D1914D8"/>
rouſed William, who lay faſt aſleep, and maintained that it was already day-break. It was but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining moon, which ſhot a feeble ray into their apartment.</p>
               <p>At laſt the eaſtern horizon was overſpread with purple clouds, and before the firſt rays of the ſun peeped through the grey twilight, the two friends were already in the ſtreet. The doors were all ſhut, and their footſteps alone reſounded along the empty pavement. They had this time loaded their pockets with all kinds of proviſions, and hoped to prevail upon their benefactreſs to partake of a frugal meal. William meditated, as he walked along, how he ſhould tempt her from the gloomy grotto, where the terrific objects it contained furniſhed freſh food for her grief. His care, however, was unneceſſary; for when the travellers arrived at the iron gate, they ſaw Babet ſitting under a lime-tree on the lawn, feeding her two hens with crumbs of bread.</p>
               <p>The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vely creature bluſhed modeſtly, and bade them kindly welcome. William ſecretly made the agreeable remark that her hair was dreſſed with ſome degree of care, and that her boſom was more ſtudiouſly covered than it was the firſt time they ſaw her.</p>
               <p>They all ſat down under the lime-tree. The converſation of the little circle, indeed, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained. They ſeemed to be afraid to diſplay any ſymptoms of joy. The lovely dreamer was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hurt to perceive that all alluſion to her afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was carefully avoided, and ſhe herſelf likewiſe forbore to mention it. William exerted every ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in his power to animate the converſation, and he ſometimes ſucceeded. Babet appeared to feel his anxiety with gratitude, and repaid his exertions by many kind looks. In a word, her natural feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for the pleaſures of life awoke. She again
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:035693_0190_100672DD54E54228"/>
reſumed an intereſt in what paſſed around her. Of Frederick's love, however, ſhe entertained no ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion. A more experienced girl would have gueſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from his vacant ſtare, his embarraſſment when ſhe ſpoke to him, the bluſh upon his cheeks when her eye met his, what paſſed in his heart. But Babet, educated in the ſecluſion of a cloiſter, never ſuſpected the power of her charms.</p>
               <p>The day paſſed in the utmoſt harmony. Babet led her gueſts through the fields, the meadows, and gardens, pointed out and deſcribed to them all its former beauties, every place that was now deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. She dwelt with a melancholy pleaſure on every ſpot which had been the favorite of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſaid, that if ſhe were not ſo well convinced of her ſpeedy death, ſhe could not endure the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy proſpect of theſe ſcenes, but would fly from her country.</p>
               <p>William ſeized this opportunity to deſcant on the charms of his native land, and to declare with what cordial welcome ſhe would there be received. He lamented that fate denied him the pleaſure of being her deliverer. He ventured even to expreſs the wiſh that his prayers might avert the fatal lightning.</p>
               <p>He then watched her countenance unobſerved, to ſee whether ſhe betrayed any diſlike at ſuch an idea; and he had the ſatisfaction to perceive that, though ſhe was ſilent, her downcaſt looks teſtified ſeriouſneſs, not diſpleaſure. Contented with his firſt ſucceſs, he broke off the converſation, and left to her own imagination to complete the ſketch in ſolitude.</p>
               <p>When evening began to ſpread its ſhades, the party ſeparated, with the promiſe of ſeeing each other daily till the fatal hour arrived. Poor Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick's heart was more deeply pierced than ever, for Babet, in a few hours, with ſiſterly ſolicitude,

               <p>REVIEWERS and undertakers reſemble each other in this, that they both perform their reſpective functions for hire; the latter are paid to mourn, the former to abuſe. Both of them are engaged indeed in preciſely the ſame occupation, that of making hired criticiſms, the latter upon men who are carried to the grave; the former upon books, which people are at perfect liberty, if they pleaſe, to carry to the ſame place.</p>
               <p>Should any body obſerve that this remark is very unſeaſonable upon the preſent occaſion, I have two anſwers ready. Firſt, I follow the example of Cato, who, whatever ſubject might have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed in the ſenate, always concluded his ſpeech with: <hi>Coeterùm puto Carthaginem eſſe delen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="194" facs="unknown:035693_0192_100672E064C930C8"/>
the authority of this great example muſt be the more concluſive for my juſtification, as the republic of letters would evidently gain a great deal more by the extermination of Reviewers than Rome could do by the deſtruction of Carthage.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this remark is not quite ſo foreign from the purpoſe as on the firſt glance might be imagined; for this true hiſtory now is at that very period which gives the Prometheuſes among the reviewers an opportunity to ſurpaſs the work of the gods. Babet, will they ſay, the rapt enthuſiaſt, that ſcarce ſeemed to touch the earth, now too eaſily admits of conſolation, and forgets the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of her father and brothers, as ſoon as if merely her lap-dog had torn her handkerchief. <hi>There is no conſiſtency in the character!</hi>

                  </gap>kin in the meads would care for a dancing-maſter, who ſhould preſcribe how he ought to ſkip. The celebrated Mr. <hi>Huber</hi> (I had almoſt forgot to add, author of the <hi>Secret Tribunal</hi>) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where obſerves, that "Brutus is the moſt conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent character in the hiſtory of the world." Although ſuch a remark is advanced only becauſe it ſounds extraordinary, it follows, from this hyper-critic's own confeſſion, that there are very few conſiſtent characters in the hiſtory of the world. The author of the world, we all know, is dame Nature; and if ſhe exhauſted her powers on Brutus, Babet may juſtly hope to be forgiven.</p>
               <p>We candidly acknowledge, therefore, that the good young lady, in conſequence of the repeated viſits of her new brothers, diſcovered in the laſt ten days of her life a quite different temper of mind from that which ſhe had diſplayed when ſhe rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the caſket, with contempt of all terreſtrial things. She was now attached to life by ſecret wiſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="unknown:035693_0193_100672E452FC07F8"/>Three days had Babet, according to her calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſtill to live. On the firſt ſhe confeſſed that ſhe had too precipitately prayed for death; on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſhe even ventured to think that God too haſtily had granted her prayer; and on the third ſhe trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the ſucceeding morn.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as William obſerved this favourable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, he began to ſuggeſt doubts of the fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the prophetic dream. He repeated a number of examples of dreams which had never been fulfilled. He explained as well as he could (for who can perfectly explain it?) the effect of the ſtate of the blood, or exceſſive agitation of the corporeal organs, upon the mind of the ſleeper. Babet did not underſtand him; but ſhe liſtened with reſpect, and ſecretly wiſhed he might be right.</p>
               <p>She had inſenſibly conceived a ſtrong attachment to William; with this attachment was connected a ſiſterly confidence, and in their walks ſhe clung to his ſide with as little conſtraint as if he had been one of the nuns with whom ſhe uſed to walk in the gardens of the convent. Frederick, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſeemed only the moon, which borrowed a feeble ray from the friendly ſun. She eſteemed him likewiſe, but it was more with a feeling of friendſhip. How could it be otherwiſe? Love had veiled all his ſplendid and amiable qualities in the miſt of reſerve.</p>
               <p>When, on the evening before the awful day, they ſeparated with beating hearts, the lovely Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, with trembling voice, entreated her friends to return very early next day, that ſhe might not be utterly deſerted in her laſt hour. William prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed for both; and as the ſultry evening really portended a ſtorm, they ſcarce went an hundred yards from Babet's houſe, to be nearer at hand, and took up their lodgings at an inn.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="unknown:035693_0194_100672E5D5B8D250"/>A lover, as all the world knows, is ever in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes. He is in raptures or in deſpair; he is dumb or talkative; and when in the humour to ſpeak, his ſubject is ſo inexhauſtible, that he commonly ſpares the hearer the trouble of an anſwer; and a tree or a man, therefore, are often equally his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidantes. That Frederick, in the ſilence of night, in the ſleepleſs hours, ſhould dwell upon the charms of his beloved; that he ſhould deſcant with all his eloquence on Babet's beauty and innocence, was quite as natural as that William, who could hope to hear nothing new on this ſubject, ſhould fall aſleep. Receiving no anſwer to his queſtions, and hearing his companion breathe louder than before, the orator at length perceived that he was uttering his complaints to the bare walls. He was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to diſturb his friend's ſlumber; he roſe, went out, and groped his way in the dark along the road.</p>
               <p>As during the laſt ten days he had formed an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with every ſtone and tree which ſtood or lay in the road to Babet's houſe, it was not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for him, in ſpite of the darkneſs which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him, to find the well-known path to the abode of his beloved, without ſtumbling or knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his head againſt a poſt. He arrived ſafe at the iron gate, and through the rails contemplated with ſighs the broken windows, from which a ſolitary lamp ſhed a feeble light. He walked backwards and forwards, breathed lengthened ſighs, and in the ſilence of night repeated, ſometimes aloud, ſometimes in a low voice, the name of Babet.</p>
               <p>Alas! he knew not what agoniſing tortures he had occaſioned his beloved by this nocturnal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion. The timorous maiden had ſtood at the window ever ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> her friends had left her, gazing at the gloomy clouds, which gathered in the weſt, and ſeemed to carry in their boſom the arrow of death. The diſtant lightning increaſed her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:035693_0195_100672E7A797F898"/>
—her heart trembled as often as the flaſh burſt from the cloud!</p>
               <p>But what were her feelings when, by this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid light, ſhe ſuddenly ſaw a figure walking back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards at the iron gate!—when ſhe heard profound ſighs, and diſtinctly heard her name pronounced!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My father's ghoſt!</hi>—The idea ſtruck horror through her whole frame, and her teeth chattered.—"The ghoſt of my father ſummons me hence!—My dream was no idle phantom of the brain!—My laſt hour approaches!—The ſpirits of the dead are ready to receive me!"</p>
               <p>She dropped down upon her knees, and attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pray; but ſhe fell ſenſeleſs upon the floor. Frederick, unconſcious of the miſchief he had done, had now finiſhed his romantic excurſion; for the light ſtreaks which appeared in the eaſt announced the coming day. He returned and awaked his friend. With the firſt dawn of the morning they were at the door.</p>
               <p>They aſcended the ſtair without noiſe and found the ſervants ſtill buried in ſleep. They imagined that Babet was likewiſe in bed. William opened the door of her room as carefully as a mother who is fearful of diſturbing the ſlumbers of her ſick child. Frederick ſtood behind him, and threw a timid glance over his ſhoulders. The maid lay ſtretched upon the door.</p>
               <p>"She is aſleep," whiſpered William, and was about to retire. But Frederick, with ill preſaging alarm, advanced nearer, took her hand, found it cold as clay, and ſcreamed, "She is dead!—The terrors of imagination have killed her!" William endeavoured without ſucceſs, to moderate the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of his grief. He ran through the room like a perſon frantic and exclaimed in agonizing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair:
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:035693_0196_100672E92BBD4FB8"/>
"She is gone!—Is there now a compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate thunderbolt reſerved for me!" With wild cries he threw himſelf on the ſuppoſed corpſe— with frantic grief he ſprang up to look for ſome weapon to put an end to his miſerable exiſtence. William begged and threatened—ſometimes with tenderneſs, ſometimes with anger—in vain! Frederick, heard him not—till at laſt his friend ſeized him forcibly in his arms, and ſhouted in his ear: Man! are you mad?—She is not dead!—her heart beats ſtill!"</p>
               <p>Frederick now threw himſelf down tranſported beſide his beloved, laid his trembling hand upon her heart, felt it beat, and to the moſt violent grief ſucceeded the moſt immoderate expreſſions of joy. He preſſed William to his breaſt—embraced the old footman—he wept, and ſhouted. He never thought of applying the proper means to recover her from the ſwoon—it was enough that ſhe was alive—her heart beat, he thanked heaven with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm!</p>
               <p>Meanwhile, William had rouſed the ſervant. Cold ſpring water was the only cordial with which ſhe could ſupply him. He ſprinkled Babet's face, rubbed her arms and temples, and in a few minutes ſhe opened her eyes.</p>
               <p>She looked round wildly, and eagerly preſſed William's hand. "I thank you," ſaid ſhe, "for having come ſo early.—Soon, very ſoon, and my death-hour knells." William led her to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, pointed out to her the beauties of the bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morn, remarked how the black clouds diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, how the thick moſt formed an ocean in the valley, all indications of a pleaſant day. The bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morn, however, had no charms for Babet. Her eye gazed wildly at the iron gate—there was the place where the ſpectre ſtalked—thence iſſued the diſmal groans—thence it had called the name of
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:035693_0197_100889A6B1AEC3E8"/>
Babet. In vain did William endeavor to amuſe her mind, and to withdraw her attention from the object on which it dwelt. "Leave me, ſaid ſhe, "I muſt die—too ſure this day I die—My father's ghoſt has appeared to me—his warning ſummons has rouſed me from my ſinful hopes.—I go to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for death."</p>
               <p>Without farther explanation reſpecting the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the apparition, ſhe retired into an adjoining room to pray. Aſtoniſhed and chagrined, William looked at her, and curſed the demon that, with ſome new phantaſy of a diſordered imagination, had blaſted the fruits of his exertions. In vain the two friends endeavoured to gather from the domeſtics, whether, ſince laſt night, any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary had occurred. They knew of nothing. Babet had ordered them to go to bed, and they obeyed without oppoſition, for it was no new thing for their miſtreſs not to undreſs at all. William could now no longer conceal the impreſſion which the circumſtance made upon his mind. He dreaded not indeed any miracle of nature; but he dreaded the wonderful effects of imagination, which, ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten governed by phantoms of its own creation, ſilences the feeble voice of reaſon. In a word, he dreaded not Babet's death, but, what is worſe than<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> death—madneſs. He endeavored, as well as he could, to conceal theſe melancholy thoughts from his friend, who walked about with tottering ſteps and folded hands, in viſible agitation. Sometimes he ſtood gazing at the door through which ſhe had diſappeared. Sometimes he ſtopped ſhort, looked at him wiſtfully, as if to ſeek conſolation in his eye.</p>
               <p>After the lapſe of an hour Babet returned to the room, and a ſupernatural ſerenity ſat majeſtic upon her brow. She ſpoke little, anſwered ſhortly, and ſeemed afraid to drop a ſingle word that could indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:035693_0198_10064D489A62AB50"/>
a doubt of her approaching death—as if ſhe feared to loſe that compoſure and reſignation ſhe had prayed from heaven.</p>
               <p>The converſation was very conſtrained. Of dreams, apparitions, and dying, the brothers would not talk, and the ſiſter would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ear of nothing elſe. They walked up and down together, almoſt in ſilence. From Frederick's breaſt heaved long heavy ſighs, as if he himſelf had been condemned to die. Babet walked about in ſtill meditation, not a breath, not a footſtep was heard. Spirits ſkim along the earth—and Babet was already almoſt diſembodied.</p>
               <p>William, from time to time, went to the window, and failed not always to obſerve, that the morning was delightful and ſerene, that not a threating cloud hung on the horizon. The viſionary maid how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, heard his remarks with indifference, for the voice of the ſpectre ſtill vibrated in her ear.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. THE STORM.</head>
               <p>WHEN the ſun had advanced far towards the meridian, and an oppreſſive heat announced the higheſt influence of his reign; when his burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rays penetrated through the unſhaded windows into the apartment, Babet herſelf propoſed a walk in the grove. It was not, indeed, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh herſelf in the cooling ſhade; for ſhe would have been aſhamed, when at the very verge of the world of ſpirits, to have expreſſed any corporeal
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:035693_0199_10064D4A6D7F4338"/>
inconvenience. She wiſhed unobſerved to approach the turret which her dream had pointed out as the termination of her pilgrimage, and the humanity which ſtill adhered to her, taught her the tender delicacy of concealing this circumſtance from her anxious friends.</p>
               <p>William ſeized the proffered plan of amuſement, ſlight as it was. They went out; and the good-hearted William, whoſe ſuſpicions had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered into a wrong track, ſtudiouſly endeavored to conduct her far from the little iſland and the hideous grotto. Babet obſerved it, and ſaid with a ſmile: "Why this anxiety?—Why ſhould I now with to viſit the melancholy remains of my father, ſince in a few hours I ſhall ſee him in glory?"</p>
               <p>William ſighed ſoftly at her invincible credulity, and Frederick ſorrowfully broke the twigs as he paſſed along from every buſh. At laſt the ſultry noon-day heat compelled them to ſeek the moſt ſhady place of the grove, where a gravel foot-path led to a ſolitary hermitage which received only a feeble light through a little window, round which ivy and wild hopes were entwined.</p>
               <p>Here a moſſy bank invited them to reſt from their fatigue. Babet ſeated herſelf between her two brothers; and William, who found that it was important to talk, be the ſubject what it might, in order to divert the attention of the viſionary, took up the moſt indifferent topics. He deſcanted upon the beauty of the butterfly, and the induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the ant. At laſt, a coat of arms, which was pointed on one of the panes, afforded matter for along and intereſting converſation. Among many other uſeleſs things, Babet in the cloiſter had likewiſe learnt heraldry. The artful William, who really underſtood little of the ſubject, affected to be more ignorant than he really was, and with exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary patience led her to explain all the mummery
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:035693_0200_10064D4D51BF4238"/>
of creſts, ſupporters, &amp;c. When upon a critical occaſion it is important to withdraw the mind from ſome ruling object, the moſt trifling means are not to be deſpiſed, ſince by the aſſociation of ideas they awaken they produce the happieſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. Babet exhauſted the ſcience ſhe had acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the cloiſter on the arms of her female friends, whoſe images recurred to her mind as ſhe dwelt upon topics with which they were connected, or renewed the faded recollection of paſt ſcenes. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly the ſubject withdrew her from the gloomy contemplation of death. Who knows how far William might have ſucceeded, for two hours had thus clapſed, when ſuddenly the noiſe of the diſtant thunder ſtruck alarm into the little party!</p>
               <p>Babet grew pale—the blood forſook Frederick's cheeks—even William was diſconcerted, and ſecretly repined at fortune, which ſeemed reſolved ſtill farther to prove the poor ſuperſtitious maid. All three ſprang up, and haſtened to the door. The horizon was overcaſt, the wind howled through the trees, the croaking ravens flew to their neſts, and the birds flattered about in alarm.</p>
               <p>Babet folded her trembling hands: "Follow me!" ſaid ſhe with faltering voice; "leave me not!"</p>
               <p>Frederick was ſo confounded and agitated by what he ſaw, and what he felt, that he knew not what he did. "Would to God!" ſaid he as he ſeized Babet's hand, and preſſed it eagerly, "would to God I could die with you!"—She ſtarted, and gazed at him wildly. She then gently diſengaged herſelf, and flew ſo rapidly through the thick buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that the two friends could hardly follow her. The ſtorm approached nearer and nearer, the big drops fell, the wind whiſtled, and the ruſtling leaves were ſhaken from the trees.</p>

                  </gap>reathleſs ran Babet through a meadow, which
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:035693_0201_10064D5026123B28"/>
the river formed into a peninſula, at the extremity of which ſtood the ruins of the old tower, under the nodding walls of which ſhe reſolved to bury herſelf. William followed her cloſe, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took her juſt as ſhe ſunk down exhauſted upon a ſtone, and ſtretched out her arms to Heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the angel of death.</p>
               <p>Her brothers kneeled by her ſide. With ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and the agitation of her rapid race her breaſt was like to burſt. William looked round<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and perceived that in this dangerous ſituation accident might very eaſily realize Babet's prophetic dream; for the turret was ſurrounded by tall oaks, whoſe tops defied the tempeſt, and ſeemed boldly to tempt the lightning down. But it would have been in vain to mention this danger. The luckleſs Babet was already almoſt in the agonies of death.</p>
               <p>The black cloud hung directly over their head —the thunder pealed tremendous—the lightning darted quicker and more vivid—the wind ſuddenly died away—the rain ceaſed—a ſullen ſilence reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the ſullen landſcape—a ſultry breeze taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every flower—death ſeemed to hang the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning clouds in maffy chains over their heads— Babet breathed languid—the luſtre of her eye was faded—Hark! the lightning craſhes upon the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, ſhivers the wall, the ruins roll into the river, and the earth trembles.</p>
               <p>"<hi>Jeſu Maria!</hi>" cried a voice from the midſt of the ruins.—Babet lay lifeleſs on the ground—the hail deſcended in torrents—Frederick was motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs—William lifted Babet, who lay ſenſeleſs, cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered her with his great coat, and turned towards the ruins, from whence the voice had iſſued. He ſaw, and ſhuddered.—Through the gaping wall, between ſtones which ſtill ſeparated and tumbled down, appeared the figure of a young man as if riſing out of the grave. Pale and haggard, covered
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:035693_0202_10064D51E81A3C40"/>
only with a few rags, he gazed wildly it the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and advanced in ſilence like a ſpectre.</p>
               <p>"Who art thou?" cried William. The ſpectre anſwered not. The rain beat on his uncovered head; he viſibly trembled, and endeavored to hide his naked limbs. Rouſed by William's ſummons, his friend turned round, and gazed at the figure, which inſpired a mingled feeling of compaſſion and fear. He ſprang up, advanced haſtily towards the apparition, and cried in a rougher voice, "Who are you? What do you want?"</p>
               <p>"Spare me!" ſaid the young man with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling voice; "you ſee that God has now ſpared me.—I beheld from the turret how you kneeled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the ſide of this virtuous maid.—Happy for me that you prize her ſo much! My Babet will pray for me!"</p>
               <p>"<hi>Your</hi> Babet?" cried Frederick ſtarting back, and eyeing the figure with doubtful penetrating looks, and reluctantly perceived in him an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome young man, whom want and miſery had worn to the bone.</p>
               <p>"<hi>Your Babet!</hi>" repeated William with curioſity.</p>
               <p>"<hi>My Babet!</hi>" ſaid the young man ſomewhat more firmly, and advanced uninterrupted to the lifeleſs maid, kneeled beſide her, and endeavoured to warm her cold hands between his. Frederick ſtood gazing ſpeechleſs—an indignant feeling darted through his heart. He felt as if the odious wiſh aroſe in his mind that Babet might never awake.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the ſtormy clouds had ſpent their fury, the thunder now rolled at a greater diſtance, a ſoft ſhower revived the earth, the flowers again reared their heads, the birds began to twitter; with the birds and the flowers Babet alſo awoke, and found herſelf—in the arms of her brother.</p>
               <p>His countenance was the firſt object which met her half-opened eyes; it was not extraordinary,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:035693_0203_10064D5378D1B720"/>
therefore, that her imagination, aſſailed by dreams and by realities, ſhould fancy that ſhe awoke in L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yſium. She thought herſelf deceaſed, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the abodes of the bleſſed.</p>
               <p>"My brother Philip!" ſaid ſhe in feeble accents, "has death again united us?—Where is our father? —Why comes he not to receive his daughter?"</p>
               <p>When he heard the unſuſpicious name of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, peace returned to Frederick's breaſt. The youth, againſt whom he thought he had felt an emotion of hatred, ſuddenly became dear to him— he was Babet's brother!</p>
               <p>It was a long time before Babet could perſuade herſelf that ſhe was really alive; the ſuppoſed ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it of her brother before her ſupported the decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was not in any degree removed by the preſence of her friends, for ſhe believed that they too had been killed by the lightning. The youth, by lengthened miſery and continual danger, from which he had not yet eſcaped, was weakened both in mind and body; he ſtill conſidered the ſtrangers as purſuers, who thirſted for his blood. In Frederick's boſom, joy on Babet's recovery ſtruggled with the apprehenſion of what might be the conſequence of her having found a brother, who might perhaps diſapprove his love. Theſe doubts kept him penſive and ſilent.</p>
               <p>William was the only one who, in a few min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes, recovered his preſence of mind. He obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this place, drenched with rain, and the melancholy proſpect of the ruins, was not calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for receiving mutual explanations. He made a ſign to his friend to lead the exhauſted Babet home, while he himſelf ſupported her tottering brother. The way was long through the dripping grove. Whenever a drop from the branches fell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Frederick's eyes hung upon her with anxious ſolicitude; her arm lay in his; he trembled like the aſpen-tree, whoſe overhanging leaves cooled the glow of his cheeks; it was the moſt painful journey he had ever performed. He thought he ſhould never be able to reach its termination; he looked towards the houſe, and yet wiſhed that it were miles diſtant.</p>
               <p>William was examined with keenneſs and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion by his haggard companion. The near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they approached the manſion-houſe, the more his hollow eye teſtified ſuſpicion and uneaſineſs. Often he was on the point of running away, and probably he would have yielded to this impulſe had he felt himſelf ſtrong enough to eſcape from two vigorous purſuers. He trembled as he entered the houſe, and his confidence did not return till on the ſtair he met the faithful old footman, who threw himſelf at his feet with ſhouts or joy.</p>
               <p>They at laſt reached Babet's apartment, where the brother and ſiſter viewed every thing around them with looks of wildneſs and ſurpriſe. William preſcribed for them refreſhment and repoſe, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of powerful virtue even for diſeaſed minds.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. THE SEPARATION.</head>
               <p>CHEVALIER BELLOY, the ſame whom his ſiſter imagined to be on his way to America, had ſeen his father and brother murdered by his ſide, and had withdrawn himſelf from the fury of his perſecutors by taking an aſylum among ſome inacceſſible ruins, which in the amuſements of his boyiſh days had been thoroughly explored, and were perfectly familiar to him. Here he ventured for many weeks only to creep out with the owls, to gather wild roots and fruits for his ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. At firſt he ſuppoſed that the whole man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was deſtroyed, and that his ſiſter too had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len a prey to the rage of his ſanguinary perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, till one day, through the chink of his retreat, he ſaw her in deep ſorrow walking at the foot of the tower.</p>
               <p>He was on the point of running down to throw himſelf into her arms, when he was deterred by a dread of the loud expreſſions of her ſudden joy. He did not know who might be in the neighbourhood; whether ſhe might not be a priſoner. Had he not reaſon to dread ſpies and ambuſh in every thicket?—The ſorrowful Babet again retired from the tower; and though in a few days after want and affection had overcome all his ſcruples, and he was determined to come forth in ſpite of every danger, the lovely form never again appeared to his view.</p>
               <p>At laſt, when he had no longer any means of ſupporting his exiſtence, he reſolved in deſpair to
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:035693_0206_10064D5AD71B4498"/>
quit his retreat, and again throw himſelf into his ſiſter's arms, or expoſe himſelf to the daggers of his blood-thirſty murderers. He had for this purpoſe fixed upon the day when the roots he had collected by moonlight were exhauſted, and he had no longer any means of ſupporting his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exiſtence.</p>
               <p>This, however, was the very day when our fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives had been driven into the grotto by the wild rabble, who filled the garden, the grove, and the whole neighbourhood with their frantic ſhouts. Philip thought he was betrayed, that this careful ſearch, this roar of the wild beaſts for prey was directed againſt him. More than once, indeed, the tower had been ſurrounded by the raging mob; the boldeſt of them ventured into the tower, and clambered over the moſs-grown ruins. As the only acceſs to Philip's retreat was by a ſmall opening, before which he had piled up the ſtones in artful diſorder, he eſcaped their ſearch.</p>
               <p>As, however, nothing appeared more certain than that he was the object of their purſuit, his fears were redoubled, and in the firſt days which ſucceeded this incident, he did not even truſt his life to the friendly darkneſs of night, but reſigned himſelf a prey to the moſt preſſing hunger and thirſt, till he was almoſt too much reduced to be able to quit the place of his retreat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Meanwhile he ſometimes ſaw his ſiſter in the neighbourhood of the tower, and rejoiced to ſee her ſafe. Now, however, ſhe appeared to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by two ſtrangers, whoſe ſuſpicious preſence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him from diſcovering himſelf, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as the deep grief which Babet's features bore, gave him reaſon to apprehend that her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants were no friends but guards.</p>
               <p>When firſt in the obſcurity of night he ventured out to allay his thirſt in a neighbouring pond, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:035693_0207_10064D5C6238D958"/>
drove him into the court of his father's houſe; and had he found the door open, he would in ſpite of all danger have penetrated to his ſiſter's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but all was faſt. Should he make a noiſe, ſhould he knock at the door, muſt he not meet the ſuſpicious ſtrangers whom he daily ſaw wand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering in the garden? Irreſolute he walked about till the firſt cock-crow chaſed him back to his ruins.</p>
               <p>Yet longer to endure this accumulation of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery was beyond the ſtrength of a young man rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the lap of proſperity, on whom every joy of life had ſhed its gentleſt influence, and whom the winds of Heaven had never viſited too roughly, Want and deſpair unfolded that courage which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> effeminacy and profuſion, had weakened: for all our virtues and vices are the offspring of natural or artificial wants. He had formed an irrevocable determination the enſuing night to force his way into his father's houſe, and, if it was poſſeſſed by murderers, to die in his ſiſter's arms. The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt anticipated the execution of his deſign, ſprang open his dungeon, and accidentally threw him into the hands of friends.</p>
               <p>Such was the ſtory which he communicated when refreſhment had recovered him from the firſt ſtupefaction of returning ſenſibility. The diſcovery that William and Frederick were priſoners of war inſpired him with confidence. Their blue coats, which he had hitherto miſtaken for the uniform of the national guard, he no longer viewed with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, Theſe men had fought for <hi>his</hi> rights; they were of <hi>his</hi> political faith, and could not betray him. When ſimilar neceſſities and ſimilar principles form a point of union among men, the moſt ſuſpicious ſouls ſoon cordially fraterniſe.</p>
               <p>The clouds which had obſcured Babet's mind
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:035693_0208_10064D5F0F167128"/>
now began to diſperſe. She felt that ſhe was alive, and appeared to be pleaſed at the feeling. William, who anxiouſly obſerved every change of her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, now ventured more directly to pronounce the prophetic dream to be a deluſion of the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and to refute his opinion, ſhe recapitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſtory of the apparition of her father, and the awful ſummons, with the minuteſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. When ſhe led her friends to the window, to ſhow them the place at the gate where the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre had walked and ſighed, Frederick bluſhed, and ſtammered out the confeſſion, that he was the figure which had occaſioned her ſo much uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and he reſpectfully begged her forgiveneſs for having ſighed ſo loud.</p>
               <p>Babet's joy at this diſcovery ſerved to conceal the ingenuous ſhame which glowed in her cheeks, on hearing Frederick's confeſſion. His romantic nocturnal excurſion recalled to her mind the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common eagerneſs with which, at the door of the hermitage, he had expreſſed the wiſh that he might die with her. Inexperienced as ſhe was in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paſſion, ſhe yet would have ſworn that this was love—and the roſes on her cheeks changed into the deepeſt ſcarlet.</p>
               <p>Philip, who had long known that paſſion, gueſſed what paſſed in the heart of the ſtranger. The conqueſt his ſiſter had made ſeemed to give him pleaſure, as in his own deſtitute and unſettled ſituation he was unable to afford her protection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; and he rejoiced at the proſpect of her honor being ſecured, in a union with a man of worth. That the modeſt, backward Frederick was no ſeducer his own experience convinced him, for at the firſt glance he diſcovered a man unhackneyed in the ways of vice. The ſame evening, too, William completely removed every doubt, by availing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of a favourable opportunity to acquaint him with the pure and honorable paſſion of his friend.</p>

                  <pb n="211" facs="unknown:035693_0209_10064D62598F80B8"/>"Is he a nobleman?" was the only queſtion which the prejudices of this Frenchman of the old ſchool ſuggeſted; and when William, by an evaſion, had ſatisfied him upon that ſubject, he joyfully gave his conſent to the propoſal, that, as ſoon as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of priſoners took place, Babet ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Frederick as his bride.</p>
               <p>The baſhful lover meanwhile had remained alone with the object of his wiſhes, but his courage had ceaſed with the tempeſt. He allowed the favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opportunity of completing in the evening what he had begun in the morning, to eſcape. They both ſat in profound ſilence—both fixed their eyes on the ground—Frederick becauſe he had already ſaid too much, and Babet becauſe ſhe had heard too much to remain longer doubtful of the ſituation of his heart.</p>
               <p>In the delightful feeling of having eſcaped the dangers by which they were threatened, the little party ſpent, in friendly confidence and harmony, the remainder of a day which had begun with ſuch unfavorable auſpices. They now began to conſult what was to be done with Philip. Babet inſiſted that he ſhould take refuge in the inacceſſible ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern till the republican tempeſt had ſpent its fury. Even Philip himſelf was at firſt inclined to this propoſal. When he was informed, however, of the treaſure which had been found, and ſaw the caſket full of diamonds, with the value of which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the inexperienced company, he ſuddenly changed his reſolution.</p>
               <p>He was too generous, indeed, or rather too thoughtleſs, notwithſtanding Babet's entreaties, to take more than a ſmall proportion of his father's bequeſt. He would not, as he ſaid, diminiſh the little dowry of his ſiſter, as the three rings which he appropriated to himſelf were fully ſufficient to carry him out of the territories of France. He
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:035693_0210_10064D63E4F37CE8"/>
then propoſed to equip himſelf in a manner ſuitable to his rank, haſten to the army of the Prince of Conde, and never again ſet his foot on the ſoil of his ungrateful country, till he came back to reclaim his paternal inheritance with armed hand. "Thy ſate, my dear Babet," ſaid he with a ſignificant ſmile, "I commit to theſe brave men. They are noblemen, they are ſoldiers, and I rely upon them with confidence. To them I transfer the father's authority and the brother's duties, which fortune now denies me an opportunity to exerciſe. Under their protection leave this deſolate manſion, as ſoon as they invite you to fly to a more ſafe and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble retreat."</p>
               <p>In vain Babet laboured to prevail upon him to prefer the ſecurity of the cavern to an unſafe flight; in vain ſhe offered, ſince he was not to be diverted from his reſolution, to accompany him and ſhare every danger. He urged ſo many plauſible and powerful reaſons againſt this propoſal, and William, although he did not altogether approve the thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs with which the Chevalier entruſted the happineſs of his ſiſter in the hands of men whom he had never before ſeen, ſupported him ſo ably, that Babet was at laſt obliged to yield.</p>
               <p>The old ſervant procured his young maſter the dreſs of a peaſant. They cut off his hair, changed his fair complexion into a ſun-burnt olive, and equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in large wooden ſhoes, accompanied by the faithful old footman, who knew every bye road and footpath: the inconſiderate youth at midnight took leave of his weeping ſiſter. He firſt took the road to Montauban, where he expected the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of a ſteady friend to enable him to proceed on his journey.</p>
               <p>After his departure, the little ſociety he had left behind lived more than a month in great concord and tranquility. Frederick enjoyed many delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:035693_0211_10064D65DC2A6748"/>
hours, but it was only in ſeeing his beloved; for as often as William either ſeriouſly or with raillery reproached him with his timidity, and often as he himſelf formed the heroic reſolution this day to open his heart, and to entreat from Babet's lips the deciſion of his fate, yet he continued to return at night to town as undecided as he had come, and communicated only to the trees the ſecret which he ought to have confided to the ear of his miſtreſs.—We can indeed offer but one apology for this conduct. Babet carefully avoided being alone with him, and a declaration of love, even in preſence of the beſt friend, is, God knows why, a very unpleaſant taſk.</p>
               <p>Matters, however, could not long remain in this ſtate. It was improper that a young lady of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſhould receive daily viſits from two young officers. In the preſent ſituation of the country, indeed, nobody paid any attention to their conduct, and the new marriage code juſtified many things which formerly would have attracted cenſure. But Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet herſelf felt the doubtful nature of her ſituation, her tender ſenſibility revolted at it, and her help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs alone led her to ſuppreſs the dictates of her trembling delicacy. To this likewiſe was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the general report of a ſpeedy exchange of priſoners, an event which might daily take place. A ſudden departure then muſt render the favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iſſue of Frederick's declaration ſtill more doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for experience tells us, that it is eaſier to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a lady's conſent, when there is the proſpect of a long courtſhip, and when ſhe has time to think of her new ſituation. Precipitation might ruin all.</p>
               <p>This and much more did William daily urge to his baſhful friend; nor was Frederick inſenſible of the juſtice of his remonſtrances, but he wanted courage to obey his own conviction. One day, as they were walking ſlowly home in the duſk of the evening, William bethought himſelf of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:035693_0212_10064D693643D498"/>
to give new effect to his ſolicitations, by ſuggeſting ſomething, the mere poſſibility of which is ſufficient to drive a lover to deſpair. "What," ſaid he, "if by your procraſtination the chaſtity and innocence of your miſtreſs ſhould be expoſed to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? What, if a horde of frantic perſons, hurried on by ſome criminal ebullition—a circumſtance indeed which cannot be foreſeen, but which, in the preſent frenzy of the people, may always be apprehended— ſhould again burſt into Babet's houſe? The firſt time, the ghaſtly ſight of her father's corpſe allayed their fury, but what now will protect her from their brutal outrage?"</p>
               <p>Frederick ſtopped, ſtared wildly around and trembled.</p>
               <p>"Who," proceeded William, "who will anſwer that even now, while we are walking quietly here"—</p>
               <p>"For heaven's ſake, no more!" cried Frederick with trembling lips, "you have ſucceeded, here is my hand.—Sure as theſe planets revolve over our heads—ſure as a God is enthroned above theſe planets, to-morrow ſhall I tell her all!"</p>
               <p>William received the hand and promiſe of his friend. In order to facilitate this bold attempt, he reſolved to remain at home next day, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of indiſpoſition. Frederick hurried on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, immerſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>An officer of the national guard, who was by trade a butcher, told him roughly, that the number of priſoners of war in this little town was by far too great; that ſymptoms of diſorder had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and the municipality had therefore thought proper to transfer the half of their gueſts to the next department. Lieutenant Perlſtadt was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the latter, and therefore he would be ſo good as to follow him immediately.</p>
               <p>Frederick was confounded. William collected himſelf, and expreſſed a hope that at leaſt they would not ſeparate him from his friend, but ſend them together to the ſame place.</p>
               <p>"To ſeparate ſuch friendſhip," purſued the officer bluntly, "is the very object the municipali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have in view." He begged them to make haſte, as he had many other priſoners to call out of their beds. "On account of the temper of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple," added he, "who hate all foreigners, you may conſider yourſelves indebted to the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates for giving orders that you ſhould be ſent out of the town by night."</p>
               <p>William eaſily ſaw that all kind of oppoſition would here be fruitleſs, Frederick was too much ſtupefied by the order to be able to make any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for his departure. William packed up the few neceſſaries which belonged to his friend, and whiſpered in his ear: "Be eaſy! I will ſpeak to Babet to-morrow upon your affair."</p>
               <p>Frederick embraced William, and took leave in ſilence.—Silently he walked along the ſtreets, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by grenadiers. At the gate he found the troop of his companions already aſſembled; he joined them without ſaying a word, and a ſigh firſt relieved the oppreſſion of his breaſt, when, in the ſtillneſs of night, the detachment fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. XI. THE FEVER.</head>
               <p>THE lovely mourner did not hear with perfect indifference of the departure of her lover. Beſides that a young man who dotes upon a woman with his whole ſoul muſt ever have a claim to ſome conſideration, even with the moſt inflexible beauty, Babet really felt a cordial regard for Fred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erick; and who knows how far this feeling which ſhe indulged without diſtruſt might have carried her, had not William's preſence, unconſciouſly to both of them, extinguiſhed every ſofter emotion of his friend?</p>
               <p>The ſorrow ſhe felt at Frederick's departure was rather ſympathy with William's grief; nay, we muſt confeſs that this feeling was inſtantly blended with a ſenſation of ſecret joy, becauſe in future ſhe ſhould enjoy William's company without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint which the penetrating eye of a lover impoſed. Yet let it not be ſuppoſed that her mind diſtinctly avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this thought. No; it was only an obſcure feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which ſhe never properly explained to herſelf, and which, perhaps, ſhe did not exactly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
               <p>With the moſt childiſh unembarraſſment ſhe laid her hand in his during their walks, or ſhe clung to him when the cold harveſt wind ruſtled through the trees; or ſhe would allow him to carry her over a ditch; or eagerly ſnatched the glaſs from his hand when he was over-heated, and was about to ſwallow a haſty draught.—In a word, ſhe gave
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:035693_0215_10064D6F608F1D10"/>
him involuntarily ſo many proofs of her innocent attachment, and the ſparks of love diffuſed ſo many new charms over her enchanting form, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the infinite affection he bore Jeanette, and the pure friendſhip he entertained for Frederick, to enable him to avoid the dangerous influence of a paſſion, which it would have been criminal to indulge.</p>
               <p>Never, perhaps, had his conſtancy ſuſtained a ſeverer trial. Better acquainted than Babet with the wandering of the human heart, he ventured to examine the ſtate of his feelings; he could not but perceive that the beauty and innocence of this maid powerfully intereſted him, he trembled when he contemplated the precipice on which he ſtood, and reſolved, the better to avoid the danger, to haſten the diſcovery which he had promiſed to communicate of his friend's attachment.</p>
               <p>He was not deterred from the performance of his promiſe by obſerving that Babet avoided all converſation upon this ſubject; that ſhe endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to interrupt what ſhe could not altogether ſhun. He declared to her with warmth and importunity, that it was in her power to make his friend happy, and at the ſame time to confer the greateſt happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon himſelf. Babet had but one anſwer to all that William urged ſo eloquently in favor of the abſent lover.</p>
               <p>"But do I love him?" ſaid ſhe bluſhing, while ſhe peeped through the veil over her long ſilken eye-laſhes. "But do I love him?" repeated ſhe with glowing cheeks, as ſhe darted a glance at the more fortunate advocate, which told him what he durſt not ſuppoſe. In a word, the ſuitor was obliged to content himſelf with the equivocal anſwer: that ſhe would leave her reſolution to be formed by time, that ſhe would not ſtudiouſly reſiſt his
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:035693_0216_10064D73A2080170"/>
wiſhes, but would candidly acknowledge whenever ſhe began to feel any thing more for Frederick than eſteem."</p>
               <p>His abſence, while William was daily with her, was not very well calculated indeed to effect ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable an alteration. And why then did not William modeſtly decline his viſits, when he but too diſtinctly perceived that his intercourſe with Babet would be fatal to his friend?—Two ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal reaſons, backed by vanity, prevented this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſtep. "She is quite alone," thought ſhe, "ſhe has no protector but me. I cannot venture to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the young helpleſs orphan to chance. And beſides, the intereſt of my friend! Muſt I not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther redouble my viſits, to talk to her daily of his accompliſhments, and thus by degrees animate her heart to love?"</p>
               <p>Alas! all this might have perfectly ſucceeded, had he only appriſed her of the ſecret that he was married; that he was united to an amiable wife, and was now perhaps a father. But we muſt here confeſs a weakneſs in our hero—a weakneſs which he had in common with three-fourths of his ſex Although unqueſtionably he laid no claim to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet's love, yet he ſecretly felt himſelf ſo flattered by it, that ſuch a diſcovery daily became more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant. Often the deciſive word hovered upon his lips; but one of Babet's ingenious glances again overthrew his reſolution; and though he did not uſe the ſmalleſt effort to cheriſh the flame, it was high treaſon to friendſhip and to love not to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it. Far be it from us, therefore, to attempt to juſtify our hero's foible, who, in this inſtance, allowed himſelf to be governed by his vanity.</p>

                  <pb n="219" facs="unknown:035693_0217_10064D752B8305D8"/>One evening when he entered his apartment in profound meditation, he found a letter from Jeanette lying upon the table. He bluſhed, preſſed the well known characters to his lips, and haſtily broke the ſeal. She informed him of her happy delivery, deſcribed the beauty of the lovely boy, her mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal tranſports, her anxiety to ſee the beloved father. All was tenderneſs and love. Not a trace of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy was to be found in the whole letter; every line diſcovered the fondeſt confidence, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the moſt diſtant thought of the poſſibility of infidelity. Ha! this generoſity touched him to the quick. A tear ſtarted in his eye; he raiſed his eyes, and ſecretly ſwore to God and his conſcience to appear before Babet next day with this letter in his hand.</p>
               <p>And indeed this time he would have kept his word, but the caprice of fortune was not yet weary of embittering his cup of life. In th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> morning William awoke in a ſtrong fever, which had been occaſioned by a cold he had caught in coming home one wet harveſt evening. At firſt he paid no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to it. He attempted to riſe and put on his clothes, but ſcarcely had he left his bed, when the fever attacked him more violently. One ſhivering fit ſucceeded another, and again compelled him to return to bed.</p>
               <p>There was but one phyſician in the town, who combined with William's impatience to increa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When Babet had for ſomedays expected in vain a viſit from her friend, ſhe ſent a peaſant boy to the town to inquire after him.

times ſhe was on the point of flying to his bed ſide, and an hundred times her female modeſty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her. She now felt, and for the firſt time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to herſelf, how much ſhe was attached to William. She now ſaw that it was on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that life had acquired new charms. Two or three times a day ſhe ſent the boy to town to bring her tidings of his health. The impatience with which ſhe expected his return, the inquiſitive anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety with which ſhe ran to meet him, indubitably teſtified the warmth of her attachment.</p>
               <p>William's illneſs, though not dangerous, was very lingering. It left a languor and debility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, which prevented him from going abroad. In a few weeks he again walked through the room, but he could not mount the ſtair, and durſt not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to expoſe himſelf to the bleak autumn winds. He always ſent, however, the moſt flattering ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to his anxious friend, and was ſo accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the appearance of the little meſſenger, that at the hour when the latter uſed to arrive he ſtood at the window, and expected him with impatience.</p>
               <p>All at once the boy failed to come at the uſual hour. He came not in the morning; he did not appear in the evening. This ſurpriſed William the firſt day; the ſecond it gave him uneaſineſs; the third his anxiety was extremely painful; and on the fourth he could no longer endure the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſuſpence. He threw on his great-coat, ſupported himſelf on a crutch, and ſlowly bent his way along the well-known road.</p>
               <p>When he ſaw at a diſtance Babet's habitation, his heart beat; but he carried his taliſman, Jean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ette's letter, in his boſom, and it was the anxiety of friendſhip alone which cauſed his agitation. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation redoubled his ſtrength and his ſpeed. He entered the gate with inquiſitive looks; he went through the deſolate court; he aſcended the ſtair,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:035693_0219_10064D7863289088"/>
found all the doors open, and all the apartments empty. Not a trace was to be ſeen of Babet or her ſervant; not a ſound announced the preſence of a human being.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," thought he, "ſome new tumult has compelled her to take refuge in the cavern." He endeavoured to grope his way in the dark down to the dungeon, and to find the place where the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the cavern was guarded by looſe ſtones. He found it, and whiſpered ſoftly—then louder and louder: "Babet! It is I! it is your friend!"— In vain, all was ſilent.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," did hope again ſuggeſt, "ſolitude has renewed her enthuſiaſtic turn. Perhaps I ſhall find her in the grotto."—With much difficulty he ſucceeded in finding his way back through th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"My God," exclaimed he, "what can have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the helpleſs creature?"—With exhauſted ſtrength he pryed round the whole neighbourhood, viſited the hermitage, ſearched the ruins of the tower, through which he clambered, calling every where the name of Babet—but in vain.</p>
               <p>One time the murmur of the ſtream deceived his ear; again the buz of a graſhopper in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring thicket. Still he hoped to claſp Babet; but his hopes deceived him, and every moment his ſtrength decreaſed. At laſt he ſunk down exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the lime tree on the lawn, and fell into a kind of unconſcious ſtupor. "Is there then no compaſſionate mortal at hand, who can give me ſome intelligence of her?—Would I could but ſee the little meſſenger?"—In vain; his vows were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, and the approaching night obliged him at
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:035693_0220_10064D7B414D4850"/>
laſt to think of returning home without being able to form one probable conjecture reſpecting Babet, to cheer him on his ſolitary way.</p>
               <p>Diſtracted by gloomy preſages, tortured by the thought of the deſpair into which his friend would be plunged by the intelligence, he proceeded on to the town in ſorrowful plight, his head reclining on his breaſt, when he met a peaſant boy chanting merrily, "<hi>Allons, erfans de la patrie!</hi>" The ſound rouſed him from his reverie. He looked up—it was the little meſſenger. "Ha!" cried he haſtily, "what has become of the lady, who for ſome weeks paſt ſent you daily to inquire for me?"</p>
               <p>"The lady?" ſaid the boy careleſsly, "I don't know. Three days ago ſhe engaged me to come to her, as uſual, the following day. When I went, however, ſhe was gone; I found nobody at all in the houſe."</p>
               <p>The boy could tell him nothing more. Tired of importunate queſtions, he took off his hat, again began to ſing, and went his way.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. THE CONFLAGRATION.</head>
               <p>BABET's ſudden elopement made ſo violent an impreſſion upon William, that his illneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more ſerious than ever, and he would not perhaps have eſcaped a dangerous relapſe, if he had leiſure to dwell upon his ſituation, and had followed the advice of his phyſician, who ordered
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:035693_0221_10064D7DF3035768"/>
him to keep his bed; for nothing, perhaps, tends more to confirm ſickneſs than ſuch a regimen. He now forgot his own health, and made inceſſant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after Babet in all the neighbouring country; traverſed every road, and ſearched avery village, to diſcover ſome traces of her. Thus the freſh air and exerciſe ſuperſeded the phyſician, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely cured the patient without farther preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>His conſcience now became uneaſy, and ſmarted ſeverely at the leaſt touch. To the blame which he juſtly had incurred, his ingenuous ſenſibility add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a new charge, which preyed upon him no leſs acutely. When after long inquiry and reflection William could diſcover no other reaſon for Babet's myſterious flight, vanity at laſt whiſpered him, that ſhe had fled from him to ſeek that cure from the ſoothing hand of time, which his coldneſs had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed her that ſhe could not expect from love.</p>
               <p>Alas! had he but told her ſooner that he was married, this would never have happened. If a traveller ignorant of his way comes to a thick gloomy wood, and finds an high road, he proceeds with caution; even a foot-path may induce him to go on; but if there is neither beaten track nor path-way, he returns. So is it with the labyrinth of Love, in which Cupid's bye roads abound, but through which, too, the great high road of Hymen leads. If the latter is ſhut, ſome Werter ſeeks a forbidden path; a virtuous maid turns quick and flies, however ſweetly Love's groves and nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales may entice.—Babet would have overcome her paſſion, ſhe now had been the bride of his friend, had not childiſh vanity—Alas! how he bluſhed for his weakneſs!—and be aſſured, the worſt kind of ſhame is that which ſurpriſes us when there is none to witneſs its effects.</p>
               <p>Where now was he to inquire for Babet?—
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:035693_0222_10064D7F826B6A50"/>
Where obtain intelligence of her?—It was danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to inquire after her with too much anxiety. The ſteps of the priſoners were watched with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy; their converſation and their conduct were marked. Babet's family was obnoxious; the warm intereſt he expreſſed for her might excite ſuſpicion of a ſecret connection, and at this time a ſecret connection was always conſidered a conſpiracy.</p>
               <p>He durſt venture, therefore, only to put indirect queſtions, or endeavor by ſome artifice to diſcover what he ſought; but the unſatisfactory anſwers which he thus obtained, afforded him no light in his darkneſs. He at laſt was ſilent, and expected from accident a clue to the myſtery.</p>
               <p>In order, if poſſible, to put himſelf in the way of ſuch a diſcovery, he wandered about from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till night through all the villages in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and failed not from time to time to viſit Babet's habitation, which he ſtill found deſolate and forlorn.</p>
               <p>One evening he wandered weary with his ſearch through a village, returning cheerleſs home with ſtill renewed diſappointment. Scarcely had he got through the village, when ſuddenly he heard a cry of Fire! He looked back, and ſaw a cottage in flames, which ſpread ſo rapidly, that before William could reach the ſpot, the neighbouring houſes were in a blaze. The inhabitants flocked together from all quarters; every thing that could be reſcued from the flames was ſaved, and William vigorouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed his aſſiſtance to carry off whatever he could reach. Sometimes he bore a cheſt upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which anxiety alone enabled him to carry; now he tottered under heavy bundles of linen; and again, to recover himſelf, ſtood at the well to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply water. The flames continued to rage, the fire gained ground, thoſe who endeavoured to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it ſhouted, the unfortunate proprietors la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented their fate, and the fire bell rang.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="unknown:035693_0223_10064D8136293818"/>A piercing cry ſuddenly burſt through the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful noiſe, and ſtruck William's ear. He made his way to the place from which the voice of woe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and ſaw a young woman rolling herſelf on the ground in the agonies of deſpair. She had been in the fields at work when the fire broke out; ſhe ran breathleſs to the ſpot, and found her cottage in flames. She had left a ſucking infant in the cradle, and a boy of eight years old to watch his little ſiſter. Neither of them was any where to be found; the flames prevented all acceſs to the cottage, and the roof every moment threatened to fall in.</p>
               <p>The woman lay on the ground, tearing her hair, and uttering ſuch bitter cries as cut the hearts of the by-ſtanders. "My children! my children!— My Antony! my little Babet!"—William could not ſuſtain this cruel ſpectacle. Without conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration—for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lleſt reflection would, on the preſent occaſion, have deterred him from the raſh deed—he plunged into the flames.</p>
               <p>The ſpectators ſhuddered—the mother raiſed herſelf on her knees, and ſtretched her hands to heaven in the attitude of prayer. She could not ſpeak—ſhe only cried, and God heard her cries!— With the ſcreaming boy in one hand, and the ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing babe in the other, their deliverer returned in half a minute, and, almoſt ſuffocated with duſt and ſmoke, dropped ſenſeleſs at the feet of the weeping mother.</p>
               <p>Her joy expreſſed itſelf in the wildeſt tranſports. She preſſed the children warmly to her breaſt— laughed, wept, and prayed—crept to William, kiſſed his feet, bathed him in tears, bleſſed him!— Then ſhe raiſed the little ſuckling to Heaven, and ordered the boy to fold his hands, and pray for his benefactor. The old men ſtood round—tears hung on their grey eye-laſhes; they pulled off their caps
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:035693_0224_10064D830A251390"/>
when William again opened his eyes, and gazed at him with reſpect as a ſuperior being.</p>
               <p>The flames were at laſt extinguiſhed; no lives were loſt; William was the only perſon who had ſuſtained much injury, and lay unable to crawl home. "Generous ſtranger," ſaid the woman, "willingly would I carry you to my cottage, but I have none to offer you!"—"Come to mine, come to mine," cried an hundred voices. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the honor of entertaining the ſtranger, who had ſo magnanimouſly riſked his life. An old man at laſt obtained the preference, becauſe his houſe was neareſt. William was removed to it with the utmoſt tenderneſs, and every thing was provided that could contribute to remove the pain, or conduce to his refreſhment.</p>
               <p>The grateful woman watched all the firſt night beſide him. She ſat with the babe at her breaſt by his bed-ſide, and offered ſecret prayers to Heaven for his recovery. They had applied to his wound a ſalve compoſed of olive oil and ſweet cream, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome white lead, a remedy which ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſuaged the pain, that about midnight he fell aſleep, and next morning when the day was well advanced he awoke, greatly ſtrengthened and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To what delightful ſenſations does he awake, whoſe firſt reflections are on the good action he performed the day before! Delightful ſenſations! —The happy mother ſat before him, and ſmiled with ineffable benignity. She held out to him the little Babet, as if ſhe would have ſaid: "See there that lovely innocent; to thee ſhe owes her life!" The dear name of Babet awakened in his mind a train of agreeable ideas, which perhaps yeſterday, when the mother expreſſed her agoniſing grief, had unconſciouſly aſſiſted to compel him to the raſh attempt. He now learned that the huſband and

               <p>William was ſo unweariedly tended with the moſt anxious care, that in a few days he was in a ſituation to quit the houſe of his benevolent hoſt. He was followed with bleſſings from every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The young woman accompanied him out of the village; and when he was about to leave her, ſhe attempted to kiſs his hand. She entreated him with tears not to forget her, but as often as his walks were in this direction to call at her houſe, and taſte the joys of the noble action he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>He promiſed to viſit her again, ſhook her hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the hand, and, accompanied by the delightful feeling of having been the benefactor of an honeſt family, which he conſidered r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WHILE all this was paſſing upon the agitated theatre of French liberty, Nature had ſet free a little captive, who had long been expected with anxiety. Jeanette was delivered of a boy— lovely as a May-day would I ſay, were all May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:035693_0226_10064D88932590C8"/>
lovely. To uſe a compariſon more preciſe, the little William was lovely as every mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders her firſt-born ſon. Jeanette, as is uſual with mothers, thought him very ſenſible at the end of fourteen days. She alone ſaw him laugh, ſhe alone ſaw in his ſcarce viſible noſe the counter part of the hawk noſe of her huſband. She remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that he already knew her, that he ſtretched out his hands to her—In a word, the boy was juſt ſuch a prodigy as the whole world is peopled with, if we were to believe what mothers tell us.</p>
               <p>Poor Jeanette's joy at the birth of her boy was greatly embittered by the intelligence of William's captivity. It was ſome conſolation to her, indeed, that his life was no longer expoſed to the ſwords and bullets of the enemy, and that ſhe might now hear or read of battles without trembling. But yet was not her beloved expoſed to a thouſand dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which perhaps it might be more difficult to parry than the grenadier's bayonet in the open field? Did he not live in a country were vague ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion paſſed for convicted guilt, and where the people at once pronounced and executed the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence?—But, ſhould his prudence and diſcretion elude the ever weakful jealouſy of his foes, might he not be ſick?—A new climate, anxiety, <hi>ennui,</hi> every thing which can affect the health, may lay him on a ſick bed, and who then is to care for him? —Who watch and tend him?—Who give him his medicines at the proper moment?—Paid hirelings! who with pleaſure would ſee him die, in order to rob the deceaſed ſtranger!—Has he not a wife whom love and duty call to his aid?—The jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is dangerous, but do love and duty ſhrink from any difficulties?—The journey is attended with many obſtacles and hardſhips, but is love acquainted with trifles like theſe?—Did William weigh all theſe conſiderations when he came from the camp
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:035693_0227_10064D8A2365C480"/>
to Munſter?—But the mother muſt leave her new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born child—Alas! that indeed is the hardeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all!—The little ſweet creature is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely dear to her! almoſt as dear as his father!— Her heart is diſtracted, but at length decides for him—him who by his unbounded love has acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a right to every ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>Jeanette made every arrangement which mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal anxiety could ſuggeſt for the moſt careful treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her child. She committed him to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendance of a clergyman's widow, who was her friend and neighbor. She left him in the hands of a nurſe, an honeſt country woman who loved the boy as her own child. The moment of ſeparation was dreadful, but ſhe tore herſelf away, and obeyed the dictates of the moſt ſacred duty. Accompanied only by the faithful Peter, ſhe ſet out on her journey, and arrived ſafe at Paris, at this period the theatre of Robeſpierre's enormities.</p>
               <p>She had taken the precaution to feign herſelf poor, and Peter appeared a perfect <hi>ſans culotte.</hi> She accordingly enjoyed the moſt enviable advantage which could be poſſeſſed at this moment, that of remaining unnoticed. Hitherto a guardian angel ſeemed to have guided her ſteps, but no difficulties increaſed upon her which it was difficult for an helpleſs woman to ſurmount. She remained ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral weeks in Paris before ſhe could learn to whom ſhe ought to apply for a paſſport, to carry her ſafe through the interior of France. She was ſent from one office to another, and no where was ſhe treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the reſpect due to her ſex. Here a taylor gave himſelf airs, there ſhe was expoſed to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar jeſts of a peruke-maker, dreſſed out with the tri-coloured cockade; here ſhe was hooted by a ſecretary, and there impoſed upon by a clerk. Thoſe who treated her beſt, adviſed her not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite ſuſpicion by too much importunity, and bade her be patient till to-morrow.</p>

Think of the miſery of a woman who longed, with the moſt glowing impatience, to be again united to her huſband; who every morning left her lodgings with renewed hopes that now ſhe ſhould attain the object and reward of her fond perſeverence, when ſhe returned home again in the evening weary and forlorn. Thus did ſeveral weeks elapſe, and the ſickneſs of hope diſappointed, began at length to give place to deſpair.</p>
               <p>One morning, when ſhe had wandered from ſtreet to ſtreet, and from office to office, and had every where in vain ſought humanity under the red cap, exhauſted with fatigue, ſhe loſt herſelf in the garden of the <hi>Thuilleries,</hi> ſunk down upon a bench, and, without regarding the company paſſing by, bitterly wept her fate. Many ſtopped and gazed at her a moment. Many, accuſtomed to the daily ſpectacle of miſery, paſſed careleſſly along. Nobody aſked, "Poor woman, what is the matter with you?"</p>
               <p>A beautiful woman, elegantly dreſſed in the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian ſtyle, now came down one of the walks. Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette did not obſerve her. The lady obſerved Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette with ſympathy, did not ſtop indeed, but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently looked back. After paſſing on a little ſhe returned, repaſſed the mourner, and whiſpered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Do not weep, my child! To ſhed tears is a crime here!"</p>
               <p>Jeanette looked up.—Scarce had ſhe time to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the benignant profile of the lovely ſtranger;
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:035693_0229_10064D8FE2E3DE98"/>
but the features were ſo blended with humanity and kindneſs, that they inſtantly inſpired the poor outcaſt with confidence. She ſtarted up, followed the lady, and eagerly exclaimed: "Ah! madam, pity a poor helpleſs ſtranger!"</p>
               <p>The angelic creature turned timorouſly round, and ſaid eagerly: "Not here! not here!—Come in the evening to the <hi>Rue St. Hanoré,</hi> and inquire at number 27, for <hi>Thereſa Cabarrus.</hi>

               <p>She diſappeared, but her words remained deep in Jeanette's memory. With impatience ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the evening; hope lent her wings; with ſerene confidence ſhe appeared before the amiable Thereſa.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, Madam," ſaid the gentle creature, "forgive me for ſeeming this morning to treat you with harſhneſs; but you know not how dangerous it is in this place to ſhow compaſſion for the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate. Here we are alone. Impart to me your diſtreſs. Your figure, and the expreſſion of grief on your countenance, have inſpired me with the wiſh to be of ſervice to you.

               <p>Alas! ſuch accents! ſuch kind attentive good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were now ſtrange to Jeanette's ear and heart. She burſt into tears, but they were tears of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly pleaſure. The artleſs narrative of her ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tale affected Thereſa. She detained the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wife, to whom ſhe felt herſelf attracted, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſet down to write a note. She then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained her gueſt with the moſt unconſtrained cheerfulneſs, and carefully avoided touching upon any chord which did not found in uniſon with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent gaiety.

               <p>THE happy pilgrim breathed ſilent bleſſings over her guardian angel when ſhe ſaw the barrier of Paris ſhut behind her. Engroſſed with delightful contemplations ſhe lolled in the corner of her chaiſe. The moſt enchanting landſcapes paſſed unnoticed. She never ſtopped at any ſtage. Twenty times a day indeed was Jeanette obliged to ſhow her paſſport; but it was immediately returned to her with ſulky looks, becauſe the moſt dexterous inquiſitor could find no error in it.</p>
               <p>The anxious wife, haſtening to her beloved huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, allowed herſelf neither repoſe nor refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the third day had dawned, when a reſtleſs ſlumber overpowered her for a few moments.

               <p>As ſhe entered the gate ſhe heard a noiſe in the neighboring ſtreets, to which at firſt ſhe paid no attention. When ſhe came near the market-place, however, ſhe ſaw an immenſe crowd of people, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>locked together from all quarters. She was now
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:035693_0231_10064D938EBA10B8"/>
alarmed; for all ſhe had read and heard of the wild ebullitions of popular fury ſuddenly recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to her mind.</p>
               <p>Alas! in a luckleſs hour ſhe had entered within the walls of the town. It would be ſuperſluous to relate how the tumult aroſe. The people reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſand in the deſart, which at firſt whirled round by the gentle breeze in little volumes, is by degrees agitated deeper and deeper, till it ſwells into a ſweeping torrent which overwhelms every thing it meets, tears the trees up by the roots, and buries men and houſes in deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Some Jacobin had been preaching up the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſyſtem of an equal diviſion of property, and collected the journeymen, and porters, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, by the force of their arms to carry it into effect. The enfuriated people aſſembled in crowds to murder a ſource of rich people, and ſhare their inheritance under the banner of liberty.</p>
               <p>When Jeanette entered the town, the people were entertaining themſelves with that ſpectacle with which they had ſo often been glutted ſince the 9th Thermidor, that of bloody heads carried in proceſſion upon pikes. The carriage was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly caught in the crowd, and could move neither backward nor forward. Jeanette trembled and grew pale when ſhe perceived the frantic rabble, who, inſtead of the former images of ſaints and conſecrated banners, carried in triumph the bloody enſigns of human heads which they had cut off.</p>
               <p>Peter ſat on the coach-box, and gazed with open mouth and looks of horror. The lofty box made the poor fellow, againſt his will, a prominent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. When the ſanguinary rout came up, one of the ſtandard-bearers thought proper to practiſe the cruel jeſt of clapping the goary head to Peter's noſe, and inſiſted on his kiſſing it. As Peter did not underſtand a word of French, and therefore

did not know what they required him to do, the natural diſguſt which ſuch a ſpectacle inſpired, taught him to turn away the bloody head with both his hands. But the greater reluctance he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and the more he proteſted, in German, againſt this violence, the more obſtinate the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple became, and with frantic ſhouts inſiſted that he ſhould obey.</p>
               <p>Jeanette dropped down ſenſeleſs. Her faithful ſervant was torn from the box, kicked and abuſed in the moſt cruel manner. Peter muſt have fallen a ſacrifice to their fury, if the attention of the miſcreants had not been withdrawn from the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to his miſtreſs in the carriage. "This way, brothers!" cried one of them in a brutal tone, "here is an Auſtrian lady, who cannot ſtand the ſight of royaliſt blood." They broke open the carriage, pulled out the unconſcious victim, ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her pockets, plundered her of her money, took her paſſport, tore it to pieces, and ſcattered it in the air.</p>
               <p>Already a thouſand voices thundered her doom, and a ſavage monſter, with an ax in his hand, offered to undertake the office of her executioner. Moſt ſeaſonably, at this moment, a young man, of a genteel appearance, followed by a detachment of the national guard, made his way through the crowd, and, in the name of the law, enjoined tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. This command, enforced by threatening bayonets, procured reſpect, and reſcued the victim. The people diſperſed with murmurs.</p>
               <p>When Jeanette opened her eyes, ſhe found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſurrounded by ſoldiers, in the arms of a young man, who gazed at her with complacency. He announced himſelf as the mayor of the town, and ſo politely congratulated himſelf on his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in being her deliverer, that Jeanette imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately recogniſed him to be an elegant, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:035693_0233_10064D99697EC5B0"/>
man.—"Take courage, madam," ſaid he with reſpectful intereſt, "the danger is over. Have the goodneſs to allow me to conduct you to my houſe. My wife and I will do every thing in our power to give you a better opinion of our town."</p>
               <p>The mention of a wife redoubled Jeanette's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; ſhe accepted his offer with thanks; he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted her into the carriage, which the guard ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded, and he himſelf followed on foot. Poor Peter was ſo beaten and bruiſed, that he was not able to mount the coach-box, but was obliged to be led by two grenadiers. He had, at laſt, found out what they wiſhed him to do, and in whimper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice curſed the horrible propoſal. "Were there never," ſaid he to his conductors, "another woman for me in the world but here, and were ſhe the faireſt that ever was ſeen, I ſhould not come for her to your country, and be forced to kiſs bloody heads." The ſoldiers looked at him and laughed, for they did not underſtand what he ſaid—Every body knows, but the circumſtance has never been explained, even by Kant, that an ignorant man always laughs when he does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a thing.—The mayor's lady welcomed the ſtranger with polite hoſpitality. She was uſhered into an elegant apartment, which was furniſhed with every conveniency; the table was covered with all kinds of refreſhments. They preſſed her earneſtly to partake of them; but when ſhe aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them that ſhe wanted nothing but repoſe, they politely withdrew and left her alone.</p>
               <p>Her firſt care was to thank God on her knees for her deliverance. She threw herſelf on the bed, which was adorned with ſilken curtains, that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an agreeable ſhade. She fell aſleep, and did not awake till the evening, greatly refreſhed. Scarcely had a little noiſe ſhe made announced
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:035693_0234_10064D9B4C3E23D8"/>
that ſhe was awake, when the miſtreſs of the houſe drew aſide the curtains, kindly inquired how ſhe did, and invited her to ſupper in the family circle.</p>
               <p>Jeanette appeared in full ſplendour of youthful beauty. The roſes which terror had chaſed from her cheeks, bloomed afreſh. Refreſhing ſleep, and a delightful dream of having met with her huſband, had kindled a delicate fire in her eye. Every body complimented her, all preſſed round her, every one endeavored to ſay ſomething civil, and Beaublanc himſelf (for that was the mayor's name) diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his aſſiduity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with her in the moſt agreeable manner, and ſtrove to anticipate her moſt trivial wiſhes.</p>
               <p>Jeanette would have forgot herſelf in this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſociety, if her anxiety to ſee William had not been much more powerful than the charms of any kind of amuſement. Immediately after ſupper ſhe entreated her deliverer to ſend for poſt horſes, as ſhe wiſhed to purſue her journey, even by night. Her requeſt ſeemed to throw him into ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. He repreſented to her the neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; he called a phyſician, who happened to be in company, to give weight to his remonſtrance; and when nothing could ſhake the impatience of the anxious wife to be gone, he exaggerated the dangers to which ſhe expoſed herſelf, as the people ſtill ſwarmed diſorderly round the houſe; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her next day to take precautions for her ſafety. All was in vain. Jeanette perſevered in her reſolution to ſet off immediately.</p>
               <p>Beaublanc at laſt was obliged to acquieſce, and begged to ſee her paſſport, which his duty required him to examine. Jeanette haſtily put her hand in her pocket—but how great was her terror when ſhe found neither paſſport nor money, and was obliged to bring out her hand empty!—"Ah! God!" exclaimed ſhe, turning pale as aſhes—
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:035693_0235_10064D9CDC2E0128"/>
"Ah! God!"—She could ſay no more—her knees ſhook, and ſhe was forced to ſit down.</p>
               <p>The mayor ſeemed to receive the news of this unfortunate accident with feigned concern, and a ſecret joy was painted in his countenance. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted her with the utmoſt kindneſs, and promiſed to write immediately to Paris, giving a faithful ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the accident, and immediately procure her a new paſſport. He aſſured her likewiſe that ſhe need not be under any uneaſineſs reſpecting money, for he ſhould conſider himſelf happy in being permitted to lend her. He entreated her, during the ſhort delay, to conſider his houſe as her own, and in the mean time to announce to her huſband her ſpeedy arrival.</p>
               <p>She liſtened to all he ſaid in ſilent ſtupor, and could only expreſs her thanks in broken ſentences.</p>
               <p>The propoſals, indeed, were the moſt agreeable which, in her ſituation, could be made; and ſince fortune had reſolved to make her the object of its caprice, it was happy that ſhe had found a houſe were ſhe could remain with comfort and with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectability, and await a more favorable turn of her affairs. She yielded, therefore, to the neceſſity of circumſtances, and with tears entreated the mayor to haſten his proffered aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>He repeated the conſolatory aſſurance, promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this very evening to diſpatch a courier to Paris, and in the mean time enjoined his domeſtics to do every thing to render the agreeable ſtranger as happy as her ſituation would admit. "My exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple," added he, "will teach you how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct yourſelves."</p>
               <p>Alas! this laſt was the only point in which he kept his word. Beaublanc belonged to that claſs of good weak men who are irreſiſtibly attracted by new charms. He was married to an amiable woman, with whom before his marriage he had
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:035693_0236_10064D9FA261BA30"/>
carried on a long and romantic courtſhip, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered a thouſand obſtacles before he attained the object of his wiſhes. He loved her ſtill, his heart was hers, but his licentiouſneſs ſhe was not able to reſtrain. Many a tear ſhe wept in ſecret; ſometimes a tender reproach eſcaped her, which the young man felt indeed, but it produced no other effect but to render him more guarded in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, and more ſecret in his infidelities. When he was detected, he threw himſelf at her feet, claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her knees, wept, intreated, called himſelf a wretched licentious profligate, and could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, when he poſſeſſed ſo amiable a wife, how he could have any taſte for other charms. In a word, he never ceaſed till ſhe tenderly forgave him.</p>
               <p>After theſe occaſions ſucceeded an interval of domeſtic happineſs for two or three months, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which his wife was ſatisfied with his conduct, and he was ſatisfied with himſelf; for after ſuch occurrences he ſeriouſly endeavoured to correct his bad habits, but all his reſolution vaniſhed if a new beauty fell in his way. In a word, he reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a needle, which turns ſteadily to its pole ſo long as it is not attracted by ſome new and more powerful magnet.</p>
               <p>Jeanette's appearance happened juſt in one of theſe intervals of domeſtic tranquility, during which Beaublanc had been the beſt huſband in the world, and when he had ſolemnly promiſed after his laſt error never to wander again. Who could have ſuſpected that he ſhould thus accidentally meet with a woman like Jeanette? who ſeemed as if formed by an adverſe fate on purpoſe to triumph over his firmeſt reſolutions. When he reſcued her from the fury of the populace; when ſhe lay ſenſeleſs in his arms, and her half-covered boſom beat againſt his; when her lily cheeks touched his, and his mouth received the firſt breath which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:035693_0237_10064DA291B16B40"/>
her lips—ah! his heart was gone!—His attention, his hoſpitality, his humane exertions ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ang from a ſource which his experienced wife eaſily diſcovered. Theſe ſuſpicions which had been but too often juſtified, awaked. She trembled, and concealed her apprehenſion, too patient to cry Fire on perceiving the firſt ſparks, and too gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to revenge the inconſtancy of her huſband on an innocent ſtranger.</p>
               <p>During the firſt day ſhe conſoled herſelf in the expectation of the ſpeedy departure of her gueſt; but when the diſagreeable accident of the loſs of the paſſport was mentioned, when ſhe diſcovered the ſecret joy of her huſband, and ſaw herſelf compelled to entertain ſo dangerous a rival in the houſe for ſeveral weeks, her only hope was in the character of the ſtranger, whoſe dignified manners and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt reſerve inſpired her with confidence that the licentious views of her huſband would here be diſappointed.</p>
               <p>She was not miſtaken. It was ſome time before Jeanette perceived the unwelcome triumph of her charms; and when ſhe could no longer doubt the fact, it cauſed her the moſt cruel vexation. Her ſituation became more painful than ever. What could ſhe now do?—Was ſhe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eaſe with importunities the man who had ſaved her life, and given her a ſecure aſylum in his houſe?—But he had not yet made any expreſs declaration of his paſſion. His looks only ſpoke what he felt; a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand little attentions betrayed the ſtate of his heart. It was poſſible that he ſtruggled with himſelf, that he endeavored to extinguiſh his riſing attachment, and in this caſe he deſerved pity rather than reproach. How happy would ſhe have been to have aided his ſtruggling virtue by a ſudden ſlight! but whither could ſhe fly, without money, and without a paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="unknown:035693_0238_10064DA41B9D5218"/>Should ſhe confide the ſecret to her kind hoſteſs? Ought ſhe to awaken the jealouſy of an unſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wife; and, as a reward for her ſiſterly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, plant a dagger in her heart? No! She ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther choſe to be ſilent, to conceal her anguiſh, to throw a veil over her grief, and reſolved as much as poſſible to avoid the company of Beaublanc, and to wait the arrival of her paſſport in ſolitude, which ſhe took every opportunity to indulge. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived many pretexts for ſpending the forenoon in her own apartment. In the afternoon ſhe was going to write to William, or an head-ache fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed her with an apology, or ſhe walked with her hoſteſs in the garden. Often too unwelcome gueſts detained the mayor, ſo that he found but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle opportunity to enjoy the company of his new love.</p>
               <p>The conduct which Jeanette obſerved was indeed perfectly well calculated to keep Beaublanc at a diſtance; but it could have little effect in repreſſing his paſſion, ſince perpetual obſtacles only inflamed him the more, and drove him to deſpair. The more his wife felt herſelf indebted to the delicate and diſcreet conduct of the generous ſtranger, the more expedients did Beaublanc contrive to prolong Jeanette's ſtay, in the hope that a favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity would at laſt lead to the accompliſhment of his wiſhes.</p>
               <p>For the attainment of his object he was not very ſcrupulous about the means he employed. A month had elapſed, the new paſſport had really arrived, but Beaublanc concealed it. During this period Jeanette had written eight letters to her huſband; but Beaublanc had ſuppreſſed them, and his jealouſy delighted to obſerve the anguiſh of the wife, who conſidered William's ſilence as an ill preſage. He himſelf undertook to make inquiries in the place where William reſided, but only to communicate
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:035693_0239_10064DA5E5B60998"/>
to her equivocal intelligence. Sometimes he gave the anxious wife reaſon to ſuſpect the death of her huſband; ſometimes he told her of a priſoner of war anſwering his deſcription who had married a rich heireſs.</p>
               <p>With regard to the paſſport, it was eaſier to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead her unſuſpecting confidence; for what could be more natural than in the revolutionary confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which now prevailed in Paris that ſuch a tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e ſhould be forgotten?—A letter to Thereſa remained unanſwered. Thereſa and William were ſilent preciſely for the ſame reaſon.</p>
               <p>The poor forlorn Jeanette, ſeparated from all ſhe loved and honored, trembling for the life of her huſband, of her child, wept bitter tears in ſecret. As Beaublanc had now completely laid aſide the maſk, as he became more preſſing, and did not heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itate eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>She endeavored by raillery and remonſtrance, by ſeverity and by mildneſs, to recall him to the path of reaſon and of duty, but in vain. He remained unmoved by her tears, deaf to her repreſentations, and callous to the ſilent grief of his wife. He was at no pains to conceal the hope that William might be dead. He laboured to render her familiar with this frightful idea. He inſinuated how eaſy it would be for him, according to the preſent marriage code of France, to procure a ſeparation from his wife. He dropped hints of his wealth, his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the ſplendid life which he could enable a wife whom he loved to enjoy. In a word, he left no arts unemployed which could ſhake Jeanette's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal fidelity. Her paſſions he likewiſe endeavored to engage by the diſplay of an elegant figure which was animated and adorned by the glow of love; and he exerted himſelf to give it new charms by the moſt taſteful diſplay of dreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="unknown:035693_0240_10064DAA0D0E6458"/>It is unneceſſary to aſſure the reader that all his arts were baſſled, and fell harmleſs from Jeanette's heart, like a blunt arrow from a mail of ſteel. Not a foul drop ever mingled in the pure fountain of her feelings. Never once did her vanity liſten with compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this did not at all contribute to render her ſituation leſs wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. She was dependent upon a man who laboured to obtain his criminal object at every riſk; who, as appeared, did not even ſhrink from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a crime if it promiſed to conduct him to his wiſhes; for he had now gone ſo far as to throw out menaces, and to drop hints at which her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue trembled. And if indeed his uncontrouled paſſion ſhould prompt him to acts of violence—alas! what guardian divinity would then protect the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Jeanette!</p>

               <p>After Babet diſappeared, and his friend was torn from him, William's moſt delightful dreams now hung undivided upon his native land, on his beloved Jeanette, the object of his moſt ardent wiſhes. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed with theſe contemplations, he ſtrolled in harveſt through the fading flowers; or, when the buſtle of induſtry offered him unwelcome amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he plunged into the ſhady receſſes of a wood, or ſtole among the bulruſhes which ſkirted a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring brook.

a king is adorned by the beams of morn, while before 'tis noon the throne is involved in clouds and tempeſts; how often darkneſs and miſts co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the poor man's cradle, while the caprice of fortune prepares for the obſcure child a ſerene and joyful evening. His own example recurred to his mind, and with the laſt traces of the parting clouds his gratitude mounted up to heaven.</p>
               <p>The temper of his ſoul was now ſo ſublimated that it ſought for kindred objects, and he therefore reſolved this day to aſcend to the top of a hill, which he had long marked out as the boundary of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions. The way to it was through the village, the inhabitants of which, ſince the conflagration, loved him with brotherly affection. He wiſhed to paſs on unobſerved; but the little boy he had ſaved came running after him, and pulling him by the coat, ſaid: "Mother is coming too; ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not run ſo faſt." William ſtopped, and waited till the young woman came up with the moſt cordial expreſſions of joy, and held out to him her ſmiling infant. She kindly complained that he had quite forgot her; the boy had daily aſked for him, and ſhe had been much grieved at his abſence. A thouſand times ſhe had thanked God for the deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erance of her children, but ſhe had lamented that ſhe had not an opportunity to expreſs her gratitude to the angel whom God had ſent. She then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him that ſhe now lived in the houſe of her father-in-law till her cottage was rebuilt, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to be ſo good as come and partake of a rural breakfaſt. She was ſo preſſing, ſhe ſo eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſhed in this way to ſhow her kindneſs, that it was impoſſible for him to refuſe.</p>
               <p>He was conducted to a neat, clean houſe, where he was cordially received by an old man with ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grey locks. Every body was employed in the houſe; they ran backwards and forwards, ſought
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:035693_0243_10064DAF5D231758"/>
the whiteſt cloth, the cleareſt glaſſes, the fineſt plates. They brought out honey, butter, milk, and fruits; and every eye ſparkled with joy when the welcome gueſt ſeemed to eat with appetite. They appeared delighted that their efforts had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in pleaſing their benefactor.</p>
               <p>The young woman told him that during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence her huſband and brother had been at home, and heard of his noble deed, and both of them intended to come to town to thank him, but the calls of ſervice prevented them. "Yeſterday," added the weeping wife, "they were ſent off in ſearch of ariſtocrats, and God knows when they will return."</p>
               <p>At the lateſt, however, ſhe hoped they would be home on Saturday, and William was obliged to promiſe ſolemnly to repeat his viſit next Sunday.</p>
               <p>After he had eat and drank a great deal from pure complaiſance, he told the good people his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to walk to the top of the hill, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan gradually to aſcend juſt at the back of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage. He inquired which road he ought to take. They told him it was ſeveral miles to the top; firſt, he muſt croſs a bridge, then he would come to a ſheep-cot, then he muſt quit the road, and aſcend by the left-hand way. The aſcent was ſteep and difficult. They adviſed him to provide himſelf with refreſhments, and inſiſted on filling his pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets with fruit. William, however, refuſed, as he wiſhed to be as light as poſſible; and ſaid, if neceſſary, that he ſhould find milk at the ſheep-cot to which he was directed. The young woman, however, repreſented the inhabitants to be rough unobliging people, and deſired him to obſerve a ſmall houſe, not far from the ſheep-cot. "There," ſaid ſhe, "lives our conſtitutional prieſt, a good, kind-hearted man; call there if you want refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

He receives every body with welcome."</p>
               <p>William thanked her, and went away with the reſolution to call no where unleſs he was compelled by ſome unforeſeen accident. He eaſily found the road which had been pointed out to him, lay on the top of the hill, and enjoyed the delightful proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect into the fertile valley below, through which the river rolled along, in a thouſand meanders. He traced out Babet's deſerted habitation, the ſight of which baniſhed the ſerenity of his ſoul. He reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to look at it no more, and his eyes ſtill recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to it. The landſcape loſt its charms, he ſunk into a melancholy mood, and did not obſerve that twilight began to approach.</p>
               <p>He ſtarted up. The ſhades of night already covered the valley. A grey ſtreak of the ſetting ſun ſtill glittered on the ſummits of the rocks. He haſtily deſcended the foot-path, and night thickened faſt around. Too much precipitation might lead him aſtray. He began, therefore, to walk more ſlowly, and to examine the path, ſince, if he loſt it, he muſt be compelled to paſs the cold harveſt night in the open air in this ſolitude, which after his late illneſs, might be attended with danger.</p>
               <p>He was extremely happy, therefore, after wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſeveral hours through unbeaten tracks, to reach a fold belonging to the ſheep-cot. Recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the advice of his friends, however, he did not call, but directed his ſteps to the abode of the prieſt, whoſe white-waſhed walls glittered through the ſhade at the diſtance of a few hundred paces. Here he reſolved to beg a night's lodging, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rain, and the darkneſs became every moment thicker.</p>
               <p>As no light appeared through the windows, he began to fear that there was nobody at home, and was about to ring the bell, when the ſcreams of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

proceed from a back houſe or cellar, and William diſtinctly heard the words "<hi>Help! help!</hi>"</p>
               <p>He now pulled the bell with violence ſeveral times. He endeavored to open the houſe-door, but it was locked. He attempted to get over the wall round the court, but it was too high. The ſcreams ſtill continued, and cut him to the heart. He ran anxiouſly as faſt as he could round the whole place, hovering like a hen over a pond where her foſter ducklings ſwim. He reached a garden fenced with a thick hedge. He was not deterred by the thorns, continued to make his way through, and haſtened to the place from which the cries proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>He came to a back-door, which appeared but ill ſecured; he ſtruck it with his foot, and it flew open. He entered, ſtumbled, and fell. An iron ſhovel lay in his way: he roſe, ſeized the ſhovel, for ſome obſcure feeling told him that here arms were neceſſary. The ſhrieks had changed into moan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of lamentations; he followed the ſound, which ſoon brought him to the door of a room. It was ſhut; he thund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>red at it with his fiſt. A man's voice cried, "<hi>Who is there?</hi>"</p>
               <p>"Open," cried William.—They refuſed.— "Open, or I will break open the door!"—They ſtill refuſed. William threw himſelf with all his force againſt the door, and drove it from its hinges.</p>
               <p>At this moment the light in the room was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, and William received a violent blow on the ſhoulder, which probably was aimed at his head. He eaſily could diſcern the figure that had ſtruck the blow. He lifted up his ſhovel, and ſtruck ſo violent a blow at the ſhadow, that the latter cried, "Jeſu Maria!" and dropped to the ground.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time another figure ſlipped paſt him out at the door. He now remained thunderſtruck in this extraordinary ſituation; here at his feet a

man whom probably he had mortally wounded, a few ſteps from him a low voice of lamentation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to moan; utter darkneſs prevailed, and the whole houſe was utterly unknown. He groped round the place from which the ſound proceeded, ſtruck againſt a bed, and found a perſon whom by the dreſs he ſuppoſed to be a lady.</p>
               <p>"Who is here?" ſaid he. Groans were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer. He was almoſt inclined to join in uniſon with theſe groans, for the pain in his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was very violent. Without light, however, he could neither aſſiſt himſelf nor others. But where was he to find it?—Where was the kitchen, in which, perhaps, the fire was ſtill alive in the embers? He went out, groped along the wall, creeped through the whole houſe, ſometimes found the doors open, ſometimes ſhut, but no where was he ſought. He now was unable to find the way back to the myſterious chamber, and had reſolved to wait on the ſtair till morning, when he heard keys turning, and a door ſling open with great noiſe. A number of voices ſounded through the paſſage, and a gleam of light was ſeen at a diſtance.</p>
               <p>Conſcious of his innocence, he went fearleſs to meet the party, and found a number of half-naked peaſants, who, armed with all kinds of weapons, preſſed in, led by an ugly old woman with a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn.—"There is the robber," cried the woman when ſhe ſaw William. He had thrown down the ſhovel; the peaſants ſeized him quite defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and tied his hands behind his back.</p>
               <p>In vain he proteſted his innocence, in vain he attempted to relate the accident which had brought him to the houſe; the old beldame bore him down. "He meant to rob my good maſter, your worthy paſtor!" cried ſhe with ſhrill voice. "Who knows but he may have already murdered him? His niece, the villain firſt gagged; by God's mercy I contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to eſcape in the dark."</p>

She ran on before with the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, the crowd followed with William bound in the middle. They entered the room—William looked round, and was confounded.—On the bed lay a beautiful young lady gagged with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief—It was <hi>Babet!</hi>—On the ground lay wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in his blood a thick-headed prieſt—It was <hi>Jeanette's raviſher!</hi>

We live in times when it would be matter of no great wonder to ſee the Emperor of China, like Dionyſius of old, turn ſchoolmaſter. Why then ſhould we wonder to find a prieſt in his vocation?

As long as the former is found not improbable, the latter muſt be allowed to paſs for ever natural.—The whole affair too hangs ſo ſimply together, that it is very eaſy to ſolve the myſtery.</p>

                  <pb n="250" facs="unknown:035693_0248_10064DBE0C408920"/>The prieſt, as the reader will remember, in the firſt volume of this hiſtory was withdrawn from the civil power, and ſhut up in a cloiſter. This, however, was done only <hi>pro forma,</hi> to remove him from the view of the good believers, who might have taken offence at his little miſchievous tricks. His more tolerant brethren took no offence at the matter, but chaſtiſed him as the Spartans uſed to chaſtiſe a boy who happened to ſteal clumſily. After a ſhort confinement, they gave him money for his expences, and ſent him about his buſineſs. He choſe France as the place of his retreat, where, according to the ſpirit of the prieſthood, he took a ſhare in every thing, accommodated himſelf to the ſpirit of the time, practiſed the eaſy art of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiating himſelf with the people, was one of the firſt who, without ſcruple, took the famous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional oath, recommended himſelf to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in power, and, in the moſt natural way ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, inſinuated himſelf into the confidence of an unſuſpecting congregation, who choſe him their paſtor, and ſettled upon him a conſiderable income and a comfortable houſe, from which a worthy old man, whoſe conſcience revolted from the oath, was driven naked and helpleſs.</p>

<pb n="251" facs="unknown:035693_0249_10064DBF98F75F68"/>
that he dropped the deſign of marrying her which he had firſt conceived, and employed her helliſh art in corrupting the innocence of the country girls, till Babet's charms captivated his foul paſſions.</p>
               <p>That very day when William was attacked by the fever, and Babet expected her friend under the lime-tree on the lawn, accident brought the prieſt this way. He ſaw the lovely maid, as ſhe lay care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſlly on the bench, her head reclining on her ſnow white hand, while her auburn locks waved round her boſom, and her elegant foot played in the ſand. This was more than ſufficient to inflame his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. He approached, with that ſoft, ſimpering air which he had ever at command, as a courtier his ſmile. "Thoſe mourning weeds," ſaid he, "tell me that you are in grief, and my office juſtifies me in intruding upon you with an offer of conſolation."</p>
               <p>He ſat down beſide her, and talked to her a jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon for which we Germans ought to have a word, ſince the thing may likewiſe be found among the prieſts of our country. Babet, educated in a cloiſter, was accuſtomed to conſider theſe wolves in ſheep's cloathing as a ſuperior claſs of beings. She recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him with reſpect and confidence. She rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced once more to ſee a prieſt, whoſe conſoling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſhe had been ſo long denied. She wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly gave him permiſſion to viſit her daily. She even begged him to come, and, on the very firſt interview, joyfully offered him one of her dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds to ſay maſſes for the ſouls of her father and brother.</p>
               <p>The prieſt ſoon found what an unſuſpicious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture chance had thrown in his way. The very next viſit he diſcovered all Babet's ſecrets of every kind; he learnt the flight of her brother, her attachment to William, the treaſure ſhe had concealed in the caſket; he diſcovered all, and bounded with joy, like Satan in Klopſtock's Meſſiah. Any attempt, indeed, to change Babet's childiſh confidence into
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:035693_0250_10064DC121EBC2F8"/>
love, was not very likely to ſucceed, as ſhe was much too innocent to underſtand what he meant. When he gazed at her with glowing paſſion, ſhe conſidered his ardour to be paternal kindneſs; and when he preſſed her hand, ſhe kiſſed his reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. To give her any opportunity of diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foul corruption of his heart was dangerous: her innocence might be alarmed, and ſhe might take offence.</p>
               <p>Under pretence of placing her in ſafety, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to take her home to his houſe, as his niece. He repreſented to her the danger to which ſhe was daily expoſed in this ſolitary habitation; the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of a young lady, quite deſerted, living thus without protection. He then diſplayed the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the undiſturbed tranquillity ſhe might enjoy at his houſe, the ſecurity with which ſhe could there, unknown and unperſecuted, indulge her grief, and perform the duties of devotion.</p>
               <p>His arguments made an impreſſion upon Babet, but they were not attended with all the effect which ſhe expected. The image of her friend was too deeply engraved upon her heart; ſhe muſt ſee him and conſult with him before ſhe finally adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a reſolution by which they would be ſeparated. She did not, therefore, abſolutely refuſe the pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal offer of the prieſt, as ſhe called it, but poſtpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her deciſion till William's recovery.</p>
               <p>Such a delay and ſuch conſultation were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the prieſt's plan. He dreaded the return of this dangerous priſoner, and ſaw the neceſſity of accompliſhing his purpoſe before the arrival of this friend oppoſed a new obſtacle to his ſucceſs. One evening, therefore, when Babet informed him with joy, that ſhe had received the moſt favourable accounts of the convaleſcence of her friend, and that ſhe expected to ſee him in a few days, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a diabolical artifice for the completion of his deſign.

               <p>Babet trembled as ſhe read this letter. Tears ſtarted in her eyes, ſiſterly affection glowed in her breaſt. Without the leaſt ſuſpicion ſhe inſtantly reſolved to truſt herſelf with the expected meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to put the caſket into her pocket, to give her unfortunate brother the half of its contents, and by her tender conſolation perhaps ſave him from ſelf-murder.</p>

ariſen in her guileleſs heart. With anxious impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience ſhe waited the day, and, with tender anxiety, the night. The prieſt viſited her as uſual. He hoped ſhe would impart to him what had happened, and the reſolution ſhe had taken; but ſhe was ſilent. It was not <hi>her own</hi> ſecret; the care of her brother's ſafety ſealed her lips.</p>
               <p>The cunning ſeducer, however, eaſily perceived that ſhe labored under the preſſure of ſecret anxiety, and in her agitation he gueſſed the ſucceſs of his villainy.

               <p>Her cries, mean while, had really aſſembled the ſhepherd, who were eaſily ſatisfied with the ſtory that their prieſt, whoſe virtue they never ſuſpected,

The prieſt deſired the honeſt peaſants to inform their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of this circumſtance, that they might not again be alarmed by her cries.

Sometimes he deſcended to every kind of flattery, and again he endeavored to alarm her with the baſeſt threats.

The prieſt breathed out his foul ſpirit, and the laſt influence which hell exerciſed over the dying reprobate was to dictate the falſe declaration that William was a robber, a murderer.—Thus did he deſcend to the other world; the hand of his murdered child ſeized him, and led him diſmayed to the tribunal of an offended Judge.</p>
               <p>But his villainous accuſation remained behind. Every thing teſtified againſt William; the words of the deceaſed, the cries of the procureſs, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken door, the gagged maid, and laſtly his own confuſion; for the ſight of his ſuffering benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs on the one hand, and of the deteſted betrayer of his wife on the other, had ſtruck him dumb with aſtoniſhment.

               <p>The ſhepherds, who were attached to the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical priJſt, loaded William with curſes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſacrificed his life to the firſt dictates of their reſentment.

               <p>He lay on his bed of ſtraw, with the invaluable conſciouſneſs of having never in the courſe of his life, been guilty of a diſhonourable action. He prayed—but not for himſelf—he prayed for his wife and child.—At midnight he fell into a placid ſlumber.</p>
               <p>The rattling of keys ſuddenly awaked him. Two ſoldiers of the national guard entered with a dark lanthorn. William ſtarted up, and thought the awful moment was come. In one of the ſoldiers he recogniſed the man to whom he had entruſted the laſt proof of his love for Jeanette. "I am glad," ſaid William, "that you have been choſen to attend me on this occaſion. Be witneſs of my

death, and announce to my wife that I have met it, if not with perfect tranquillity, at leaſt with firmneſs."</p>
               <p>"Be ſilent, and follow us," ſaid the ſoldiers, as he raiſed up his chains to allow him to walk more eaſily. William followed in ſilence. They led him through a gloomy paſſage, which he never before had trod. They reached an open court. The ſtars glimmered over their heads. William wondered to find that it was yet night. They came to a little door, which ſtood open. When William went out, he heard the trampling of horſes, and ſoon diſtinguiſhed a carriage and four. The ſoldiers aſſiſted him to mount, and took their ſeats beſide him.</p>
               <p>Away they drove, full ſpeed. William knew not what they meant to do with him. He aſked, but they gave him no anſwer, and the rattling of the carriage drowned his words. The moon roſe. William looked round in the open fields—he thought it was all a dream.</p>
               <p>After they had proceeded about a mile, they came to the high-way, and the carriage ſuddenly ſtopped. They obliged him to diſmount. When he touched the ground, ſome perſon kiſſed his hand, and bathed it with tears. William looked round—it was the young woman whoſe children he had ſaved.—The two ſoldiers were her huſband and brother.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. THE GRANDMOTHER.</head>
               <p>IF the author ſhould anticipate objections, and begin this chapter with the obſervation that "probability is really nothing more than the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility or poſſibility of a thing," it would ſeem to infer that he himſelf entertained doubts of the probability of this true hiſtory. As every thing which happened, however, is pourtrayed to his fancy in the cleareſt light, and he hopes with the aſſiſtance of the muſes to ſketch it to the reader in no leſs lively colours, he ſhall take the liberty, merely to enhance his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, to remind the reader that Dubos and Breitenger, Marmountel and Schelegel, are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples he has followed; and that all theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have ſhown him that it is quite conceivable and poſſible that William, Babet, Jeanette, and the worthy peaſants ſhould all meet at day-break on the read to Limoges, although the former eſcaped from his dungeon, and, what is ſtill more difficult, the latter muſt have eluded the vigilance of a lover. Were the author doubtful of his cauſe, he would entrench himſelf behind the example of celebrated
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:035693_0260_10064DD8350DB210"/>
poets. The works of many diſtinguiſhed writers are full of things which no man, with all the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the world, can conſider probable. It does not however require this foreign aid to juſtify the incidents of this hiſtory; for the ſimpleſt ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will immediately bring down the reader from the fairy fields of the wonderful into the region of the uncommon, but at the ſame time very poſſible,</p>
               <p>Gratitude impelled the honeſt peaſants, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of every danger, to attempt William's deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erance. Their ſituation as ſoldiers of the national guard, aſſiſted however with Babet's diamonds, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them ready means for the attainment of their purpoſe. While the huſband began the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, the wife, accompanied by her brother, went to the houſe of the deceaſed parſon, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the meaning of William's myſterious requeſt. At firſt, however, they found none but the old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureſs, who was buſy in packing up all the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, in order to transfer them to ſome place of ſafety. When aſked whether there was not a mad girl in the houſe, ſhe replied, that the poor creature had made her eſcape. Some degree of confuſion, which ſtill lurked behind her unbluſhing impudence, excited ſuſpicion. The keys were demanded, which ſhe refuſed.</p>
               <p>The woman and her brother agreed to ſeparate, and traverſe the whole houſe from top to bottom, and at every door they found ſhut to call aloud, to aſcertain whether any priſoner would anſwer. This reſolution they immediately carried into effect. The one went up ſtairs; the other down. In a few minutes they returned, and they had found more than they ſought. "Above, there," ſaid the ſiſter, "I heard the voice of complaint." "And below, there," replied the brother, "I heard the ſound of groans in the cellar."</p>
               <p>The procureſs was now aware of her danger.
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:035693_0261_10064DDB275CE780"/>
The honeſt ſoldier overtook her juſt as ſhe was ſtealing out at the garden-door. She had left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the heavy and bulky part of the ſpoil, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented herſelf with a ſmall bundle, from which the ſoldier pulled out a ſuſpicious-looking caſket. "To the right about, miſtreſs!" ſaid he in a ſtern voice, ſeizing her roughly by the arm: "Give me the keys, or I ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l plunge you into the pond."</p>
               <p>This pond, which was but a few ſteps diſtant, and the threatening aſpect of the young man, whoſe flaming eyes promiſed that he would keep his word, compelled the old ſerpent to be more compliant. She offered to exchange the keys for the caſket; but this was refuſed, in caſe any body ſhould be found who had a better claim to it. This hard condition produced a fruitleſs refuſal. The ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier advanced a few paces nearer the pond, and the keys were delivered up.</p>
               <p>Joyfully the young woman aſcended the ſtair, and her brother haſtily went down to the cellar. The former liberated the languiſhing Babet, and the latter brought out the half-ſtarved maid-ſervant. While mutual explanations were going on, and Babet, to the aſtoniſhment of the peaſants, related her unfortunate ſtory, the old beldame took the opportunity of their confuſion to make her eſcape. She made off without the booty of the caſket, but provided with accompliſhments by which ſhe every where earned a ſubſiſtence, till at laſt, under Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier's adminiſtration at Nantz, ſhe again roſe to be a woman of conſequence.</p>
               <p>Babet was unable to give any ſatisfactory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her fate till ſhe heard that William was alive, and that hopes were entertained of his deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erance. With joy ſhe offered the contents of her caſket to contribute to that object, an offer which, in caſe of neceſſity, they promiſed to accept. She accompanied her deliverers to their rural hut, there

Beſides her own grief, that of an amiable young woman likewiſe lay heavy upon her heart for Beaublanc's wife could no longer conceal that the new infidelity of her huſband was no ſecret to her. She indeed was perfectly conſcious to herſelf that Jeanette's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct was entirely unexceptionable. The fair ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, however, ſtill was the deſtroyer of her peace, and ſhe could not love her. She ſhowed her all the attentions which her misfortunes and the duties of hoſpitality demanded; but the cordial kindneſs which ſeaſons all theſe attentions it was not in her power to diſplay. A cold politeneſs was all ſhe could beſtow, which to noble minds is not leſs galling than open hate.</p>
               <p>They at laſt only met at table; they ſaluted each other coldly; they talked only of the moſt indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſubjects, and both were glad when the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert was introduced. Beaublanc himſelf played a very awkward part. The more he felt the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of his conduct, the more he endeavored, as men uſually do, to juſtify it to himſelf by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to cauſes in which he was not to blame. The cold behavior of his wife he did not overlook, and he reproached her for it when they were alone. She anſwered him only with tears, which ſtill more diſpleaſed him. In a word, the part which the different perſons had to ſupport was now become ſo ſerious, that a melancholy cataſtrophe was juſtly to be apprehended, when a beneficent <hi>deus ex machina</hi> appeared upon the ſtage.</p>
               <p>One evening Jeanette heard a carriage drive up to the door, to which at firſt ſhe paid no attention.
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:035693_0263_10064DDE92392D28"/>
When immediately on his arrival, however, ſhe heard the whole houſe in motion; when ſhe heard baggage brought up ſtairs, and Beaublanc's chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſkipping about in great joy, ſhe aſked the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who brought her a light, whether any company was come?—"Our maſter's grand-mother," ſaid the man.</p>
               <p>The news was very agreeable to Jeanette, partly becauſe ſhe hoped that Beaublanc in preſence of his grandmother would be more attentive to his wife, partly becauſe, in a company of perſons who are intimately acquainted with each other's affairs, a ſtranger is always welcome, becauſe it gives ſome relief to the converſation. Jeanette, therefore, when ſummoned to ſupper, went down with more eaſe and courage then ſhe had done for ſeveral weeks. She ſaw upon the ſopha a venerable matron, who roſe on her entrance, and, with that amiable frankneſs which age is entitled to diſplay, came to meet her. Beaublanc preſented the old lady to her with the words "My grandmother, madame Jerome."</p>
               <p>"Madame Jerome!" ſtammered Jeanette, and grew pale.—"Madame Jerome!" ſhe repeated with an earneſtneſs which ſtruck the company.</p>
               <p>"You appear to know that name," ſaid the lady; "I flatter myſelf that it is not diſagreeable to you."</p>
               <p>"Diſagreeable! No. Jerome was my father's name."</p>
               <p>Beaublanc appeared ſurpriſed. The old lady ſtarted. With viſible anxiety ſhe rubbed her hands, and ſaid: "you are a German?"</p>
               <p>"My father," continued Jeanette, "was a Frenchman, who had left his country for more than twenty years."</p>
               <p>"His ſirname?"</p>
               <p>"Joſeph Aime."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="unknown:035693_0264_10064DE15AA72E60"/>"Great God!" exclaimed the old lady—her knees ſhook—ſhe ſunk in Beaublanc's arms. In a word, we need no longer conceal what the reader muſt have anticipated: ſhe was Jeanette's grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, and the mayor was Jeanette's couſin german.</p>
               <p>Extravagance and irregular conduct had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly irritated the old lady againſt her ſon; ſhe baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from her preſence, and by her ſeverity compelled him to ſeek his fortune in foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Neceſſity—the great maſter which leads its pupils either to virtue, or drives them to deſpair— had reclaimed the prodigal to the path of order and of induſtry. He did not chooſe, however, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any intelligence of himſelf to his mother till he had accumulated as much property as ſhould enable him to diſpenſe with all aſſiſtance from his relations, in order that ſhe might have no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for thinking that he only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Madame Jerome, on the other hand, had long ſince forgotten her reſentment; for the reſentment of a mother is like a flake of ſnow in the month of May. She reproached herſelf bitterly for her harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In the ſleepleſs hours of night ſhe wept her
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:035693_0265_10064DE45BEA7FE8"/>
loſt ſon; ſhe ſaw him wandering in the world poor and abandoned. With what joy would ſhe have called him back! but in what region of the globe was ſhe to ſeek him?—With what anxiety did ſhe expect ſome filial application from him! But he was ſilent.—How often did ſhe invite him by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic advertiſements in the newſpapers to return! They never reached him. Was it poſſible that he, who, in ſpite of his levity and wildneſs, was ſo affectionate towards her, could remain ſo long ſilent?—Ah! no! he is dead! he has fallen a ſacrifice to his mother's unnatural ſeverity!</p>
               <p>This reproach, which inceſſantly preyed on her maternal heart, threw a gloom over her evening of life—and now to be ſo delightfully awaked from this diſagreeable dream! True, indeed, her Joſeph was gone!—but he had lived happily, and he had left behind a youthful repreſentative, who fondly called her <hi>Mother</hi>; a being of her own fleſh and blood, and of whom ſhe had reaſon to be proud.</p>

She even led the converſation to a circumſtance which ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did not wiſh to ſeem to perceive, his paſſion for her.

It availed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here that nature had written the paſſport of virtue and innocence upon her brow; this might have availed her only on the banks of the Ohio, or Hudſon's Bay. Captious objections were advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; her perſon was to be compared with the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription. Formalities and ceremonies of every kind were to be obſerved. Here an officer of the municipality thought he diſcharged his duty well in proportion to the time he conſumed; there an officer of police thought that the colour of her eyes did not exactly correſpond with the original.</p>
               <p>Every thing was at laſt adjuſted, paſſport and baggage were ſtamped with the ſeal of liberty. The poſtillion ſlowly mounted his horſe, and, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, inquired where madame choſe to alight.</p>
               <p>"At the firſt good inn," replied Jeanette haſtily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the carriage rolled heavily through the ſtreets.

A goſſiping hoſteſs conducted her up ſtairs, and immediately began to entertain her with the news of the day. She told her that a priſoner of war, an officer had murdered a conſtitutional prieſt, and violated his niece; that he had been thrown into priſon, and probably in a ſhort time would receive his deſerts under the guillotine.</p>
               <p>Jeanette ſtarted at the words priſoner of war, but inſtantly laid aſide her fear when ſhe heard the nature of the crime of which he was accuſed.
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:035693_0269_10064DEE1599C900"/>
"He has dined at my table," ſaid the prattling hoſteſs; "he appeared ſo quiet, well-behaved a young man, that I would not have ſcrupled to have truſted him either with my ſtrong box or my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But ſtill waters are deep—Brave he may be, as he wears a croſs, and they call him major."</p>
               <p>Jeanette ſtood petrified, and the blood forſook her cheeks.—"A croſs?—Major?—What is his name?"</p>
               <p>Alas! he had a very hard German name; the hoſteſs could not pronounce it. "But how did he look?"—She deſcribed his perſon, feature for fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It was eaſy to ſee that William had ſat for the picture. From Jeanette's pale lips dropped the name of Eichenwald! and—"Right!" interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hoſteſs—"Right! Eichenwald is the very name!"</p>
               <p>Poor Jeanette ſunk to the ground; night obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her eyes; her pulſe at her heart ceaſed to beat, and a convulſive movement of her lips was the only ſymptom of life. The hoſteſs in terrible alarm, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking all the ſaints to her aid, contributed all the aſſiſtance in her power. "Ah! my God! Ah! poor madame!" ſhe repeated an hundred times, and tears of ſympathy burſt from her eyes when ſhe heard that the lady before her was the wife of the unfortunate priſoner.</p>
               <p>She immediately ſhut the door, that the populace might not hear of the diſcovery, and confound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence with guilt. But Jeanette became delirious: ſhe inſiſted on going out—ſhe would throw herſelf at the feet of the judges—in the public market-place proteſt the innocence of her huſband.—The good-natured hoſteſs was obliged to detain her by force; was obliged to ſtifle her cries by ſhutting the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and repeat to her a thouſand times that her interference would only accelerate the fate of her huſband. When at laſt Jeanette's ſtrength was

exhauſted; when ſhe lay breathleſs on the ſopha, and her tears, which paſſion had ſuppreſſed, began to ſteal ſlowly down her cheeks, ſhe began to liſten to the conſolation of the hoſteſs.</p>
               <p>"I fain would believe," ſaid the kind-hearted old woman, "that he is not guilty of the ſhocking crime; I wiſh to believe it becauſe you love him ſo well; and truly I have a good opinion of him myſelf, for many a day has he ſat ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

whiſpered ſhe to the patient, "is one of your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's guards."—Jeanette roſe, and haſtily ſeized the ſtranger's hand. Her eyes were hot and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but tears refuſed to flow.</p>
               <p>"Madame," ſaid the ſoldier, "your ſituation would affect me had I no other motive to venture my life for your huſband."—Jeanette made a ſignal to the hoſteſs to reach the cheſt, which ſtood at the foot of the bed. She opened it, and it was full of money. With a melancholy, affecting look of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, ſhe preſented it to the ſoldier, who rejected it with ſome diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>"Madame," ſaid he with the accents of offended generoſity, "your huſband threw himſelf into the flames to ſave my children. I hope that is enough to induce you to ſhut up your ſtrong box. Here is my hand, I ſhall ſave your huſband's life, or die with him."</p>
               <p>Jeanette attempted to kiſs his hand; tears of grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude again ruſhed to her eyes; a ſervent look to heaven ſpoke her thanks to God and her deliverer. When the beams of hope, like an electrical ſhock, reſtored her the uſe of her tongue, and ſhe again was able to ſpeak, ſhe preſſed upon the generous ſoldier as much as was neceſſary for the payment of all expences; but he inſiſted that he alone muſt anſwer theſe, ſhould it coſt him his laſt ſixpence.</p>
               <p>She now aſked pen and ink to write a note to her huſband to announce her arrival, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to him conſolation in his dungeon. The ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, however, refuſed to carry the letter. He would not even undertake to inform the priſoner of Jeanette's arrival, becauſe it was to be feared that his joy might betray him.</p>
               <p>"Patience!" ſaid the generous young man, "patience till to-morrow, or the day after; by that time it will be decided. Meanwhile this good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will bring you as ſoon as it is night to the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage

               <p>"In tranquility!" ſighed Jeanette.</p>
               <p>The ſoldier endeavored to raiſe her ſpirits, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the hoſteſs which way ſhe ſhould take, and haſtened back to his poſt to avoid ſuſpicion. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of her fever and her weakneſs, Jeanette prepared for her departure; and when night ſpread its ſhades over the earth, ſhe ſet out in company with her worthy hoſteſs, and about midnight reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the young woman's cottage. She was received as the wife of her benefactor, and in Babet ſhe found a ſiſter.</p>
               <p>What paſſed in the heart of the lovely maid when ſhe ſo ſuddenly ſaw the wife of her beloved appear, thoſe who are acquainted with the human heart may conceive. Her attachment, however, was too pure and innocent to permit the ſmalleſt feeling of jealouſy.

               <head>CHAP. XX. THE FLIGHT.</head>
               <p>THE reader will not be greatly ſurpriſed that our hero, at the ſcene before him, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed altogether ſo miraculous, began to think whether his head was not ſeparated from his body, and thoſe he ſaw were not the viſionary ſhades of Elyſium hovering round him:—The explanation of the myſtery, however, upon a public and well fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented road, might be dangerous. The brave ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier rouſed William from his dream, and led him into the thicket, where a large open cart waited for them, furniſhed with every thing that was neceſſary to facilitate their flight.</p>
               <p>In ten minutes William was freed from his irons. Inſtead of his uniform, he put on a coarſe frock, and his hair he tied up under a red cap. Jeanette and Babet were likewiſe obliged to bind up their wav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing locks in a leſs conſpicuous form. Coarſe hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs concealed want their faſhionable corſſet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ces of their perſon, and monſtrous wooden ſhoes covered their elegant feet.</p>
               <p>Already Jeanette and Babet had taken leave of their kind hoſteſs, with tears. William had aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them into the carriage, and was himſelf about to follow, when an unexpected diſcovery changed his reſolution, and almoſt determined him volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to return to his priſon. Till now it had never occurred to him, in the ſlutter of ſpirits into which he had been thrown, to inquire who was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor; and for the firſt time he was fully aware of the extent of the ſacrifice which gratitude had led the worthy ruſtics to make.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="unknown:035693_0274_10064DF849723E50"/>The ſoldier had retired a few ſteps with his wife. William ſaw how anxiouſly ſhe clung round his neck; he heard her ſob, and aſk when ſhe ſhould ſee him again:—He heard her husband comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her in broken accents; he heard him bleſſing her and his children, promiſing to return as ſoon as he could venture it without riſk of his life.—The poor woman could not tear herſelf away; ſhe ſtill hung upon him to take her laſt embrace, till her husband whiſpered her: "Think of the fire, and our duty!"—She then let him go.</p>
               <p>"God protect you!" ſaid he, and went away.— His wife remained ſtanding and wringing her hands. "No!" cried William with emotion—"No! I cannot purchaſe my life at ſuch a price. If my deliverance muſt render you an helpleſs fugitive, your wife a widow, and your children orphans, I ſhould a thouſand times rather return to my cell, and meet death to-morrow."</p>
               <p>Theſe words diffuſed terror through the whole party. Babet and Jeanette roſe up from their ſeats, the ſoldier ſtopped, his wife immediately dried up her tears, and ſtifled her ſighs.—"What do you mean?" began the ſoldier in firm voice. "Take your place quietly in the carriage. The ſtep which puts my life in danger cannot be recalled. Suppoſe even that you were to return to your priſon, it might now be more difficult to get into it unobſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved than it was to get out. You muſt already be miſſed. If not, you cannot reach the town before day-break; and then it muſt be juſt as fatal to your guard, whether you really eſcaped, or only attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it by his connivance. Away then, without loſing a moment! My wife and child I commit to the protection of God and my brother, who was not preſent with me on the poſt, and conſequently has nothing to anſwer for. I will conduct you to the frontiers, and there remain till the tyrant of

my country it overthrown, which ſooner or later muſt happen, as I know the temper of my comrades. Juſtice will then have time to breathe again, and it will no longer be reckoned criminal to obey the dictates of gratitude and humanity.—Away then, and God be with us!"</p>
               <p>He ſeized the reins, and leaped into the ſaddle. William, though his alarms were not baniſhed, was convinced by his arguments, that now to recede would nothing diminiſh the dangers to which the gallant fellow was expoſed; he reſigned himſelf to neceſſity, ſeated himſelf by Jeanette's ſide, and the carriage drove on.</p>

Often would he remain breathleſs with anxiety, and ſtretch every fibre of attention.—Five nights they travelled through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented roads, known only to their guide. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the day they concealed themſelves in woods and deep retired vallies among the mountains. Twice did the harneſs break in paſſing over the rocks. On the third night they loſt their way, and at dawn ſaw, with terror and aſtoniſhment, the lofty ſpires of a large town at a little diſtance; and as they ſuddenly turned the horſes to ſhun this danger, one of them dropped down dead.</p>
               <p>The courage of the men and the firmneſs of the women at laſt overcame all dangers. The morning ſun of the fifth day dawned as they entered the frontiers of Switzerland. In vain Jeanette opened her purſe, and Babet her caſket, to ſupply their gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous guide, at leaſt with what was neceſſary to ſecure him from want during his exile. "I can work," ſaid he—"Induſtry and honeſty are wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come every where. If you would alleviate the pain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="278" facs="unknown:035693_0276_10064DFC9AC4D820"/>About noon, William with his fair companions reached a town, where they reſolved to recruit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after the many difficulties they had encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. There their hearts, for the firſt time, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eaſy unembarraſſed converſation. Fear no longer ſealed their lips, no dangers now obliterated the remembrance of the paſt, or clouded their hopes of the future.</p>
               <p>Jeanette had now an opportunity to inquire with cordial ſympathy the hiſtory of her husband's friend; and William availed himſelf of this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to relate, in Babet's preſence, the ſtate of his heart. He gained this advantage by the ſtep, that he was not obliged to addreſs himſelf to Babet, and ſhe could bluſh in ſilence, as the looks of her friend were too delicate to dwell on her ingenuous ſhame.</p>
               <p>He now painted Frederick's paſſion in the moſt glowing colours, expatiated with eloquence on all the amiable qualites which the reſerve of his friend had rendered him incapable of diſplaying, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the ardent wiſh (which he addreſſed to heaven, and not to Babet) that the lovely creature might one day reward the firſt love of a man of honour by a mutual attachment.</p>
               <p>Babet was ſilent, and fixed her eyes on the ground. What really paſſed in her heart it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for us to unfold. All that ſhe heard, however, connected with the impoſſibility of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the man who had made the firſt impreſſion on her heart, and now ſpoke ſo warmly for another, combined too with her helpleſs ſituation in a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign land, produced no diſadvantageous impreſſion on her mind to Frederick's pretenſions.</p>
               <p>William now was ſilent, and left the reſt to his wife, to whom he made a ſignificant ſign to ſecond the wiſhes of Babet, convinced that in ſuch caſes a woman is the beſt agent that can be employed.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXI. THE TYRANNY OF HONOUR.</head>
               <p>TWO days had now elapſed. Repoſe and anxiety to ſee her child had armed Jeanette with new ſtrength. For ſome days paſt ſhe had obſerved a cloud on William's brow, the cauſe of which ſhe was unable to explain; and ſhe hoped, by a ſpeedy departure, to reſtore his wonted ſeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. She intreated him, therefore, to make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to ſet out next morning, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to comply.</p>
               <p>This promiſe indeed appeared to coſt him ſome pain. He ſeemed reluctantly to make prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the journey; and the evening previous to their intended departure he was uncommonly penſive; melancholy clouded his open countenance. Jeanette's eye dwelt upon him with anxious looks; but as ſhe could not deviſe the reaſon, and he ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly evaded her inquiries, ſhe contented herſelf in the expectation that time would unravel the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and baniſh her uneaſy apprehenſions with the thoughts of ſoon ſeeing her infant.</p>
               <p>The morning came. Jeanette awoke, but Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam was gone. On the day of their departure ſo many things were to be arranged, that at firſt ſhe was not ſurpriſed. She leaped out of bed, and went into the adjoining room, to awake Babet, and began very buſily to pack up her baggage.</p>
               <p>Breakfaſt was brought up, and with it the waiter delivered her a ſealed letter. She glanced over it, and turned pal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the ſake of my comrades who ſtill remain in captivity, I muſt not abuſe the indulgence for which we pledged our honor. Be eaſy, however. I do not intend to deliver myſelf up to the frantic deluded people. There are ſtill in France men of worth, who will protect me till the expected exchange takes place.

               <p>To ſee a thunderbolt from the unclouded ſky ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſhiver to pieces the lofty oak by his ſide, would leſs aſtoniſh the affrighted traveller than this letter amazed Jeanette. Pale and trembling ſhe handed the letter to Babet. "Ah! William, William, what haſt thou done?—You are going to a land where the laws of nations afford no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection—to a land where noble ſentiments are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, where the few who yet are animated by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of humanity, muſt bend under the iron rod of

tyranny; and can I then be eaſy?—A thouſand dangers have I defied—through difficulties innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, through frightful precipices did I preſs to find thee—yet again you abandon me!—Ah! William, what haſt thou done?"</p>
               <p>Thus did ſhe lament under the heavy load of her anguiſh, and was inacceſſible to the cold conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her friend. Her ſpirits quite exhauſted, unable to turn her attention to any object, ſhe did unconſciouſly whatever ſhe was deſired; conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without being ſenſible of what ſhe did, to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet's requeſt that they ſhould leave this melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpot. She followed her into the carriage, ſeated herſelf in ſilence, and neither aſked nor cared whither they were going.</p>
               <p>When ſhe began again to breathe her native air, when they paſſed the frontiers of Germany, Babet ſucceeded in rouſing her from her ſtupor, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding her of her child. At laſt, when they had advanced within a day's journey of the place of their deſtination, the feelings of the wife yielded to thoſe of the mother; her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion painted the little ſmiling William ſtretching out his arms to her. She calculated in idea how much he had grown; ſhe heard the new words he had learnt to liſp, and rejoiced in the thought that in ſpite of her long abſence he would ſtill know his mother.</p>
               <p>It was evening when they reached a little town only two ſhort ſtages from the object of her tender anxiety. As they had purſued their journey day and night without repoſe, the wearied Babet here wiſhed to enjoy a few hours ſleep; and in this wiſh ſhe was confirmed by the repreſentations of the landlord, who told them that there was a wood in their way, through which it was very unſafe to paſs. "A deſperate band," ſaid he, "conſiſting of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man deſerters, Dutch run-aways, and French re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugees,

have collected here, and render travelling very dangerous. The neighborhood of the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers favor their deſigns. Dreadful ſtories of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and murder are circulated, which perhaps may be exaggerated, but yet are terrible enough if you believe only one half of them. Government, it is ſaid, however, is making preparations to put an end to the diſorder, and a ſtrong party of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers is to be ſent to ſurround the wood, and hunt the robbers from their retreats." Whether the detachment had yet arrived, whether the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt had yet been made to clear the wood, and with what ſucceſs, the landlord could not tell, and he thought it very dangerous, for the travellers to proceed, eſpecially by night.</p>

               <p>Their confidence was increaſed, when at the diſtance of half a mile from the fatal wood they met a traveller on horſe-back, who had rode through it unmoleſted, and who communicated to them the agreeable intelligence, that in the morning two companies of gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>As long as the road ſtretched through cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fields, and here and there the village dog was heard to bark, the travellers felt no apprehenſion. When the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

An anxious ſilence prevailed in the carriage—every accidental ruſtling among the leaves, every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful ſhadow of the trees, ſtruck them with diſmay.</p>
               <p>At little intervals the wood ſometimes opened, and diſplayed little ſpots, on which the gentle light of the moon ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

had ſhe ſaid this, however, when a ſhrill whiſtle from a thicket on their left hand ſounded ſo fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully through the ſilence of night, that they ſtarted up. The ſignal was repeated at a little diſtance before them in the ſame ſhri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"God protect us!" ſaid the poſtillion, and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf. In trembling broken accents Jeanette endeavored to comfort her companion with the hope that perhaps it was the grenadiers who were in ſearch of the robbers, and who guarded the road. But at this moment a ſhot which levelled the poſt-boy confirmed all their fears. The carriage was ſurrounded, and the ladies ſcreamed for help. One of the robbers mounted upon a ſtately charger ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the door with a piſtol in his hand; he ſpoke to them in French, and ordered them, as they prized their lives, to obſerve a ſtrict ſilence. One of his companions pulled down Peter from the coach-box; another leaped into the ſaddle, and drove the carriage into the wood. The robbers ſurrounded it on all ſides; two of them ſtood behind, and one rode before, to guide it through the rough, unformed path.</p>
               <p>Scarcely had they advanced two hundred paces, when the carriage ſtruck violently againſt ſome f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſwore; the ladies trembled; nothing remained to be done but to take the animate as well as inan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate booty out of the carriage, and leave it. This the robbers inſtantly reſolved to do; twenty hands were employed in removing the baggage; and the perſon on horſeback, who appeared the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the gang, came up and politely requeſted the ladies to diſmount. They were obliged to obey.</p>
               <p>He immediately quitted them again to ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his companions, and to haſten the buſineſs.

Jeanette and Babet ſat down upon the moſſy ſtump of a tree, and were obliged to look on and ſee their little property thrown about and plundered. Moſt of it was heaped upon poor Peter's ſhoulders, and when he groaned under the burden, they ſtimulated him with laſhes. In a very few minutes the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers had emptied the carriage, and ſhaken the lining to ſee whether any thing was concealed.</p>
               <p>They immediately put the cav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ade in motion, and the ladies at firſt believed that the robbers would content themſelves with the booty, and leave them behind in the wood, as nobody ſeemed to take any concern about them. Their ſituation was ſo diſtreſſing, that the frightful alternative of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining alone in the heart of the pathleſs wood ſeemed preferable, and Jeanette in ſecret breathed a fervent prayer that they might be left; for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can find her way through a wilderneſs to her child. Of this wretched hope, however, they were deprived. Two ſaddled horſes were brought, and a ſignal was made that they ſhould mount and follow the reſt of the party as faſt as poſſible.</p>
               <p>They declined with abundance of tears, and both declared that they had never in their lives been on horſeback; that they would rather follow on foot; but their intreaties were fruitleſs. A dozen of rude fellows ſurrounded them, and with coarſe jeſts promiſed to take care and keep them from falling. When the ladies ſtill refuſed, they ſeized them rudely, and placed them on horſeback by force.</p>
               <p>At this moment a volley of muſket ſhot poured in among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the balls whiſtled about Jeanette's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The whole wood ſeemed ſuddenly to be anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Thundering cries reſounded through the trees. "<hi>This way! this way!</hi>' cried a man on

horſeback, who cut his way through the buſhes with his ſabre. Behind him grenadiers' caps glanced in the light of the moon.</p>
               <p>The robbers who had gone before, threw down their booty when they heard the firing, ſeized their arms, and aſſembled courageouſly round their lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who boldly advanced to meet the ſoldiers. A furious engagement began, which was rendered ſtill more dreadful by the darkneſs of the night, and the narrow ſpace within which the combatants were confined. Jeanette and her companion were almoſt as much expoſed to danger as thoſe engaged. They attempted to fly, but on all ſides they were ſurrounded by the ſanguinary conflict. Balls ſtruck the trees by their ſide, and wounded men dropped down at their feet.</p>
               <p>The robbers exceeded the ſoldiers in number, and the latter began to retreat, ſtill maintaining a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fight. By this movement the ladies were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the middle of the crowd. The officer who commanded them was wounded. His horſe received a ſhot, and reeled—he leaped to the ground juſt beſide Babet, who lay trembling on her knees, and with a ſigh ſtammered the words, "I can do no more!"</p>
               <p>"My God!" exclaimed Babet as ſhe wrung her hands, and threw her tearful eyes to heaven. At theſe words, the wounded man looked up, ſcreamed "Babet! Babet!" and plunged anew into the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. That ſweet name ſeemed inſtantaneouſly to have cloſed his wounds, and manned his arms with ſupernatural ſtrength. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Alas! he was again driven back to Babet's feet— covered with new wounds he ſunk down beſide her, and exclaimed, "Here will I die with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure!"—The ſtranger was bending forwards to cleave his head, when the ſight of Babet again ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be endued with an inexplicable charm. "Babet!" cried the robber, and his uplifted arm dropped nerveleſs. "Babet!" repeated he; then leaped haſtily from his horſe, ſeized the kneeling maid, and hurried her through the crowd deeper into the thicket. The officer lay unable to move, or to make the leaſt oppoſition to this attempt.</p>

               <p>Aſtoniſhment and joy deprived her of ſpeech. She could not aſk what miracle had ſent her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band as her deliverer. She could only feel an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joy, and this feeling venting itſelf in tears, ſhe hung on his neck and wept.</p>
               <p>The groans of a wounded man attracted his attention, and rouſed William from the delightful tranſports into which he was thrown. He looked round, ſaw a man lying weltering in his blood—looked again—ſtarted with affright—and ſunk down overpowered with grief by the ſide of the ſufferer.—It was Frederick—his friend, who knew him not; for the night of death ſat heavy on his eyes.</p>

               <p>The ſoldiers deſiſted from the purſuit of the robbers, returned, and haſtily made up two litters of twigs; gently placed the wounded man upon the one, and the exhauſted Jeanette upon the other, and bore them with cautious ſteps through the wood. The huſſars drove the priſoners before them. William rode ſlowly beſide the litters, and a thouſand conflicting emotions agitated his breaſt. When he looked at the wife he had ſaved from ſuch danger, he was filled with a melancholy joy; but when he turned to his dying friend, and heard Jeanette's lamentations for the loſt Babet his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in being the deliverer of his wife was cruelly embittered.</p>
               <p>At day-break they reached the extremity of the

William immediately diſpatched a huſſar to the next town to call ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons. They came about noon, and to William's unſpeakable joy declared that none of his friend's wounds were mortal. They pledged themſelves for his recovery, and ſaid, that the only dangerous circumſtance was the weakneſs which the loſs of ſo much blood ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The parſon of the pariſh, a benevolent old man, now came to the inn, and with the kindeſt hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity made an offer of his houſe for the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the patient. The offer was gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and Frederick, after the firſt dreſſing was taken off, with permiſſion of the ſurgeon was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. The good old man prepared the beſt and quieteſt room in the houſe for his reception; and with the moſt tender anxiety produced whatever his kitchen, his cellar, and his little domeſtic med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icine cheſt could furniſh.</p>
               <p>In the evening Frederick again became perfectly ſenſible. He could not ſpeak, however, but he ſmiled complacently when he ſaw his friend ſitting at his bed-ſide. He ſmiled, too, when he ſaw Jeanette buſied going backwards and forwards; and his eye glanced with looks of anxiety round the room, as if he ſtill ſought another object. William underſtood this look, and with a ſignificant geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aſked his wife, whether Babet was yet aſleep: Jeanette nodded aſſent, but ſhe was forced to turn aſide to conceal the riſing tear. This little decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion produced an happy effect upon Frederick; he ſeemed to be perfectly ſatisfied, and ſoon after fell aſleep.</p>

William was almoſt as much worn out; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved this night to watch by his friend's bed-ſide, and inſiſted that his wife ſhould return and enjoy the repoſe ſhe ſo much required in the adjoining room. One of the ſurgeons likewiſe remained with Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick. As the patient, however, ſeemed to ſleep quietly, the ſurgeon fell aſleep alſo. William con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued awake; and the remembrance of all his wonderful adventures furniſhed his mind with ſuch copious ſubject of meditation, as enabled him to reſiſt the attacks of ſleep.</p>
               <p>A little after midnight he heard repeated knocks at the door; but as the room where the ſick man lodged was at the back of the houſe, and the knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could not diſturb the repoſe of his friend, he took no further notice of it. In a ſhort time, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his attention was attracted by the noiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, by the ſound of people paſſing and repaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and talking at a diſtance. Not long after, ſome one ſtepped up to the door of the room, and knocked ſoftly. William went out, and found the parſon with a light in his hand, who told him that a beautiful young lady with a caſket under her arm had come to his houſe on foot, and had called him up to ſpeak with him. As ſhe, however ſpoke nothing but French, and he did not underſtand that language, he had conducted her to his cloſet, and taken the liberty to call him as an interpreter. The lady appeared very uneaſy, and was bathed in tears.</p>
               <p>William haſtened to awake the ſurgeon, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the old man with a preſentiment which did not deceive him; for, when the door opened, Babet flew into his arms!—William's unexpected ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance gave her extreme joy a tinctu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of a beloved friend. She laughed, wept, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, prayed, and for a long time could not utter a coherent ſentence. At laſt ſhe inquired firſt for Jeanette—and then, with viſible emotion, for Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick, whom, in the confuſion of the ſight, ſhe had too well recogniſed when he dropped at her feet, and his laſt words, "Here will I die with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure!" ſtill vibrated in her ears.</p>
               <p>After William had given her a favorable anſwer to all her inquiries, and had ſomewhat ſettled her ſpirits by a compoſing draught, he expreſſed a wiſh to know by what lucky adventure ſhe had ſo unexpectedly appeared:—Babet, however, laid her fingers on her mouth—ſhe remained ſilent— her eyes loſt their fire—and, after taking two or three turns through the room, ſhe ſeized William's hand, and intreated him never again to diſtreſs her with this queſtion.</p>
               <p>William could not comprehend the cauſe of this refuſal; but as ſhe repeated her intreaty in the moſt fervent tone, and he was not accuſtomed to pry into oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r people's ſecrets, he deſiſted from all inquiry. The parſon, too, could give no clue to the myſtery. The ſervant could only tell that when Babet knocked, a carriage, ſurrounded by ſeveral men on horſeback, ſtood at a little diſtance from the houſe; and that as ſoon as the door was opened, and ſhe admitted, the carriage and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants wheeled round, at full gallop took the way back to the wood.</p>
               <p>Next morning the joy of the company was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted by the appearance of honeſt Peter, about whom, in the firſt alarm of the ſight, nobody had ſhown any concern; and availing himſelf of this circumſtance, he had fled with the baggage on his back into the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

brought him into the road. He then traced out his maſter, and arrived juſt at the moment when, on the removal of the ſecond dreſſing, the ſurgeon gave the moſt ſanguine hopes of Frederick's ſpeedy recovery, and Babet and Jeanette ſtood arm in arm by his bed-ſide.</p>

route of navigators, that the reader may follow them till he traces our heroes into the haven of Love, conſtant through every trial.</p>
               <p>That Frederick, ſoon after his ſeparation from his friend, was exchanged; that he returned to his regiment, which during the war had ſuffered very much, and which, partly to allow it a reſpite, and partly that it might be recruited to its full comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was ſtationed in its old garriſon; that the young hero, accuſtomed to activity, undertook the taſk of clearing the wood of the robbers by whom it was infeſted; are circumſtances extremely natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and unneceſſary to be inſiſted upon.</p>
               <p>William's elopement was the effect of, perhaps, too nice a feeling of honor, and his ſpeedy return was the effect of a proper diſplay of generoſity in the enemy. When he arrived at the head-quarters of the general, who was encamped on the frontiers of Switzerland, he voluntarily ſurrendered himſelf as a priſoner of war, and, with the noble candour which teſtifies the innocent man, recounted the ſtory of his flight. The commander in chief did not think it his duty again to expoſe the life of the priſoner to the fury of his countrymen, by detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. He joyfully ſeized the opportunity which his office of intendant of the exchange of priſoners preſented, to reſcue William from all farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, and that very evening he gave him liberty to return home.</p>
               <p>What uſe William made of his freedom it is eaſy to conceive. He flew back to the place where he had left his faithful Jeanette with the hope of ſtill finding her there. When he found that ſhe had got the ſtart of him by twenty miles, he took poſt-horſes, and followed her. Every moment the diſtance by which they were ſeparated dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed. The laſt ſtage he reached an hour after her departure, and the timorous hoſt told him how
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:035693_0292_10064D3EA21EECA0"/>
he had warned her not to proceed; and that in ſpite of his friendly remonſtrances, and Babet's fatigue, ſhe had reſolved to continue her journey.</p>
               <p>William trembled to think of the danger in which ſhe was involved by her maternal anxiety. He haſtened to the commandant of the place, an old fellow-ſoldier, and requeſted a ſtrong eſcort to the next ſtage. Twenty huſſars immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived orders to attend him, and he ſet off fullſpeed. The tumult in the wood reached his ear, and he arrived juſt in time to ſave his wife, and avenge his friend.</p>
               <p>The thickeſt veil concealed the ſecret of Babet's adventure; and we ſhould never have been able to penetrate it, if ſhe had not ſome years after, her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf communicated the myſtery in a moment of confidence to her husband. The captain of the rubbers, who had called her name, ſeized and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her off, was her brother Philip. In his youth ſpoiled by indulgence, perverted by the prejudices of birth, he left his country full of chimerical hopes, truſted to the diſtinction of his birth, and expected to perform an important part among the emigrants, for which he was not qualified. He thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf neglected; he then joined himſelf with other diſcontented perſons in the ſame ſituation, and became a robber.</p>
               <p>For ſome time he carried on his depredations cautiouſly, and with ſucceſs. But when his troop was increaſed by new acceſſions, he had the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to engage in ſome extravagant attempts, which attracted the attention of government, and invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him in the moſt ſerious diſaſters. He was overpowered, his troop diſperſed, and he had the good fortune to avoid an ignominious death by making his eſcape to America.</p>
               <p>When in the heat of the battle he recogniſed his ſiſter on her knees, a ſpark of fraternal affection
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:035693_0293_10064D4076762F38"/>
awoke in his breaſt. He forgot his own danger, and thought only of carrying the helpleſs maid to a place of ſafety. After the ſkirmiſh was over, and the reſt of his troop were aſſembled, he cauſed her caſket to be ſought for, returned it to her, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conducted her by circuitous paths, known to himſelf alone, to the parſon's houſe; here he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her his rugged hand, which ſhe bathed with tears of ſorrow to ſee him fallen ſo low. All her ſiſterly admonitions to divert him from his career of guilt—her affecting appeal to her honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed father's ſpirit—he heard only in ſullen ſilence.</p>
               <p>With a heavy heart, and a determination at leaſt not to divulge her brother's ſhame, ſhe reſigned him to his fate, and haſtened back to the arms of friendſhip, in the boſom of a new family; where in perſon of her huſband, the orphan found a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, brother, and friend.</p>
               <p>Love, friendſhip, virtue, hope, ſoon reſtored Frederick to perfect health. On William's eſtate the two families now grew and flouriſhed. Harmony, contentment, and cheerfulneſs beamed in the looks of their parents, and ſmiled in the eyes of their children. The two friends hung up their arms in the hall, tended their turnips and cabbages, and exclaimed with Voltaire:
