            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE two main defects of wit, to which all others may be reduced, are <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi>; by <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> we know not things nereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; by <hi>Error</hi> we know them falſely. <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> is a privation, <hi>Error</hi> is a poſitive act. From Ignorance ſprings Vice, from Error Hereſy. Error in Judgment is worſe than Error in Practice, for then the Conſcience takes part with Sin, and a man thinks he ought to do what he doth.</p>
            <p>Every Error is a plot of the Devil to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſome Truth, and is very ſpreading &amp; infectious: this is the moſt remarkable evil our bleſſed Saviour takes notice of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24 and that no leſs than three times <hi>ver.</hi> 5,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003659_0004_10023F39DEC2E0C0"/>11. 24. This is that againſt which the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Fathers ſpent moſt of their painful writings; and all the primitive Churches to whom the Apoſtles wrote Epiſtles, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly warned, either Poſitively to ſtand faſt in the truth, to hold faſt their Profeſſion; or Negatively to beware of, and to avoid Falſe-teachers, &amp; not to be carried about with divers and ſtrange Doctrines, as here in my Text.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſpend time about thoſe needleſs diſputes that have been maintained concerning the Author of this Epiſtle, which have taken their riſe from ſome Greek Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the New-Teſtament, wherein the name of <hi>Paul</hi> is not prefixed to this Epiſtle; this may be ſufficient for us, that whoever was the <hi>Amanuenſis,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt was the Dictator: The clear evidence whereof it carries fully in it ſelf, being calculated to diſcover unto the believing <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that they had not loſt by renouncing <hi>Judaiſm</hi> for <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> ſeeing the whole Oeconomy of <hi>Moſes</hi> was deſigned but to lead them to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to be Perfected in Him, He being the Truth and Subſtance of all thoſe ſhadows, and to ſhew them the Tranſcendant excellency of Chriſt's Perſon, both in regard of his Deity and Humanity, and of his Offices; as a Prophet exceeding
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003659_0005_10023F3D2AEEC0D0"/>
               <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a Prieſt exceeding <hi>Aaron,</hi> and as Prieſt and King exceeding <hi>Melchizedeck</hi>; and thro' the whole there are ſuch heavenly Precepts and Doctrines according to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs intermixed, that I ſay the epiſtle it ſelf declares its divine original contrary to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, Arius,</hi> and ſome other Hereticks who rejected it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall paſs by what preceeds my Text in this Chapter, &amp; Conſider theſe words (not as they may ſtand in relation to what goes before, or follows, but) abſolutely as they are in themſelves. And here we have,</p>
            <p>(1) <hi>A Dehortation, be not carried about with divers &amp; ſtrange Doctrines</hi>: The Doctrines of Chriſt being immutable, it is but neceſſary to dehort his Subjects from all mutation or defection, as the Apoſtle does here, that they ſhould not be wheeling and whirling about (as the word ſignifies) with an unſtable &amp; unconſtant motion of Judgment, Faith &amp; Practice. About ſuch erroneous Doctrines which are vain rules to lead to Chriſt, and are different in nature from Chriſt's one and the ſame Rule; and theſe Doctrines are very numerous and various, ſtrange and untrue, taught by falſe Brethren and Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, to the wounding of the Church, and deſtruction of Souls.</p>

(1) <hi>The form of Doctrine.</hi> A phraſe which expreſſeth the efficacy of Divine Doctrine in the hearts of Believers; it changes and faſhions their hearts into its own likeneſs, by imprinting upon them (thro' the Spirit of God) thoſe very Graces of Faith, Hope, Love and Obedience which it teacheth and requireth; the Doctrine of the Goſpel is a Mould, and the hearer is the Metal, which when it is melted and caſt into the Mould, it receives its Form and Figure, See Rom. 6, 17. <hi>But ye have obeyed from the heart, that form of Doctrine which was delivered you.</hi> In the Original it runs thus, The mould of Doctrine, into which you were delivered. Hence in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21, It is called <hi>an Ingrafted Word.</hi> It turns the heart and life of the Hearer into its own nature, as the Stock does the Cion that is Ingrafted into it.</p>

            <p>2. The word Doctrine is ſometimes taken <hi>in an Evil ſenſe</hi>; for falſe &amp; erroneous Tenets, taught &amp; ſpread by ſuch as are indued with a lying Spirit, and by God's juſt Judgment given over to ſtrong Deluſions; and when taken thus,</p>

corrupt &amp; erroneous Doctrines, which come from the father of lies. However vile men are or may be imploy'd as Inſtruments in the ſpreading and teaching of them. And well may ſuch be called <hi>ſtrange Doctrines,</hi> for they are quite foreign to whatever the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit of grace and truth ever taught; they are ſuch as the Word of God knows nothing of; ſuch as the Church of God col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively, &amp; the perſonal experience of the Children of God ſeverally are ſtrangers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The Spirit of God is properly called the Spirit of Truth, <hi>Joh</hi> 16. 13. And the Word of God is called the word of Truth, <hi>Joh</hi> 17. 17 &amp; <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18. And the Church of God is the pillar &amp; ground of Truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. And the glorious Head and King of the Church (who himſelf is the Way, the Truth &amp; the Life) hath promiſed that every Member of it, ſhall be guided into all Truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13 And therefore all ſuch <hi>Doctrines</hi> as are either contrary unto, or inconſiſtent with truth, are wholly ſtrange to what either the Word &amp; Spirit of God teach, or the Church &amp; People of Chriſt embrace &amp; Entertain.</p>

            <p>2. <hi>It forbids Reading and Studying the Books that contain them.</hi> Satan hath his Scribes as well as his Teachers.

1. <hi>Becauſe it is inconſiſtent with their very Profeſſion to do otherwiſe.</hi> Chriſtians profeſs to receive that and only that Goſpel which the Apoſtles preached, and that without either adding to, or diminiſhing from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelations; now to give heed to ſtrange Doctrines, is inconſiſtent with this profeſſion, for it is no leſs than a perverting the Goſpel of Chriſt, &amp; a removing or turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Becauſe it is inconſiſtent with their own beſt intereſt.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us that if any Man, nay were it poſſible that an Apoſtle of Chriſt, or an Angel of God, ſhould come from Heaven and teach ſtrange Doctrines, he ſhould be accurſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9. and if the Teacher is curſed then certainly he that is taught is in great hazard; he that ſubmits to ſuch a Teacher is a partaker of his evil deeds, &amp; conſequently will ſhare with him in the Curſe. And beſides, where Perſons do not conſcientiouſly take heed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, God is ſometimes provoked judicially to give them over to ſtrong deluſions to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve lies, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Becauſe not to do thus is to gratify Satan and reproach Chriſt in the higheſt degree.</hi> For to give heed to falſe Doctrines, is to give the father of lies that credit which is due only to God, and to reject the record God 
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003659_0016_10023F555DC8E4A8"/>
hath given in his Word as if he were a liar.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Becauſe not to do thus is very endangering to the Souls of our Poſterity.</hi> If Parents are poiſoned, the Children are exceedingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to infection; Children have common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a great deal of charity for their Parents, and therefore take up with the Principles of their Anceſtors upon truſt, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Parents had need ſee to it that their Tenets be Orthodox. But I muſt haſten,</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>To ſhew what thoſe particular ſtrange Doctrines are, which profeſſed Chriſtians at this day, and particularly in this place, ſhould eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially beware of.</hi> I ſhall mention Eight, and give a brief confutation to each of them.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>To deny the morality of the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is a very ſtrange doctrine.</hi> There are a ſort of creatures riſen up, who (in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen defiance to the great God and all good order) live in the conſtant breach of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs divine Law, by denying the morality of the fourth Commandment, &amp; caſhiering it among other Levitical Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. For confutation of this Error, we may here,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> That all the Laws given in the old Teſtament, are to be diſtinguiſhed in regard of their continuance, into theſe two ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1) <hi>Perpetual,</hi> binding all men in all ages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:003659_0017_1002026E6830B628"/>
Or,</p>
            <p>(2) <hi>Temporary,</hi> binding only ſuch as lived before the Reſurrection of Chriſt; for the Will of the Legiſlator (which is the very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of all that force, extent, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance that the Law hath) was that ſome Precepts ſhould be obſerved only till the Reſurrection of the promiſed Meſſiah, and no longer, and that others ſhould continue in force from the firſt promulgation of them to the end of time. Now the Queſtion is, Which of theſe kinds is the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of? and to this I anſwer, That it belongs to the former ſort, and is bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all men in all ages; as may appear by conſidering the following particulars.</p>
            <p>[1] <hi>Conſider</hi> Adam <hi>had no Precept given him in innocency, but what was of perpetual obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>: But this Precept was then given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man, therefore it is perpetual; the major propoſition is evident thus, that all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts then given to <hi>Adam</hi> were moral and not ceremonial, for there was then no ſin, and ſo no need of a Saviour, &amp; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no uſe of ceremonies to ſignify the one or typify the other; and the minor is plain from <hi>Gen</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>[2] <hi>It is apparent that it was the real inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſupreme and abſolute Lawgiver, that this Precept ſhould bind all men to the Worlds end.</hi> 
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:003659_0018_10023F5A33C82E08"/>
For how could the great God declare his mind in this behalf more plainly than by equalling it in all things with thoſe Precepts which all men muſt own to be of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obligation. And by ſeparating it wholly from, nay exalting it far above all thoſe which are on all hands acknowleged to be but Temporary.</p>
            <p>(1) <hi>This Precept</hi> was promulgated in the ſame majeſtick manner, with the ſame voice, at the ſame time, and in the ſame place that the other nine were.</p>
            <p>(2) <hi>It was delivered to the ſame Perſon,</hi> to be laid up in the ſame Ark, and ſo is a part of the ſame Covenant, whence thoſe Tables are called the Tables of the Covenant, and that Ark the Ark of the Covenant. Whence it may be thus argued.</p>
            <p>What Commandment ſoever is a part of eternal Covenant, and is by God graced and commended with all thoſe ſigns of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation wherewith all the reſt are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, cannot be made of leſs continuance than the reſt (whoſe perpetuity is ſignified by their being written on Tables of Stone, and being laid up in the Ark.)</p>
            <p>But thus it is with reſpect to the fourth Commandment. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3) <hi>The bleſſed God himſelf</hi> hath ſeparated this from all temporary Precepts, by giving
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003659_0019_10023F5C961A4B70"/>
it thoſe privileges, as it were, and notes of honour, which all of them wanted; and he hath equalled it with the perpetual &amp; ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Precepts, by communicating to it all thoſe teſtimonies of force and continuance which they had; therefore we are bound to believe it was his holy will that this ſhould continue in force as much and as long as the reſt, even to all men in all ages till time ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>[3] <hi>Conſider how unreaſonable, nay what a vile reflection it is on the Divine Wiſdom,</hi> for any to think that God would put a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and temporary law in the very midſt of moral and perpetual Precepts, and urge it with more reaſons, words, repetitions and particulars than any of thoſe morals, as he plainly doth in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>[4] <hi>Conſider to deny the morality &amp; perpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of this Precept,</hi> is to take away one of the ten and ſo leave but nine, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expreſs word of God, in Deut. 10. 4. <hi>And he wrote on the Tables according to the firſt writing, the ten Commandments, which the Lord ſpake unto you in the mount,</hi> &amp;c. And how our Adverſaries can anſwer this I know not, unleſs they betake themſelves to the ſame poor ſhift with the Papiſts, who when they raze out the ſecond Commandment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is expreſly againſt their Idolatry, 
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003659_0020_10023F5EF35E44C0"/>
they divide the tenth into two to maintain the number.</p>
            <p>[5] <hi>Conſider all thoſe Laws in the Jewiſh Church,</hi> that were ceremonial and temporary, were accompliſhed in Chriſt, and abrogated by him; but it was not ſo with reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Commandment, for we find plainly that this Precept was ſtill to continue in force under the Goſpel; as appears briefly by theſe things,</p>
            <p>(1) The Prophet <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> (<hi>Iſai. ch.</hi> 56.) he pronounces a bleſſing on them in thoſe days that keep the Sabbath from polluting it, (<hi>v.</hi> 2.) nay he puts the keeping of the Sabbath for the whole obedience of the Covenant (<hi>v.</hi> 6) which he would never do had it been no more than temporary.</p>
            <p>(2) We accordingly find our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf, when ſpeaking of thoſe days wherein all the ceremonial Law was dead and buried, <hi>viz</hi> ſeveral years after his own Reſurrection &amp; Aſcention, when <hi>Titus Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſian</hi> ſhould deſtroy Jeruſalem, he ſays, Mat. 24. 20 <hi>Pray that your flight be not in the winter, nor on the Sabbath day,</hi> plainly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Sabbath was to continue after the legal Ceremonies ceaſed,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:003659_0021_10023F61622F5F90"/>
(3) The ſame point concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of this Law is plainly confirmed by <hi>James</hi> after Chriſt's Aſcention: ſee <hi>Jam.</hi> 2 to where he ſays, <hi>He that keepeth the whole Law, and faileth but in one point, is guilty of all.</hi> Whence we may thus reaſon, The whole Law, and every part of it, was in force when <hi>James</hi> wrote this Epiſtle, for how can a man break a Law that is abrogared, or be guilty of all by breaking any one point, if the whole, and every point of it he not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually in force. Now this Epiſtle was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>James</hi> to ſuch as lived under the Goſpel. Wherefore at that time and to thoſe Perſons, the whole Law, &amp; every part and point of it was in force And if any doubt what <hi>James</hi> means by the Law, it is plain he meaneth the decalogue or ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, thus, He that ſpeaketh of a whole Law, and after inſtanceth in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar members of the Law, muſt needs mean the whole number of Precepts, whereof theſe two bro't for inſtance are members and parts. Now for inſtance <hi>James</hi> brings in two members of the decalogue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the whole Law, and each point, he muſt needs mean the decalogue and every precept thereof, as ſtill farther appears by his manner of ſpeaking and reaſoning, when as ſays thus, <hi>He that ſaid, Thou ſhalt not 
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003659_0022_10023F62EC844168"/>
commit adultery, ſaid alſo, Thou ſhalt not kill, if then thou commit not adultery, but killeſt, thou art a tranſgreſſor of the Law.</hi> Here we have an imperfect ſyllogiſm, or a plain Enthymem, and a propoſition muſt needs be underſtood to make up the Argument, and having one propoſition and the concluſion, no man that hath reaſon can chooſe but add the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition underſtood, thus or to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> What things were ſpoken by the ſame Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, do bind ſo equally, that though a man keep one of them, and yet break ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is a tranſgreſſor of that Law given by that Lawgiver. Now theſe two, <hi>thou ſhalt not commit adultery,</hi> and <hi>thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> were ſo ſpoken: And may not one add to the ſame propoſition, but this, <hi>thou ſhalt ſanctify the Sabbath,</hi> was ſo ſpoken, &amp; ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. Therefore if thou keep all the reſt and break this, thou art a tranſgreſſor. It is therefore from this place clearly manifeſt, that the fourth Commandment as well as any other point of the Law is now in force.</p>
            <p>There is one Argument that has ſome ſhew of weight, which ſome make uſe of to overthrow this truth of the perpetuity of the fourth Commandment, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That by our practice we declare our ſelves now not bound to do the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in this Precept, nay that we are 
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003659_0023_10023F665916C678"/>
bound not to do it; Inaſmuch as our Sabbath is not the Seventh, but the Highth from the Creation. To which it may be Anſwered.</p>
            <p>That this Fourth Commandment does not require us to Reſt, and Sanctify the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, from the Creation, nor from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther period of Time, but alone the Seventh Day after Six of Labour, or coming betwixt Six of Labour; in a ſetled Courſe of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering from any Period that God ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point; and ſo in the meaning of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, we now do, and ever muſt Reſt the Seventh Day: For that is the Seventh in order of numbering, which doth ſtill come betwixt Six, having Six before it, and Six after it continually, &amp; ſo our Day of Reſt hath, and therefore we alſo Reſt the Seventh Day. It is true indeed the Period, from which the Chriſtian Church taketh the beginning of her Account is not the ſame, but another different from that which was the beginning of the Jewiſh Account; for they reckoned from the beginning of the Creation, &amp; ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: We from the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and ſo forward; but ours is as truely and ſurely the Seventh, as theirs, tho' reckoned from another Period; and as to the Period, from whence the account muſt be made, we have no word at all of it in this Precept. The Law-giver ſaith not, Six Days from the 
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003659_0024_10023F68D0701588"/>
Creation thouſhalt labour, &amp; the ſeventh from the Creation is the Sabbath of the Lord, in it thou ſhalt do no work: but, Six days ſhalt thou labour: And he faith not afterwards, The Lord bleſſed and ſanctified the ſeventh day from the Creation, but the Sabbath day, that is the ſeventh after ſix of labour Indeed the Lord by a ſpecial inſtitution giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 2. 1. had for the times before Chriſt appointed that they ſhould reckon from the Creation, which was the cauſe of the ſpecial inſtitution, but this is no part of the Commandment; and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod from which we take the beginning of our account hath as Divine and as Special an Inſtitution, as ſhall appear anon.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>The denial of the Change of the Sabbath, from the Laſt to the Firſt day of the Week, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel is a ſtrange Doctrine</hi>: And the falſhood of this may appear from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars.</p>
            <p>(1) <hi>We have ſever ai intimctions of this change of the Day in the Old Teſtiment.</hi> The Jewiſh Sabbath was the Seventh in order from the Creation, and ſo the one immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it was the eighth day in the ſame order of reckoning; now let us but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what ſpecial regard was had to an eighth day under the legal diſpenſation, 
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003659_0025_10023F6B2E1689C8"/>
and ſee what may to our preſent purpoſe be deduced from it; and we find Circumoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was to be performed on the eighth day, <hi>Gen</hi> 17 12. The firſtlings of the ſlocks and berds were to be ſeven days with the dam, and on the eighth day to be given to God. In cleanſing the Leproſy, the perſon was to carry out of his Tent ſeven days, and on the eighth day he was to come and offer his gifts according to divine Inſtitution, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. 10. So at the feaſt of In-gathering, on the firſt day was to be a Sabbath, and on the eighth day a Sabbath, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 39. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which we may particularly remark both the numbers as holding forth a Sabbath to some, which ſhould be both the firſt &amp; the eighth day, the firſt in the weekly account, and the eighth, as following the ſeventh which was the Jewiſh Sabbath. But to come to that which is yet more plain, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. 12, <hi>to</hi> 36. we have the manner of the leaſt of Tabernacles, during ſeven days and the particular offerings of every day, then in <hi>v.</hi> 35. we find that the eighth day was a great holiday; now as the offering referred to Chriſt as the ſubſtance, why not this eighth day alſo? the whole intimating to us, that after the Meſſiah ſhould offer up Himſelf once for all, the eighth day, <hi>i. e.</hi> the day after the ſeventh which was the <hi>J</hi>ewiſh 
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003659_0026_10023F6CB968F9C8"/>
Sabbath, ſhould be the Day whereon ſhould be a ſolemn Aſſembly. Again farther, Our bleſſed Saviour calls himſelf the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and he was no doubt prefigured by it; now we find in 2 Chron 7. 8. that <hi>Solomon kept the feaſt of dedication ſeven days,</hi> and in ver. 9. <hi>On the eighth day they made a ſolemn aſſembly</hi>; intimating that when Chriſt, the true Temple, ſhould by his own power be raiſed up, then the eighth day, <hi>i. e.</hi> the day after the Jewiſh ſeventh, ſhould be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that not only once but continually, as we ſee in the Ordinance of the new Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Ezek. 43. 27. <hi>And when theſe days are expired, it ſhall be that on the eighth day and ſo forward, the prieſts ſhall make their burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on the altar.</hi> Thus alſo in the reſtoring of Religion to its primitive purity under the reign of good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the Prieſts on a firſt eighth day ſanctify the Porch, and on a ſecond eighth day made an end of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Lord's houſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 17. And ſo Chriſt the true Temple ſanctified himſelf, and compleatly finiſhed his work on an eighth day, <hi>i. e.</hi> the day after the Jewiſh Seventh-Day-Sabbath. But becauſe this may be looked upon as no concluſive way of arguing (tho' for my own part I cannot ſee what could be held forth or intimated by ſuch a ſpecial regard had to the eighth 
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003659_0027_10023F6E8E3B20A0"/>
day under the Law, if it had not a look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch a change of the Day) I ſhall paſt it, and leave my undigeſted thoughts to the correction of the learned and judicious.</p>
            <p>(2) <hi>We have this change of the Day expreſly mentioned by the Apoſtle,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. where we have theſe things.</p>
            <p>[1] Mention is made of the Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Day-Sabbath, together with one reaſon of its inſtitution, ver. 4. <hi>For he ſpake in a certain place of the ſeventh day on this wiſe, And God did reſt the ſeventh day from all his works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[2] He tells us of <hi>another day</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from the ſeventh day before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that was ſpoken of, <hi>ver.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>[3] He more particularly tells us what day that other day is, namely, the Day wherein Chriſt reſted from his Work, which was the <hi>firſt day of the week,</hi> whereon by his Reſurrection he compleated the Work of Redemption.</p>
            <p>[4] He fairly intimates the appointment of this other Day in commemoration of the Son's reſting; and that by giving us the like reaſon for the appointment of this other (or firſt) Day as there was for the ſeventh; the reaſon of God's appointing the ſeventh day, was his reſting from his Works of Creation; and there is a like reaſon for appointing the firſt day, which was the day of Chriſt's 
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003659_0028_10023F72B36D4880"/>
Reſurrection, namely, the Son of God's reſting from his ſuffering works about man's Redemption, into which reſt he is ſaid to enter, and which we are more rearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to remember, ver. 10. <hi>For he that is entred into his reſt, hath ceaſed from his works, as God did from his.</hi> From all which we may argue thus. If God in his word hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of another day, beſides the ſeventh day Sabbath, &amp; hath expreſly told us what day that is, namely, the Day on which Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe; and hath given the like reaſon for obſerving this day, as he did for that of the ſeventh day Sabbath; then the Sabbath, by God's own appointment, is changed from the day on which God reſted from the work of Creation, to the day on which Chriſt reſted from the work of Redemption, <hi>i.e</hi> from the Seventh to the Firſt day of the Week. But the former is true, as appears by what hath been already obſerved from <hi>Hebrews, chap.</hi> 4. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3) <hi>In the New Teſtament we have one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Day aſcribed to the Lord Chriſt, as his Day in a peculiar manner beyond other days.</hi> Rev. 1. 10. <hi>I was in the ſpirit on the Lord's day.</hi> Now there is but one other phraſe in the New Teſtament like this, and it is in 1 Cor. 11. 20. <hi>This is not to eat the Lord's Supper</hi>: And ſuch as are acquainted with 
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003659_0029_10023F744446A290"/>
the original, know this phraſe to be ſingular like that of the Lord's-Day: It is called the Lord's Supper, as oppoſed unto and contradiſtinguiſhed from that phraſe, <hi>v.</hi> 21. (<hi>his own Supper</hi>) which was not ſet apart from other ſuppers, and common uſe, as this was, and theſe two being by one particular phraſe expreſſed, the one may be eaſily expounded by the other, <hi>viz</hi> That ſome one particular Day is called the Lord's-Day, for the very ſame reaſons for which that particular Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is called the Lord's-Supper, namely, Becauſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and ſet apart this Day to his ſpecial Service and Worſhip (therein diſtinguiſhing it from other days) for the remembring the work of Redemption, and His Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection till he come; as alſo to ſet forth the honour of the Mediator, and that it may be enrolled among the Ordinances of the New Teſtament; for theſe Reaſons then is a particular Day called the Lords-Day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a ſpecial Day, ſet apart for the Lords uſe, of ſpecial Signification, and for a ſpecial End. But now that which remains, is to ſhew what Day this is, or to prove that this is the Firſt day of the Week; in Order to which, Note, that the day here ſpoken of, is a ſpecial Day, then known to the Church; otherwiſe <hi>John</hi> would not have given it ſuch 
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003659_0030_10023F76AF257158"/>
a denomination: It was a Day known ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly to relate to Chriſt, and pointing at ſomething in Chriſt; and that it is the Firſt Day of the Week, may be Cleared thus.</p>
            <p>It muſt be either the firſt Day of the Week, or ſome other, but it is none other, therefore &amp;c. If it be any other, then it muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed one of theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> Either not any particular day of the week, but any ſpecial time of Chriſt's appearing or manifeſting himſelf; or elſe the Jewiſh Sabbath day; now neither of theſe can be meant by the Lord's Day.</p>
            <p>(1) <hi>Not the former</hi>: For ſuch a day of Chriſt's ſpecial appearing not being named here, it would leave the Church at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt uncertainty to know what day was hereby intended; whereas the very ſcope and deſign of mentioning this Day is to point it out from other days; beſides, if it were any ſuch day, it would point at no one day; for there are many times of Chriſt's appearing; or even thus it would moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly point (it at any) to the firſt day of the week, as a day (well known to the Church) whereon Chriſt moſt frequently after his Reſurrection appeared to his Diſciples.</p>
            <p>(2) <hi>Nor the letter,</hi> to wit, the Jewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bach day, as appears,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:003659_0031_10023F78664C3EB8"/>
1. In that it is ever called the Sabbath, and ſtill retained this name in the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Teſtament.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe the Jewiſh Sabbaths were then annulled, <hi>Col</hi> 2. 16. and therefore cannot be called the Lord's Day.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe this phraſe (the Lord's Day) in the New Teſtament, looks to Chriſt as having its name ſome way from him, which cannot be ſaid of the Jewiſh Sabbaths: It points at an ordinance of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereas the Jewiſh Sabbaths had reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to Old Teſtament ordinances. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains therefore that it muſt be the firſt day of the week, for no other can lay claim to it; and this will ſtill farther appear if we compare it with Hebrews 4, the practice of the Apoſtles, and after them of the ancient Fathers.</p>
            <p>(1) <hi>Compare it with that in Heb. ch.</hi> 4. here we have a particular Day, which is peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly called the Lord's Day, and there we are told of another day diſtinct from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day ſpoken of, and clearly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a peculiar reference unto Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that Day on which he entered into his reſt, which was the firſt day of the week; Now if in one place a day be peculiarly called the Lord's, and in another place we are informed that the firſt day of the week

            <p>(2) <hi>Let us conſult the Practiſe of the Apoſtles in this matter.</hi> And in <hi>Joh.</hi> 20 19 we read of the Diſciples being aſſembled together on <hi>the firſt day of the week,</hi> and that Jeſus then came amongſt them; and that eight days after they met again, which was <hi>another Firſt day,</hi> and Jeſus came to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. From which time it was ſet apart for the Lord &amp; His Worſhip in the practiſe of the Church.

Farther we are not allowed to try the Word by any ſpirit, but we are enjoined to try the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits by the Word, and if they agree not with this there is no truth in them; and it is only to ſuch as walk according to the rule of the Word that the Apoſtle hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Peace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 16.

            </p>
            <p>V. Strange Doctrine is, <hi>To hold a ſtate of ſinleſs Perfection attainable in this life.</hi> This is contrary to the daily experience of the moſt holy men alive, to the poſitive declarations both of Old &amp; New Teſtament Saints, and to the expreſs Word of God, which declares, That the righteous man falls ſeven (i.e. <hi>often</hi>) times a day; That there is no man liveth and ſinneth not; and that, In many things we offend all. It cannot be preſumed, that any of theſe perſons (who plead for ſuch a Perfection) will dare to aſſert themſelves more Holy than <hi>Paul</hi>; and tho' we ſhould for once anſwer ſpiritual Fools according to their folly, and allow them to be full as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>Paul</hi> was, vet this will not amount to ſuch a ſinleſs Perfection; unleſs they, by their inward light, contrary to Scripture, 
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:003659_0040_10023F8A355E6A20"/>
know what <hi>Paul</hi> was better than he did himſelf; for he fully diſclaims Perfection, in <hi>Phil</hi> 312 and plainly declares Perfection to be reſerved to a future State 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9, 10, 12.</p>
            <p>VI. Strange Doctrine is, <hi>To hold total and final apoſtaſy <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> true Grace</hi> This is a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine wholly inconſiſtent with the nature of Divine Love which is as immutable as God Himſelf (Joh. 13 1 <hi>Whom he loves he loves to the end</hi>) It is contrary to the nature of the Covenant of Grace, which is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13 20. It oppoſes the Promiſe of God the Father to Chriſt. Iſai 53 10 <hi>He ſhall ſee his ſeed.</hi> It deſtroys the nature and efficacy of Chriſt's Interceſſion which is perpetual, <hi>Heb</hi> 7. 25. It oppoſes and contradicts the Promiſe of God the Father, who hath declared, that He will never leave them nor forſake them; but keep them by his Power thro' Faith unto Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13 5 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. It is contrary to the expreſs declaration of God the Son, that none ſhall pluck them out of his Hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 21. It caſts the moſt horrid reflection on the Truth, Power, and Wiſdom of God. And it is wholly deſtructive of the comfort of the Children of God. Nay it is at open wars with the laſt mentioned Error. What a dreadful deluſion muſt that Creature be

            <p>VII. Gtrange Doctrine is, <hi>To hold that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man learning is not a neceſſary qualification of a Goſpel Miniſter.</hi> This is to be wiſe above what is written, and is a baſe reflection on the Infinite Wiſdom of God, who hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accounted it neceſſary. Where can an inſtance be given of one perſon employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God in this Work, without this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification? If they had it not in an ordinary way, did not God Himſelf give it in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way, when he called &amp; ſent them <hi>Act.</hi> 2? And were it not for Human Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where would theſe Perſons been to ſeek for the Scripture? How could they had it in their own Mother's Tongue?</p>
            <p>VIII. Strange Doctrine is, <hi>For private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to hold it lawful for them to Preach and Adminiſter the Sacraments of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> I hope theſe Perſons will not dare to deny the neceſſity of a Call and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to this Work, and that from God Himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15 Now if their Call be extraordinary, let them give the
