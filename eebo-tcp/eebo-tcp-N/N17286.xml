            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MY DEAR FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF either I or my labours have any thing of public uſe or worth, it is wholly (though not only) yours. And I am convinced by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that it is the will of <hi>GOD</hi> it ſhould be ſo. This I clearly diſcerned in my firſt coming to you, in my former abode with you, and in the time of my forced abſence from you. When I was ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the miſeries of the late unhappy war, I durſt not ſix in any other congregation, but lived in a military unpleaſing ſtate, leſt I ſhould foreſtal my return to you. The offers of greater worldly accommodations were no temptatied to me once to queſtion whether I ſhould have you: your free invitation of my return, your ceedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> to my doctrine, the ſtrong affection which I have yet towards you above all people, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hearly return of love which I find from you, do all perſuade me, that I was ſent into the world eſpecially for the ſervice of your ſend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:022331_0003_0FB7F48C1501BF20"/>and that even when I am dead, I might be yet a help to your ſalvation, the <hi>LORD</hi> hath forced me, quite beſide my own reſolution, to write thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> treatiſe, and leave it in your hands. It was far from my thoughts ever to have become thus pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and burdened the world with any writing of mine: therefore have I often reſiſted the requeſt of my reverend brethren, and ſome ſuperiors, who might elſe have commanded much more at my hands. But ſee how <hi>GOD</hi> over-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>leth and croſſeth our reſolutions!</p>
            <p>Being in my quarters far from home, caſt into extreme languiſhing (by the ſudden loſs of about a gallon of blood, after many years fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going weakneſs) and having no acquaintance about me, nor any book but my Bible, and living in continual expectation of death, I bent my thoughts on my everlaſting reſt: and becauſe my memory, through extreme weakneſs, was imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, I took my pen, and began to draw up my own funeral ſermon, or ſome help for my own meditations of heaven, to ſweeten both the reſt of my life, and my death. In this condition <hi>GOD</hi> was pleaſed to continue me about five months from home; where being able for nothing elſe, I went on with this work, which lengthened to this which you here ſee. It is no wonder therefore if I be too abrupt in the beginning, ſeeing I then
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:022331_0004_0FB7F48DB2CC5560"/>intended but the length of a ſermon or two. Much leſs may you wonder if the whole be very imperfect, ſeeing it was written as it were with one foot in the grave, by a man that was betwixt the living and dead, that wanted ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to quicken invention or affection, and had no book but his Bible, while the chief part was finiſhed. But how ſweet is this Providence now to my review, which ſo happily forced me to that work of meditation, which I had formerly found ſo profitable to my ſoul! and ſhewed me more mercy in depriving me of other helps, than I was aware of! and hath cauſed my thoughts to feed on this heavenly ſubject, which hath more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited me than all the ſtudies of my life.</p>
            <p>And now, dear friends, ſuch as it is, I here offer it you; and upon the knees of my ſoul, I offer up my thanks to the merciful <hi>GOD,</hi> who hath fetched up both me and it, as from the grave for your ſervice: who reverſed the ſentence of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent death, which by the ableſt phyſicians was paſt upon me! who interrupted my public labours for a time, that he might trace me to do you a more laſting ſervice, which elſe I had never been like to have attempted! That <hi>GOD</hi> do I heartily bleſs and magnify, who hath reſened me from the many dangers of four years war, and after ſo many tedious nights and days, and ſo many doleful
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:022331_0005_0FB7F48FD6FFCD58"/>ſights and tidings, hath returned me, and many of yourſelves, and reprieved us now to ſerve him in peace! And though men be ungrateful, and my body ruined beyond hope of recovery; yet he hath made up all in the comforts I have in you. To the <hi>GOD</hi> of mercy I do here offer up my moſt hearty thanks, who hath not rejected my prayers, but hath by a wonder delivered me in the midſt of my duties: and hath ſupported me theſe four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years in a languiſhing ſtate, wherein I have ſcarce had a waking hour free from pain; who hath above twenty ſeveral times delivered me when I was near death. And though he hath made me ſpend my days in groans and tears, and in a conſtant expectation of my change, yet he hath not wholly diſabled me for his ſervice; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hath more effectually ſubdued my pride, and made this world contemptible to me, and forced my dull heart to more importunate requeſts, and occaſioned more rare diſcoveries of his mercy than ever I could have expected in a proſperous ſtate.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> This Reſt defined.</head>
               <p>IT was not only our intereſt in GOD, and actual fruition of him, which was loſt in <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall; but all ſpiritual knowledge of him, and true diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards ſuch a felicity. Man hath now an heart too ſuitable to his eſtate; a low ſtate, and a low ſpirit. As the poor man that would not believe that any one man had ſuch a ſum as an hundred pounds, it was ſo far above what he poſſeſſed: ſo man will hardly now believe, that there is ſuch an happineſs as once he had, much leſs as <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath now procured.</p>
               <p>The apoſtle beſtows moſt of this epiſtle in proving to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the end of all ceremonies and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, is to direct them to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the ſubſtance; and that the reſt of ſabbaths, and <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſhould teach them to look for a future reſt. My text is his concluſion after divers arguments to that end; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022331_0007_0FB7F493E95B3438"/>ſo uſeful to a believer, as containing the ground of all his comforts, the end of all his duty and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that you may eaſily be ſatisfied, why I have made in the ſubject of my preſent diſcourſe. What more welcome to men under afflictions, than reſt? What more welcome news to men under public calamities? Hearers, I pray GOD your entertainment of it, be but half anſwerable to the excellency of the ſubject; and then you will have cauſe to bleſs GOD, while you live, that ever you heard it, as I have that ever I ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died it.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee,
<list>
                     <item>1. What this reſt is.</item>
                     <item>2. What theſe people of GOD, and why ſo called.</item>
                     <item>3. The truth of this from other ſcripture-arguments.</item>
                     <item>4. Why this reſt muſt yet remain.</item>
                     <item>5. Why only to the people of GOD.</item>
                     <item>6. What uſe to make of it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And though the ſenſe of the text includes in the word <hi>reſt,</hi> all that eaſe and ſafety which a ſoul, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the burden of ſin and ſuffering, and purſued by law, wrath and conſcience, hath with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in this life, the reſt of grace: yet becauſe it chiefly intends the reſt of eternal glory, I ſhall conſine my diſcourſe to this.</p>
               <p>The reſt here in queſtion, is, the moſt happy eſtate of a chriſtian, having obtained the end of his courſe; or, it is the perfect endleſs fruition of GOD by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ſaints, according to the meaſure of their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, to which their ſouls arrive at death: and both ſoul and body moſt fully after the reſurrection and final judgment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I call it the eſtate of a chriſtian, to note both the active and paſſive fruition, wherein a chriſtian's bleſſedneſs lies, and the eſtabliſhed continuance of both. Our title will be perfect, and perfectly clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022331_0008_0FB7F4955E56C4F8"/>ourſelves, and ſo our capacity perfected; our poſſeſſion and ſecurity for its perpetuity perfect; our reception from GOD perfect; and therefore our fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of him, and conſequently our happineſs, will then be perfect. And this is the eſtate which we now briefly mention, and ſhall afterwards more fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I call it the moſt happy eſtate, to difference it not only from all ſeeming happineſs which is to be found in the enjoyment of creatures, but alſo from all thoſe beginnings, foretaſtes, and imperfect degrees which we have in this life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I call it the eſtate of a chriſtian, where I mean only the ſincere, regenerate, ſanctified chriſtian, whoſe ſoul having diſcovered that excellency in GOD through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> cloſeth with him, and is cordially ſet upon him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I add, That this happineſs conſiſts in obtaining the end, where I mean the ultimate and principal end, not any ſubordinate or leſs principal end. O how much doth our everlaſting ſtate depend on our right judgment and eſtimation of our end!</p>
               <p>But it is a doubt with many, whether the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this glory may be our end? Nay, concluded, that it is mercenary: yea, that to make ſalvation the end of duty, is to be a Legaliſt, and act under a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, whoſe tenor is, <hi>Do this and live.</hi> And mony that think it may be our end, yet think it may not be our ultimate end; for that ſhould be only the glory of GOD. I ſhall anſwer theſe briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is properly called mercenary, when we expect it as wages for work done; and ſo we may not make it our end. Otherwiſe it is only ſuch a mercinarineſs as <hi>Chriſt</hi> commandeth. For conſider what this end
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022331_0009_0FB7F4968BD870B0"/>is; it is the fruition of GOD in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and if ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chriſt</hi> be mercenary, I deſire to be ſo mercenary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not a note of a Legaliſt neither. It hath been the ground of a multitude of late miſtakes in divinity, to think, that <hi>Do this and live,</hi> is only the language of the covenant of works. It is true, in ſome ſenſe it is; but in other, not. The law of works only ſaith, <hi>Do this</hi> (that is, perfectly fulfil the whole law) <hi>and live,</hi> (that is, for ſo doing): But the law of grace ſaith, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> too: that is, believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſeek him, obey him ſincerely, as thy LORD and King: forſake all, ſuffer all things, and overcome, and by ſo doing, or in ſo doing, you ſhall live. If you ſet up the abrogated duties of the law again, you are a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galiſt: if you ſet up the duties of the goſpel in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſtead, in whole or in part, you err ſtill. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath his place and work; duty hath its place and work too: ſet it but in its own place, and expect from it but its own part, and you go right: yea, more, (how unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury ſoever the phraſe may ſeem) you may, ſo far as this comes to, truſt to your duty and works; that is, for their own part: and many miſcarry in expecting nothing from them, (as to pray, and to expect nothing the more) that is, from <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a way of duty. For if duty have no ſhare, why may we not truſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> as well in a way of diſobedience as duty? In a word, you muſt both uſe and truſt duty in ſubordination to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but neither uſe them nor truſt them in co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination with him. So that this derogates nothing from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for he hath done, and will do all his work perfectly, and enableth his people to do theirs: yet he is not properly ſaid to do it himſelf; he believes not, repents not, but worketh theſe in them; that is, enableth and exciteth them to it. No man muſt look for more from duty than GOD hath laid upon it; and ſo much we may and muſt.</p>

2. If I ſhould quote all the ſcriptures that plainly prove this, I ſhould tranſcribe a great part of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: I will therefore only deſire you to ſtudy what to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable interpretation can be given of the following places, which will not prove that life and ſalvation may be, yea, muſt be the end of duty. <hi>John</hi> v. 40. <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</hi> Matt. xi. 12. <hi>The kingdom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi> Matt. vii. 13. Luke xiii. 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate.</hi> Phil. ii. 12. <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> Rom. ii. 7, 10. <hi>To them who by patient continuance in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. Glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good.</hi> 1 Cor. ix. 24. <hi>So run that ye may obtain.</hi> 2 Tim. ii. 12. <hi>If we ſuffer with him, we ſhall reign with him.</hi> 1 Tim. vi. 12. <hi>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life.</hi> 1 Tim. vi. 18, 19. <hi>That they do good works, laying up a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</hi> Rev. xxii. 14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and enter in by the gates into the city.</hi> Matt. xxv. 34, 35, 36. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For I was an hungred, and ye,</hi> &amp;c. Luke xi. 28. <hi>Bleſſed are they that hear the word of</hi> GOD, <hi>and keep it.</hi> Yea, the eſcaping of hell is a right end of duty to a believer. Heb. iv. 1. <hi>Let us fear, left a promiſe being left us of entering into his reſt, any of you ſhould come ſhort of it.</hi> Luke xii. 5. <hi>Fear him that is able to deſtroy both ſoul and body in hell; yea,</hi> (whatſoever others ſay) <hi>I ſay unto you, fear him.</hi> 1 Cor. ix. 27. <hi>I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection; leſt, when I have preached to others, I myſelf ſhould he a caſt-away.</hi> Multitudes of ſcriptures and ſcripture-arguments might be brought, but theſe may ſuffice to any that believe ſcripture.</p>

3. For thoſe that think this reſt may be our end, but not our ultimate end, that muſt be GOD's glory only: I will not gainſay them. Only let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, <hi>What</hi> GOD <hi>hath joined, man muſt not ſeparate.</hi> The glorifying himſelf, and the ſaving of his people, (as I judge) are not two ends with GOD, but one; to glorify his mercy in their falvation: ſo I think they ſhould be with us together intended: we ſhould aim at the glory of GOD (not alone conſidered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our ſalvation, but) in our ſalvation. Therefore I know no warrant for putting ſuch a queſtion to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as ſome do, whether we could be content to be damned, ſo GOD were glorified? <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath put no ſuch queſtions to us, nor bid us put ſuch to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Chriſt</hi> had rather that men would enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their true willingneſs to be ſaved than their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to be damned. Sure I am, <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf is offered to faith, in terms for the moſt part reſpecting the welfare of the ſinner, more than his own abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed glory. He would be received as a Saviour, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, redeemer, reconciler, and interceſſor. And all the precepts of ſcripture being backed with ſo many promiſes and threatnings, every one intended of GOD, as a motive to us, imply as much.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I call a chriſtian's happineſs, the end of his courſe, thereby meaning, as <hi>Paul.</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 7. the whole ſcope of his life. For ſalvation may and muſt be our end; and not only the end of our faith, (tho' that principally) but of all our actions: For as what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we do, muſt be done to the glory of GOD, ſo muſt they all be done to our ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I make happineſs to conſiſt in this end obtained; for it is not the mere promiſe of it that immediately makes perfectly happy, nor <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s mere purchaſe, nor our mere ſeeking, but the apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obtaining, which ſets the crown on the ſaint's head.</p>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A perſon in motion, ſeeking reſt. This is man here in the way: angels have it already; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are paſt hope.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An end towards which he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>th for reſt. This can be only GOD. He that taketh any thing elſe for happineſs, is out of the way the firſt ſtep. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal damning ſin, is, to make any thing beſides GOD our end or reſt. And the firſt true ſaving act, is, to chooſe GOD only for our end and happineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A diſtance is pre-ſuppoſed from this end, elſe there can be no motion towards it. This ſad diſtance is the caſe of all mankind ſince the fall: it was our GOD that we principally loſt, and were ſhut out of his gracious preſence; and ſince are ſaid to be <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him in the world:</hi> nay, in all men, at age, here is ſuppoſed, not only a diſtance, but alſo a contrary motion. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes with regenerating, ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, he finds no man ſitting ſtill, but all poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eternal ruin; till, by conviction, he firſt brings them to a ſtand, and by converſion, turns firſt their hearts, and then their lives, to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:022331_0013_0FB7F4ADA43AA880"/>
4. Here is pre-ſuppoſed the knowledge of the true ultimate end, and its excellency; and a ſerious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it. For ſo the motion of the rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proceedeth: an unknown end, is no end; it is a contradiction. We cannot make that our end, which we know not; nor that our chief end which we know not, or judge not to be the chief good. Therefore where this is not known, that GOD is this end; there is no obtaining reſt in any ordinary way, whatſoever may be in ways that by GOD are kept ſecret.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Here is pre-ſuppoſed, not only a diſtance from this reſt, but alſo the true knowledge of this diſtance. If a man have loſt his way, and know it not, he ſeeks not to return: therefore they that never knew they were without GOD, never yet enjoyed him; and they that never knew they were actually in the way to hell, did never yet know the way to heaven: nay, there will not only be a knowledge of this diſtance, and loſt eſtate, but affections anſwerable. Can a man find himſelf on the brink of hell, and not tremble? Or find he hath loſt his GOD, and his ſoul, and not cry out, <hi>I am undone!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Here is alſo pre-ſuppoſed, a ſuperior moving cauſe, elſe ſhould we all ſtand ſtill, and not move a ſtep forward toward our reſt; no more than the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior wheels in the watch would ſtir, if you take away the ſpring, or the firſt mover. This is GOD. If GOD move us not, we cannot move. Therefore it is a moſt neceſſary part of our chriſtian wiſdom, to keep our ſubordination to GOD, and dependance on him; to be ſtill in the path where he walks, and in that way where his Spirit doth moſt uſually move.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Here is pre-ſuppoſed, an internal principle of life in the perſon. GOD moves not man like a ſtone, but by enduing him firſt with life, (not to enable him
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022331_0014_0FB7F4AE99B84A20"/>to move without GOD, but) thereby to qualify him to move himſelf, in ſubordination to GOD, the firſt mover.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Here is pre-ſuppoſed alſo, ſuch a motion as is rightly ordered and directed toward the end. Not all motion or labour brings to reſt. Every way leads not to this end; but he whoſe goodneſs hath appointed the end, hath in his wiſdom, and by his ſovereign authority, appointed the way. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the door, the only way to this reſt. Some will allow nothing elſe to be called the way, leſt it derogate from <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The truth is, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the only way to the Father: yet faith is the way to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and goſpel-obedience, or faith and works, the way for thoſe to walk in, that are in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. There is ſuppoſed alſo, a ſtrong and conſtant motion, which may reach the end. The lazy world, that think all too much, will find this to their coſt one day: they that think leſs ado might have ſerved, do but reproach <hi>Chriſt</hi> for making us ſo much to do. They that have been moſt holy, watchful, painful to get to heaven, find, when they come to die, all too little: we ſee daily the beſt chriſtians, when dying, repent their negligence: I never knew any then repent his holineſs and diligence. It would grieve a man's ſoul to ſee a multitude of miſtaken ſinners lay out their care and pains for a thing of nought, and think to have eternal ſalvation with a wiſh. If the way to heaven be not far harder than the world imagines. <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his apoſtles knew not the way: for they have told us, <hi>That the kingdom of heaven ſuffereth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; that the gate is ſtrait, and the way nar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>

I have ſeen this doctrine alſo thrown by with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by others, who ſay, What! do ye ſet us a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for heaven? Doth our duty do any thing? Hath not <hi>Chriſt</hi> done all? Is not this to make him an half Saviour, and to preach the law?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is to preach the law of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> his ſubjects are not lawleſs: it is to preach duty to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> None a more exact requirer of duty or hater of ſin, than <hi>Chriſt. Chriſt</hi> hath done, and will do, all his work; and therefore is a perfect Saviour: but yet leaves us a work too: he hath paid all the price, and left us none to pay; yet he never intended his purchaſe ſhould put us into abſolute title to glory, in point of law, much leſs into immediate poſſeſſion. He hath purchaſed the crown to beſtow, only on condition of believing, denying all for him, ſuffering with him, perſevering and overcoming. He hath purchaſed juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to beſtow, only on condition of believing, yea, repenting and believing: though it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> that enableth alſo to perform the condition. It is not a ſaviour offered, but received alſo, that muſt ſave: it is not the blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhed only, but applied alſo, that muſt fully deliver; nor is it applied to the juſtification or ſalvation of a ſleepy ſoul. Nor doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> carry us to heaven in a chair of ſecurity. Our righteouſneſs, which the law of works requireth, and by which it is ſatisfied, is wholly in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not one grain in ourſelves: nor muſt we dare to think of patching up a legal righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s and our own together; that is, that our doings can be the lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t part of ſatisfaction for our ſins. But yet ourſelves moſt perſonally fulfil the conditions of the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and ſo have the perfect evangelical righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> never be ſaved by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s righteouſneſs. Therefore ſay not, it is not duty, but <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a way of duty. As duty cannot do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not do it without duty.</p>

And as this motion muſt be ſtrong, ſo muſt it be conſtant, or it will fall ſhort of reſt. To begin in the ſpirit, and end in the fleſh, will not bring to the end of the ſaints. Men as holy as the beſt of us, have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len off. Read but the promiſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> ii. and iii. <hi>To him that overcometh. Chriſt</hi>'s own diſciples muſt be commanded to continue in his love, and that by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his commandments: and to abide in him, and his word in them. See <hi>John</hi> xv. 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> What this Reſt containeth.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THERE is contained in this Reſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A ceſſation from motion or action. Not from all action, but of that which implies the abſence of the end. When we have obtained the haven, we have done ſailing: when we are at our journey's end, we have done with the way. Therefore propheſying ceaſeth, tongues fail, and knowledge ſhall be done away; that is, ſo far as it was imperfect. There ſhall be no more prayer, becauſe no more neceſſity, but the full enjoyment of what we prayed for. Neither ſhall we need to faſt, and weep and watch any more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the reach of ſin and temptations. Nor will there be uſe for inſtructions and exhortations: preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is done: the miniſtry of man ceaſeth: ſacraments uſeleſs: the labourers called in, becauſe the harveſt is gathered: the unregenerate paſt hope, the ſaints paſt fear, for-ever. Much leſs ſhall there be any need of labouring for inferior ends, as here we do; ſeeing they ſhall all devolve themſelves into the ocean of the ultimate end, and the leſſer good be ſwallowed up in the greateſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:022331_0017_0FB7F4B40E014FD8"/>
2. This reſt containeth a perfect freedom from all the evils that accompany us through our courſe, and which neceſſarily follow our abſence from the chief good: beſides our freedom from thoſe eternal flames, which the neglecters of <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt endure. There is no ſuch a thing as grief and ſorrow known there: nor is there ſuch a thing as a pale face, a languid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, feeble joints, unable infancy, decripid age, pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant humours, painful ſickneſs, griping fears, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming care, nor whatſoever deſerves the name of evil. Indeed a gale of groans and ſighs, a ſtream of tears, accompanied us to the very gates, and there bid us farewell for-ever. <hi>We did weep and lament, when the world did rejoice; but our ſorrow is turned into joy, and our joy ſhall no man take from us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This reſt containeth the higheſt degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, both of ſoul and body. This qualifies them to enjoy the glory, and thoroughly to partake the ſweetneſs of it. Were the glory never ſo great, and themſelves not made capable of it, it would be little to them. But the more perfect the appetite, the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the food. The more muſical the ear, the more pleaſant the melody. The more perfect the ſoul, the more joyous thoſe joys, and the more glorious is that glory. Nor is it only ſinful imperfection that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, nor only that which is the fruit of ſin, but that which adhered to us in our pure nature. There is far more procured by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than was loſt by <hi>Adam.</hi> It is the miſery of wicked men here, that all without them is mercy, but within them an heart full of ſin, ſhuts the door againſt all, and makes them but the more miſerable. When all is well within, then all is well indeed. Therefore will GOD, as a ſpecial part of his ſaints happineſs, perfect themſelves as well as their condition.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:022331_0018_0FB7F4B9ABFD13F0"/>
4. This reſt containeth, as the principal part, our neareſt fruition of GOD. As all good whatſoever is compriſed in GOD, and all in the creature are but drops of this ocean; ſo all the glory of the bleſſed is compriſed in their enjoyment of GOD: and if there be any mediate joys there, they are but drops from this. If men and angels ſhould ſtudy to ſpeak the bleſſedneſs of the eſtate, in one word, what can they ſay beyond this, That it is the neareſt enjoyment of GOD? Say, They have GOD; and you ſay, they have all that is worth the having. O the full joys offered to a believer in that one ſentence of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s! I would not for all the world that verſe had been left out of the bible; <hi>Father, I will, that thoſe whom thou haſt given Me, be with Me where I am, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my glory, which thou haſt given me,</hi> John xvii. 24. Every word is full of life and joy. If the queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> had cauſe to ſay of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s glory, <hi>Happy are thy men, happy are theſe thy ſervants that ſtand continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before thee, and that hear thy wiſdom;</hi> then ſure they that ſtand continually before GOD, and ſee his glory, and the glory of the Lamb, are ſomewhat more than happy; to them will CHRIST <hi>give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midſt of the paradiſe of</hi> GOD, <hi>Rev.</hi> ii. 7.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This reſt containeth a ſweet and conſtant action of all the powers of the ſoul and body in this fruition of GOD. But great will the change of our bodies and ſenſes be; even ſo great, as now we cannot conceive. If grace makes a chriſtian differ ſo much from what he was, that the chriſtian could ſay to his companion, <hi>Ego non ſum ego: I am not the man I was;</hi> how much more will glory make us differ? We may then ſay much more, This is not the body I had, and theſe are not the ſenſes I had. Yet becauſe we have no other name for them, let us call them ſenſes; call them eyes and ears, ſeeing and hearing: but conceive, that as
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022331_0019_0FB7F4C018EAFF70"/>much as a body ſpiritual, above the ſun in glory, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth theſe frail, noiſome, diſeaſed lumps of fleſh, that we now carry about us; ſo far ſhall our ſenſes of ſeeing and hearing exceed theſe we now poſſeſs: for the change of the ſenſes muſt be conceived proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the change of the body. And doubtleſs as GOD advanceth our ſenſe, and enlargeth our capacity; ſo will He advance the happineſs of thoſe ſenſes, and fill up with himſelf all that capacity. And certainly the body ſhould not be raiſed up, if it ſhould not ſhare in the glory: for as it hath ſhared in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſufferings, ſo ſhall it alſo do in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs: and as <hi>Chriſt</hi> bought the whole man, ſo ſhall the whole partake of the everlaſting benefits of the purchaſe.</p>
               <p>And if the body ſhall be thus employed, O how ſhall the ſoul be taken up! As its powers and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities are greateſt, ſo its actions are ſtrongeſt, and its enjoyments ſweeteſt. As the bodily ſenſes have their proper aptitude and action, whereby they receive and enjoy their objects; ſo doth the ſoul in its own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, enjoy its own object: by knowing, by thinking, and remembering, by loving, and by delightful joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: by theſe eyes it ſees, and by theſe arms it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth. If it might be ſaid of the diſciples with <hi>Chriſt</hi> on earth, much more that behold him in his glory, <hi>Bleſſed are the eyes that ſee the things that you ſee, and the ears that hear the things that you hear: for many princes and great ones have d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Knowledge of itſelf is very deſirable. As far as the rational ſoul exceeds the ſenſitive, ſo far the delights of a philoſopher, in diſcovering the ſecrets of nature, and knowing the myſtery of ſciences, exceeds the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the glutton, the drunkard, and of all volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

What would I not give, ſo that all the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain principles in logic, natural philoſophy, metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and medicine, were but certain? And that my dull, obſcure notions of them, were but quick and clear? O what then would I not perform, or part with, to enjoy a clear and true apprehenſion of the moſt true GOD! How noble a faculty of the ſoul is the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding! It can compaſs the earth; it can meaſure the ſun, moon, ſtars, and heaven; it can foreknow each eclipſe to a minute, many years before: yea, but this is the top of all its excellency, it can know GOD, who is infinite, who made all theſe; a little here, and much more hereafter. O the wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our bleſſed LORD! he hath created the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with a natural bias to truth, and its object; and to the prime truth as its prime object: and leſt we ſhould turn aſide to any creature, he hath kept this as his own divine prerogative, not communicable to any creature, <hi>viz.</hi> to be the prime truth.</p>

Believe me, chriſtians, yea, believe GOD; you that have known moſt of GOD in <hi>Chriſt</hi> here, it is as nothing to that you ſhall, know; it ſcarce, in compariſon of that, deſerves to be called knowledge. The difference betwixt our knowledge now, and our knowledge then, will be as great as that between our fleſhly bodies now, and our ſpiritual bodies then. For as theſe bodies, ſo that knowledge muſt ceaſe, that a more perfect may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Our ſilly childiſh thoughts of GOD, which now is the higheſt we can reach to, muſt give place to a more manly knowledge.</p>
               <p>Marvel not, therefore, how it can be <hi>life eternal to know God and his Son</hi> Jeſus Chriſt: to enjoy GOD and his <hi>Chriſt</hi> is eternal life, and the ſoul's enjoying is in knowing. They that ſavour only of earth, and have no way to judge but by ſenſe, and never were acquainted with this knowledge of GOD, think it a poor happineſs to know GOD. Let them have health and wealth, and worldly delights, and take you the other. Alas, poor men! they that have made trial of both, do not envy your happineſs: O that you would come near, and taſte and try as they have done; and then judge; then continue in your former mind, if you can. For our parts we ſay with that knowing apoſtle, (though the ſpeech may ſeem preſumptuous) 1 <hi>John</hi> v. 19, 20. <hi>We know that we are of</hi> GOD, <hi>and the whole world lieth in wickedneſs: and we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we may know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, in his Son</hi> Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>this is the true God and eternal life. The Son of</hi> GOD <hi>is come</hi> to be our head and fountain of life, <hi>and hath given us an underſtanding,</hi> that the ſoul may be made capable <hi>to know him</hi> (GOD) <hi>that is true,</hi> the prime truth; <hi>and we are</hi> brought ſo near to this enjoyment, that <hi>we

               <p>And doubtleſs the memory will not be idle in this bleſſed work. If it be but by looking back, to help the ſoul to value its enjoyment. Our knowledge will be enlarged, not diminiſhed; therefore the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things paſt ſhall not be taken away. From that height the ſaint can look behind him and before him: and to compare paſt with preſent things, muſt needs raiſe in the bleſſed ſoul an unconceivable ſenſe of its condition. To ſtand on that mount, whence we can ſee the wilderneſs and <hi>Cancan</hi> both at once; to ſtand in heaven, and look back on earth, and weigh them together in the balance, how muſt it tranſport the ſoul, and make it cry out, Is this the purchaſe that coſt ſo dear as the blood of God? O bleſſed price, and thrice bleſſed love! Is this the end of believing? is this the end of the Spirit's workings? have the gales of grace blown me into ſuch an harbour? is it hither that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath inticed my ſoul? O bleſſed way, and thrice bleſſed end! Is this the glory which the ſcriptures ſpoke of, and miniſters preached of ſo much?

               <p>Thus, as the memory of the wicked will eternally promote their torment, to look back on the ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the grace refuſed, <hi>Chriſt</hi> neglected, and time loſt: ſo will the memory of the ſaints for-ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their joys.</p>
               <p>But O the full, the near, the ſweet enjoyment, is that of the affections, love and joy: it is near, for love is the eſſence of the ſoul, and love is the eſſence of GOD. GOD <hi>is love, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the poor ſoul complains, O that I could love <hi>Chriſt</hi> more! but I

Now thou knoweſt little of his amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore loveſt little: then thine eye will affect thy heart, and the continual viewing of that perfect beauty, will keep thee in continual raviſhments of love. Now thy ſalvation is not perfected, nor all the mercies purchaſed, yet given in: but when <hi>the topſtone is ſet on, thou ſhalt with ſhoutings cry, grace, grace.</hi> Chriſtians, doth it now ſtir up your love, to remember all the experiences of his love; to look back upon a life of mercies? doth not kindneſs melt you? and the ſun-ſhine of divine goodneſs warm your frozen hearts? What will it do then, when you ſhall live in love, and have all in him, who is all? O the high delights of love! of this love! the content that the heart findeth in it! the ſatisfaction it brings along with it! ſurely love is both work and wages.</p>
               <p>And if this were all, what a high favour, that GOD will give us leave to love him! that he will vouchſafe to be embraced by ſuch arms that have embraced ſin before him! But this is not all, he returneth love for love; nay, a thouſand times more, as perfect as we ſhall be, we cannot reach his meaſure of love: chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian thou wilt then be brimful of love; yet love as much as thou canſt, thou ſhalt be ten thouſand times more beloved. Doſt thou think thou canſt over-love him? what, love more than love itſelf! were the arms of the Son of GOD open upon the croſs, and an open paſſage made to his heart by the ſpear? and will not arms and heart be open to thee in glory? did he begin to love before thou lovedſt, and will he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue now? did he love thee an enemy? thee a ſinner? thee who even loatheſt thyſelf? and own thee when thou didſt diſclaim thyſelf? and will he not now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurably love thee a ſon? thee a perfect ſaint? thee who returneſt love for love? thou waſt wont injuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

When perfect created love, and moſt perfect uncreated love meet together, O the bleſſed meeting!

The inconceivable complacency which the bleſſed feel in their ſeeing, knowing, lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being beloved of GOD. The delight of the ſenſes here, cannot be known by expreſſions, as they are felt: how much leſs this joy?

All <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ways of mercy tend to, and end in the ſaints joys. He wept, ſorrowed. ſuffered, that they might rejoice: he ſendeth the ſpirit to be their comforter: he multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth promiſes, he diſcovers their future happineſs, that their joy might be full; he aboundeth to them in mercies of all ſorts: <hi>he maketh them lie down in green paſtures, and leadeth them by the ſtill waters;</hi> yea, <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to them the fountain of living waters, that their joy may be full, that they may thirſt no more, and that it may ſpring up in them to everlaſting life:</hi> he cauſeth them to ſuffer, that he may cauſe them to rejoice; and chaſteneth them, that he may give them reſt; and maketh them (as he did himſelf) <hi>to drink of the brook in the way, that they may lift up the head,</hi> Pſalm cx. 7.

And hath the LORD ſuch a care for us here; where, the bridegroom being from us, we muſt mourn? O! what will that joy be, where, the ſoul being perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared for joy, and joy prepared by <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the ſoul, it ſhall be our work, our buſineſs eternally to rejoice?</p>
               <p>And it ſeems the ſaints joy ſhall be greater than the damned's torment: for their torment is the torment of creatures <hi>prepared for the devil and his angels:</hi> but our joy is <hi>the joy of our</hi> LORD, even our LORD'S own joy ſhall we enter. <hi>And the ſame glory which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth him, doth the Son give them,</hi> John xvii. 22. <hi>And to ſit down with him in his throne, even as he is ſet down in his Father's throne,</hi> Rev. iii. 21. Thou that now ſpendeſt thy days in ſorrow, who knoweſt no garments but ſackcloth, no food but the bread and water of afflictions, what ſayeſt thou to this great change? from all ſorrow to more than all joy? Thou poor ſoul, who prayeſt for joy, complaineſt for want of joy, then thou ſhalt have full joy, as much as thou canſt hold, and more than ever thou thoughteſt on, or thy heart deſired.</p>
               <p>And in the meantime walk carefully, watch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and then let GOD meaſure out thy times and degrees of joy. It may be he keeps them till thou haſt more need: thou mayſt better loſe thy comfort, than thy ſafety: as the joy of the hypocrite, ſo the fears of the upright, are but for a moment. <hi>Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</hi> O bleſſed morning! Poor drooping ſoul, how would it fill thee with joy now, if a voice from heaven ſhould aſſure thee of thy part in theſe joys! What then will

Wilt thou not be almoſt ready to draw back, and to ſay, What I, LORD, I, the unworthy neglecter of thy grace! I, the unworthy diſeſteemer of thy blood, and ſlighter of thy love!

               <p>And it is not thy joy only: it is a mutual joy, as well as mutual love: is there ſuch joy in heaven at thy converſion, and will there be none at thy glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?

               <p>Yea, the Father himſelf puts on joy too, in our joy: as we grieve his ſpirit, and weary him with our iniquities; ſo he is rejoiced in our good. O how quickly here doth he ſpy a returning prodigal, even afar off! How doth he run and meet him, fall on his neck, and kiſs him! This is indeed a happy meeting; but nothing to the joy of that laſt and great meeting.</p>
               <p>And now look back upon all this: I ſay to thee as the angel to <hi>John, What haſt thou ſeen?</hi> Or if vet thou perceive not, draw nearer, come up higher, <hi>Come and ſee:</hi> doſt thou fear thou haſt been all this while in a dream?

Come near, and feel: a ſhadow contains not thoſe ſubſtantial bleſſings, nor reſts upon ſuch a ſure word of promiſe, as you have ſeen theſe do. Go thy way now, and tell the diſciples, and tell the drooping ſouls thou meeteſt with, That thou haſt, in this glaſs, ſeen heaven; that <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>indeed is riſen, and hath here appeared to thee;</hi> and behold he is gone before us into reſt; and that he is now preparing a place for them, and will come again, and take them to himſelf, that <hi>where he is, there they may be alſo.</hi>

               <p>But alas! my fearful heart dares ſcarce proceed: methinks I hear the Almighty's voice, ſaying to me, as to <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job xxxviii. 2. <hi>Who is this that darkeneth counſel by words without knowledge?</hi>

               <p>But pardon, O LORD, thy ſervant's ſin: I have not pried into unrevealed things, nor curiouſly ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into thy counſels; but indeed I have diſhonoured thy holineſs, wronged thine excellency, diſgraced thy ſaints glory, by my diſproportionable pourtraying: I will bewail from my heart that my apprehenſions are ſo dull, my thoughts ſo mean, my affections ſo ſtupid, and my expreſſions ſo low. But I have only heard by the hearing of the ear; O let thy ſervant ſee thee, and poſſeſs theſe joys, and then I ſhall have more ſuitable conceivings, and ſhall give thee fuller glory. <hi>I have now uttered that I underſtood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. Yet I believed, and therefore ſpake.</hi> Remember with whom thou haſt to do: what canſt thou expect from duſt, from corruption, but defilement?

               <p n="1">1. And well may the coming of CHRIST be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned with thoſe ingredients that compound this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reſt: for to this end it is intended; and to this end it is of apparent neceſſity. For his people's ſake he ſanctified himſelf to his office: for their ſake he came into the world, ſuffered, died, roſe, aſcended: and for their ſake it is that he will return. To this end will CHRIST come again to receive his people to himſelf, <hi>That where he is, they may be alſo.</hi> John xiv. 3. He that would come to ſuffer, will ſurely come to triumph: and he that would come to purchaſe, will ſurely come to poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>But why ſtayed he not with his people while he was here? Why? muſt not the Comforter be ſent? Was not the work on earth done? Muſt he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the recompenſe of reward, and enter into his glory? Muſt he not take poſſeſſion in our behalf? Muſt he not go to prepare a place for us? Muſt he not intercede with the Father, and plead his ſufferings, and be filled with the ſpirit to ſend it forth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive authority to ſubdue his enemies? Our abode here is ſhort: if he had ſtayed on earth, what would it have been to enjoy him for a few days, and then die? But he hath more in heaven to dwell among; even the ſpirits of the juſt of many generations, there made perfect. O what a day will that be! when we who have been kept priſoners by the grave, ſhall be fetched out by the LORD himſelf; when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come from heaven to plead with his enemies, and ſet his captives free? It will not be ſuch a coming as his firſt was, in meanneſs, and poverty, and contempt: he will not come to be ſpit upon, and buffeted, and ſcorned, and crucified again: he will not come, O careleſs world! to be ſlighted by you any more. And yet that coming which was in infirmity and reproach
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:022331_0032_0FB7F4F1E17D1AD8"/>for our ſakes, wanted not its glory. If the angels of heaven muſt be the meſſengers of that coming, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tidings of joy to all people:</hi> and the heavenly hoſt muſt accompany his nativity, and muſt praiſe GOD with that ſolemnity: O with what ſhoutings will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and ſaints at that day proclaim, <hi>Glory to</hi> GOD, <hi>and peace and good-will towards men!</hi> If the ſtars of heaven muſt lead men to come to worſhip a child in a manger, how will the glory of his next appearing conſtrain all the world to acknowledge his ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! If when he was in the form of a ſervant, they cry out, <hi>What manner of man is this, that both wind and ſea obey him!</hi> What ſhall they ſay when they ſhall ſee him coming in his glory, and the heavens and earth obey him? <hi>Then ſhall appear the ſign of the Son of man in heaven, and then ſhall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they ſhall ſee the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great-glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is frequently mentioned in the prophets, as the great ſupport of his people's ſpirits till then. And whenever the apoſtles would quicken to duty, or encourage to patient waiting, they uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it by mentioning <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s coming. Why then do we not uſe more this cordial conſideration, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we want ſupport and comfort? Shall the wicked with inconceivable horror behold him, and cry out, Yonder is he whoſe blood we neglected, whoſe grace we reſiſted, whoſe counſels we refuſed, whoſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment we caſt off! And ſhall not the ſaints, with inconceivable gladneſs, cry out, Yonder is he whoſe blood redeemed us, whoſe ſpirit cleanſed us! Yonder comes he in whom we truſted, and now we ſee he hath not deceived our truſt: he for whom we long waited, and now we ſee we have not waited in vain! O how ſhould it then be the character of a chriſtian, <hi>To wait for the Son of</hi> GOD <hi>from heaven, whom he raiſed from the dead, even</hi> JESUS <hi>which delivered us from the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:022331_0033_0FB7F4F96060D950"/>wrath to come!</hi> 1. Theſſ. i. 10. And with all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diligence, to prepare to meet our LORD with joy. And ſeeing his coming is of purpoſe <hi>to be glorified in his ſaints, and admired in all them that believe;</hi> what thought ſhould glad our hearts more than the thought of that day? A little while indeed we have not <hi>ſeen him, but yet a little while and we ſhall ſee him,</hi> for he hath ſaid, <hi>I will not have you comfortleſs, but will come unto you.</hi> We were comfortleſs ſhould he not come. And while we daily gaze and look up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven after him, let us remember what the angel ſaid, <hi>This ſome</hi> JESUS <hi>which is taken up from you into heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner, as ye have ſeen him go into heaven.</hi> Let every chriſtian that heareth and readeth, ſay, <hi>Come;</hi> and our LORD himſelf ſaith, <hi>Surely I come quickly, amen, even ſo come</hi> LORD JESUS.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſtream that leadeth to paradiſe, is that great work of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in raiſing our bodies from the duſt, uniting them again unto the ſoul. What, ſaith the atheiſt, ſhall all theſe ſcattered bones and duſt become a man? Thou fool, doſt thou diſpute againſt the power of the Almighty? Doſt thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject difficulties to infinite ſtrength? Thou blind mole! thou little piece of creeping, breathing clay! But come thy way, let me take thee by the hand, and with reverence (as <hi>Elihu</hi>) plead for GOD; and for that power whereby I hope to ariſe. Seeſt thou this great maſſy body of the earth? upon what foundation doth it ſtand? Seeſt thou this vaſt ocean of waters? what limits them, and why do they not overflow and drown the earth? whence is that e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Muſt thou not come to a cauſe of cauſes, that can do all things? And doth not reaſon require thee, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of that cauſe as a perfect intelligence, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary agent, and not ſuch a blind worker and empty
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:022331_0034_0FB7F4FD0404C348"/>notion as that nothing is, which thou calleſt nature? What thinkeſt thou? Is not that power able to effect thy reſurrection, which doth all this? Is it not as eaſy to raiſe the dead, as to make heaven and earth, and all out of nothing? But if thou be unperſuadable, all I ſay to thee more is as the prophet to the prince of <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 Kings vii. 19. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee that day with thine eyes,</hi> but little to thy comfort; for that which is the day of relief to the ſaints, ſhall be a day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on thee.</p>
               <p>Come then, fellow-chriſtians, let us commit theſe carcaſes to the duſt: that priſon ſhall not long contain them. Let us lie down in peace and take our reſt: it will not be an everlaſting night, or endleſs ſleep. What if we go out of the troubles and ſtirs of the world, and enter into thoſe chambers of duſt, and the doors be ſhut upon us, and we hide ourſelves, at it were, for a little moment <hi>until the indignation be overpaſt?</hi> Yet, <hi>behold the</hi> LORD <hi>cometh out of his place to puniſh the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity:</hi> and then the earth ſhall diſcloſe us, and the duſt ſhall hide us no more. As ſure as we awake in the morning, when we have ſlept out the night, ſo ſure ſhall we then awake.</p>
               <p>Lay down then cheerfully this lump of corruption: thou ſhalt undoubtedly receive it again in incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Lay down freely this terreſtrial, this natural body: thou ſhalt receive it again a celeſtial, a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual body. Though thou lay it down with great diſhonour, thou ſhalt receive it in glory: and though thou art ſeparated from it through weakneſs, it ſhall be raiſed again in mighty power. When the trumpet of GOD ſhall ſound the call, <hi>Come away, riſe ye dead;</hi> who ſhall then ſtay behind? Who can reſiſt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful command of our LORD? When he ſhall call to the earth and ſea. <hi>O earth, O ſea, give up thy dead:</hi>

               <p>The third part of this prologue to the ſaints reſt, is the ſolemn proceſs at their judgment, where they ſhall firſt themſelves be juſtified; and then with <hi>Chriſt</hi> judge the world. All the world muſt there appear, young and old, of all eſtates and nations, that ever were from the creation to that day. The judgment ſhall be ſet, and the books opened, and the book of life produced; <hi>and the dead ſhall be judged out of thoſe things which were written in the books, according to their works, and whoſoever is not found written in the book of life, is caſt into the lake of fire.</hi> O terrible! O joyful day! Terrible to thoſe that have not watched, but forgot the coming of their LORD! Joyful to the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:022331_0036_0FB7F4FF9397FDC0"/>ſaints, whoſe waiting and hope was to ſee this day! Then ſhall the world behold the goodneſs and ſeverity of the LORD; on them who periſh, ſeverity; but to his choſen, goodneſs. When every one muſt give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his ſtewardſhip; and every talent of time, health, wit, mercies, affliction, means, warnings muſt be reckoned for. When the ſins of youth, and thoſe which they had forgotten, and their ſecret ſins ſhall be laid open before angels and men: when they ſhall ſee all their friends, wealth, old delights, all their confidence and falſe hopes forſake them. When they ſhall ſee the LORD JESUS whom they neglected, whoſe word they diſobeyed, whoſe miniſters they abuſed, whoſe ſervants they hated, now ſitting to judge them: when their own conſciences ſhall cry out againſt them, and call to their remembrance all their miſdoings. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at ſuch a time ſuch or ſuch a ſin; at ſuch a time <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſued hard for thy converſion; the miniſter preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it home to thy heart, thou waſt touched to the quick with the word; thou didſt purpoſe and promiſe returning, and yet thou didſt caſt off all. O which way will the wretched ſinner look! O who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the thoughts of his heart! Now the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help him; his old companions cannot help him: the ſaints neither can nor will; only the LORD JESUS can: but there is the miſery, he will not: nay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violating the truth of his word, he cannot: tho' otherwiſe, in regard of his abſolute power, he might. The time was, ſinner, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> would, and you would not; and now, fain would you, and he will not. What then remains but to cry to the mountains, <hi>Fall on us; and the hills cover us from the preſence of him that ſits upon the throne!</hi> But all in vain! for thou haſt the LORD of mountains and hills for thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, whoſe voice they will obey, and not thine. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, make not light of this; for as thou liveſt (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a thorough change prevent it) thou ſhalt ſhortly, to thy inconceivable horror, ſee that day.</p>

                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:022331_0037_0FB7F507487FC800"/>
Poor careleſs ſinner, I did not think here to have ſaid ſo much to thee: but if theſe lines fall into thy hands, <hi>I charge thee before</hi> GOD, <hi>and the</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST, <hi>who ſhall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his kingdom;</hi> that thou make haſte and get alone, and ſet thy ſelf ſadly to ponder theſe things. Aſk thy heart, is this true, or is it not? Is there ſuch a day, and muſt I ſee it? What do I then? Is it not time, full time, that I had made ſure of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and comfort long ago? Should I ſit ſtill another day, who have loſt ſo many? Friend, I profeſs to thee from the word of the LORD, that of all thy ſweet ſins, there will then be nothing left, but the ſting in thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which will be never out through all eternity.</p>
               <p>But why trembleſt thou, O gracious ſoul! He that would not overlook one <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom;</hi> nay, that could do nothing till he went forth; will he forget thee at that day? <hi>Thy</hi> LORD <hi>knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reſerve the unjuſt to the day of judgment to be puniſhed:</hi> he knoweth how to make the ſame day the greateſt terror to his foes, and yet the greateſt joy to his people. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in</hi> CHRIST JESUS, <hi>who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> And, <hi>who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of</hi> GOD<hi>'s elect?</hi> Shall the law? Why, <hi>whatſoever the law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the law: but we are not under the law, but under grace: for the law of the ſpirit of life, which is in</hi> CHRIST JESUS, <hi>hath made us free from the law of ſin and death.</hi> Or ſhall conſcience? We were long ago <hi>juſtified by faith, and ſo have peace with</hi> GOD, <hi>and have our hearts ſprirkled from an evil conſcience: and the ſpirit bearing witneſs with our ſpirits, that we are the children of</hi> GOD. <hi>It is</hi> GOD <hi>that juſtifieth, who ſhall condemn?</hi> If our judge condemn us not, who ſhall? He that ſaid to the adulterous woman, <hi>Hath no man condemned thee? Neither do I condemn thee:</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:022331_0038_0FB7F5088A3EE4F0"/>He will ſay to us, (more faithfully than <hi>Peter</hi> to him) <hi>Though all men deny thee, or condemn thee, I will not. Thou haſt confeſſed me before men, and I will confeſs thee before my Father and the angels in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What inexpreſſible joy may this afford a believer? Our dear LORD ſhall be our judge. Will a man fear to be judged by his deareſt friend, by a brother, by a father, or a wife by her own huſband? Did he come down, and ſuffer and weep, and bleed, and die for thee; and will he now condemn thee? Was he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and condemned, and executed in thy ſtead, and now will he condemn thee? Hath it coſt him ſo dear to ſave thee? and will he now deſtroy thee? Hath he done the moſt of the work already, in juſtifying, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and perfecting thee? and will he now undo all again? O what an unreaſonable ſin is unbelief, that will charge our LORD with ſuch abſurdities! Well then, fellow-chriſtians, let the terror of that day be never ſo great, our LORD can mean no ill to us in all. Let it make the devils tremble; and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tremble; but it ſhall make us leap for joy. And it muſt needs affect us deeply with the ſenſe of our mercy and happineſs, to behold the contrary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others. To ſee moſt of the world tremble with terror, while we triumph with joy: to ſee them thruſt into hell, when we are proclaimed heirs of the kingdom; to ſee our neighbours that lived in the ſame towns, came to the ſame congregations, dwelt in the ſame houſes, and were eſteemed more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the world than ourſelves; now ſo differenced from us, and by the ſearcher of hearts eternally ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. This, with the great magnificence and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the day, doth the apoſtle pathetically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> i. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>It is a righteous thing with</hi> GOD <hi>to recompenſe tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled, reſt with us; when the</hi> LORD JESUS <hi>ſhall be revealed from heaven with his

The fourth antecedent to the ſaints advancement is, their ſolemn coronation, and receiving into the kingdom. For as <hi>Chriſt,</hi> their head, is anointed both king and prieſt: ſo under him are his people made unto GOD both kings and prieſts: <hi>To reign, and to offer praiſes for-ever,</hi> Rev. v. 10. <hi>The crown of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which was laid up for them, ſhall by the</hi> LORD, <hi>the righteous judge, be given them at that day,</hi> 2 Tim. iv. 8. <hi>They have been faithful to the death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall receive the crown of life:</hi> and according to the improvement of their talents here, ſo ſhall their rule and dignity be enlarged. So that they are not dignified with empty titles, but real dominions. For <hi>Chriſt will take them and ſet them down with himſelf, in his own throne; and will give them power over the nations, even as he received of his Father. And will give them the morning ſtar.</hi> The LORD himſelf will give them poſſeſſion with theſe applauding expreſſions: <hi>Well done, good and faithful ſervant, thou haſt been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy</hi> LORD. And with this ſolemn and bleſſed proclamation ſhall he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne them; <hi>Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</hi> Every word is full of life and joy. <hi>[Come]</hi> This is the holding forth of the golden ſceptre; to warrant our approach unto this glory. Come now as near as you will: fear not the <hi>Bethſhemites</hi> judgment: for the enmity is utterly taken away. This is not ſuch a <hi>Come</hi> as we were wont to hear, <hi>Come take up your croſs, and follow me:</hi> though that was ſweet, yet this is much more. <hi>[Ye bleſſed]</hi> Bleſſed indeed, when that mouth ſhall ſo pronounce us. For though the world hath accounted us accurſed, yet certainly thoſe that he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth are bleſſed: and thoſe whom he curſeth only, are curſed: and his bleſſing ſhall not be revoked. But he hath bleſſed us, and we ſhall be bleſſed. <hi>[Of my Father]</hi> Bleſſed in the Father's love, as well as the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:022331_0041_0FB7F5160DB0BAF0"/>Son's: for they are one: the Father hath teſtified his love, in ſending <hi>Chriſt</hi> and accepting his ranſom; as the Son hath alſo teſtified his. <hi>[Inherit]</hi> No longer bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, nor ſervants only, nor children under age, who differ not in poſſeſſion, but only in the title from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: but, now we are <hi>heirs of the kingdom, co-heirs with</hi> CHRIST. <hi>[The kingdom]</hi> No leſs than the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom! Indeed to be KING of kings, and LORD of lords, is our LORD'S own title: but to be kings and reign with him, is ours: the fruition of this kingdom, is as the fruition of the light of the ſun, each hath the whole, and the reſt never the leſs. <hi>[Prepared for you]</hi> GOD is the <hi>Alpha,</hi> as well as the <hi>Omega</hi> of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs. Eternal love hath laid the foundation. He prepared the kingdom for us, and then prepared us for the kingdom. This is the preparation of his counſel: for the execution whereof <hi>Chriſt</hi> was yet to make a further preparation. <hi>[For you]</hi> Not for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers only in general, but for you in particular. <hi>[From the foundation of the world]</hi> Not only from the promiſe after <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, but from eternity.</p>

                  <item>3. Our giving to <hi>Chriſt</hi> more of the work than ſcripture doth, or rather our aſcribing it to him out of the ſcripture-way, doth but diſhonour, and not honour him; and depreſs, but not exalt his free grace: while we deny the inward ſanctifying work of his ſpirit, and extol his free juſtification, which are equal fruits of his merit, we make him an imperfect Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</item>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The Excellencies of our Reſt.</head>
               <p>LET us ſee more immediately from the pure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the ſcriptures, what further excellencies this reſt affordeth. And the LORD hide us in the clefts of the rock, and cover us with the hands of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent grace, while we approach to take this view.</p>
               <p>And firſt, it is a moſt ſingular honour of the ſaint's reſt, to be called the <hi>purchaſed poſſeſſion;</hi> that it is the fruit of the blood of the Son of GOD; yea, the chief fruit: yea, the end and perfection of all the fruits of that blood. Surely love is the moſt precious ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the whole compoſition; and of all the flowers that grow in the garden of love, can there be brought one more ſweet than this blood? Greater love than this there is not, to lay down the life of the lover. And to have this our Redeemer ever before our eyes, and the livelieſt ſenſe and freſheſt remembrance of that dying bleeding love ſtill upon our ſouls; O how will it fill our ſouls with perpetual raviſhments, to think that in the ſtreams of this blood, we have ſwam thro' the violence of the world, the ſnares of Satan, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements of the fleſh, the curſe of the law, the wrath of an offended GOD, the accuſations of a guilty conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the doubts and fears of an unbelieving heart, and are paſſed through all, and arrived ſafely at the breaſt of GOD! Now we are ſtupified with vile and ſenſeleſs hearts, that can hear all the ſtory of this love, and read all the ſufferings of love; and all with dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:022331_0044_0FB7F51B4B3F1EB0"/>and unaffectedneſs. He cries to us, <hi>Behold and ſee, is it nothing to you, O all ye that paſs by? Is there any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow?</hi> And we will ſcarce hear or regard the voice; or turn aſide to view the wounds of him who healed our wounds at ſo dear a rate. But oh! then our perfected ſouls will feel as well as hear, and with feeling apprehenſions flame in love for love. Now we ſet his picture wounded and dying before our eyes, but can get it no nearer our hearts, than if we believed nothing of what we read. But then when the obſtructions between the eye and the underſtanding are taken away, and the paſſage opened between the head and heart, ſurely our eyes will everlaſtingly affect our heart! And while we view with one eye our ſlain revived LORD, and with the other eye our loſt recovered ſoule, theſe views will eternally pierce us, and warm our very ſouls. And thoſe eyes through which folly hath ſo often ſtolen into our hearts, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>We ſhall then leave theſe hearts of ſtone and rock behind us, and the ſin that here ſo cloſe beſets us, and the ſottiſh unkindneſs that followed us ſo long, ſhall not be able to follow us into glory. But we ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, as it were, the wounds of love, with eyes and hearts of love for-ever. Now his heart is open to us, and ours ſhut to him: but when his heart ſhall be open, and our hearts open, oh the bleſſed congreſs that will then be! What a paſſionate meeting is there between our new-riſen LORD, and the firſt ſinful wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that he appears to! How doth love ſtruggle for expreſſions? and the ſtraitned fire ſhut up in the breaſt, ſtrive to break forth? <hi>Mary!</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt: Maſter!</hi> ſaith <hi>Mary:</hi> and preſently ſhe claſps about his feet, having her heart as near to his heart as her hands were to his feet.

<pb n="46" facs="unknown:022331_0045_0FB7F5238EA534E0"/>the glorious Redeemer! But I am here at a loſs, my apprehenſions fail me, and fall too ſhort. Only this I know, it will be the ſingular praiſe of our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that it was bought with the price of that blood; and the ſingular joy of the ſaints, to behold the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer and the price, together with the poſſeſſion: neither will the views of the wounds of love renew our wounds or ſorrow: he whoſe firſt words after his reſurrection were to a great ſinner, <hi>Woman, why weepeſt thou?</hi> knows how to raiſe love and joy by all thoſe views, without raiſing any cloud of ſorrow. If a dying friend deliver but a token of his love, how carefully do we preſerve it? and ſtill remember him when we behold it, as if his own name were written on it? And will not then the death and blood of our LORD everlaſtingly ſweeten our poſſeſſed glory? Well then, chriſtians, as you uſe to do in your books, and on your goods, to write down the price they coſt you: ſo on your righteouſneſs, and on your glory; write down the price, <hi>The precious blood of</hi> CHRIST.</p>
               <p>Yet underſtand this rightly: not that this higheſt glory was in the ſtricteſt ſenſe purchaſed, ſo as that it was the moſt immediate effect of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s death; we muſt take heed that we conceive not of GOD as a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, who ſo delighteth in cruelty, as to exchange mercies for ſtripes. GOD was never ſo pleaſed with the ſufferings of the innocent, much leſs of his Son, us to ſell his mercy properly for their ſufferings. But the ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were primarily and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſatisfy juſtice, and to bear what was due to the ſinner, and ſo to reſtore him to the life he loſt, and the happineſs he ſell from: but this dignity, which ſurpaſſeth the firſt, is as it were, from the redundancy of his merit, or a ſecondary fruit of his death. The work of his redemption ſo well pleaſed the Father, that he gave him power to advance his choſen to a higher dignity than they fell from; and to give them
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:022331_0046_0FB7F525D5A7A7C8"/>the glory which was given to himſelf; and all this according to the good pleaſure of his own will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond <hi>pearl in the ſaint's diadem,</hi> is, that it is free. This ſeemeth as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>ſecond kine, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the former.</hi> But the ſeeming diſcord, is but a pleaſing diverſity which conſtitutes the melody. Theſe two attributes purchaſed and free, are the two chains of gold, which make up the wreath for the heads of the pillars in the temple of GOD. It was dear to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but free to us. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to buy, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and gold were nothing worth; prayers and tears could not ſuffice; nor any thing below his blood; but when we come to buy, our buying is but receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: we have it freely, <hi>without money and without price.</hi> Nor do the goſpel-conditions make it the leſs free; if the goſpel-conditions had been ſuch as are the laws, or payment of the debt required at our hands; the freeneſs then were more queſtionable. Yea, if GOD had ſaid to us, <hi>Sinners, if you will ſatisfy my juſtice for one of your ſins, I will forgive you all the reſt,</hi> it would have been a hard condition on our part, and the grace of the covenant not ſo free, as our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability doth require. But if all the condition be our cordial acceptation, ſurely we deſerve not the name of purchaſers. Thankful accepting of a free acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is no paying of the debt. If life be offered to a condemned man, upon condition that he ſhall not refuſe the offer, the favour is nevertheleſs free. Nay, though the condition were, that he ſhould beg, and wait before he have his pardon, and take him for his LORD who hath thus redeemed him, this is no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the juſtice of the law: eſpecially when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is alſo given by GOD; ſurely then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="48" facs="unknown:022331_0047_0FB7F528485D3470"/>us the purchaſed life upon thoſe fair conditions; and if they alſo freely ſend the ſpirit to enable us to perform thoſe conditions, then what is here, that is not free? O the everlaſting admiration that muſt needs ſurpriſe the ſaints to think of this freeneſs! What did the LORD ſee in me, that he ſhould judge me meet for ſuch a ſtate? that I who was but a poor, deſpiſed wretch, ſhould be clad in the brightneſs of this glory? that I, a ſilly, creeping worm, ſhould be advanced to this high dignity? He that durſt not lift up his eyes to heaven, but ſtood afar off ſmiting his breaſt, and crying, LORD, <hi>be merciful to me a ſinner!</hi> now to be lifted up to heaven himſelf! He who was wont to write his name in <hi>Bradford</hi>'s ſtyle, <hi>the unthankful, the hard-hearted, the unworthy ſinner!</hi> and was wont to admire that patience could bear ſo long, and juſtice ſuffer him to live: ſure he will admire at this altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he ſhall find by experience, that unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could not hinder his ſalvation, which he thought would have bereaved him of every mercy. Ah! chriſtian, there is no talk of our worthineſs or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs. If worthineſs were our condition for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, we might ſit down with St. <hi>John,</hi> and weep, <hi>Becauſe none in heaven or on earth is found worthy. But the lion of the tribe of</hi> Judah <hi>is worthy, and hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; and by that title muſt we hold the inheritance.</hi> We ſhall offer there the offering that <hi>David</hi> refuſed, <hi>even praiſe for that which coſt us nothing.</hi> Here our commiſſion runs, <hi>freely ye have received, freely give.</hi> But <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath dearly received, yet freely gives. Yet this is not all. If it were only for nothing, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our merit, the wonder were great: but it is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over againſt our merit, and againſt our long endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring our own ruin.

Oh! what pangs of love will it cauſe within us, to think, yonder was the place that ſin would have brought me to; but this is it that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath brought me to! Yonder death was the wages of my ſin; but this <hi>eternal life is the gift of</hi> GOD, <hi>through</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>my</hi> LORD. Doubtleſs this will be our everlaſting admiration, that ſo rich a crown ſhould ſit the head of ſo vile a ſinner! that ſuch high advancement, and ſuch long unfruitfulneſs and unkindneſs can be the ſtate of the ſame perſons! and that ſuch vile rebellions can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in ſuch moſt precious joys! But no thanks to us; nor to any of our duties and labours, much leſs to our neglects and lazineſs; we know to whom the praiſe is due, and muſt be given for-ever. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to this very end it was, that infinite wiſdom did caſt the whole deſign of man's ſalvation into the mould of PURCHASE and FREENESS, that the love and joy of man might be perfected, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of grace moſt highly advanced: that the thought of merit might neither cloud the one, nor obſtruct the other; and that on theſe two hinges the gates of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven might turn.

               <p>A third comfortable adjunct of this reſt is, that it is the fellowſhip of the bleſſed ſaints and angels of GOD. Not ſo ſingular will the chriſtian be, as to be ſolitary. Though it be proper to the ſaints only, yet is it common to all the ſaints. For what is it, but an aſſociation of bleſſed ſpirits in GOD? A corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perfected ſaints, whereof <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the head? The communion of ſaints completed? For thoſe that
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:022331_0049_0FB7F52C5E6E7378"/>have prayed and faſted, and wept, and watched, and waited together; now to enjoy, and praiſe together, methinks ſhould much advance their pleaſure. He who mentioneth the qualifications of our happineſs, of purpoſe that our joy may be full, and maketh ſo oft mention of our conjunction in his praiſes, ſure doth hereby intimate to us, that this will be ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to our joys. Certain I am of this, fellow-chriſtians, that as we have been together in labour, duty, danger and diſtreſs, ſo ſhall we be in the great recompenſe; and as we have been ſcorned and deſpiſed, ſo ſhall we be crowned and honoured together; and we who have gone through the day of ſadneſs, ſhall enjoy together that day of gladneſs. And thoſe who have been with us in perſecution and priſon, ſhall be with us alſo in that place of conſolation. When I look in the faces of the people of GOD, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly think of this day, what a refreſhing thought is it? Shall we not there remember our fellowſhip in duty, and in ſufferings? How oft our groans made as it were one ſound, our tears but one ſtream, and our deſires but one prayer? And now all our praiſes ſhall make up one melody; and all our churches one church; and all ourſelves but one body: for we ſhall be one in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> even as he and the Father are one. It is true, we muſt be very careful that we look not for that in the ſaints, which is alone in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that we give them not his prerogative; nor expect too great a part of our comfort in the fruition of them: we are prone enough to this kind of idolatry. But yet he who commands us ſo to love them now, will give us leave in the ſame ſubordination to himſelf to love them then, when himſelf hath made them much more lovely. And if we may love them, we ſhall ſurely rejoice in them; for love cannot ſtand without an anſwerable joy. If the forethought of ſitting down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and all the prophets in the kingdom of GOD, may be our lawful joy; then
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:022331_0050_0FB7F5325CD90E38"/>how much more that real ſight, and actual poſſeſſion? It cannot chooſe but be comfortable to me to think of that day, when I ſhall join with <hi>Moſes</hi> in his ſong, with <hi>David</hi> in his pſalms of praiſe, and with all the redeemed in the <hi>ſong of the Lamb for-ever.</hi> When we ſhall ſee <hi>Enoch</hi> walking with GOD; <hi>Noah</hi> enjoying the end of his ſingularity; <hi>Joſeph</hi> of his integrity; <hi>Job</hi> of his patience; <hi>Hezekiah</hi> of his uprightneſs: and all the ſaints the end of their faith. O happy day, when I ſhall depart out of this crowd and ſink, and go to that ſame council of ſouls! I know that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is All in All, and that it is the preſence of GOD that maketh heaven to be heaven. But yet it much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth the thoughts of that place to me, to remember that there are ſuch a multitude of my moſt dear and precious friends in <hi>Chriſt: with whom I took ſweet counſel, and with whom I went up to the houſe of</hi> GOD, <hi>who walked with me in the fear of</hi> GOD, <hi>and integrity of their hearts:</hi> In the face of whoſe converſation there was written the name of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> whoſe ſenſible mention of his excellencies hath made my heart to burn within me. To think ſuch a friend that died at ſuch a time, and ſuch a one at another time, and that all theſe are entered into reſt; and we ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go to them. It is a queſtion with ſome, Whether we ſhall know each other in heaven or no? Surely, there ſhall no knowledge ceaſe which now we have; but only that which implieth our imperfection. And what imperfection can this imply? Nay our preſent knowledge ſhall be increaſed beyond belief: it ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be done away, but as the light of the ſtars is done away by the riſing of the ſun; which is more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doing away of our ignorance than our knowledge; indeed we ſhall not know each other after the fleſh; but by the image of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſpiritual relation, and former faithfulneſs in improving our talents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond doubt, we ſhall know and be known. Nor is it only our old acquaintance, but all the ſaints of all
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:022331_0051_0FB7F53409AEA340"/>ages, whoſe faces in the fleſh, we never ſaw, whom we ſhall there both know and comfortably enjoy. Yea, and angels as well as ſaints will be our bleſſed acquaintance. Theſe who now are willingly mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial ſpirits for our good, will willingly then be our companions in joy for the perfecting of our good: and they who had ſuch joy in heaven for our converſion, will gladly rejoice with us in our glorification. I think, chriſtian, this will be a more honourable aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly than ever you have beheld; and a more happy ſociety than you were ever of before. Then we ſhall truly ſay as <hi>David, I am a companion of all them that fear thee: when we are come to mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and to the city of the living</hi> GOD, <hi>the heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and to an innumerable company of angels; to the general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and church of the firſt-born, which are written in heaven, and to</hi> GOD <hi>the judge of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, and to</hi> Jeſus <hi>the mediator of the new covenant.</hi> So then I conclude: This is one ſingular excellency of the reſt of heaven, <hi>That we are fellow-citizens with the ſaints, and of the houſehold of</hi> GOD.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another excellent property of our reſt will be, that the joys of it are immediately from GOD. <hi>We ſhall ſee</hi> GOD <hi>face to face:</hi> and ſtand continually in his preſence; and conſequently derive our life and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort immediately from him. Whether GOD will make uſe of any creatures for our ſervice then; or if any, of what creatures, and what uſe; is more than I yet know: but it is certain, that at leaſt, our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt joys will be immediate, if not all. Now we have nothing at all immediately, but at the ſecond or third hand, or how many who knows? From the earth, from man, from the ſun and moon, from the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the planets, from the miniſtration of angels, and from the ſpirit of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and doubtleſs, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſtream runs from the fountain, the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:022331_0052_0FB7F535CC44EA38"/>it is. It gathers ſome defilement from every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean channel it paſſeth through. Though it ſavours not in the hand of angels, of the imperfection of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet it doth of the imperfection of creatures; and as it comes from man, it ſavours of both. How quick and piercing is the word it itſelf? Yet many times it never enters, being managed by a feeble arm. O what weight and worth is there in every paſſage of the bleſſed goſpel! enough, one would think, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and force the dulleſt ſoul, and wholly poſſeſs its thoughts and affections: and yet how oft doth it drop as water upon a ſtone? The things of GOD which we handle, are divine: but our manner of handling is human: and there is little or none that ever we touch, but we leave the print of our fingers behind us; but of GOD ſhould ſpeak this word himſelf, it would be a piercing melting word indeed.</p>
               <p>If an angel from heaven ſhould preach the goſpel, yet could he not deliver it according to its glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; much leſs we who never ſaw what they have ſeen, and keep this treaſure in earthen veſſels. The comforts that flow through ſermons, ſacraments, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, conference, and creatures, are but half comforts; in compariſon of thoſe which the Almighty ſhall ſpeak with his own mouth, and reach forth with his own hand. The chriſtian knows by experience now, that his moſt immediate joys are his ſweeteſt joys; which have leaſt of man, and are moſt directly from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. That is one reaſon, I conceive, why chriſtians who are much in ſecret prayer and meditation, are men of greateſt life; becauſe they are nearer the well-head, and have all more immediately from GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And that I conceive the only reaſon, why we are more indiſpoſed to thoſe ſecret duties, and can eaſier bring our hearts to hear and read, than to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret prayer, ſelf-examination and meditation; becauſe in the former is more of man, and in theſe we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

Not that we ſhould therefore caſt off the other, and neglect any ordinance of GOD: to live above them while we uſe them, is the way of a chriſtian. But to live above ordinances, as to live without them, is to live without the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It is then we ſhall have light without a candle; and a perpetual day without the ſun: <hi>For the city hath no need of the ſun, neither of the moon to ſhine in it: for the glory of</hi> GOD <hi>doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof,</hi> Rev. xxi. 23. Nay, <hi>There ſhall be no night there, and they need no candle, nor light of the ſun, for the</hi> LORD GOD <hi>giveth them light, and they ſhall reign for-ever and ever.</hi> We ſhall then have reſt without ſleep, and be kept from cold without our cloathing, and need no fig-leaves to hide our ſhame: for GOD will be our reſt, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> our cloathing, and ſhame and ſin will ceaſe together. We ſhall then have health without phyſic, and ſtrength without the uſe of food; for the LORD GOD will be our ſtrength, and the light of his countenance will be health to our ſouls, and marrow to our bones. We ſhall then (and never till then) have enlightened under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings without ſcripture, and be governed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a written law. For the LORD will perfect his law in our hearts, and we ſhall be all perfectly taught of GOD; his own will ſhall be our law, and his own face ſhall be our light for-ever. We ſhall then have communion without ſacraments, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall drink with us of the fruit of the vine new, that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh us with the comforting wine of immediate fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition in the kingdom of his Father.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A further excellency of this reſt is this; it will be a ſuitable reſt: ſuited,
<list>
                     <item>1. to our natures.</item>
                     <item>2. to our deſires.</item>
                     <item>3. to our neceſſities.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:022331_0054_0FB7F53C4AF28550"/>
1. To our natures. If ſuitableneſs concur not with excelleney, the beſt things may be bad to us: for it is not that which makes things good in themſelves, to be good to us. In our choice of friends, we oft paſs by the more excellent, to chooſe the more ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; every good agrees not with every nature. The choiceſt dainties which we feed upon ourſelves, would be to our beaſts, as an unpleaſing, ſo an inſufficient ſuſtenance.</p>
               <p>Now here is ſuitableneſs and excellency conjoined. The new nature of the ſaints doth ſuit their ſpirits to this reſt: and indeed their holineſs is nothing elſe but a ſpark taken from this element, and by the ſpirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> kindled in their hearts, the flame whereof, as mindful of its divine original, doth ever mount aloft, and tend to the place from whence it comes. Gold and earthly glory, temporal crowns and kingdoms, could not make a reſt for ſaints. As they were not redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo low a price, ſo neither are they endued with ſo low a nature. As GOD will have from them a ſpiritual worſhip, ſuitable to his own ſpiritual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo will he provide them a ſpiritual reſt, ſuitable to his people's ſpiritual nature.</p>
               <p>A heaven of the knowledge of GOD, and his <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and a delightful complacency in that mutual love, and everlaſting rejoicing in the fruition of our GOD, a perpetual ſinging of his high praiſes: this is a heaven for a ſaint: a ſpiritual reſt, ſuitable to a ſpiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Then we ſhall live in our element. We are now as the fiſh in ſome ſmall veſſel of water, that hath only ſo much as will keep him alive: but what is that to the full ocean? We have a little air let into us to afford us breathing: but what is that to the ſweet and freſh gales upon mount <hi>Sion?</hi> We have a beam of the ſun to lighten our darkneſs, and a warm
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:022331_0055_0FB7F53DC8F51358"/>ray to keep us from freezing: but then we ſhall live in its light, and be revived by its heat for-ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſuitable to the deſires of the ſaints: for ſuch as is their nature, ſuch are their deſires; and ſuch as their deſires, ſuch will be their reſt. Indeed we have now a mixed nature; and from contrary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ariſe contrary deſires. But it is the deſires of our renewed nature, which this reſt is ſuited to. Whilſt our deſires remain corrupt and miſguided, it is a far greater mercy to deny, yea, to deſtroy them, than to ſatisfy them: but thoſe which are ſpiritual, are of his own planting, and he will ſurely water them, and give the increaſe. He quickened our hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt for righteouſneſs, that he might make us happy in a full ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Chriſtian, this is a reſt after thy own heart; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth all that thy heart can wiſh, that which thou longeſt for, prayeſt for, laboureſt for, there thou ſhalt find it all. Thou hadſt rather have GOD in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than all the world; why there thou ſhalt have him. Deſire what thou canſt, and aſk what thou wilt, as a chriſtian, and it ſhall be given thee; not only to half of the kingdom, but to the enjoyment of both king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and king. This is a life of deſire and prayer; but that is a life of ſatisfaction and enjoyment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This reſt is ſuitable to the ſaints neceſſities alſo, as well as to their natures and deſires. It contains whatſoever they truly wanted; not ſupplying them with groſs created comforts, which, like <hi>Saul</hi>'s ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour on <hi>David,</hi> are more burden than benefit: but they ſhall there have the benefit without the burden; and the pure ſpirits extracted (as it were) ſhall make up their cordial, without the mixture of any droſſy or earthly ſubſtance. It was <hi>Chriſt</hi> and perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which they moſt needed, and with theſe ſhall they be ſupplied.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:022331_0056_0FB7F5456CABF578"/>
4. Another excellency of our reſt will be this, that it will be abſolutely perfect and complete; and this both in the ſincerity and univerſality of it. We ſhall then have joy without ſorrow, and reſt without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs: as there is no mixture of our corruption with our graces, ſo no mixture of ſufferings with our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

To-day we are well, to-morrow ſick; to-day in eſteem, to-morrow in diſgrace; to-day we have friends, to-morrow none: nay, we have wine and vinegar in the ſame cup. If revelation ſhould raiſe us up to the third heaven, the meſſenger of Satan muſt preſently buffet us: but there is none of this inconſtancy in heaven. It perfect love caſt out fear; then perfect joy muſt needs caſt out ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and perfect happineſs exclude all the relicks of miſery. There will be an univerſal perfecting of all our parts and powers, and an univerſal removal of all our evils. And though the poſitive part be the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and that which draws the other after it, even as the riſing of the ſun excludes the darkneſs; yet is not the negative part to be ſlighted, even our freedom from ſo many and great calamities. Let us therefore look over theſe more punctually, and ſee what it is we ſhall there reſt from. In general, it is from all evil. Particularly, <hi>Firſt,</hi> from ſin. <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſuffering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It excludeth nothing more directly than ſin; whether original, and of nature; or actual, and of converſation: for <hi>there entereth nothing that defileth, nor that worketh abomination, nor that maketh a lie.</hi> What need <hi>Chriſt</hi> have died, if heaven could have contained imperfect ſouls? <hi>For to this end cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed. <hi>For what communion hath light with darkneſs? And what fellowſhip hath</hi> CHRIST <hi>with</hi> Belial? He that hath prepared for ſin the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:022331_0057_0FB7F548A2635840"/>of hell, will never admit it into the bleſſedneſs of heaven. Therefore, chriſtian, never fear this: if thou be once in heaven, thou ſhalt ſin no more. Is not this glad news to thee, who haſt prayed, and watched, and laboured againſt it ſo long? I know, if it were offered to thy choice, thou wouldſt rather chooſe to be freed from ſin, than to be made heir of the world. Thou ſhalt have thy deſire: that hard heart, thoſe vile thoughts, which thou couldſt no more leave behind thee, than leave thyſelf behind thee, ſhall be now left behind for-ever. If they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company thee to death, they cannot proceed a ſtep further. Thy underſtanding ſhall never more be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with darkneſs: ignorance and error are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with this light. Now thou walkeſt like a man in the twilight, ever afraid of being out of the way: but then will all darkneſs be diſpelled, and our blind underſtandings fully opened.</p>
               <p>O what would we give to know clearly all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found myſteries in the doctrine of redemption, of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, of the nature of grace, of the divine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes! What would we give to ſee all dark ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures made plain; to ſee all ſeeming contradictions reconciled! Why, when glory hath taken away the veil from our eyes, all this will be known in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; we ſhall then ſee clearly into all the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies about doctrine or diſcipline that now perplex us. The pooreſt chriſtian is preſently there a more perfect divine, than any is here. We are now through our ignorance ſubject to ſuch mutability, that in points not fundamental, we change as the moon: but when once our ignorance is perfectly healed, then ſhall we be ſettled, reſolved men; then ſhall our reproach be taken from us, and we ſhall never change our judgment more. Our ignorance now doth lead us into error, to the grief of our more knowing brethren, to the diſturbing the church's quiet, to the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:022331_0058_0FB7F549DA8AA5B0"/>of others, and weakening ourſelves. How many a faithful ſoul is ſeduced into error! Loth they are to err, GOD knows; and therefore read and pray, and yet err ſtill. And in leſſer and more difficult points, how can it be otherwiſe?</p>
               <p>Can it be expected, that men void of learning and ſtrength of parts, unſtudied and untaught, ſhould at the firſt onſet know thoſe truths, which they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt incapable of knowing at all? When the greateſt divines of cleareſt judgment acknowledge ſo much difficulty, that they could almoſt find in their hearts, ſometimes to profeſs them quite beyond their reach. But O that happy approaching day, when error ſhall vaniſh away for-ever, when our underſtanding ſhall be filled with GOD himſelf, whoſe light will leave no darkneſs in us! His face ſhall be the ſcripture, where we ſhall read the truth: and himſelf inſtead of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and counſellors, to perfect our underſtandings, and acquaint us with himſelf. No more error, no more ſcandal to others, no more diſquiet to our own ſpirits, no more miſtaken zeal for falſehood. Many a good man hath here in his miſtaken zeal, been a means to deceive and pervert his brethren; and when he ſees his own error, cannot again tell how to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them: but there we ſhall all conſpire in one truth, as being one in him who is the truth.</p>
               <p>And as we ſhall reſt from all the ſin of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, ſo of our wills, affection and converſation. We ſhall no more retain this rebelling principle, which is ſtill withdrawing us from GOD. We ſhall no more be oppreſſed with the power of our corruptions, nor vexed with their preſence: no pride, paſſion, ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, ſenſeleſſneſs ſhall enter with us; no ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to GOD, and the things of GOD; no coldneſs of affections, nor imperfection in our love; no uneven walking, nor grieving of the ſpirit; no ſcandalous
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:022331_0059_0FB7F54B483136B8"/>action, or unholy converſation: we ſhall reſt from all theſe for-ever. Then ſhall our underſtandings receive their light from the face of GOD, as the full moon from the open ſun: then ſhall our wills correſpond to the divine will, <hi>as face anſwers face in the glaſs;</hi> and his will ſhall be our law and rule, from which we ſhall never ſwerve again. I conclude therefore with the words next my text, <hi>He that is entered into his reſt, hath ceaſed from his own works, as</hi> GOD <hi>from his.</hi> So that there is a perfect reſt from ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is a perfect reſt from ſuffering. When the cauſe is gone, the effect ceaſeth. Our ſufferings were but the conſequents of our ſinning, and here they both ſhall ceaſe together.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſhall reſt from all the temptations of <hi>Satan.</hi> What a grief is it to a chriſtian, though he yield not to the temptation, yet to be ſtill ſolicited to deny his LORD? That ſuch a thought ſhould be caſt into his heart? That he can ſet about nothing that is good, but <hi>Satan</hi> is ſtill diſſuading him from it, diſtracting him in it, or diſcouraging him after it? What a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as a temptation is it, to have ſuch horrid motions made to his ſoul? Sometime cruel thoughts of GOD; ſometime undervaluing thoughts of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſometime unbelieving thoughts of ſcripture; ſometime injurious thoughts of Providence: to be tempted ſometime to turn to preſent things; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to play with the baits of ſin; ſometime to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the delights of the fleſh; and ſometime to <hi>Atheiſm</hi> itſelf? Eſpecially when we know the treachery of our own hearts, that they are as tinder, ready to take fire, as ſoon as one of theſe ſparks ſhall fall upon them: but when the day of our deliverance comes, we ſhall fully reſt from theſe temptations: <hi>Satan</hi> is then bound up, the time of tempting is done; the time of torment to himſelf, and his conquered cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:022331_0060_0FB7F5507326C9A0"/>is then come; and the victorious ſaints ſhall have triumph from temptation.

Every ſenſe is a ſnare; every member a ſnare; every creature a ſnare; every mercy a ſnare; and every duty a ſnare to us. We can ſcarce open our eyes but we are in danger: if we behold them above us, we are in danger of envy: if we ſee ſumptuous buildings, pleaſant ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, honour and riches, we are in danger to be drawn away with covetous deſires: if the rags and beggary of others, we are in danger of ſelf-applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts or unmercifulneſs: if we ſee beauty, it is a bait to luſt; if deformity, to loathing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain. We can ſcarcely hear a word ſpoken, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to us matter of temptation. How ſoon do ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous reports, vain jeſts, or wanton ſpeeches creep into the heart? How ſtrong and prevalent a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is our appetite?

<pb n="65" facs="unknown:022331_0064_0FB7F55C1B933828"/>There they are not every man conceited of his own underſtanding, and in love with the iſſue of his own brain; but all admiring the divine perfection, and in love with GOD, and one another. As old <hi>Gryneus</hi> wrote to his friend, "If I ſee you no more on earth, yet we ſhall there meet, where <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inglius</hi> are now well agreed." There is no recording our brethren's infirmities; nor raking into the ſores which <hi>Chriſt</hi> died to heal. There is no plotting to ſtrengthen our party; nor deep deſigning againſt our brethren.</p>
               <p>And is it not a ſhame and pity, that our courſe is now ſo contrary? Surely, if there be ſorrow or ſhame in heaven, we ſhall then be both ſorry and aſhamed to look one another in the face: and to remember all this carriage on earth, even as the brethren of <hi>Joſeph</hi> were to behold him, when they remembered their former unkind uſage. Is it not enough that all the world is againſt us, but we muſt alſo be againſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Did I ever think to have heard chriſtians ſo to reproach and ſcorn chriſtians! And men profeſſing the fear of GOD, to make ſo little conſcience of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring, vilifying, and diſgracing one another! O what helliſh things are ignorance and pride, that can bring men's ſouls to ſuch a caſe as this! <hi>Paul</hi> knew what he ſaid, when he commanded, that <hi>a novice ſhould not be a teacher, leſt being lifted up he fall into the condemnation of the Devil,</hi> 1 Tim. iii. 6. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned that ſuch young chriſtians that have got but a little ſmattering knowledge in religion, lie in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt danger of this pride and condemnation. Who but <hi>Paul</hi> could have foreſeen that among the very teachers and governors of ſo choice a church as <hi>Epheſus,</hi> there were ſome that afterwards ſhould be notorious ſect-maſters? <hi>That of their own ſelves men ſhould ariſe, ſpeaking per verſe things, to draw away diſciples after them,</hi> Acts xx. 30. Who then can expect better from
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:022331_0065_0FB7F55EC30FDFE0"/>any ſociety now, how knowing and holy ſoever? To day they may be unanimous, and joined in love; and perhaps within a few weeks be divided, and at bitter enmity, through their doating on queſtions that tend not to edify.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We ſhall then reſt from all which we now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, by participating with our brethren in their calamities. Alas, if we had nothing upon ourſelves to trouble us, yet what heart could lay aſide ſorrows, that lives in the ſound of the church's ſufferings? If <hi>Job</hi> had nothing upon his body to diſquiet him, yet the meſſage of his children's overthrow muſt needs grieve the moſt patient ſoul. Except we are turned into ſteel or ſtone, and have loft both chriſtian and human affection, there needs no more than the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our brethren to fill our hearts with ſorrows. The church on earth is a mere hoſpital; which way ſoever we go, we hear complaining; and into what corner ſoever we caſt our eyes, we behold objects of pity: ſome groaning under a dark underſtanding, ſome under a ſenſeleſs heart, ſome languiſhing under unfruitful weakneſs, and ſome bleeding for miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages and wilfulneſs, and ſome in a lethargy, that they are paſt complaining; ſome crying out of their pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poverty; ſome groaning under pains and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſome bewailing a whole catalogue of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, eſpecially in days of common ſufferings: but our day of reſt will free us and them from all this. Now we may enter many a poor chriſtian's cottage, and ſee poverty poſſeſſing and filling all: how much better is that day, when we ſhall ſee them filled with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> cloathed with glory, and equal with the greateſt princes?</p>
               <p>But a far greater grief it is to our ſpirits, to ſee the ſpiritual miſeries of our brethren: to ſee ſuch an one, with whom we took ſweet counſel, now falling
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:022331_0066_0FB7F568782E2FD8"/>off to ſenſuality, turned drunkard, worldling, or a perſecutor, and theſe trying times have given us too large occaſion for ſuch ſorrows: to ſee our deareſt friends turned aſide from the truth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in the fleſh continue their neglect of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and their ſouls, and nothing waking them out of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; and to think how certainly they ſhall be in hell for-ever, if they die in their preſent ſtate: and will it not be a bleſſed day, when we ſhall reſt from all theſe ſorrows? <hi>When the people ſhall be all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, even the work of</hi> GOD<hi>'s hands, the branch of his planting, that he may be glorified?</hi> Thus ſhall we reſt from our participation of our brethren's ſufferings.</p>
               <p n="6">6. We ſhall reſt from all our perſonal ſufferings. And though this may ſeem a ſmall thing to thoſe that live in continual eaſe, and abound in all kind of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; yet methinks, to the daily afflicted ſoul, it ſhould make the fore-thoughts of heaven delightful: and I think I ſhall meet with few of the ſaints, but will ſay, that this is their own caſe.</p>
               <p>Though we are reconciled by the blood of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the price is paid for our full deliverance; yet our Redeemer ſees fit to leave this meaſure of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery upon us, to mind us of what we would elſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get; to be ſerviceable to his wiſe and gracious deſigns, and advantageous to our full and final recovery.

Grief creeps in at our eyes, at our ears, and almoſt every where: it ſeizeth upon our head, our hearts, our fleſh, our ſpirits: and what part doth eſcape it? fears devour us, and darken our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, as the froſt nips the buds: cares feed upon our our ſpirits, as the ſcorching ſun doth wither the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate flowers. Or, if any hath fortified his inwards againſt theſe, yet he is naked ſtill without.</p>

What tender pieces are theſe duſty bodies? What brittle glaſſes do we bear about us? And how many thouſand dangers are they hurried through? And how hardly cured if once cracked? O the multitude of ſlender veins, of tender membranes, nerves, fibres, muſcles, arteries; and all ſubject to obſtructions, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, contractions, reſolutions, ruptures, or one thing or other to cauſe their grief! Every one is a fit ſubject for pain, and fit to communicate that pain to the whole: but ſin, and fleſh, and duſt, and pain, will all be left behind together.</p>
               <p>O the bleſſed tranquility of that region, where there is nothing but ſweet continued peace! No ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of joy there, becauſe no intermiſſion. Our lives will be but one joy, as our time will be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into one eternity. O healthful place, where none are ſick! O fortunate land, where all are kings! O place moſt holy, where all are prieſts! How free a ſtate, where none are ſervants, ſave to their ſupreme monarch! Our face ſhall no more be pale or ſad; our groans and ſighs will be done away, and GOD <hi>ſhall wipe away all tears from our eyes.</hi> No more parting of friends, nor voice of lamentation heard in our dwellings; no more breaches nor diſproportion in our friendſhip; nor any trouble accompanying our rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: no more care of maſters for ſervants, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents for children, or magiſtrates over ſubjects, or miniſters over people.

Hold out then a little longer, O my ſoul; bear with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of thine earthly tabernacle; endure that ſhare of ſorrows, that the love of thy Father ſhall impoſe; ſubmit to his indignation alſo, becauſe thou haſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

<q>
                     <l>Sorrow was all my ſoul; I ſcarce believed,</l>
                     <l>Till grief did tell me roundly, that I lived.</l>
                  </q>
ſhall then feel, that GOD and joy is all thy ſoul; the fruition of whom, with thy freedom from all theſe ſorrows, will more ſweetly, and more feelingly make thee know, and to his eternal praiſe acknowledge, that thou liveſt. And thus we ſhall reſt from all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
               <p>The laſt bleſſed attribute of this reſt is, that it is an <hi>eternal reſt.</hi> This is the crown of our crown; without which all were comparatively nothing. The very thought of leaving it would embitter all our joys; and the more, becauſe of the ſingular excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies we muſt forſake. It would be a hell in heaven to think of once loſing heaven: as it would be a kind of heaven to the damned, had they but hopes of once eſcaping.</p>
               <p>It makes our preſent life of little value (were it not for the reference it hath to eternity) to think that we muſt ſhortly lay it down. How can we take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in any thing, when we remember how ſhort that delight will be? But, O bleſſed eternity! where our lives are perplexed with no ſuch thoughts, nor our joys interrupted with any ſuch fears! O, what do I ſay when I talk of eternity? Can my ſhallow thoughts conceive it? To be eternally bleſſed, and ſo bleſſed! Surely this, if any thing, is the reſemblance of GOD: eternity is a piece of infiniteneſs. Then, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting, O grave, where is thy victory?</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:022331_0069_0FB7F570E15FAF98"/>Days, and nights, and years, time and end, and death, are words which there have no ſignification; nor are uſed, except perhaps to extol eternity; as the mention of hell, to extol heaven: all the years of our LORD, and the years of our life, are ſwallowed up and los;t in this eternity.</p>
               <p>While we were ſervants, we held by leaſe; and that but for the term of tranſitory life: <hi>But the ſon abideth in the houſe for ever.</hi> Our earthly paradiſe in <hi>Eden</hi> had a way out, but none, that ever we could find, in again: but this eternal paradiſe hath a way in, (a milky way to us, but a bloody way to <hi>Chriſt</hi>) but no way out again: <hi>For they that would paſs from hence to you</hi> (ſaith <hi>Abraham) cannot:</hi> a ſtrange phraſe! would any paſs from ſuch a place, if they might? Could they endure to be abſent from GOD again one hour? No: but upon ſuppoſal they would, yet they could not. O then, my ſoul, let go thy dreams of preſent pleaſures: and looſe thy hold of earth and fleſh. Fear not to enter that eſtate, where thou ſhalt ever after ceaſe thy fears.

               <p>HAVING thus performed my firſt taſk of deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the ſaints reſt: it remains that now I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the ſecond, and ſhew you what theſe people of GOD are, and why ſo called; for whom this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reſt remaineth.</p>
               <p>Regeneration is the firſt and great qualification of the people of GOD. To be the people of GOD with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regeneration, is as impoſſible as to be the children of men without generation; ſeeing we are are born
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:022331_0071_0FB7F573F5EB2960"/>GOD'S enemies, we muſt be new-born his ſons, or elſe remain his enemies ſtill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſpoken it with his mouth, <hi>That except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of</hi> GOD. The greateſt reformation of life, without this new life wrought in the ſoul, may procure our fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deluſion, but never our ſalvation.</p>
               <p>But by what acts doth this new life diſcover itſelf?</p>
               <p>The firſt work I call conviction, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the knowledge of what the ſcripture ſpeaks againſt ſin and ſinners; and that this ſcripture which ſpeaks ſo, is the word of GOD himſelf. It compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends alſo, ſome knowledge of ourſelves, and our own guilt, and an acknowledgment of the verity of thoſe conſequences, which, from the practice of ſin in us, and threats in ſcripture, conclude us miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As there muſt be conviction, ſo alſo ſenſibility. GOD works on the heart, as well as the head: both were corrupted, and out of order. The principle of new life doth quicken both. All true ſpiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth paſs into affections. The great things of ſin, of grace, and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and eternity, which are of weight, one would think to move a rock; yet ſhake not the heart of the carnal profeſſor, nor pierce his ſoul to the quick: though he ſhould be a conſtant preacher of them to others, yet they little affect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: when he is preſſing them upon the hearts of others, you would little think how inſenſible is his own ſoul: his invention precureth him zealous and moving expreſſions, but they cannot procure him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable affections.</p>
               <p>The things that the ſoul is thus convinced and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, are eſpecially theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>
1. The evil of ſin. The ſinner is made to know and feel, that the ſin, which was his delight, is a more loathſome thing than toads or ſerpents, and a greater evil than plague or famine, or any other calamities: it being a breach of the righteous law of the moſt high GOD, diſhonourable to him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the ſinner.</p>
               <p>Now the ſinner reads and hears the reproofs of ſin, as words of courſe; but when you mention his ſin, he feels you ſpeak at his very heart, and yet is contented you ſhould ſhew him the worſt: he was wont to marvel, what made men keep ſuch a ſtir againſt ſin, what harm it was for a man to take a little pleaſure; he ſaw no ſuch heinouſneſs in it. But now the caſe is altered; GOD hath opened his eyes to ſee its inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible vileneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſoul in this great work is convinced and ſenſible, as of the evil of ſin, ſo of its own miſery by reaſon of ſin. They who before read the threats of GOD's law, as men do the ſtories of foreign wars; now find it is their own ſtory, and perceive they read their own doom, as if they found their names written in the curſe, or heard the law ſay, as <hi>Nathan, thou art the man.</hi> The wrath of GOD ſeemed to him but as a ſtorm to a man in a dry houſe: but now he finds the diſeaſe is his own, and feels the pains in his own bowels. In a word, he finds himſelf a condemned man, dead and damned in point of law, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is wanting but mere execution to make him abſolutely and irrecoverably miſerable.</p>
               <p>Whether you will call this a work of the law or goſpel, it is a work of the Spirit wrought in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in all the regenerate: And though ſome judge it unneceſſary bondage, yet it is beyond my conceiving, how he ſhould come to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for pardon, that firſt
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:022331_0073_0FB7F57F0F3B5E48"/>found not himſelf guilty and condemned: <hi>The whole need not the phyſician, but they that are ſick.</hi> Yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not, but the diſcovery of the remedy as ſoon as the miſery, may prevent a great part of the trouble, and the diſtinct effect on the ſoul, to be with much more difficulty diſcerned: nay, the actings of the ſoul are ſo quick, and oft ſo confuſed, that the diſtinct order of theſe workings may not be apprehended or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered at all: and perhaps the joyful apprehenſions of mercy may make the ſenſe of miſery the ſooner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So doth the ſpirit alſo convince the ſoul, of the creature's vanity and inſufficiency. Every man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is a flat idolater, our hearts were turned from GOD in our firſt fall; and ever ſince the creature hath been our GOD: this is the grand ſin of nature: when we ſet up to ourſelves a wrong end, we muſt needs err in all the means. The creature is to every unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man his GOD: he aſcribeth to it the divine prerogatives, and alloweth it the higheſt room in his ſoul, or if ever he come to be convinced of miſery, he fleeth to it as his Saviour. Indeed GOD and his <hi>Chriſt</hi> have uſually the name; but the real expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is from the creature, and the work of GOD is laid upon it. His pleaſure, his profit, and his honour, is the natural man's trinity; and his ſelf, that is theſe in unity: indeed, it is that fleſh that is the principal idol; the other three are deified in their relation to ourſelves. It was our firſt ſin, to aſpire to be as gods; and it is the greateſt ſin that runs in our blood, and is propagated in our nature from generation to generation.</p>
               <p>When GOD ſhould guide us, we guide curſelves; when he ſhould be our ſovereign, we rule ourſelves. The laws which he gives us, we find fault with; and if we had had the making of them, we would have
<pb n="75"
                      facs="unknown:022331_0074_0FB7F580907C0438"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>made them otherwiſe: when he ſhould take care of us, (and muſt, or we periſh) we will care for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; when we ſhould depend on him daily, we had rather keep our ſtock ourſelves, and have our portion in our own hands; when we ſhould ſtand at his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, we would be at our own; and when we ſhould ſubmit to his Providence, we uſually quarrel at it; as if we knew better what is good for us than he, or how to diſpoſe all things more wiſely. This is the language of a carnal heart, though it doth not always ſpeak out. When we ſhould ſtudy GOD, we ſtudy ourſelves; when we ſhould mind GOD, we mind our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; when we ſhould love GOD, we love ourſelves; when we ſhould truſt GOD, we truſt ourſelves; when we ſhould honour GOD, we honour ourſelves; when we ſhould aſcribe to GOD and admire him, we aſcribe to, and admire ourſelves: and inſtead of GOD, we would have all mens eyes and dependence on us, and all mens thanks returned to us, and would gladly be the only men on earth extolled and admired by all.</p>
               <p>And thus we are naturally our own idols: but down falls this <hi>Dagon,</hi> when GOD does once renew the ſoul: it is the great buſineſs of that great work to bring the heart back to GOD. He convinceth the ſinner,
<list>
                     <item>1. That the creature can neither be his GOD, to make him;</item>
                     <item>2. Nor yet his <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to recover him from his miſery, to reſtore him to GOD, who is his happineſs.</item>
                  </list>
This GOD doth not only by preaching, but by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence a ſo; becauſe words will hardly take off the raging ſenſes, therefore doth GOD make his rod to ſpeak, and continue ſpeaking, till the ſinner hear, and hath learned this great leſſon.</p>
               <p>This is the great reaſon why affliction doth ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily concur in the work of converſion; theſe real arguments which ſpeak to the quick, will force a hearing when the moſt powerful words are ſlighted.
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:022331_0075_0FB7F58385AB3F88"/>When a ſinner made his credit his GOD, and GOD ſhall caſt him into the loweſt diſgrace; or bring him that idolized his riches, into a condition wherein they cannot help him, or cauſe them to take wings and fly away; what a help is here to this work of conviction? When a man that made his pleaſure his GOD, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eaſe, or ſports, or mirth, or company, or glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, or drunkenneſs, or cloathing, or buildings: or whatſoever a ranging eye, a curious ear, a raging appetite, or a luſtful heart could deſire, and GOD ſhall take theſe from him, or give him their ſting and curſe with them, and turn them all into gall and wormwood, what a help is here to conviction? When GOD ſhall caſt a man into a languiſhing ſickneſs, and inflict wounds and anguiſh on his heart, and ſtir up againſt him his own conſcience, and then as it were take him by the hand, and lead him to credit, to riches, to pleaſure, to company, to ſports, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was deareſt to him, and ſay, now try if theſe can help you; can theſe heal thy wounded conſcience? Can they now ſupport thy tottering cottage? Can they keep thy departing ſoul in thy body? Or ſave thee from mine everlaſting wrath? Will they prove to thee eternal pleaſures? Or redeem thy ſoul from the eternal flames? Cry aloud to them, and ſee now whether theſe will be inſtead of GOD and his <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto thee. O how this works with the ſinner! when ſenſe itſelf acknowledgeth the truth, and even the fleſh is convinced of the creature's vanity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth thing that the ſoul is convinced and ſenſible of, is the abſolute neceſſity, the full ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and perfect excellency of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>This conviction is not by mere argumentation, as a man is convinced of ſome unconcerning conſequence by diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the ſinner finds himſelf in another caſe than ever he was aware of: he feels an inſupportable burden upon him, and ſees there is none but <hi>Chriſt</hi> can take it off: he perceives that he is under the wrath of GOD, and that the law proclaims him a rebel and out-law, and none but <hi>Chriſt</hi> can make his peace: he is as a man purſued by a lion, that muſt periſh if he find not preſent ſanctuary: he feels the curſe doth lie upon him, and upon all he hath, for his ſake, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone can make him bleſſed: he is now brought to this dilemma, either he muſt have <hi>Chriſt</hi> to juſtify him, or be eternally condemned; he muſt have <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſave him, or burn in hell for-ever: he muſt have <hi>Chriſt</hi> to bring him again to GOD, or be ſhut out of his preſence everlaſtingly. And no wonder, if he cry, as the martyr <hi>Lambert, none but</hi> Chriſt; <hi>none but</hi> Chriſt. It is not gold but bread, that will ſatisfy the hungry: nor any thing but pardon, that will comfort the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. <hi>All things are now but droſs and dung;</hi> and <hi>what he counted gain, is now but loſs in compariſon of</hi> Chriſt: for as the ſinner feeth his utter miſery, and the diſability of himſelf, and all things to relieve him; ſo he doth perceive, that there is no ſaving mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy out of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> There is none found in heaven or on earth that can open the ſealed book ſave the Lamb; without his blood there is no remiſſion, and without remiſſion there is no ſalvation. Could the ſinner now make any ſhift without <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or could any thing elſe ſupply his wants, and ſave his ſoul, then might <hi>Chriſt</hi> be diſregarded: but now he is convinced, that there is no other name, and the neceſſity is abſolute.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as the ſoul is thus convinced of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo alſo of his full ſufficiency: he ſees, though the creature cannot, and himſelf cannot, yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> can. Though the fig-leaves of our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:022331_0077_0FB7F5917419E7E8"/>righteous righteouſneſs are too ſhort to cover our nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, yet the righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is large enough: ours is diſproportionable to the juſtice of the law, but <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s doth extend to every tittle: his ſufferings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perfect ſatisfaction to the law, and <hi>all power in heaven and earth being given to him,</hi> he is now able to ſupply every of our wants, and <hi>to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſoul is alſo here convinced of the perfect excellency of JESUS CHRIST, both as he is conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in himſelf, and as conſidered in relation to us; both as he is the only way to the Father, and as he is the end, being one with the Father. Before he knew <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s excellency, as a blind man knows the light of the ſun; but now, as one that beholdeth his glory.</p>
               <p>And thus doth the Spirit convince the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. After this ſenſible conviction, the will diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alſo its change; and that in regard of all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned objects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſin which the underſtanding pronounceth evil, the will doth turn from with abhorrency. Not that the ſenſitive appetite is changed, or any way made to abhor its object; but when it would carry us to ſin againſt GOD; this diſorder and evil the will abhorreth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The miſery alſo which ſin hath procured, as he diſcerneth, ſo he bewaileth. It is impoſſible that the ſoul now living, ſhould look either on its treſpaſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt GOD, or its own ſelf procured calamity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome compunction. He that truly diſcerneth, that he hath killed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and killed himſelf, will ſurely in ſome meaſure be pricked to the heart. If
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:022331_0078_0FB7F596F670FB30"/>he cannot weep, he can heartily groan; and his heart — feels what his underſtanding ſees.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The creature he now renounceth as vain, and turneth it out of his heart with diſdain. Not that he undervalueth it or diſclaimeth its uſe; but its idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous abuſe, and its unjuſt uſurpation.</p>
               <p>There is a two-fold error very common in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of the work of converſion. The one, of thoſe who only mention the ſinner's turning from ſin to GOD, without mentioning the receiving <hi>Chriſt</hi> by faith. The other, of thoſe who only mention a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's believing, and then think they have ſaid all: nay, they blame them as Legaliſts, who make any thing but the bare believing of the love of GOD in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to us, to be part of the work; and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade poor ſouls to queſtion all their former comforts, and conclude the work to have been only legal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have made their change of heart and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſin, part of it; and have taken up part of their comfort from the reviewing of theſe.</p>
               <p>Indeed, ſhould they take up here without <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or take ſuch a change inſtead of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in whole or in part, the reprehenſion were juſt. But can <hi>Chriſt</hi> be the way, where the creature is the end; is he not the only way to the Father? Can we ſeek to <hi>Chriſt</hi> to reconcile us to GOD, while in our hearts we prefer the creature before him? In the ſoul of every unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, the creature is both GOD and <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Can <hi>Chriſt</hi> be believed in, where our own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or any other thing, is truſted as our Saviour?</p>
               <p>The truth is: as turning from the creature to GOD, and not by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is no true turning; ſo believing in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> while the creature hath our hearts, is no true believing. And therefore in the work of ſelf-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:022331_0079_0FB7F5980D1C1440"/>whoever would find in himſelf a thorough ſincere work, muſt find an entire work; even the one of theſe as well as the other.</p>
               <p>In the review of which entire work, there is no doubt but his ſoul may take comfort. And it is not to be made ſo light of, as moſt do, that ſcripture doth ſo ordinarily put repentance before faith, and make them jointly conditions of the goſpel: which repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance contains thoſe acts of the will before expreſſed.</p>
               <p>It is true, if we take faith in the largeſt ſenſe, then it contains repentance in it: but if we take it ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no doubt there are ſome acts of it go before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſome follow after.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And as the will is thus averted from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned objects; ſo at the ſame time doth it cleave to GOD the Father, and to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Its firſt acting conſiſts eſpecially in intending and deſiring GOD for his portion and chief good; having before been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that nothing e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe can be his happineſs, he now finds it in GOD; and therefore looks towards it. But it is yet rather with deſire than hope. For alas, the ſinner hath already found himſelf to be a ſtranger and an enemy to GOD, under the guilt of ſin and curſe of the law, and knows there is no coming to him in peace till his caſe be altered; and therefore having before been convinced alſo, that only <hi>Chriſt</hi> is able and willing to do this, and having heard this mercy in the goſpel freely offered; his next act is, to accept of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as his Saviour and Lord.</p>
               <p>Therefore both miſtake: they who only mention our turning to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and they who only mention our turning to GOD, in this work of converſion. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching was <hi>repentance towards</hi> GOD, <hi>and faith toward our</hi> Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And <hi>life eternal
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:022331_0080_0FB7F59A1E2C0F60"/>conſiſts, firſt in knowing the only true</hi> GOD, and then <hi>Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent,</hi> John xvii. 3. The former is the natural part of the covenant, to take the LORD only for our GOD. The latter is the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural part, to take <hi>Chriſt</hi> only for our Redeemer. The former is firſt neceſſary, and implied in the latter.</p>
               <p>Though repentance and good works are required to our full juſtification at judgment, as ſubſervient to; or concurrent with faith; yet is the nature of this juſtifying faith itſelf contained, in accepting of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for Saviour and Lord. I call it accepting, it being principally an act of the will; but yet alſo of the whole ſoul. This accepting being that which the goſpel preſſeth to, and calleth the receiving or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting <hi>Chriſt.</hi> I call it an affectionate accepting, though love ſeem diſtinct from faith, yet I take it as eſſential to that faith that juſtifies. To accept <hi>Chriſt</hi> without love, is not juſtifying faith. Nor doth love follow as a fruit, but immediately concur; as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a true accepting.</p>
               <p>It is an accepting him for our Saviour and Lord. For in both relations will he be received, or not at all. It is not only to acknowledge his ſufferings, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of pardon and glory, but to acknowledge his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, and ſubmit to his government and way of ſaving.</p>
               <p>The work (which <hi>Chriſt</hi> thus accepted of, is to perform) is, to bring the ſinners to GOD, that they may be happy in him; and this both really by his Spirit, and relatively in reconciling them, and making them ſons; and to preſent them perfect before him at laſt, and to poſſeſs them of the kingdom. The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of theſe are the ſinner's lawful ends in receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and to theſe uſes doth he offer himſelf to us.</p>
               <p n="5">

5. To this end doth the ſinner now enter into a cordial covenant with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But he was never ſtrictly, nor comfortably in covenant with <hi>Chriſt</hi> till now. He is ſure <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth conſent, and now doth he cordially conſent himſelf; and ſo the agreement is fully made.</p>
               <p n="6">6. With this covenant concurs, a mutual delivery; <hi>Chriſt</hi> delivereth himſelf in all comfortable relations to the ſinner, and the ſinner delivereth up himſelf to be ſaved and ruled by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now doth the ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvedly conclude, I have been blindly led by the fleſh, the world, and the devil, too long, almoſt to my deſtruction: I will now be wholly at the diſpoſal of my LORD, who hath bought me with his blood, and will bring me to his glory. And thus the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete work of ſaving faith conſiſteth in this covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or myſtical marriage of the ſinner to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you have a naked enumeration of the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of this people of GOD: not a full portraiture of them in all their excellencies, nor all the notes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they be diſcerned. And though it will be part of the following application, to put you upon trial: yet becauſe the deſcription is now before your eyes, and theſe evidencing works are freſh in your memory, it will not be unſeaſonable, to take an account of your own eſtates, and to view yourſelves exactly in this glaſs, before you paſs. And I beſeech thee, reader, as thou haſt the hope of a chriſtian, yea, or the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a man, to deal throughly, and ſearch carefully, and judge thyſelf as one that muſt ſhortly be judged by the righteous GOD: and faithfully anſwer to theſe few queſtions.</p>
               <p>And firſt, haſt thou been thoroughly convinced of an univerſal depravation, through thy whole ſoul? And an univerſal wickedneſs through thy whole

Haſt thou perceived thyſelf ſentenced to this death by it, and been convinced of thy undone condition? Haſt thou further ſeen the utter inſufficiency of every creature, either to be itſelf thy happineſs, or the means of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this thy miſery, and making thee happy in GOD? Haſt thou been convinced, that thy happineſs is only in GOD as the end? and only in <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the way to him? and that thou muſt be brought to GOD by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or periſh eternally? Haſt thou ſeen hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an abſolute neceſſity of enjoying <hi>Chriſt?</hi> and the full ſufficiency that is in him, to do for thee whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thy caſe requireth, by reaſon of the fulneſs of his ſatisfaction, the greatneſs of his power, the dignity of his perſon, and the freeneſs of his promiſes? Haſt thou diſcovered the excellency of this pearl, to be worth thy ſelling all to buy it? Hath all this been joined with ſome ſenſibility? As the convictions of a man that thirſteth, of the worth of drink? And not been only a change of opinion produced by reading and education, as a bare notion in the underſtanding? Hath it proceeded to an abhorring ſin? Have both thy ſin and miſery been a burden to thy ſoul? and if thou couldſt not weep, yet couldſt thou groan under the inſupportable weight of both? Haſt thou renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all thine own righteouſneſs? Haſt thou turned thy idols out of thy heart; ſo that the creature hath no more the ſovereignty; but GOD and <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Doſt thou accept of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as thy only Saviour, and expect thy juſtification, recovery and glory from him alone? Doſt thou take him alſo for Lord and King? And are his laws the moſt powerful commanders of thy ſoul? Do they ordinarily prevail againſt the commands of the fleſh, of <hi>Satan,</hi> of the greateſt on earth that ſhall countermand? and againſt the intereſt of thy credit,

Hath he the higheſt room in thy affections? So that though thou canſt not love him as thou wouldſt, yet nothing elſe is loved ſo much?

               <p>I HAVE been hitherto preſenting to your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, the excellency of the Reſt of the Saints. Let your hearts now cheerfully embrace it, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, and I ſhall preſent it to you, in its reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive uſes.</p>

                  <hi>The inconceivable miſery of the ungodly in their loſs of this Reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt, if this reſt be for none but the people of GOD, what tidings is this to the ungodly world? That there is ſo much glory, but none for them: ſo great joys for the ſaints of GOD, while they muſt
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:022331_0085_0FB7F5A711496E28"/>conſume in perpetual ſorrows! If thou who readeſt theſe words, art a ſtranger to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to the holy nature and life of his people, and ſhalt live and die in the condition thou art now in; I am a meſſenger of the ſaddeſt tidings to thee, that ever yet thy ears did hear: that thou ſhalt never partake of the joys of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor have the leaſt taſte of the ſaints eternal reſt. I may ſay to thee, as <hi>Ehud</hi> to <hi>Egl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n;</hi> I have a meſſage to thee from GOD: but it is a mortal meſſage, that as ſure as the word of GOD is true, thou ſhalt never ſee the face of GOD with comfort. This ſentence I am commanded to paſs upon thee! Take it as thou wilt, and eſcape it if thou canſt. I know, if thy heart and life were throughly changed, thy relation to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and eternity, would be changed alſo; he would then acknowledge thee for one of his people, and give thee a portion in the inheritance of his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. But if thou end thy days in thy preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſure as the heavens are over thy head, and the earth under thy feet; as ſure as thou liveſt and breatheſt in this air, ſo ſure ſhalt thou be ſhut out of this reſt of the ſaints, and receive thy portion in everlaſting ſire. I expect that thou ſhouldſt in the pride of thy heart, turn upon me, and ſay, and when did GOD ſhew you the book of life, or tell you who they are that ſhall be ſaved, and who ſhut out?</p>
               <p>I will not anſwer thee according to thy folly; but plainly diſcover this thy folly to thyſelf, that if there be yet any hope, thou mayſt recover thy underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and return to GOD and live: Firſt, I do not name thee, nor any other; I only conclude of the unregenerate in general, and of thee conditionally, if thou be ſuch an one. Secondly, I do not go about to determine who ſhall repent, and who ſhall not, much leſs, that thou ſhalt never repent, and come to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Theſe things are unknown to me; I had far rather ſhew thee what hopes thou haſt before thee, if thou
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:022331_0086_0FB7F5A905E78150"/>wilt not ſit ſtill and loſe them: and I would far ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſuade thee to hearken in time, before the door is ſhut againſt thee, that ſo thy ſoul may return and live, than tell thee that there is no hope of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and returning. But if the foregoing deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people of GOD do not agree with the ſtate of thy ſoul; it is then a hard queſtion, whether thou ſhalt ever be ſaved? Even as hard a queſtion, as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther GOD be true? Do I need to aſcend up into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to know, <hi>That without holineſs none ſhall ſee</hi> GOD? or, <hi>That only the pure in heart ſhall ſee</hi> GOD? or, <hi>That except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of</hi> GOD? Cannot theſe be known without ſearching into GOD's councils? And yet doſt thou aſk me, how I know who ſhall be ſaved? What need I go up to heaven to enquire that of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which he came down to earth to tell us? and ſent his Spirit in his prophets and apoſtles to tell us? and hath left upon record to all the world? And though I do not know the ſecrets of thy heart, and therefore cannot tell thee by name, whether it be thy ſtate, or no; yet if thou art but willing or diligent, thou mayſt know thyſelf, whether thou art an heir of heaven, or not. And that is the main thing that I deſire, that if thou be yet miſerable, thou mayſt diſcern it, and eſcape it. But canſt thou eſcape, if thou neglect <hi>Chriſt</hi> and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? <hi>If thou love father, mother, wife, children, houſes, lands, or thine own life better than Chriſt; if ſo, thou canſt not be his diſciple.</hi> And conſequently canſt never be ſaved by him. Is it not as impoſſible for thee to be ſaved, <hi>except thou be born again,</hi> as it is for the devils themſelves to be ſaved? Nay, GOD hath more plainly and frequently ſpoken it in the ſcripture, that ſuch ſinners as thou ſhall never be ſaved, than he hath done, that the devils ſhall never be ſaved. And do not theſe tidings go cold to thy heart? Methinks, but that there is yet life and hope before thee, and thou haſt yet time and means to have thy ſoul reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.

Much more do they want that moral perfection which the bleſſed partake of; thoſe holy diſpoſitions; that bleſſed conformity to the holineſs of GOD; that cheerful readineſs to do his will; that perfect rectitude of all their actions: inſtead of theſe, they have their old ulcerous deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſouls, that perverſeneſs of will, that diſorder in their faculties, that loathing of good, that love to evil, that violence of paſſion, which they had on earth. It is true, their underſtandings will be much cleared, both by the ceaſing of temptation and deluding ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and by the ſad experience which they will have in hell, of the falſehood of their former conceits and deluſions. But the evil diſpoſition is never the more changed; they have the ſame diſpoſitions ſtill, and ſain would commit the ſame ſins, if they could; they want but opportunity; certainly they ſhall have none of the glorious perfections of the faints, either in ſoul or body. There will be a greater difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:022331_0088_0FB7F5AE58AFCF18"/>theſe wretches and the glorified chriſtians, than there is betwixt a toad and the ſun in the firmament.</p>
               <p>But the great loſs of the damned, will be their loſs of GOD, they ſhall have no comfortable relation to him: nor communion with him. As <hi>they did not like to retain</hi> GOD <hi>in their knowledge;</hi> but bid him, <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As if GOD would father the devil's children; or, as if the ſlighters of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the friends of the world, the haters of godlineſs, or any that delight in iniquity, were the offspring of heaven! They are ready now, to lay confident claims to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as if they were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere believers. But when that time is come, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> will ſeparate his followers from his foes, and his faithful friends from his deceived flatterers, where then will be their preſumptuous claim? Then they ſhall find that GOD is not their father, but their foe, becauſe they would not be his people. And as they would not conſent that GOD ſhould by his Spirit dwell in them, ſo ſhall not theſe evil-doers dwell with him; the tabernacles of wickedneſs ſhall have no fellowſhip with him: nor the wicked inhabit the city of GOD; <hi>for without are dogs, ſorcerers, whore mongers, murderers, idolaters, and whatſoev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What were the body, but a loathſome carrion, if it had loſt the ſoul? Yet all theſe are nothing to the loſs of GOD. So that as the enjoyment of GOD, is the heaven of the ſaints; ſo the loſs of GOD is the hell of the ungodly.

Inſtead of being companions of thoſe happy ſpirits, and numbered with thoſe joyful and triumphing kings, they muſt now be members of the corporation of hell, where they ſhall have companions of a far different nature. While they lived on earth, they loathed the ſaints, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, baniſhed them, and caſt them out of their ſocieties, or at leaſt they would not be their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in labour, and in ſufferings; and therefore they ſhall not now be their companions in their glory. Now you are ſhut out of that company, from which you firſt ſhut out yourſelves; and are ſeparated from them whom you would not be joined with. You could not endure them in your houſes, nor in your

They moleſted you with their faithful reproving your ſin: their holy converſation troubled you. You ſcarce ever heard them pray or ſing praiſes in their families, but it was a vexation to you; and you envied their liberty of worſhipping GOD. And is it then any wonder if you be ſeparated from them hereafter? The day is near when they will trouble you no more; betwixt them and you will be a great gulf ſet, that thoſe that would paſs from thence to you (if any had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to eaſe you with a drop of water) cannot, neither can they paſs to them, who would go from you.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The Aggravation of the Loſs of Heaven to the Ungodly.</head>
               <p>I KNOW many will be ready to think, if this be all, they do not much care: what care they for loſing the perfections above? What care they for loſing GOD, his favour, or his preſence? They lived mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily without him on earth, and why ſhould it be ſo grievous to be without him hereafter? and what care they for being deprived of that love, and joy, and praiſing of GOD. They never taſted ſweetneſs in the things of that nature; or what care they for being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the fellowſhip of angels and ſaints? They could ſpare their company in this world well enough,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:022331_0091_0FB7F5B8F0720DC8"/>and why may they not be without it in the world to come? To make theſe men therefore underſtand the truth of their future condition, I will here annex theſe two things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. I will ſhew you why this loſs will be intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and moſt tormenting then, though it ſeem as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now.</item>
                  <item>2. I will ſhew you what other loſſes will accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny theſe; which, though they are leſs in themſelves, yet will now be more ſenſibly apprehended.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Then, That this loſs of heaven will be moſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, may appear by theſe conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The underſtandings of the ungodly will be then cleared, to know the worth of that which they have loſt. Now they lament not their loſs of GOD, becauſe they never knew his excellency, nor the loſs of that holy employment and ſociety, for they were never ſenſible what they were worth. A man that hath loſt a jewel, and took it but for a common ſtone, is never troubled at his loſs; but when he comes to know what he has loſt, then he lamenteth it.</p>
               <p>Though the underſtandings of the damned will not then be ſanctified; yet will they be cleared from a multitude of errors. They think now that their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, their eſtates, their pleaſures, their health and life, are better worth their labour, than the things of another world; but when theſe things which had their hearts, have left them in miſery, when they know by experience, the things which before they did but read and heard of, they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> be quite in another mind. They would not believe that water would drown, till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> were in the ſea; nor that the fire would burn, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> were caſt into it; but when they ſeel it, they
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:022331_0092_0FB7F5BCA7CC89A0"/>will eaſily believe. All that error of their mind, which made them ſet light by GOD, and abhor his worſhip, and vilify his people, will then be removed by experience; their knowledge ſhall be increaſed, that their ſorrows may be increaſed. Doubtleſs thoſe poor ſouls would be comparatively happy, if their underſtandings were wholly taken from them, if they had no more knowledge than idiots, or brute beaſts; or if they knew no more in hell, than they did upon earth, their loſs and miſery would then leſs trouble them.</p>
               <p>How happy would they now think themſelves, if they did not know there is ſuch a place as heaven! Now when their knowledge would help to prevent their miſery, they will not know: but then when their knowledge will but feed their conſuming fire, they ſhall know whether they will or no.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The loſs of heaven will more torment them then, becauſe, as the underſtanding will be cleared, ſo it will be more enlarged, and made more capacious, to conceive of the worth of that glory which they have loſt. The ſtrength of their apprehenſions, as well as the truth of them, will then be increaſed. What deep apprehenſions of the wrath of GOD, of the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſinning, of the miſery of ſinners, have theſe ſouls that now endure this miſery, in compariſon of thoſe on earth that do but hear of it? What ſenſible apprehenſions of the worth of life, hath the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, man that is going to be executed, in compariſon of what he was wont to have in the time of his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity? Much more will the actual deprivation of eternal bleſſedneſs make the damned exceeding appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of the greatneſs of their loſs: and as a large veſſel will hold more water than a ſhell, ſo will their more enlarged underſtandings contain more matter to feed their torment, than now their ſhallow capacity can do.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="94" facs="unknown:022331_0093_0FB7F5BF2D959DE0"/>
3. And as the damned will have deeper apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the happineſs they have loſt, ſo will they have a cloſer application of this doctrine to themſelves, which will exceedingly tend to increaſe their torment. It will then be no hard matter to them to ſay, this is my loſs, and this is my everlaſting miſery. The want of this is the main cauſe why they are now ſo little troubled at their condition; they are hardly brought to believe that there is ſuch a ſtate of miſery, but more hardly to believe that it is like to be their own. This makes ſo many ſermons to be loſt, and all threatenings and warnings prove in vain. Let a miniſter of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhew them their miſery never ſo plainly, they will not be perſuaded that they are ſo miſerable. Let him tell them of the glory they muſt loſe, and the ſufferings they muſt feel, and they think it is not they whom he means. We find in all our preaching, by ſad experience, that it is one of the hardeſt things in the world to bring a wicked man to know that he is wicked; a man who is in the way to hell, to know that he is in that way; or to make a man ſee himſelf in a ſtate of wrath and condemnation: how ſeldom do we hear men, after the plaineſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their condemned ſtate, cry out, <hi>I am the man!</hi> or to acknowledge, that if they die in their preſent condition, they are undone for-ever.</p>
               <p>There is no perſuading men of their miſery till they fell it, except the Spirit of the Almighty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them.</p>
               <p>Oh, but when they find themſelves ſuddenly in the land of darkneſs, perceive by the execution of the ſentence that they were indeed condemned, and feel themſelves in the ſcorching flames, and ſee that they are ſhut out of the preſence of GOD for-ever, it will then be no ſuch difficult matter to convince them of their miſery: this particular application of GOD'S anger to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:022331_0094_0FB7F5C150772A08"/>will then be the eaſieſt matter in the world; then they cannot chooſe but know and apply it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Again, as the underſtandings and conſciences of ſinners will be ſtrengthened, ſo will their affections be more lively and enlarged: as judgment will be no longer blinded, nor conſcience ſtifled, ſo the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be no longer ſtupified. A hard heart now makes heaven and hell ſeem but trifles: and when we have ſhewed them everlaſting glory and miſery, they are as men half aſleep, they ſcarce take notice what we ſay, our words are caſt as ſtones againſt a hard wall, which fly back in the face of him that caſteth them. We talk of terrible aſtoniſhing things, but it is to dead men that cannot apprehend it: we ſpeak to rocks rather than to men; the earth will as ſoon tremble as they. But when theſe dead wretches are revived, what paſſionate ſenſibility! what working affections! what pangs of horror! what depth of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row will there then be! How violently will they fly in their own faces! How will they rage againſt their former madneſs! The lamentations of the moſt paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate wife for the loſs of her huſband, or of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt mother for the loſs of her children, will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to theirs for the loſs of heaven. Oh, the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſing, and ſelf-tormenting fury of thoſe forlorn wretches! How they will even tear their own hearts, and be GOD'S executioners upon themſelves! I am perſuaded, as it was none but themſelves that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſin, and themſelves that were the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe of their ſufferings, ſo themſelves will be the chief executioners of thoſe ſufferings; GOD will have it ſo for the clearing of his juſtice: even Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as he was not ſo great a cauſe of their ſinning as themſelves, ſo will he not be ſo great an inſtrument of their torment. How happy would you think your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves then, if you were turned into rocks, or any
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:022331_0095_0FB7F5C5673FDA00"/>thing that had neither paſſion or ſenſe! How happy were you, if you could now feel, as lightly as you were wont to hear! And if you could ſleep out the time of execution, as you did the time of the ſermons that warned you of it! But your ſtupidity is gone, it will not be.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Moreover, it will much increaſe the torment of the damned, that their memories will be as large and ſtrong as their underſtandings and affections. Were their loſs never ſo great, and their ſenſe of it never ſo paſſionate, yet if they could but loſe the uſe of their memory, thoſe paſſions would die, and that loſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forgotten, would little trouble them. But as they cannot lay by their life and being, ſo neither can they lay aſide any part of that being. Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, conſcience, affections, memory, muſt all live to torment them, which ſhould have helped to their happineſs. And as by theſe they ſhould have fed upon the love of GOD, and drawn forth perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the joys of his preſence; ſo by theſe muſt they now feed upon the wrath of GOD, and draw forth continually the pains of his abſence.</p>
               <p>And yet theſe men would never be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider; but in the latter days (ſaith the LORD) they ſhall perfectly conſider it: when they are enſnared in the work of their own hands: when GOD hath arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and judgment is paſſed upon them, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is poured out upon them to the full, then they cannot chooſe but conſider it whether they will or no. Now they have no leiſure to conſider, nor any room in their memories for the things of another life. But then they ſhall have leiſure enough, they ſhall be where they have nothing elſe to do; their memories ſhall have no other employment, it ſhall be engraven upon the tables of their hearts. GOD would have had the doctrine of their eternal ſtate to have been
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:022331_0096_0FB7F5C649F7F8B0"/>written on the poſts of their doors, on their houſes, on their hands, and on their hearts: and ſeeing they rejected this counſel of the LORD, therefore ſhall it be written always before them in the place of their thraldom, that which way ſoever they look, they may ſtill behold it.</p>
               <p>I will briefly lay down ſome of thoſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which will thus feed the anguiſh of theſe damned wretches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It will torment them to think of the greatneſs of the glory which they have loſt. Oh if it had been that which they could have ſpared, it had been a ſmall matter: Or, if it had been a loſs reparable with any thing elſe; if it had been health, or wealth, or friends, or life, it had been nothing; but to loſe <hi>that exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eternal weight of glory!</hi>—</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will torment them to think of the poſſibility that once they were in of obtaining it. Then they will remember, the time was, when I was in as fair a poſſibility of the kingdom as others; I was ſet upon the ſtage of the world; if I had played my part wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faithfully, now I might have had poſſeſſion of the inheritance; I might have been amongſt yonder bleſſed ſaints, who am now tormented with theſe damned fiends! The Lord did ſet before me life and death, and having choſen death, I deſerve to ſuffer it: the prize was once held out before me; if I bad run well, I might have obtained it: if I had ſtriven, I might have had the maſtery: if I had fought valiantly, I had been crowned.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will yet more torment them to remember, not only the poſſibility, but the great probability that once they were in, to obtain the crown. It will then wound them, to think: why, I had once the gales
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:022331_0097_0FB7F5C8EBDE8B88"/>of the Spirit ready to have aſſiſted me. I was fully purpoſed to have been another man, to have cleaved to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to have forſook the world; I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt reſolved to have been wholly for GOD: I had even caſt off my old companions, and yet I turned back, and loſt my hold, and broke my promiſes, and ſlacked my purpoſes; almoſt GOD had perſuaded me to be a real chriſtian, and yet I conquered thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions. What workings were in my heart! when a faithful miniſter preſſed home the truth. O how fair was I once for heaven! I had almoſt had i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and yet I have loſt it; if I had but followed on to ſeek the LORD, and blown up the ſparks of deſire which were kindled in me, I had now been bleſſed among the ſaints.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet further, it will much add to their torment to remember that GOD himſelf did condeſcend to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them: how long he did wait, how freely he did offer, how lovingly he did invite, and how impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately he did ſolicit them! how the Spirit did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtriving with their hearts, as if he were loth to take a denial: how <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtood knocking at the door of their hearts, ſermon after ſermon, and one ſabbath after another; crying out, open, ſinner, open thy heart to the Saviour, and <hi>I will come in and ſup with thee and thou with me.</hi> Why doſt thou thus delay? What doſt thou mean, that thou doſt not open to me? How long ſhall it be till thou attain to innocency? <hi>How long ſhall thy vain thoughts ledge within thee?</hi> Wo to thee, Oh unworthy ſinner! Wilt thou not be made clean? Wilt thou not be pardoned and ſanctified, and made happy? When ſhall it once be?

Shall the GOD of all the world beſeech thee to be happy, and beſeech thee to have pity upon thine own ſoul, and wilt thou not regard him? Why did he make thy ears but to hear his voice? Why did he make thy underſtanding, but to conſider? Or thy heart, but to entertain the Son in love? <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, conſider thy ways.</hi>—</p>
               <p>Oh how all theſe paſſionate pleadings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> will paſſionately tranſport the damned with ſelf-indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! That they will be ready to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ear out their own hearts! How freſh will the remembrance of them be ſtill in their minds, lancing their ſouls with renewed torments! What ſelf-condemning pangs will it raiſe within them, to remember how oft <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have gathered them to himſelf <hi>even as the hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but they would not?</hi> Then will they cry out againſt themſelves, how juſtly is all this befallen me! Muſt I tire out the patience of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Muſt I make the GOD of heaven to follow me in vain, till I had wearied him with crying to me, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, return?</hi> Muſt the LORD of all the world thus wait upon me, and all in vain? O how juſtly is that patience now turned into fury, which falls upon my ſoul with irreſiſtible violence! when the LORD cried out to me in his word, <hi>How long will it be before thou wilt be made clean and holy?</hi> My heart, or at leaſt my practice anſwered, <hi>never;</hi> I will never be ſo preciſe: and now when I cry out, how long will it be till I be freed from this torment, and ſaved with the ſaints! how juſtly do I receive the anſwer! <hi>never, never.</hi>—Oh ſinner, I beſeech thee for thy own ſake, think of this while the voice of mercy ſoundeth in thine ears!

7. Yet much more will it add unto their torment, when they conſider that all this was their own doings, and that they wilfully procured their own deſtruction: had they been forced to ſin, it would much abate the rage of their conſciences, or if they were puniſhed for another man's tranſgreſſions: or if any other had been the chief author of their ruin: but to think, that it was the choice of their own wills, and that GOD had ſet them in ſo free a condition, that none in the world could have forced them to ſin againſt their wills, this will be a griping thought. What (thinks this wretched creature) had I not enemies enough in the world, but I muſt be an enemy to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? GOD would neither give the devil, nor the world, ſo much power over me, as to force me to commit the leaſt tranſgreſſion. If I had not conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their temptations had been in vain; they could but entice me, it was myſelf that yielded, and did the evil; and I muſt needs lay hands upon my own ſoul, and imbrue my hands in my own blood. Who ſhould pity me, who pitied not myſelf, and who brought all this upon mine own head? Never did GOD do me any good, or offer me any for the welfare of my ſoul, but I reſiſted him: he hath heaped mercy upon me, and renewed one deliverance after another, to entice my heart to him, and yet was I never heartily willing to ſerve him: he hath gently chaſtiſed me, and made me groan under the fruit of my diſobedience, and yet, though I promiſed largely in my affliction, I was never unfeignedly willing to obey him.</p>
               <p>Thus will it gnaw the hearts of theſe wretches, to remember that they were the cauſe of their undoing; and that they wilfully and obſtinately perſiſted in their rebellion, and were mere volunteers in the ſervice of the devil. They would venture, they would go on, they would not hear him that ſpoke againſt it: GOD called to them to hear and ſtay, but they would

What great undertakings did they engage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to effect their ruin, to reſiſt GOD, to conquer the Spirit, to overcome the power of mercies, judgments, and the word itſelf, to ſilence conſcience? All this they did take upon them and perform. What a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſins did they manage at once! What difficulties did they ſet upon! Even the conquering the power of reaſon itſelf. What dangers did they adventure on! Though they walked in continual danger of the wrath of GOD, and knew he could lay them in the duſt in a moment; though they knew they lived in danger of eternal perdition, yet would they run upon all this. What did they forſake for the ſervice of Satan, and the pleaſures of ſin? They forſook their GOD, their conſcience, their beſt friends, their hopes of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Oh the labour that it coſteth poor wretches to be damned! Sobriety they might have at a cheaper rate, and a great deal of health and eaſe too; and yet they will rather have gluttony and drunkenneſs, with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and ſhame and ſickneſs, with the out-cries and lamentations of wife and children, and conſcience it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Contentedneſs they might have with eaſe and delight; yet will they rather have covetouſneſs and ambition; though it coſt them ſtudy, and cares, and fears, and labour of body and mind, and continual unquietneſs and diſtraction of ſpirit. Though their
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:022331_0104_0FB7F25EC81BD228"/>anger be nothing but a tormenting themſelves, and revenge and envy conſume their ſpirits, and keep them upon a continual rack; though uncleanneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their bodies, and eſtates, and names; yet will they do and ſuffer all this, rather than ſuffer their ſouls to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>O how the reviews of this will feed the flames in hell! With what rage will theſe damned wretches curſe themſelves, and ſay, was damnation worth all this coſt and pains? Was it not enough that I periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enough my negligence, and that I ſat ſtill while <hi>Satan</hi> played his game, but I muſt ſeek ſo diligently my own perdition? Might I not have been damned on free coſt, but I muſt purchaſe it ſo dearly? I thought I could have been ſaved without ſo much ado: and could I not have been deſtroyed without ſo much ado? How well is all my care, and pains, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence now requited? Muſt I work out ſo laboriouſly my own damnation, when GOD commanded me to work out my ſalvation? O if I had done as much for heaven as I did for hell, I had ſurely had it. I cried out of the tedious way of godlineſs; and yet I could be at more pains for <hi>Satan,</hi> and for death. If I had loved <hi>Chriſt</hi> as ſtrongly as I did my pleaſures, and profits, and honours, and thought on him as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and ſought him as painfully, O how happy had I now been! But juſtly do I ſuffer the flames of hell, who would rather buy them ſo dear, than have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when it was purchaſed to my hands.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhewed you ſome of thoſe thoughts which will aggravate the miſery of theſe wretches for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. O that GOD would perſuade thee, who read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt theſe words, to take up theſe thoughts now, for the preventing that inconceivable calamity, ſo that thou mayeſt not take them up in hell as thy own tormentor.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> They ſhall loſe all Things that are comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as well as Heaven.</head>
               <p>HAVING ſhewed you thoſe conſiderations which will then aggravate their miſery, I am next to ſhew you their additional loſſes, which will aggravate it. For as <hi>godlineſs hath the promiſe both of this life, and that which is to come;</hi> and as GOD hath ſaid, <hi>That if we firſt ſeek his kingdom and righteouſneſs, all things elſe ſhall be added to us:</hi> ſo alſo are the ungodly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with the loſs both of ſpiritual and of corporal bleſſings; and becauſe they ſought not firſt <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s kingdom and righteouſneſs, therefore ſhall they loſe both it, and that which they did ſeek, and there ſhall be taken from them even that little which they have. If they could but have kept their preſent enjoyments, they would not have much cared for the loſs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: but catching at the ſhadow for the ſubſtance, they now find they have loſt both; and that when they rejected <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they rejected all things. If they had loſt and forſaken all for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they would have found all again in him; for he would have been all in all to them: but now they have forſaken <hi>Chriſt</hi> for other things, they ſhall loſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that alſo for which they did forſake him.</p>
               <p>But I will particularly open to you ſome of their other loſſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ſhall loſe their preſent conceit of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in GOD, and of his favour towards them, and of their part in the merits and ſufferings of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This falſe belief doth now ſupport their ſpirits, and defend them from the terrors that would elſe ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:022331_0106_0FB7F26C5BB3CFE8"/>on them: but what will eaſe their trouble when this is gone? When they can believe no longer, they will be quiet no longer. If a man conceit that he is in ſafety, his conceit may make him cheerful till his miſery comes, and then both his conceit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts vaniſh.</p>
               <p>There is none of this believing in hell; nor any perſuaſion of pardon or happineſs, nor any boaſting of their honeſty, nor juſtifying themſelves. This was but <hi>Satan</hi>'s ſtratagem, that, being blindfold, they might follow him the more boldly; but then he will uncover their eyes, and they ſhall ſee where they are.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another addition to the miſery of the damned will be this: that with the loſs of heaven, they ſhall loſe all their hopes. In this life, though they were threatened with the wrath of GOD, yet their hope of eſcaping it did bear up their hearts. We can now ſcarce ſpeak with the vileſt drunkard, or ſwearer, or ſcorner, but he hopes to be ſaved for all this. O happy world, if ſalvation were as common as this hope; even thoſe whoſe helliſh nature is written in the face of their converſation, whoſe tongues plead the cauſe of the devil, and ſpeak the language of hell; yet ſtrongly hope for heaven, though the GOD of heaven hath told them no ſuch ſhall ever come there. Nay, ſo ſtrong are men's hopes, that they will diſpute the cauſe with <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf at judgment, and plead <hi>their eating and drinking in his preſence, their preaching in his name, and caſting out devils,</hi> (and theſe are more probable arguments than our baptiſm, and common profeſſion, and name of chriſtians) they will ſtiffly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ever they <hi>neglected Chriſt in hunger, nakedneſs, priſon,</hi> till <hi>Chriſt</hi> confute them with the ſentence of their condemnation. Though the heart of their hopes will be broken at their death; yet, it ſeems, they would fain plead for ſuch hope at the general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:022331_0107_0FB7F26DDDA67FF8"/>
But, O the ſad ſtate of theſe men, when they muſt bid farewell to all their hopes! When their hopes ſhall all periſh with them! <hi>The eyes of the wicked ſhall fail, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ir hope ſhall be as the giving up of the ghoſt.</hi> The giving up of the ghoſt is a fit, but terrible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of a wicked man's giving up his hopes.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Firſt,</hi> as the ſoul departeth not from the body without the greateſt pain, ſo doth the hope of the wicked depart. O the pangs that ſeize upon the ſoul of the ſinner at death and judgment, when he is parting with all his hopes!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſoul departeth from the body ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in a moment, which hath there delightfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo many years: juſt ſo doth the hope of the wicked depart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſoul which then departeth, will never return to live with the body in this world any more; and the hope of the wicked, when it departeth, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an everlaſting farewell of his ſoul. A miracle of reſurrection ſhall again conjoin the ſoul and body, but there ſhall be no ſuch miraculous reſurrection of the damned's hope.</p>
               <p>Methinks it is the moſt doleful ſpectacle that this world affords, to ſee an ungodly perſon dying; his ſoul and hopes departing together! With what a ſad change he appears in another world! Then if a man could but ſpeak with that hopeleſs ſoul, and aſk it, are you now as confident of ſalvation as you were wont to be? Do you now hope to be ſaved as ſoon as the moſt godly? O what a ſad anſwer would he return!</p>
               <p>O that careleſs ſinners would be awakened to think of this in time! If thou be one of them, who art reading theſe lines, I do here, as a friend, adviſe thee,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:022331_0108_0FB7F26F51A8B0E0"/>that as thou wouldſt not have all thy hopes deceive thee, when thou haſt moſt need, thou preſently try them, whether they will prove current at the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of the ſcripture; and if thou find them unſound, let them go, whatſoever ſorrow they coſt thee. Reſt not till thou canſt give a reaſon of all thy hopes; till thou canſt prove, that they are the hopes which grace and not nature, hath wrought; that they are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſcripture-promiſes; that they purify thy heart; that they quicken, and not cool thy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in godlineſs; that the more thou hopeſt, the leſs thou ſinneſt, and the more painful thou art in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing on the work, and not grown more looſe and careleſs by the increaſing of thy hopes; that thou art willing to have them tried, and fearful of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; that they ſtir up thy deſires of enjoying what thou hopeſt for, and the deferring thereof is the trouble of thy heart.</p>
               <p>There is a hope which is a ſingular grace and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and there is a hope which is a notorious, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſin: ſo conſequently there is a deſpair which is a grievous ſin; and there is a deſpair which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to thy ſalvation.</p>
               <p>I would not have thee deſpair of the ſufficiency of the blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to ſave thee, if thou believe, and heartily obey him; nor of the willingneſs of GOD to pardon and ſave thee, if thou be ſuch a one: nor yet abſolutely of thy own ſalvation, becauſe while there is life and time, there is hope of thy converſion, and ſo of thy ſalvation; nor would I draw thee to deſpair of finding <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if thou do but heartily ſeek him: but this is the deſpair that I would perſuade thee to, as thou loveſt thy ſoul; that thou deſpair of ever being ſaved, except thou be born again; or of ſeeing GOD, without holineſs; or eſcaping periſhing, except thou ſuddenly repent; or of ever having part in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:022331_0109_0FB7F274DE1464C8"/>thou love him above father, mother, or thy own life; or of ever truly loving GOD, or being his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, while thou loveſt the world, and ſerveſt it.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I would have thee deſpair of, and whatever elſe GOD hath told thee ſhall never come to paſs. And when thou haſt ſadly ſearched into thy own heart, and findeſt thyſelf in any of theſe caſes, I would have thee deſpair of ever being ſaved in that ſtate thou art in. This kind of deſpair is one of the firſt ſteps to heaven.</p>
               <p>Conſider, if a man be quite out of his way, what muſt be the firſt means to bring him in again? Why a deſpair of ever coming to his journey's end in the way that he is in. If his home be eaſtward, and he be going weſtward, as long as he hopes he is in the right, he will go on: and as long as he goes on hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he goes further amiſs. Therefore when he meets with ſomebody that aſſures him that he is clean out of his way, and brings him to deſpair of coming home except he turn back again; then he wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l return, and then he may hope.</p>
               <p>Why, ſinner, juſt ſo it is with thy ſoul; thou art out of the way to heaven, and in that way thou haſt proceeded many a year; yet thou goeſt on quietly, and hopeſt to be ſaved, becauſe thou art not ſo bad as many others. Why, I tell thee, except thou throw away theſe hopes, and ſee that thou haſt all this while been quite out of the way to heaven; I ſay, till thou be brought to this, thou wilt never return and be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Who will turn out of his way while he hopes he is right? Remember what I ſay; till thou feel GOD convincing thee, that the way which thou haſt lived in will not ſerve thy turn, and ſo break down thy former hopes, there is yet no ſaving work wrought upon thee, how well ſoever thou mayſt hope

Another additional loſs, aggravating their loſs of heaven, is this, they ſhall loſe all their carnal mirth; they will ſay to themſelves (as <hi>Solomon</hi> doth) <hi>of their laughter, thou art mad; and of their mirth, what didſt thou?</hi> Eccleſ. ii. 2. Their pleaſant conceits are then ended, and their merry tales are all told, <hi>their mirth was but as the crackling of thorns under a pot,</hi> Eccleſ. vii. 6. It made a blaze for a while, but it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gone, and will return no more. They ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to entertain any ſaddening thoughts: the talk of death and judgment was irkſome to them, becauſe it damped their mirth: they could not endure to think of their ſin or danger, becauſe theſe thoughts did ſad their ſpirit: they knew not what it was to weep for ſin, or to humble themſelves under the mighty hand of GOD: they could laugh away ſorrow, and ſing away cares, and drive away theſe melancholy thoughts: they thought if they ſhould meditate, and pray, and mourn, as the godly do, their lives would be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual miſery.</p>
               <p>Alas, poor ſouls! What a miſery then will that life be, where you ſhall have nothing but ſorrow; intenſe, heart-piercing, multiplied ſorrow? When you ſhall have neither the joys of the ſaints, nor your own former joys? Do you think there is one merry heart in hell? Or one joyful countenance, or jeſting tongue? You cry now, <hi>A little mirth is worth a great deal of ſorrow:</hi> but ſurely a little godly ſorrow, which would have ended in eternal joy, had been more worth than a great deal of your fooliſh mirth, which will end in ſorrow.</p>

4. Another additional loſs will be this: they ſhall loſe all their ſenſual delights; that which they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed their chief good, their heaven, their falſe god, muſt they loſe, as well as GOD himſelf.</p>

As his duſt and bones will not be known from the duſt and bones of the pooreſt beggars; ſo neither will his ſoul be honoured or ſavoured any more than theirs. What a number of the great, noble, and learned, are now ſhut out of the preſence of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> They are ſhut out of their well contrived houſes, and ſumptuous buildings; their comely chambers, with coſtly hangings; their ſoft beds, and eaſy couches. They ſhall not find their gallant walks, their curious gardens, with variety of beauteous fruits and flowers; their rich paſtures, and pleaſant meadows, and plenteous harveſt, and flocks and herds. Their tables will not be ſo ſpread and furniſhed, nor they ſo punctually attended and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. They have not there variety of dainty fare, or ſeveral courſes, to pleaſe their appetites to the full. The rich man there fareth not deliciouſly eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, neither ſhall he wear there his purple and fine linen.</p>
               <p>O that ſinners would remember this in the midſt of their jollity, and ſay to one another, we muſt ſhortly reckon for this. Will the remembrance of it then be comfortable or terrible? Will theſe delights accompany us to another world? How ſhall we look each other in the face, if we meet in hell? Will not the memorial of them be then our torment? Come, as we have ſinned together, let us pray together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſtir, that GOD would pardon us; and let us enter into a promiſe with one another that we will do thus no more, but will meet together in the worſhip of GOD, and help one another towards heaven, as

                  </gap>, ſenſible torments for the damned, is a matter beyond all doubt, and that they will be exceeding great, may appear by theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the principal author of them, which is GOD himſelf: as it was no leſs than GOD whom the ſinners had offended, ſo it is no leſs than GOD that will puniſh them for their offences. He hath prepared thoſe torments for his enemies. His continued anger will ſtill be devouring them. His breath of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will kindle the flames. His wrath will be an intolerable burden to their ſouls. If it were but a creature that they had to do with, they might better
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:022331_0113_0FB7F28281675830"/>bear it. But wo to him that falls under the ſtrokes of the Almighty! They ſhall feel to their ſorrow, <hi>That it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living</hi> GOD. It were nothing in compariſon to this, if all the world were againſt them, or if the ſtrength of all the creatures were united in one to inflict their penalty. What a conſuming fire is his wrath? <hi>If it he kindled here, and that but a little,</hi> how do we wither before it, <hi>as the graſs that it cut down before the ſun?</hi> How ſoon doth our ſtrength decay, and turn to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and our beauty to deformity! The flames do not ſo eaſily run through the dry ſtubble, as the wrath of GOD will feed upon theſe wretches. Oh, they that could not bear a priſon, or a gibbet, for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſcarce a few ſcorns, how will they now bear the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fire?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The place or ſtate of torment, is purpoſely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the glorifying GOD's juſtice. As all the works of GOD are great and wonderful, ſo thoſe above all, which are ſpecially intended for the eminent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of ſome of his attributes. When he will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify his power, he makes the worlds. The comely order of all, and ſingular creatures, declare his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. His providence is ſhewn, in ſuſtaining all things and maintaining order, and attending his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellet ends, amongſt the confuſed, perverſe, tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous agitations of a world of wicked, fooliſh ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying miſcreants. When a ſpark of his wrath doth kindle upon the earth, the whole world, ſave only eight perſons, are drowned, <hi>Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah</hi> and <hi>Zeboim,</hi> are burnt with fire from heaven to aſhes. The ſea ſhuts her mouth upon ſome. The earth doth open and ſwallow others. The peſtilence deſtroyeth them by thouſands. The preſent deplorable ſtate of the Jews may fully teſtify this to the world. And yet the glorifying of the two great attributes, of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and juſtice, is intended moſt eminently for the life
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:022331_0114_0FB7F287664E6198"/>to come. As therefore when GOD will purpoſely glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify his mercy, he will do it in a way that is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the comprehenſion of the ſaints that muſt enjoy it; ſo that the blood of his Son, and the enjoyment of himſelf immediately in glory, ſhall not be thought too high an honour for them: ſo alſo, when the time comes that he will purpoſely manifeſt his juſtice, it ſhall appear to be indeed the juſtice of GOD. The everlaſting flames of hell will not be thought too hot for the rebellious; and when they have there burned through millions of ages, he will not repent him of the evil which is befallen them. Oh, wo to the ſoul that is thus ſet up for a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t, for the wrath of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to ſhoot at! and for a buſh that muſt burn in the flames of his jealouſly, and never be conſumed!</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider who ſhall be GOD's executioners of their torment; and that is, firſt, <hi>Satan.</hi> Secondly, themſelves. Firſt, he that was here ſo ſucceſsful in drawing them from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> will then be the inſtrument of their puniſhment, for yielding to his temptations. It was a pityful fight to ſee the man poſſeſſed, that was bound with chains, and lived among tombs; and that other that would be caſt into the fire and into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but alas! that was nothing to the torment that <hi>Satan</hi> puts them to in hell: that is the reward he will give them for all their ſervice; for their rejecting the commands of GOD, and forſaking <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſouls at his perſuaſion. Ah, if they had ſerved <hi>Chriſt</hi> as faithfully as they did <hi>Satan,</hi> he would have given them a better reward. 2. And it is moſt juſt alſo, that they ſhould there be their own torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that they may ſee that their whole deſtruction is of themſelves; and they who were wilfully the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſe, ſhould alſo be the efficient in their own ſufferings; and then who can they complain of but themſelves?</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="116" facs="unknown:022331_0115_0FB7F289CB1134C8"/>
4. Conſider alſo that their torment will be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, not upon one part alone, while the reſt are free; but as all have joined in the ſin, ſo muſt all partake of the torment. The ſoul, as it was the chief in ſinning, ſhall be the chief in ſuffering; and as it is of a more ſpiritual and excellent nature than bodies are, ſo will its torments far exceed bodily ſufferings. And as the joys of the ſoul far ſurpaſs all ſenſual pleaſures, ſo the pains of the ſoul ſurpaſs corporal pains.</p>
               <p>And it is not only a ſoul, but a ſinful ſoul that muſt ſuffer: the guilt which ſtill remains upon it, will make it fit for the wrath of GOD to work upon: as fire will not burn, except the fuel be combuſtible; but if the wood be dry, how fiercely will it burn then! The guilt of their ſins will be as tinder to gunpowder to the damned ſoul, to make the flames of hell take hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with fury.</p>
               <p>And as the ſoul, ſo alſo the body muſt bear its part. That body that muſt needs be pleaſed, whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of its eternal ſafety, ſhall now be paid for its unlawful pleaſures. That body which was ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looked to, ſo tenderly cheriſhed—That body which could not endure heat or cold, or an ill ſmell, or a loathſome ſight: Oh what muſt it now endure! how are its haughty looks now taken down! how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle will thoſe flames regard its comelineſs and beauty! but as death did not regard it, nor the worms regard it, but as freely feed upon the face of the proud and luſtful dames, and the heart of the moſt ambitious lords or princes, as if they had been but beggars; ſo will their tormenters then as little pity their tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or reverence their lordlineſs. Thoſe eyes which were wont to be delighted with curious ſights, muſt then ſee nothing, but what ſhall amaze and terrify them; an angry GOD above them, and thoſe ſaints whom they ſcorned, enjoying the glory which they have
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:022331_0116_0FB7F28C1438B648"/>loſt; and about them will be only devils and damned ſouls; ah! then how ſadly will they look back and ſay, are all our feaſts, our games and revels come to this! Then thoſe ears which were wont to be delighted with muſic, ſhall hear the ſhrieks and cries of their damned companions; children crying out againſt their parents, that gave them encouragement and example in evil; huſbands crying out upon their wives, and wives upon their huſbands; maſters and ſervants curſing each other; miniſters and people; magiſtrates and ſubjects, charging their miſery upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for diſcouraging in duty, conniving at ſin, and being ſilent or formal when they ſhould have plainly told one another of their miſery, and fore-warned them of their danger. Thus will ſoul and body be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in calamity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And the greater by far will their torments be, becauſe they ſhall have no comfort leſt to mitigate them. In this life when a miniſter told them of hell, or conſcience began to trouble their peace, they had comforts enough at hand to relieve them: their carnal friends were all ready to comfort them, but now they have not a word of comfort either for him or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Formerly they had their buſineſs, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, their mirth, to drive away their fears; they could drink away their ſorrows, or play them away, or ſleep them away, or at leaſt, time did wear them away; but now all theſe remedies are vaniſhed. They had a hard, a preſumptuous unbelieving heart, which was a wall to defend them againſt troubles of mind; but now their experience bath baniſhed theſe, and leſt them naked to the fury of thoſe flames. Yea, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>Satan</hi> himſelf was their comforter, and would unſay all that the miniſter ſaid againſt them, as he did to our firſt mother. <hi>Hath</hi> GOD <hi>ſaid, Ye ſhall not eal? Ye ſhall not ſurely die.</hi> So doth he now: doth GOD tell you that you ſhall lie in hell? it is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:022331_0117_0FB7F28D5BA99AA0"/>GOD is more merciful: he doth but tell you ſo to fright you from ſinning: or if there be a hell, what need you fear it? are not you chriſtians? and ſhall you not be ſaved by <hi>Chriſt?</hi> was not his blood ſhed for you? Miniſters may tell you what they pleaſe, they would make men believe that they ſhall all be damned except they will fit themſelves to their humour.—Thus as the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the comforter of the ſaints, ſo <hi>Satan</hi> is the comforter of the wicked; for he knows if he ſhould now diſquiet them, they would no longer ſerve him; or if fears or doubts ſhould trouble them, they would bethink themſelves of their danger. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a thief more careful leſt he ſhould awake the people, when he is robbing the houſe, than <hi>Satan</hi> is, not to awaken a ſinner. But when the ſinner is dead, and he hath his prey, then he hath done flattering and comforting them. While the ſight of ſin and miſery might have helped to ſave them, he took all the pains he could to hide it from their eyes; but when it is too late, and there is no hope left, he will make them ſee and feel to the utmoſt. Oh, which way will the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn ſinner then look for comfort! They that drew him into the ſnare, and promiſed him ſafety, now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, and are forſaken themſelves. His ancient comforts are taken from him, and the righteous GOD, whoſe fore-warning he made light of, will now make good his word againſt him to the leaſt tittle.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But the great aggravation of this miſery, will be its eternity. That when a thouſand millions of ages are paſt, their torments are as freſh to begin as at the firſt day. If there were any hope of an end, it would eaſe them to foreſee it; but when it muſt be for-ever ſo, that thought is intolerable: much more will the miſery itſelf be. They never heartily repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their ſin, and GOD will never repent him of their ſuffering. They broke the laws of the eternal GOD, and therefore ſhall ſuffer eternal puniſhment.
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:022331_0118_0FB7F28F2E8F3468"/>They knew it was an everlaſting kingdom which they refuſed; and therefore what wonder if they be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly ſhut out of it? It was their immortal ſouls that were guilty of the treſpaſs, and therefore muſt immortally ſuffer the pains. What happy men would they think themſelves, if they might have lain ſtill in their graves, or continued duſt, or ſuffered no worſe than the gnawing of thoſe worms! Oh that they might but there lie down again! What a mercy now would it be to die? And how will they call and cry out for it? Oh death! whither art thou gone? Now come and cut off this doleful life. O that theſe pains would break my heart, and end my being! O that I might once die at laſt! O that I had never had a being!— Theſe groans will the thoughts of eternity wring from their hearts. They were wont to think the ſermon long, and prayer long; how long then will they think theſe endleſs torments? What difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the length of their pleaſures and of their pains? The one continued but a moment, the other endureth through all eternity. Oh that ſinners would lay this thought to heart! Remember how time is almoſt gone. Thou art ſtanding all this while at the door of eternity; and death is waiting to open the door, and put thee in. Go ſleep out but a few more nights, and ſtir up and down on earth a few more days, and then thy nights and days ſhall end; thy thoughts, and cares, and pleaſures, and all ſhall be devoured by eternity; thou muſt enter upon the ſtate which ſhall never be changed. As the joys of heaven are beyond our conceiving, ſo alſo are the pains of hell. Everlaſting torment is inconceivable torment.</p>
               <p>But methinks I perceive the obſtinate ſinner deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately reſolving, if I muſt be damned, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; rather than I will live ſo preciſely, I will put it to the venture; I ſhall eſcape as well as the reſt of my neighbours, and we will even bear it as well as
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:022331_0119_0FB7F293454F6000"/>we can.—Alas, poor creature! would thou didſt but know what it is that hou doſt ſo boldly venture on: I dare ſay thou wouldſt ſleep this night but very unquietly. Wilt thou leave thyſelf no room for hope? Art thou ſuch an implacable enemy to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and thy own ſoul? And doſt thou think indeed, that thou canſt bear the wrath of GOD, and go away ſo eaſily with theſe eternal torments? Yet let me beg this of thee, that before thou doſt ſo flatly reſolve, thou wouldſt lend thine attention to theſe few queſtions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Who art thou that thou ſhouldſt bear the wrath of GOD? Art thou a God; or art thou a man? What is thy ſtrength to undergo ſo much? is it not as the ſtrength of wax or ſtubble to reſiſt the fire? or as chaff to the wind; or as duſt before the whirlwind? Was he not as ſtout a man as thyſelf, who cried to GOD, <hi>Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? And wilt thou purſue the dry ſtubble?</hi> If thy ſtrength were as iron, and thy bones as braſs, thou couldſt not bear. If thy foundation were as the earth, and thy power as the heavens, yet ſhouldſt thou periſh at the breath of his indignation. How much more when thou art but a little, creeping, breathing clay, kept a few days from ſtinking, and from being eaten with worms, by the mere ſupport and favour of him whom then thus reſiſteſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If thou be ſo ſtrong, and thy heart ſo ſtout, why do thoſe ſmall ſufferings ſo diſmay thee? If thou have but a ſit of the gout or ſtone, what groans doſt thou utter? The houſe is filled with thy complaints. If thou ſhouldſt but loſe a leg or an arm, thou wouldſt make a great matter of it. If thou loſe thine eſtate, and fall into poverty and diſgrace; how heavily wouldſt thou bear any one of theſe? And yet all theſe laid together, will be one day accounted a happy ſtate, in compariſon of that which is ſuffered
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:022331_0120_0FB7F29918DA07B0"/>in hell. Let me ſee thee make as light of convulſive, gouty, rheumatic pains, when they ſeize upon thee, and then the ſtrength of thy ſpirit will appear. Alas, how many ſuch boaſters as thyſelf have I ſeen made ſtoop and cat their words! And when GOD hath but let out a little of his wrath, that <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſked, <hi>Who is the Lord?</hi> hath cried, <hi>I have ſinned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If all this be nothing, go try thy ſtrength by ſome corporal torment; as <hi>Bilney</hi> before he went to the ſtake, would firſt try his finger in the candle; ſo do thou: hold thy ſinger awhile in the fire, and feel there whether thou canſt endure the fire of hell. <hi>Auſtin</hi> mentioneth a chaſte chriſtian woman, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempted to uncleanneſs by a lewd ruffian, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him for her ſake to hold his finger one hour in the ſire; he anſwered, it is an unreaſonable requeſt: how much more unreaſonable is it (ſaid ſhe) that I ſhould burn in hell for the ſatisfying your luſt? So ſay I to thee; if it be an intolerable thing to ſuffer the heat of the are for a year, or a day, or an hour, what will it be to ſuffer ten thouſand times more for ever? What if thou wert to ſuffer <hi>Lawrence</hi>'s death, to be roaſted upon a grid-iron; or to be ſcraped or pricked to death, as other martyrs were? If thou couldſt not endure ſuch things as theſe, how wilt thou endure the eternal flames?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If thou be ſo fearleſs of that eternal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, why is the leaſt foretaſte of it ſo terrible? Didſt thou never feel ſuch a thing as tormenting conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? If thou haſt not, thou ſhalt do. Didſt thou never ſee and ſpeak with a man that lived in deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in ſome degree of theſe wounds of ſpirit that was near deſpair? How uncomfortable was their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? How burdenſome their lives? Nothing doth them good which they poſſeſs; the ſight of friends, or houſe, or goods, which refreſh others, is a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:022331_0121_0FB7F29ACED5A738"/>to them: they feel no ſweetneſs in meat or drink; they are weary of life, and fearful of death. What is the matter with theſe men? If the miſery of the damned itſelf can be endured, why cannot they more eaſily endure theſe little ſparks?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Tell me faithfully, what if thou ſhouldſt but ſee the devil appear to thee in ſome terrible ſhape, would it not daunt thee? What if thou ſhouldſt meet him in thy way home, or he ſhould ſhew himſelf to thee at night in thy bedchamber, would not thy heart ſail thee, and thy hair ſtand on end? I could name thee thoſe that have been as confident as thyſelf, who, by ſuch a ſight, have been ſo appalled, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they were in danger of being driven out of their wits. Or what if ſome damned ſoul, of thy former acquaintance, ſhould appear to thee, would not this amaze thee? Alas! what is this to the torments of hell? Canſt thou not endure a ſhadow to appear before thee? O how wilt thou endure to live with them for-ever, where thou ſhalt have no other company but devils and the damned: and ſhalt not only ſee them, but be tormented with them, and by them!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let me aſk thee, if the wrath of GOD be to be made ſo light of, why did the Son of GOD himſelf make ſo great a matter of it? When he had taken upon him the payment of our debt, and bore that puniſhment we had deſerved, it makes him ſweat water and blood; it makes the LORD of life to cry, <hi>My ſoul is heavy, even to the death.</hi> It makes him cry out upon the croſs, <hi>My</hi> GOD, <hi>my</hi> GOD, <hi>why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Surely, if any one could have borne theſe ſufferings, it would have been <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He had another meaſure of ſtrength to bear it than thou haſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="unknown:022331_0122_0FB7F29C5CA81710"/>
Wo to poor ſinners for their mad ſecurity! Do they think to find that tolerable to them which was ſo heavy to <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Nay, the Son of GOD is caſt into a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agony, and bloody ſweat, under the curſe of the law only; and yet the feeble, fooliſh creature makes nothing to bear alſo the curſe of the goſpel: the good LORD bring theſe men to their right minds by repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, leſt they buy their wit at too dear a rate.</p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewn you ſomewhat of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, who miſs of this reſt prepared for the ſaints. And now, reader, I demand thy reſolution, what uſe thou wilt make of all this? Shall it all be loſt to thee? Or wilt thou conſider it in good earneſt? Thou haſt caſt by many a warning of GOD, wilt thou do ſo by this alſo? Take heed what thou doſt, and how thou reſolveſt. GOD will not always ſtand warning and threatening. The hand of revenge is lifted up; the blow is coming, and wo to him on whom it lighteth. Little thinkeſt thou how near thou ſtandeſt to thy eternal ſtate, and how near the pit, thou art dancing in thy jollity. If thy eyes were but opened, as they will be ſhortly, thou wouldſt ſee all this that I have ſpoken before thine eyes, without ſtirring from the place in which thou ſtandeſt. Doſt thou throw by the book, and ſay, it ſpeaks of nothing but hell and damnation? Thus thou uſeſt alſo to complain of the miniſter; but wouldeſt thou not have us tell thee of theſe things? Should we be guilty of the blood of thy ſoul, by keeping ſilent that which GOD hath charged us to make known? Wouldſt thou periſh in eaſe and ſilence, and alſo have us to periſh with thee, rather than diſpleaſe thee, by ſpeaking the truth? If thou wilt be guilty of ſuch inhuman cruelty, GOD forbid we ſhould be guilty of ſuch ſottiſh folly!</p>
               <p>There are few preachers ſo ſimple, but they know that this kind of preaching is the ready way to be
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:022331_0123_0FB7F29F58C723C0"/>hated of their hearers: and the deſire of the ſavour of men is ſo natural, that few delight in ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing way. But I beſeech thee conſider, are theſe things true, or are they not? If they were not true, I would heartily join with thee againſt any miniſter that ſhould offer to preach them, and to affright poor people when there is no cauſe. But if theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings be the words of GOD, what a wretch art thou that wouldſt not hear it, or conſider it. Why, what is the matter? If thou be ſure that thou art one of the people of GOD, this doctrine will be a comfort to thee: but if thou be yet unregenerate, methinks thou ſhouldſt be as fearful to hear of heaven as of hell, except the bare name of heaven or ſalvation be ſufficient. Sure there is no doctrine concerning hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in all the ſcripture that can give thee any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but upon the ſuppoſal of thy converſion; what comfort is it to thee, to hear that there is a reſt remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the people of GOD, except thou be one of them? Nay, what more terrible, than to read of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for others, when thou muſt be ſhut out? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, except thou wouldſt have a miniſter to preach a lie, it is all one to thee, for any comfort thou haſt in it, whether he preach of heaven or hell to thee. His preaching heaven and mercy to thee, can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to intreat thee to ſeek them; but he can make thee no promiſe of it, but upon condition of thy obeying the goſpel; and his preaching hell, is but to perſuade thee to avoid it. And is not this doctrine fit for thee to hear? Indeed if thou wert quite paſt hope of eſcaping it, then it were in vain to tell thee of hell, but rather let thee take a few mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hours whilſt thou mayſt; but as long as thou art alive, there is hope of thy recovery, and therefore all means muſt be uſed to awake thee from thy le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy.</p>

Oh that ſome ſon of thunder, who could ſpeak as <hi>Paul,</hi> till the hearers tremble, were now to preach this doctrine to thee! Alas! as terrible as you think I ſpeak, yet is it not the thouſandth part of what muſt be felt; for what heart can now conceive, or what tongue expreſs the pains of thoſe ſouls that are under the wrath of GOD? Ah, that ever blind ſinners ſhould wilfully bring themſelves to ſuch unſpeakable miſery! You will then be crying to JESUS CHRIST, Oh mercy! Oh pity! Why, I do now in the name of the LORD JESUS cry to thee, Oh have mercy, have pity upon thine own ſoul! Shall GOD pity thee, who wilt not be entreated to pity thyſelf? If thy horſe ſee but a pit before him, thou canſt ſcarcely force him in; and wilt thou ſo obſtinately caſt thyſelf into hell, when the danger is foretold thee! <hi>Oh who can ſtand before the Lord, and who can abide the fierceneſs of his anger?</hi> Methinks thou ſhouldſt need no more words, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently caſt away thy ſins, and deliver up thyſelf to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Reſolve on it immediately, and let it be done, that I may ſee thy face in reſt among the ſaints. The LORD perſuade thy heart to it without longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay: but if thou be hardened unto death, and there be no remedy, yet do not ſay another day, but that thou waſt faithfully warned, and that thou hadſt a friend that would fain have prevented thy damnation.</p>

Would not a man wonder, that is in his right ſenſes, to ſee what riding and running, what ſcramb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and catching there is for a thing of nought, while eternal reſt lies by neglected! What contriving and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, what fighting and bloodſhed, to get a ſtep higher in the world than their brethren, while they neglect the kingly dignity of the ſaints! What inſatiable purſuit of fleſhly pleaſures, whilſt they look upon the praiſes of GOD, which is the joy of angels, as a burden! What unwearied diligence is there in raiſing their poſterity, enlarging their poſſeſſions, gathering a little ſilver or gold? Yea, perhaps for a poor living from hand to mouth, while in the mean time their judgment is drawing near; and yet how it ſhall go with them
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:022331_0126_0FB7F2A6DCD4AD20"/>then, or how they ſhall live eternally, did never put them to one hour's ſober conſideration.</p>
               <p>What riſing up early, fitting up late, labouring and caring year after year, to maintain themſelves and children in credit till they die; but what ſhall follow after, that they never think on; and yet theſe men cry to us, may not a man be ſaved without ſo much ado? How early do they rouſe up their ſervants to their labour? [Up, come away to work, we have this to do, and that to do;] but how ſeldom do they call them [Up, you have your ſoul to look to, you have everlaſting life to provide for; up to prayer, to the reading of the ſcripture.]</p>
               <p>What a gadding up and down the world is here, like a company of ants upon a hillock, taking inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant pains to gather a treaſure, which death will ſpurn abroad, as if it were ſuch an excellent thing to die in the midſt of wealth and honours! Or as if it would be ſuch a comfort to a man in another world, to think that he was a lord, or a knight, or a gentleman, or a rich man on earth! What hath this world done for its lovers and friends, that it is ſo eagerly followed, and painfully ſought after, while <hi>Chriſt</hi> and heaven ſtand by, and few regard them? Or what will the world do for them for the time to come? The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon entrance into it is through anguiſh and ſorrrow.

Will they go along with you to another world, and bribe the Judge, and bring you off clear; or purchaſe you a room among the bleſſed? Why then did ſo rich a man want a drop of water to cool his tongue? Or are the ſweet morſels of preſent delight and honour of more worth than eternal reſt? and will they recompenſe the loſs of that enduring treaſure?

Why this is the laſt and longeſt courteſy that we ſhall receive from it. But we ſhall have this whether we ſerve it or no; and even that homely, duſty dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it will not afford us always neither; it ſhall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs our duſt but till the reſurrection. How then doth the world deſerve ſo well at men's hands, that they ſhould part with <hi>Chriſt</hi> and their ſalvation to be its fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers? Ah vile deceitful world! how oft have we heard thy faithfulleſt ſervants at laſt complaining, Oh the world hath deceived me, and undone me! And yet ſucceeding ſinners will take no warning.</p>
               <p>So this is the firſt ſort of neglecters of heaven which fall under this reproof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort here to be reproved, are the profane, ungodly, preſumptuous multitude, who will not be perſuaded to be at ſo much pains for ſalvation, as to perform the common outward duties of religion. Yea, though they are convinced that theſe duties are commanded, yet will they not be brought to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice of them. If they have the goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the town where they dwell, it may be they will give the hearing to it one part of the day, and ſtay at home the other; or if the maſter come to the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, yet part of his family muſt ſtay at home. If they want the plain and powerful preaching of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, how ſew are there in a whole town who will tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:022331_0128_0FB7F2ABA95E4178"/>a mile or two to hear abroad, though they will go many miles to the market for their bodies.</p>
               <p>And though they know the ſcripture is the law of GOD, by which they muſt be acquitted or condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in judgment; and that it is the property of every bleſſed man to delight i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of ſalvation. But if they carry a bible to church, and let it lie by them all the week, this is the moſt uſe that they make of it. And though they are commanded to <hi>pray without ceaſing;</hi> and to <hi>pray always and not to faint;</hi> to <hi>continue in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and watch in the ſame with thankſgiving;</hi> yet will they not pray conſtantly with their families, or in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. You may hear in their houſes two oaths for one prayer. Or if they do any thing this way, it is uſually but a running over a few formal words which they have got on their tongues' end, as if they came on purpoſe to make a jeſt of prayer, and to mock GOD and their own ſouls.</p>
               <p>Alas, he that only reads in a book that he is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and what his foul ſtands in need of, but never felt himſelf miſerable, or felt his ſeveral wants, no wonder if be muſt alſo fetch his prayer from his book only, or at fartheſt from the ſtrength of his memory. <hi>Solomon</hi>'s requeſt to GOD was, that <hi>what prayer or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication ſoever ſhould be made by any man, or by all the people, when every man ſhall know his own ſore, and his own grief, and ſhall ſpread ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

If theſe men did thus know and feel every man the ſore, and the grief of his own ſoul, we ſhould neither need ſo much to urge them to prayer, nor to teach them how to perform it. Whereas now they invite GOD to be backward in giving, by their
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:022331_0129_0FB7F2ACDBDF73C8"/>backwardneſs in aſking; and to be weary of relieving them by their own being weary of begging; and to be ſeldom and ſhort in his favours, as they are in their prayers; and to give them but common and outward favours, as they put up but common and outſide re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. Yea, their cold and heartleſs prayers invite GOD to a flat denial: for among men it is taken for granted, that he who aſks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

And yet if one ſhould go from houſe to houſe, thro' town and pariſh, and enquire at every houſe as you go, whether they do morning and evening call their family together, and earneſtly ſeek the LORD in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; how few would you find that conſtantly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly practiſe this duty? If every door were marked where they do not thus call upon the name of GOD, that his wrath might be poured out upon that family, our towns would be as places overthrown by the plague, the people being dead within, and the mark of judgment without. I fear where one houſe would eſcape, ten would be marked out for death; then they might teach their doors to pray, LORD <hi>have mercy upon us;</hi> becauſe the people would not pray themſelves. But eſpecially if you could ſee what men do in their ſecret chambers, how few ſhould you find in a whole town that ſpend one quarter of an hour, morning and night in earneſt ſupplication to GOD for their ſouls? Oh how little do theſe men ſet by eternal reſt!</p>
               <p>Thus do they ſlothfully neglect all endeavours for their own welfare, except ſome public duty in the congregation, which cuſtom or credit doth engage them to. Perſuade them to read good books, and they will not be at ſo much pains. Perſuade them to learn
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:022331_0130_0FB7F2AFCD575050"/>the grounds of religion in ſome catechiſm, and they think it toilſome ſlavery, fit for ſchool-boys. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them to ſanctify the Lord's-day, and to ſpend it wholly in hearing the word, and repeating it with their families, and prayer and meditation, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear all their worldly thoughts and ſpeeches; and what a tedious life do they take this to be; and how long may you preach to them, before they will be brought to it As if they thought heaven were not worth all this ado.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third ſort that fall under this reproof, are thoſe ſelf-cozening, formal, lazy profeſſors of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who will be brought to any outward duty, but to the inward work they will never be perſuaded. They will preach, or hear, or read, or talk of heaven, or pray cuſtomar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The outſide hypocrites will never be perſuaded to any of theſe. Above all other, two ſorts there are of theſe hypocrites.</p>

               <p>The former entertaineth the doctrine of the goſpel with joy; but it is only in the ſurface of his ſoul,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:022331_0131_0FB7F2B230562540"/>he never gives the ſeed any depth of earth. He changeth his opinion, and thereupon enga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eth for religion, as the right way, but it never melted and new-moulded his heart, nor ſet up <hi>Chriſt</hi> there in full power and authority: as his religion is but opinion, ſo is his ſtudy, and conference, and chief buſineſs all about opinion. He is uſually an ignorant, proud, bold enquirer and babler about controverſies, rather than an humble embracer of the known truth, with love and ſubjection: you may conjecture by his bold and forward tongue, and conceitedneſs in his own opinions, and ſlighting the judgments and perſons of others, and ſeldom talking of the great things of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with ſeriouſneſs and humitlity—that his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dwelleth in the brain, and not in his heart; where the wind of temptation aſſaults him, he eaſily yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and it carrieth him away as a feather, becauſe his heart is empty, and not balanced and eſtabliſhed with <hi>Chriſt</hi> and grace. If this man's judgment lead him in the ceremonious way, then doth he employ his chief zeal for ceremonies. If his judgement be againſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, then his ſtrongeſt zeal is employed in ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, talking, diſputing againſt them, and cenſuring the uſers of them. For, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> having the eſſentials of chriſtianity, he hath only the mint and cummin, the ſmaller matters of the law, to lay out his zeal upon. You ſhall never hear any humble and hearty bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his ſoul's imperfections, or any heart-bleeding acknowledgments of his unkindneſſes to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of any pantings and longings after him, from this man; but that he is of ſuch a judgment, or ſuch a religion, or ſociety, or a member of ſuch a church: herein doth he gather his greateſt comforts; but the inward and ſpiritual labours of a chriſtian he will not be brought to.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of the worldly hypocrite, who choaketh the doctrine of the goſpel with the
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:022331_0132_0FB7F2B986957C60"/>thorns of worldly cares and deſires. His judgment is convinced that he muſt be religious, or he cannot be ſaved; and therefore he reads, and hears, and prays, and forſakes his former company and courſes; but becauſe his belief of the goſpel-doctrine is but waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhallow, he reſolves to keep his hold of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things; and yet to be religious, that ſo he may have heaven, when he can keep the world no longer. This man's judgment may ſay, GOD is the chief good, but his heart and affections never ſaid ſo, but looked upon GOD as to be tolerated rather than the flames of hell, but not deſired before the felicity on earth. In a word, the world hath more of his affections than GOD, and therefore is his god. This he might eaſily know and feel, if he would judge impartially, and were but faithful to himſelf. And though this man does not gad after novelties in religion, as the former, yet will he ſet his ſails to the wind of worldly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And as a man whoſe ſpirits are ſeized on by ſome peſtilential malignity, is feeble and faint, and heartleſs in all that he does; ſo this man's ſpirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſſed by the plague of this malignant, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſition, how faint is he in ſecret prayer! How ſuperficial in examination and meditation! How fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in heart-watchings, and humbling, mortifying endeavours! How nothing at all in loving and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with GOD, rejoicing in him, or deſiring him! So that both theſe, and many other ſorts of lazy hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites there are, who though they will trudge on with you in the eaſy outſide of religion, yet will never be at the pains of inward and ſpiritual duties.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And even good men themſelves deſerve this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, for being too lazy ſeekers of everlaſting reſt. Alas, what a diſproportion is there between our light and our heat! our profeſſions and proſecution! Who makes that haſte, as if it were for heaven? How ſtill we ſtand! How idly we work! How we talk, and

Who would think that ſtood by us, and heard us pray in private or public, that we were praying for no leſs than ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting glory? Should heaven be ſought no more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly than thus? Methinks we are none of us all in good ſadneſs for our ſouls. We do but dally with the work of GOD, and play with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as children play with their meat when they ſhould eat it; we hang upon ordinances from day to day, but we ſtir not our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſeek the LORD.</p>
               <p>I ſee a great many very conſtant in hearing and praying, but they do not hear and pray as if it were for their lives. Oh, what a frozen ſtupidity hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbed us! The plague of <hi>Lot</hi>'s wife is upon us, as if we were changed into lifeleſs and immoveable pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: we are dying, and we know it, and yet we ſtir not; we are at the door of eternal happineſs or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and yet we perceive it not: death knocks, and we hear it not: <hi>Chriſt</hi> calls and knocks, and we hear not: GOD cries to us, <hi>to-day if you will hear my voice, harden not your hearts. Work while it is day, for the night cometh when none can work.</hi> Now ply your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, now labour for your lives; now lay out all your ſtrength. Now or never; and yet we ſtir no more than if we were half aſleep. What haſte do death and judgment make! How faſt do they come on! They are almoſt at us, and yet what little haſte make we! The ſpur of GOD is in our ſide, we bleed, we groan, and yet we do not mend our pace. LORD, what a ſenſeleſs, ſottiſh, earthly, helliſh thing is a hard heart!
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:022331_0134_0FB7F2C1AF1DF748"/>That we will not go roundly and cheerfully toward heaven without all this ado! No, nor with it neither? Where is the man that is ſerious in his chriſtianity? Methinks men every where make but a trifle of their eternal ſtate. They look after it but a little by the by; they do not make it the taſk and buſineſs of their lives.</p>
               <p>To be plain with you, I think nothing undoes men ſo much as complimenting and jeſting in religion. Oh, if I were not ſick myſelf of the ſame diſeaſe, with what tears ſhould I mix this ink; and with what groans ſhould I expreſs theſe ſad complaints; and with what heart's grief ſhould I mourn over this univerſal deadneſs! Do the magiſtrates among us ſeriouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their portion of the work? are they zealous for Gon? do they build up his houſe? are they tender of his honour? do they ſecond the word? encourage the good? relieve the oppreſſed? compaſſionate the diſtreſſed? and fly at the face of ſin and ſinners, as being the diſturbers of our peace, and the only cauſe of all our miſeries? do they ſtudy how to do the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt they can for GOD? to improve their power and parts, and wealth and honour, and all their intereſt for the greateſt advantage to the kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as men that muſt ſhortly give an account of their ſtewardſhip? Or do they build their own houſes, and ſeek their advancements, and conteſt for their own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and do no more for <hi>Chriſt</hi> than needs they muſt, or than lies in their way, or than is put by others into their hands, or than ſtands with the pleaſing of their friends, or with their worldly intereſt?</p>
               <p>And how thin are thoſe miniſters that are ſerious in their work! Nay, how mightily do the very beſt fail in this! Do we cry out of men's diſobedience to the goſpel, in the evidence and power of the Spirit, and deal with ſin, as that which is the fire in our towns
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:022331_0135_0FB7F2C2F5A8F428"/>and houſes; and by force pull men out of this fire? Do we perſuade our people, as thoſe that know the terrors of the LORD ſhould do? Do we preſs <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and regeneration, and faith, and holineſs, as men that believe indeed, that without theſe they ſhall never have life? Do our bowels yearn over the ignorant, and the careleſs, and the obſtinate multitude, as men that believe their own doctrine? When we look them in the face, do our hearts melt over them, leſt we ſhould never ſee their faces in reſt? Do we, as <hi>Paul,</hi> tell them weeping, of their fleſhly and earthly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition? And teach them publicly, and from houſe to houſe, night and day with tears? And do we entreat them, as if it were indeed for their lives? That when we ſpeak of the joys and miſeries of another world, our people may ſee us affected accordingly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that we mean as we ſpeak? Or rather, do we not ſtudy words? As if a miniſter's buſineſs were but to tell them a ſmooth tale of an hour long, and ſo look no more after them till the next ſermon.</p>
               <p>Oh the formal, frozen, lifeleſs ſermons which we daily hear preached upon the moſt weighty, piercing ſubjects in the world! How gently do we handle thoſe ſins, which will handle ſo cruelly our people's ſouls! And how tenderly do we deal with their careleſs hearts, not ſpeaking to them as men that muſt be awakened or damned! We tell them of heaven and hell in ſuch a ſleepy tone, and ſlight way, as if we were but act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part in a play; ſo that we uſually preach our people aſleep with thoſe ſubjects, which one would think ſhould rather endanger the driving ſome beſide themſelves.</p>
               <p>In a word, our want of ſeriouſneſs about the things of heaven, doth charm the ſouls of men into forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and hath brought them to this cuſtomary, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs hearing, which undoes them.

Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, look but to thyſelf, and reſolve the queſtion. Aſk conſcience, and ſuffer it to tell thee truly.

Haſt thou made haſte, leſt thou ſhouldſt come too late, and die before the work be done? Hath thy heart been ſet upon it, and thy deſires and thoughts run out this way? Haſt thou preſſed on through crowds of oppoſition <hi>towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling of</hi> GOD <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus?</hi> When you have ſet your hand to the work of GOD, have you done it with all your might? Can conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence witneſs your ſecret cries, and groans, and tears? Can your families witneſs that you have taught them the fear of the LORD, and warned them all with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs and unweariedneſs to remember GOD and their ſouls? Or that you have done but as much for them, as that damned glutton would have had <hi>Lazarus</hi> do for his brethren on earth, to warn them that they come not to that place of torment? Can your mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters witneſs that they have heard you cry out, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> And that you have followed them with complaints againſt your corruptions, and with earneſt enquiries after the LORD? Can your neighbours about you witneſs, that you are ſtill learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them that are able to inſtruct you? And that you plainly and roundly reprove the ungodly, and take pains for the ſaving of your brethren's ſouls?

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> An Exhortation to Seriouſneſs in ſeeking Reſt.</head>
               <p>I HOPE, reader, by this time thou art ſomewhat ſenſible, what a deſperate thing it is to triſte about eternal reſt; and how deeply thou haſt been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this thyſelf. And I hope alſo, that thou dareſt not now ſuffer this conviction to die; but art reſolved to be another man for the time to come: What ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thou? Is this thy reſolution? If thou wert ſick of ſome deſperate diſeaſe, and the phyſician ſhould tell thee, if you will obſerve but one thing, I doubt not to cure you, wouldſt thou not obſerve it? Why, if thou wilt obſerve but this one thing for thy ſoul, I make no doubt of thy ſalvation; if thou wilt now but ſnake off thy ſloth and put to all thy ſtrength, and be a downright chriſtian, I know not what can hinder thy happineſs. As far as thou art gone from GOD, if thou now return and ſeek him with thy whole heart, no doubt but thou ſhalt find him. As unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

O fall to work then ſpeedily, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, and bleſs GOD that thou haſt yet time to do it: and though that which is paſt cannot be recalled, yet redeem the time now by doubling thy diligence.</p>
               <p>And becauſe thou ſhalt ſee I urge thee not without cauſe, I will here adjoin a multitude of conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to move thee: their intent and uſe is, to drive thee from delaying, and from loitering in ſeeking reſt. Whoever thou art therefore, I entreat thee to rouſe up thy ſpirit, and give me awhile thy atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to the people) <hi>Set thy heart to all the words that I teſtify to thee this day; for it is not a vain thing, but it is for thy life.</hi> Weigh what I here write with the judgment of a man; and the LORD open thy heart, and faſten his counſel effectually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, our affections and actions ſhould be anſwerable to the greatneſs of the ends to which they are intended. Now the ends of a chriſtian's deſires and endeavours are ſo great, that no human under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding on earth can comprehend them; whether you reſpect their proper excellency, their exceeding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, or their abſolute neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Theſe ends are, the glorifying of GOD, the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our own and other men's ſouls, in eſcaping the
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:022331_0139_0FB7F2C8987AD880"/>torments of hell, and poſſeſſing the glory of heaven. And can a man be too much affected with things of ſuch moment? Can he deſire them too earneſtly, or love them too violently, or labour for them too dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently? When we know that if our prayers prevail not, and our labour ſucceeds not, we are undone for ever, I think it concerns us to ſeek and labour to the purpoſe. When it is put to the queſtion, whether we ſhall live for ever in heaven or in hell? and the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be reſolved upon our obeying the goſpel, or diſobeying it, upon the painfulneſs or the ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our preſent endeavours; I think it is time for us to beſtir ourſelves, and to leave our triſling and complimenting with GOD.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, our diligence ſhould be anſwerable to the greatneſs of the work which we have to do, as well as to the ends of it.</p>
               <p>Now, the works of a chriſtian here are very many, and very great: the ſoul muſt be renewed; many and great corruptions mortified; cuſtom, temptations and worldly intereſt muſt be conquered; fleſh muſt be maſtered; life and friends, and credit, and all muſt be ſlighted; conſcience muſt be upon good grounds qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted; aſſurance of pardon and ſalvation muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. And though it is GOD that muſt give us theſe, and that freely, without our own merits; yet will he not give them without our earneſt ſeeking and labour.</p>
               <p>Beſides, there is a deal of knowledge to be got, for the guiding ourſelves, for defending the truth, for the direction of others, and a deal of ſkill for the right managing of our parts: many ordinances are to be uſed, and duties to be performed, ordinary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; every age, and year, and day, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire freſh ſucceſſion of duty; every place we come
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:022331_0140_0FB7F2CBA40661B0"/>in, every perſon we have to deal with, every change of our condition, doth ſtill require the renewing our labour, and bringing duty along with it: wives, children, ſervants, neighbours, friends, enemies, all of them call for duty from us. and all this of great importance too; ſo that for the moſt, if we miſcarry in it, it would prove our undoing.</p>
               <p>Judge then yourſelves, whether men that have ſo much buſineſs lying upon their hands, ſhould not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtir them? And whether it be their wiſdom either to delay, or to loiter?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, our diligence ſhould be quickened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of the time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us for the performing of all this work, and the many and great impediments which we meet with. Yet a few days, and we ſhall be here no more. Time paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth on: many diſeaſes are ready to aſſault us; we that now are preaching, and hearing, and talking, and walking, muſt very ſhortly be carried, and laid in the duſt, and there left to the worms in darkneſs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; we are almoſt there already; it is but a few days, or months, or years, and what is that when once they are paſt? We know not whether we ſhall have another ſermon, or ſabbath, or hour. How then ſhould thoſe beſtir them for their everlaſting reſt, who know they have ſo ſhort a ſpace for ſo great a work? Beſides, every ſtep in the way hath its difficulties; <hi>the gate is ſtrait, and the way narrow: the righteous them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ſcarcely ſaved.</hi> Scandals and diſcouragements will be ſtill caſt before us; and can all theſe be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by ſlothful endeavours?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover, our diligence ſhould be anſwerable to the diligence of our enemies in ſeeking our deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For if we ſit ſtill while they are plotting and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring; or if we be lazy in our defence, while they
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:022331_0141_0FB7F2CD077B0618"/>are diligent in aſſaulting us, you may eaſily conceive how we are likely to ſpeed. How diligent is <hi>Satan</hi> in all kinds of temptations? Therefore, <hi>be ſober and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, becauſe your adverſary, the devil, as a roaring lion walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> How diligent are all the miniſters of <hi>Satan?</hi> Falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſcorners at godlineſs, malicious perſecutors, all unwearied; and our inward corruption the moſt buſy and diligent of all: whatever we are about; it is ſtill refiſting us; depraving our duties, perverting our thoughts, dulling our affections to good, exciting them to evil: and will a feeble reſiſtance ſerve our turn? Should we not be more active for our own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, than our enemies for our ruin?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our affections and endeavours ſhould bear ſome proportion with the talents we have received, and means we have enjoyed.</p>
               <p>It may well be expected that a horſeman ſhould go faſter than a footman; and he that hath a ſwift horſe, faſter than he that hath a ſlow one. More work will be expected from a ſound man, than from the fick; and from a man at age, than from a child: and to whom men commit much, from them they will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the more.</p>
               <p>Now the talents which we have received are many and great: the means which we have enjoyed are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many, and very precious. What people breathing on earth, have had plainer inſtructions, or more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſuaſions, or conſtant admonitions, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon? Sermons, till we have been weary of them: and ſabbaths, till we profaned them! Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent books in ſuch plenty, that we knew not which to read! What people have had GOD ſo near them as we have had? Or have ſeen <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as it were, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before their eyes, as we have done? What people
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:022331_0142_0FB7F2D0065F31F0"/>have had heaven and hell, as it were, opened unto them, as we? Scarce a day wherein we have not had ſome ſpur to put us on. What ſpeed then ſhould ſuch a people make for heaven? How ſhould they fly that are thus winged? And how ſwiftly ſhould they ſail that have wind and tide to help them? Believe it, brethren, GOD looks for more from <hi>England,</hi> than from moſt nations in the world; and for more from you that enjoy theſe helps, than from the dark un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught congregations of the land. A ſmall meaſure of grace beſeems not ſuch a people; nor will an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diligence in the work of GOD, excuſe them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. vigour of our affections and actions ſhould be anſwerable to the great coſt beſtowed upon us, and to the deep engaging mercies which we have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from GOD. Surely we owe more ſervice to our maſter, from whom we have our maintenance, than we do to a ſtranger, to whom we were never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden.</p>
               <p>O the coſt that GOD hath been at for our ſakes? The riches of ſea and land, of heaven and earth, hath he poured out unto us. All our lives have been filled up with mercies: we cannot look back upon one hour of it, or one paſſage in it, but we may behold mercy. We feed upon mercy, we wear mercy upon our backs, we tread upon mercy; mercy within us, mercy without us for this life, and for that to come. O the rate deliverances that we have partaken of, both national and perſonal! How oft, how ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, how fully have our prayers been heard, and our fears removed? What large catalogues of particular mercies can every chriſtian rehearſe? To offer to number them would be as endleſs a taſk, as to number the ſtars, or the ſands of the ſhore.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="unknown:022331_0143_0FB7F2D42E012D08"/>
If there be any difference betwixt hell, (where we ſhould have been) and earth, (where we now are) yea, or heaven, (which is offered to us) then certainly we have received mercy: yea, if the blood of the Son of GOD be mercy, then are we engaged to GOD by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; for ſo much did it coſt him to recover us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And ſhould a people of ſuch deep engagements be lazy in their returns? Shall GOD think nothing too much nor too good for us; and ſhall we think all too much that we do for him? Thou that art an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſenſible man, who knoweſt how much thou art beholden to GOD, I appeal to thee, is not a loitering performance of a few heartleſs duties, an unworthy requital of ſuch admirable kindneſs? For my own part, when I compare my ſlow and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable life, with the frequent and wonderful mercies received, it ſhames me, it ſilenceth me, and leaves me inexcuſable.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Conſider, all the relations which we ſtand in toward GOD, call upon us for our utmoſt diligence. Should not the pot be wholly at the ſervice of the potter, and the creature at the ſervice of his Creator? Are we his children, and do we not owe him our moſt tender affections, and dutiful obedience? Are we the ſpouſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and do we not owe him our obſervance, and our love? <hi>If he be our father, where is his honour? and if he be our maſter, where is his fear? We call him Lord and Maſter, and we do well:</hi> but if our induſtry be not anſwerable to our relations, we condemn ourſelves in ſaying, we are his children, or his ſervants. How will the hard labour and daily toil that ſervants undergo to pleaſe their maſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> judge and condemn thoſe men who will not labour ſo hard for their great maſter? Surely there is none have a more honourable maſter than we, nor can expect ſuch fruit of their labours.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="145" facs="unknown:022331_0144_0FB7F2DB48378400"/>
8. How cloſe ſhould they ply their work, who have ſuch attendants as we have? All the world are our ſervants, that we may be the ſervants of GOD. The ſun, and moon, and ſtars, attend us with their light and influence: the earth, with all its furniture, is at our ſervice: how many thouſand plants, and flowers, and fruits, and birds, and beaſts, do all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend us? The ſea with its inhabitants, the air, the wind, the froſt and ſnow, the heat and fire, the clouds and rain, all wait upon us while we do our work: yea, <hi>the angels are miniſtering ſpirits for us.</hi> And is it not an intolerable crime for us to trifle, while all theſe are employed to aſſiſt us? Nay more; the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of GOD doth wait upon us: the LORD JESUS CHRIST waiteth, in the offers of his blood; the holy Spirit waiteth, in ſtriving with our backward hearts: beſides, all his ſervants, the miniſters of his goſpel, who ſtudy and wait, and preach and wait, and pray and wait upon careleſs ſinners: and ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and men, yea the LORD himſelf, ſtand by and look on, while thou doſt nothing?</p>
               <p>O chriſtians, I beſeech you, whenever you are on your knees in prayer, or reproving the tranſgreſſors, or exhorting the obſtinate, or upon any duty, do but remember what attendants you have for this work; and then judge how it behoves you to perform it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. How forward and painful ſhould we be in that work, where we are ſure we can never do enough? If there were any danger in over-doing, then it might well cauſe men to moderate their endeavours: but we know, <hi>that if we could do all, we were but unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervants;</hi> much more when we fail in all.</p>
               <p>It is true, a man may poſſibly preach too much, or hear too much, (though I have known few that did ſo) but yet no man can obey or ſerve GOD too much:
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:022331_0145_0FB7F2DF03395140"/>one duty may be ſaid to be too long, when it ſhuts out another; and then it ceaſeth indeed to be a duty. And all ſuperſtition, or worſhip of our own deviſing, may be called a righteouſneſs over much; yet as long as you keep your ſervice to the rule of the word, you never need to fear <hi>being righteous over much:</hi> for elſe we ſhould reproach the LORD and Lawgiver of the church, as if he commanded us to do too much.</p>
               <p>If the world were not mad with malice, they could never be ſo blind in this point as they are: to think that diligence for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is folly and ſingularity: and that they who ſet themſelves wholly to ſeek eternal life, are but preciſe <hi>Puritans!</hi> The time is near, when they will eaſily confeſs, that GOD could not be loved or ſerved too much, and that no man can be too buſy to ſave his ſoul: for the world you may eaſily do too much, but herein (in GOD'S way) you cannot.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Conſider, they that trifle in the way to heaven, loſe all their labour. If two be running in a race, he that runs ſloweſt, had as good never run at all: for he loſeth the prize, and his labour both. Many, who like <hi>Agrippa, are but almoſt chriſtians,</hi> will find in the end they ſhall be but almoſt ſaved. GOD hath ſet the rate at which the pearl muſt be bought; if you bid a penny leſs, you had as good bid nothing. As a man that is lifting up ſome weighty thing, if he put to almoſt ſtrength enough, it is as good he put to none at all, for he doth but loſe all his labour.</p>
               <p>O how many profeſſors of chriſtianity will find this true to their ſorrow, who have had a mind to the ways of GOD, and have kept up a dull taſk of duty, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came to ſerious chriſtianity?

If a traveller ſleep, or trifle out moſt of the day, he muſt travel ſo much the faſter in the evening, or fall ſhort of his journey's end. With ſome of us our childhood and youth is gone; with ſome alſo their middle age, and the time before us is very uncertain. What a deal of time have we ſlept away, and talked away, and played away? What a deal have we ſpent in worldly thoughts and labours, or in mere idleneſs? Though in likelihood the moſt of our time is ſpent, yet how little of our work is done? And is it not time to beſtir ourſelves in the evening of our days? The time which we ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

You may receive indeed an <hi>equal recompenſe with thoſe that have borne the burden and heat of the day, though you came not in till the laſt hour;</hi> but then you muſt be ſure to labour diligently that hour.

Though you may ſeem to loſe your labour at the preſent, yet the hour cometh when you ſhall find it with advantage. The ſeed which is buried and dead, will bring forth a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful increaſe at the harveſt. Whatever you do, and whatever you ſuffer, everlaſting reſt will pay for all. There is no repenting of labours and ſufferings in heaven; none ſays, <q>would I had ſpared my pains and prayed leſs, or been leſs ſtrict, and did as the reſt of my neihbours did:</q> there is never ſuch a thought in heaven as theſe. But on the contrary, it

Whoever complained that he came to heaven at too dear a rate; or that his ſalvation coſt him more labour than it was worth? We may ſay of all our labours, as <hi>Paul</hi> of his ſufferings, <hi>I reckon that the ſufferings</hi> (and labours) <hi>of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ſhall be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> We labour but for a moment, but we ſhall reſt for-ever.

Conſider, violence and laborious ſtriving for ſalvation, is the way that the wiſdom of GOD hath directed us to, as beſt, and his ſovereign authority appointed us as neceſſary. Who knows the way to heaven better than the GOD of heaven? When men tell us that we are too ſtrict, whom do they accuſe, GOD, or us? If we do no more than what we are commanded, nor ſo much neither; they may as well ſay, GOD hath made laws which are too ſtrict. Sure if it were a ſault, it would lie in him that commands, and not in us who obey. And dare theſe men think that they are wiſer than GOD? Do they know better than he, what men muſt do to be ſaved? Theſe are the men that aſk us, whether we are wiſer than all the world beſides? and yet they will pretend to be wiſer than GOD. What do they leſs, when GOD bids us take the moſt diligent courſe, and they tell us, it is more ado than needs?

<pb n="149" facs="unknown:022331_0148_0FB7F2E2CBE6D830"/>of the world: <hi>The kingdom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. Strive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at the ſtrait gate; for many ſhall ſeek to enter in and not be able. Whatſoever the hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, or wiſdom in the grave, whither thou goeſt. Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling. Give diligence to make your calling and election ſure. If the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſinner appear?</hi>

               <p>This is the conſtant language of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and which ſhall I follow, GOD or men; yea, and that the worſt and moſt wicked men?

Let them bring all the ſeeming reaſon they can againſt the holy, violent ſtriving of the ſaints; and this ſufficeth me to confute them all, that GOD is of another mind, and he hath commanded me to do much more than I do: and though I could ſee no reaſon for it, yet his will is reaſon enough to me: I am ſure GOD is worthy to govern us, if we were better than we are. Who ſhould make laws for us, but he that made us? And who ſhould mark out the way to heaven, but he that muſt bring us thither? And who ſhould determine on what conditions we ſhall be ſaved, but he that beſtows the gift of ſolvation? So that let the world, or the fleſh, or the devil, ſpeak againſt a holy laborious courſe, this is my anſwer, GOD hath commanded it.</p>

Even thoſe that are hated and derided by the world for being ſo ſtrict, and are thought to be almoſt beſide themſelves for their extraordinary diligence; yet commonly when they lie a dying, wiſh, O that they had been a thouſand times more holy, more heavenly, more laborious for their fouls!

What an eſteem will they have of a holy life? For my own part, I may ſay as <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> 
                  <q>They accuſe me for doing too much, but my own conſcience accuſeth me for doing too little, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too ſlow: and it is far eaſier bearing the ſcorns of the world, than the ſcourges of conſcience.</q> The world ſpeaks at a diſtane without me, ſo that though I hear their words, I can chooſe whether I will feel them: but my conſcience ſpeaks within, at the very heart, ſo that every check doth pierce me to the quick. Conſcience, when it reprehends juſtly, is the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of GOD: ungodly revilers are the voice of the devil. I had rather be reproached by the devil for ſeeking ſalvation, than reproved of GOD for neglecting it: I had rather the world ſhould call me Puritan in the devil's name, than conſcience ſhould call me loiterer in GOD's name. As GOD and conſcience are more uſeful friends than <hi>Satan</hi> and the world; ſo are they more dreadful, irreſiſtible enemies.</p>

Only as we do by our friends when they are dead; and our words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can do them no good, yet to teſtify our affections we weep and mourn for them: ſo will I alſo do for theſe ſouls. It makes my heart even tremble to think, how they will ſtand trembling before the LORD! And how confounded and ſpeechleſs they will be, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall reaſon with them concerning their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and ſloth! When he ſhall ſay, as the Lord doth in <hi>Jer.</hi> ii. 5.9.11.15. <hi>What iniquity have your Fathers</hi> (or you) <hi>found in me, that ye are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity?</hi> Did I ever wrong you, or do you any harm, or ever diſcourage you from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing my ſervice? Was my way ſo bad that you could not endure it? or my ſervice ſo baſe that you could not ſtoop to it? Did I ſtoop to the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the law for you, and could not you ſtoop to fulfil the eaſy conditions of my goſpel? Was the world or Satan a better friend to you than I? Or had they done for you more than I had done? Try now whether they will ſave you, or whether they will recompenſe you for the loſs of heaven; or whether they will be as good to you as I would have been? O! what will the wretched ſinner anſwer for any of this! But though man will not hear, yet we may have hope in ſpeaking to GOD—LORD, ſmite theſe rocks till they guſh forth waters: though theſe ears are deaf, ſay to them, <hi>Ephphatha,</hi> be opened: though theſe ſinners be dead, let that power ſpeak, which ſometime ſaid, <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus ariſe!</hi> We know they will be awakened at the laſt reſurrection; O, but then it will be only to their ſorrow! O, thou that didſt weep and groan over dead <hi>Lazarus,</hi> pity theſe ſad and ſenſeleſs ſouls, till they are able to weep and groan for, and pity themſelves. As

               <p>Yet I will add a few more words to good men in particular, to ſhew them why they above all men ſhould be laborious for heaven; and that there is a great deal of reaſon, that though all the world ſit ſtill, yet they ſhould abhor that lazineſs and negligence, and lay out all their ſtrength on the work of GOD.

Are theſe men alive or dead? Are they waking, or aſleep? What do they think on? Where are their hearts? If they have but a weighty ſuit at law, how careful are they to know whether it will go for them, or againſt them? If they were to be tried for their lives, how careful would they be to know whether they ſhould be ſaved or condemned, eſpecially if their care might ſurely ſave them? If they be dangerouſly ſick, they will enquire of the phyſician; what think you ſir, ſhall I eſcape or no? But for the buſineſs of their ſalvation, they are content to be uncertain. If you aſk moſt men a reaſon of their hopes to be ſaved, they will ſay it is becauſe GOD is merciful, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for ſinners, and the like general reaſons, which any man in the world may give as well as they; but put them to prove their intereſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercy of GOD, and they can ſay nothing at all; at leaſt nothing out of their hearts and experience.</p>
               <p>If GOD ſhould aſk them for their ſouls, as he did <hi>Cain</hi> for his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> they could return but ſuch an anſwer as he did. If GOD or man ſhould ſay to them, what caſe is thy ſoul in, man? Is it regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and pardoned or no? Is it in a ſtate of life, or a ſtate of death? He would be ready to ſay, I know not; am I my ſoul's keeper. I hope well, I truſt GOD with my ſoul, I ſhall ſpeed as well as other men do, I thank GOD I never made any doubt of my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Thou haſt the more cauſe to doubt a great deal, becauſe thou never didſt doubt; and yet more becauſe thou haſt been ſo careleſs in thy confidence. What do theſe expreſſions diſcover, but a wilful neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of thy own ſalvation? As a ſhip-maſter that ſhould let his veſſel alone, and ſay, I will venture it among the rocks, and the waves, and winds; I will truſt GOD with it; it will ſpeed as well as other veſſels do. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as well as other men's that are as careleſs and idle, but not ſo well as other men's that are diligent and
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:022331_0163_0FB7F30A8E524280"/>watchful. What horrible abuſe of GOD is this, for men to pretend they truſt GOD, to cloak their own wilful negligence! If thou didſt truly truſt GOD, thou wouldeſt alſo be ruled by him, and truſt him in that way which he hath appointed thee. He requires thee to <hi>give all diligence to make thy calling and election ſure,</hi> and ſo to truſt him, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 10. He hath marked thee out a way by which thou mayſt come to be ſure; and charged thee to ſearch and try thyſelf, till thou certainly know. Were he not a fooliſh traveller, that would go on when he doth not know, whether it be right or wrong; and ſay, I hope I am right; I will go on and truſt GOD? Art not thou guilty of this folly in thy travels to eternity? Not conſidering that a little ſerious enquiry whether the way be right, might ſave thee a great deal of labour which thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweſt in vain, and muſt undo again, or elſe thou wilt miſs of ſalvation, and undo thyſelf. Did I not know what a deſperate, blind, carnal heart is, I ſhould wonder how thou doſt to keep off continual terrors from thy heart: and eſpecially in theſe caſes following:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. I wonder how thou canſt either think or ſpeak of the dreadful GOD without exceeding terror and aſtoniſhment, as long as thou art uncertain whether he be thy father or thy enemy, and knoweſt not but all his attributes may be employed againſt thee. If his <hi>ſaints muſt rejoice before him with trembling, and ſerve him with fear:</hi> If they that are ſure to receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable kingdom, muſt yet ſerve GOD <hi>with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and godly fear,</hi> becauſe <hi>he is a conſuming fire:</hi> how terrible ſhould the remembrance of him be to them that know, not but this fire may for-ever conſume them?</item>
                  <item>2. How doſt thou think without trembling, upon JESUS CHRIST? When thou knoweſt not whether
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:022331_0164_0FB7F2F174C5B078"/>his blood hath purged thy ſoul, or not? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will condemn thee, or acquit thee in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor whether he be the corner ſtone and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of thy happineſs, or a ſtone of ſtumbling to break thee, and grind thee to powder?</item>
                  <item>3. How canſt thou open the bible and read a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or hear a chapter read but it ſhould terrify thee? Methinks every leaf ſhould be to thee as <hi>Belſhazzar</hi>'s writing on the wall, except only that which draws thee to try and reform: If thou read the promiſes, thou knoweſt not whether ever they ſhall be fulfilled to thee, becauſe thou art uncertain of thy perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the condition. If thou read the threatenings, for any thing thou knoweſt, thou doſt read thy own ſentence. I do not wonder if thou art an enemy to plain preaching, and if thou ſay of it, and of the miniſter and ſcripture itſelf, as <hi>Ahab</hi> of the prophet, <hi>I hate him for he doth not propheſy good concerning me, but evil.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. What comfort canſt thou find in any thing which thou poſſeſſeſt? Methinks, friends, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and houſes, and lands, ſhould do thee little good, till thou know thou haſt the love of GOD withal, and ſhalt have reſt with him when thou leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt theſe. Offer to a priſoner, before he know his ſentence, either muſic, or clothes, or lands or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what cares he for any of theſe, till he know how he ſhall eſcape for his life? Then he will look after theſe comforts of life, and not before: for he knows if he muſt die the next day, it will be ſmall comfort to die rich or honourable. Even when thou lieſt down to take thy reſt, methinks the uncertainty of thy ſalvation ſhould keep thee waking, or amaze thee in thy dreams, and trouble thy ſleep; and thou ſhouldſt ſay, as <hi>Job</hi> in a ſmaller diſtreſs than thine, <hi>Job</hi> vii. 13, 14. <hi>When I ſay, my bed ſhall comfort me,

If the keepers trembled, and became as dead men, when they did but ſee the angels, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxviii. 3, 4. how canſt thou think of living in hell with devils, till thou haſt got ſome ſound aſſurance that thou ſhalt eſcape it? Or if thou ſeldom think of theſe things, the wonder is as great, what ſhift thou makeſt to keep thoſe thoughts from thy heart? Thy bed is very ſoft, or thy heart is very hard, if thou canſt ſleep ſoundly in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain caſe.</item>

But, alas, either men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not the nature and uſe of this duty, or elſe they will not be at the pains to try.

Aſk thy own conſcience, reader, when was the time, and where was the place, that ever thou ſolemnly tookedſt thy heart to taſk, as in the ſight of GOD, and examinedſt it by ſcripture, whether it be born again or not?

               <p>And, 1. we cannot doubt but <hi>Satan</hi> will do his part, to hinder us from ſuch a neceſſary duty as this: if all the power he hath can do it, or all the means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments which he can raiſe up. He is loth the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould have that aſſurance, and advantage againſt corruption, which faithful ſelf-examination would procure them; and for the ungodly he knows, if they ſhould once fall cloſe to this they would find out his deceits, and their own danger. If they did but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perform this duty, he were likely to loſe moſt of his ſubjects. If the ſnare be not hid, the bird will eſcape it: Satan knows how to angle for ſouls, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to ſhew them the hook or line, and to fright them away with a noiſe, or with his own appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="unknown:022331_0169_0FB7F312CC2131B0"/>
Therefore he labours to keep them from a ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miniſtry; or to keep the miniſter from helping them to ſearch: or to take off the edge of the word, that it may not pierce, or to turn away their thoughts, or poſſeſs them with prejudice: Satan is acquainted with all the preparations of the miniſter; he knows when he hath provided a ſearching ſermon, fitted to the ſtate and neceſſity of an hearer; and therefore he will keep him away that day, if it be poſſible, or elſe caſt him aſleep, or ſteal away the word by the cares and talk of the world, or ſome way prevent its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt hinderance.</p>
               <p>Wicked men alſo are great impediments to poor ſinners when they ſhould examine and diſcover their eſtates.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their examples hinder much. When an ignorant ſinner ſeeth all his friends and neighbours do as he doth, yea, the rich and learned as well as others, this is an exceeding great temptation to proceed in his ſecurity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The merry company, and diſcourſe of theſe men do take away the thoughts of his ſpiritual ſtate, and make the underſtanding drunk: ſo that if the Spirit had before put into them any jealouſy of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or any purpoſe to try themſelves, theſe do ſoon quench all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Alſo their continual diſcourſe of matters of the world, doth damp all theſe purpoſes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Their railings alſo, and ſcorning at godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is a very great impediment to multitudes of ſouls, and poſſeſſeth them with ſuch a prejudice and
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:022331_0170_0FB7F3190F0B6120"/>diſlike of the way to heaven, that they ſettle in the way they are in.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Their conſtant perſuaſions, allurements, threats, hinder much. GOD doth ſcarce ever open the eyes of a poor ſinner, to ſee that his way is wrong, but preſently there is a multitude of Satan's apoſtles rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to flatter him, and daub, and deceive, and ſettle him again in the quiet poſſeſſion of his former maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. What, ſay they, do you make a doubt of your ſalvation, who have lived ſo well, and done no body harm? GOD is merciful: and if ſuch as you ſhall not be ſaved, GOD help a great many: what do you think is become of all your fore-fathers? And what will become of all your friends and neighbours that live as you do? Will they all be damned? Shall none be ſaved think you, but a few ſtrict ones? Come, come, if ye hearken to theſe books or preachers, they will drive you to deſpair, or drive you out of your wits: thus do they follow the ſoul that is eſcaping from Satan, with reſtleſs cries, till they have brought him back: Oh, how many thouſands have ſuch charms kept aſleep in ſecurity, till death and hell have awakened and better informed them! The LORD calls to the ſinner, and tells him, <hi>The gate is ſtrait, the way is narrow, and few find it: try and examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou be in the faith or no: give all diligence to make ſure in Time.</hi>—And the world cries out clean the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, never doubt, never trouble yourſelves with theſe thoughts:—I entreat the ſinner that is in this ſtrait, to conſider, that it is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and not their fathers, or mothers, or neighbours, or friends that muſt judge them: and if <hi>Chriſt</hi> condemn them, theſe cannot fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When <hi>Ahab</hi> would enquire among the multitudes of flattering prophets, it was his death. They can flatter men into the ſnare, but they cannot bring them out. Oh, take the counſel of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> v. 6, 7. <hi>Let no ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But the greateſt hinderances are in men's own hearts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some are ſo ignorant that they know not what ſelf-examination is, nor what a miniſter means when he perſuadeth them to try themſelves; or they know not that there is any neceſſity of it: but think every man is bound to believe that GOD is his father, and that his ſins are pardoned whether it be true or falſe; and that it were a great fault to make any queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: or they do not think that aſſurance can be attained: or that there is any ſuch great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one man and another: but that we are all chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and therefore need not trouble ourſelves any further: or at leaſt they know not wherein the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence lies; nor how to ſet upon this ſearching of their hearts. They have as groſs conceits of that regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which they muſt ſearch for, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had; they are like thoſe in <hi>Acts</hi> xix. 2. that <hi>know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were a Holy Ghoſt to be received or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Some are ſo poſſeſſed with ſelf-love and pride, that they will not ſo much as ſuſpect any danger to themſelves. Like a pround tradeſman who ſcorns the motion when his friends deſire him to caſt up his books, becauſe they are afraid he will break. As ſome fond parents that have an over-weaning conceit of their own children, and therefore will not believe
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:022331_0172_0FB7F320A264B000"/>or hear any evil of them: ſuch a fond ſelf-love doth hinder men from ſuſpecting and trying their ſtates.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some are ſo guilty that they dare not try: they are ſo fearful that they ſhould find their eſtates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, that they dare not ſearch into them. And yet they dare venture them to a more dreadful trial.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some are ſo in love with their ſin, and ſo in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like with the way of GOD, that they dare not fall on the trial of their ways, leſt they be forced from the courſe which they love.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Some are ſo reſolved already never to change their preſent ſtate, that they neglect examination as a uſeleſs thing: before they will turn ſo preciſe and ſeek a new way, when they have lived ſo long, and gone ſo far, they will put their eternal ſtate to the venture, come of it what will. And when a man is fully reſolved to hold to his way, and not to turn back, be it right or wrong, to what end ſhould he enquire whether he be right or no?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Moſt men are ſo taken up with their worldly affairs, and are ſo buſy in providing for the fleſh, that they cannot ſet themſelves to the trying of their title to heaven: they have another kind of happineſs in their eye, which will not ſuffer them to make ſure of heaven.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But the moſt common impediment is that falſe faith and hope commonly called preſumption: which bears up the hearts of moſt of the world, and ſo keeps them from ſuſpecting their danger.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee what abundance of difficulties muſt be overcome before a man cloſely ſets upon the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of his heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="unknown:022331_0173_0FB7F3228A8BEBB0"/>
And if a man break through all theſe impediments, and ſet upon the duty, yet, of thoſe few who enquire after means of aſſurance, divers are deceived and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, eſpecially through theſe following cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is ſuch confuſion and darkneſs in the ſoul of man, eſpecially of an unregenerate man, that he can ſcarcely tell what he doth, or what is in him. As one can hardly find any thing in an houſe where nothing keeps its place, but all is caſt on an heap together; ſo is it in the heart where all things are in diſorder, eſpecially when darkneſs is added to this diſorder: ſo that the heart is like an obſcure dungeon, where there is but a little crevice of light, and a man muſt rather grope than ſee, no wonder if men miſtake in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an heart, and ſo miſcarry in judging their eſtates.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beſides, many are reſolved what to judge before they try: they uſe the duty but to ſtrengthen their preſent conceits of themſelves, and not to find out the truth of their condition: like a bribed judge, who examines each party as if he would judge uprightly, when he is reſolved which way the cauſe ſhall go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand. Juſt ſo do men examine their hearts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Alſo men try themſelves by falſe marks and rules: not knowing wherein the truth of chriſtianity doth conſiſt: ſome looking beyond, and ſome ſhort of the ſcripture-ſtandard.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Men frequently miſcarry in this work, by ſetting on it in their own ſtrength. As ſome expect the Spirit ſhould do it without them, ſo others at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it themſelves without ſeeking or expecting the help of the Spirit: both theſe will certainly miſcarry in their aſſurance.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Further Cauſes of doubting among Chriſtians.</head>
               <p>BECAUSE the comfort of a chriſtian's life doth ſo much conſiſt in his aſſurance of GOD's ſpecial love, and becauſe the right way of obtaining it is ſo much controverted, I will here proceed a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in opening to you ſome other hinderances which keep us chriſtians from comfortable certainty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One great cauſe of doubting and uncertainty, is, the weakneſs of our grace. A little grace is next to none. Small things are hardly diſcerned. Moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with a ſmall meaſure of grace, and do not follow on to ſpiritual ſtrength and manhood. They believe ſo weakly, and love GOD ſo little, that they can ſcarce find whether they believe and love at all. Like a man in a ſwoon, whoſe pulſe and breathing is ſo weak, that they can hardly be perceived whether they move at all, and conſequently whether the man be alive or dead.</p>
               <p>The chief remedy for ſuch would be, to follow on their duty, till their graces be increaſed: ply your work: wait upon GOD in the uſe of his preſcribed means, and he will undoubtedly bleſs you with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Oh that chriſtians would beſtow moſt of that time in getting more grace, which they beſtow in anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doubtings whether they have any or none; and that they would lay out thoſe ſerious affections in praying, and ſeeking to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for more grace, which they beſtow in fruitleſs complaints! I beſeech thee, take this advice as from GOD! and then, when thou believeſt ſtrongly, and loveſt ſervently, thou canſt not doubt whether thou believe and love or not; no more
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:022331_0175_0FB7F3265ACB2D38"/>than a man that is burning hot can doubt whether he be warm: or a man that is ſtrong and luſty can doubt whether he be alive.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Many a ſoul lieth long under doubting, through the imperfection of their very reaſon, and exceeding weakneſs of their natural parts. Grace doth uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rather employ our faculties on better objects, than add to the degree of their natural ſtrength. Many honeſt hearts have ſuch weak heads, that they know not how to perform the work of ſelf-trial: they are not able to argue the caſe; they will acknowledge the premiſes, and yet deny the apparent concluſion. Or if they be brought to acknowledge the concluſion, yet they do but ſtragger in their conceſſion, and hold it ſo weakly, that every aſſault may take it from them. If GOD do not ſome other way ſupply to theſe men the defect of their reaſon, I ſee not how they ſhould have clear and ſettled peace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another common cauſe of doubting and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, is, the ſecret maintaining ſome known ſin.</p>
               <p>When a man liveth in ſome unwarrantable practice, and GOD hath oft touched him for it, and yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth it; it is no wonder if this perſon want both aſſurance and comfort. One would think that a ſoul that is ſo tender as to tremble, ſhould be as tender of ſinning: and yet ſad experience telleth us that it is frequently otherwiſe: I have known too many ſuch, that would complain and yet ſin, and accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and yet ſin ſtill, yea and deſpair, and yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in ſinning: and all arguments and means could not keep them from the wilful committing of that ſin again and again, which yet they themſelves did think would prove their deſtruction. Yea, ſome will be carried away with thoſe ſins that ſeem moſt contrary to their dejected temper. I have known them that
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:022331_0176_0FB7F328E7615068"/>would fill men's ears with the conſtant lamentations of their miſerable ſtate, and accuſations againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as if they had been the moſt humble people in the world; and yet be as paſſionate in the maintaining their innocency when another accuſeth them, and as intolerably peeviſh, and tender of their reputation in any thing they are blamed for, as if they were the proudeſt perſons on earth.</p>
               <p>This cheriſhing ſin doth hinder aſſurance theſe four ways.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. It doth abate the degree of our graces, and ſo makes them undiſcernible.</item>
                  <item>2. It obſcureth that which it deſtroyeth not; for it beareth ſuch ſway, that grace is not ſeen to ſtir, nor ſcare heard ſpeak for the noiſe of this corruption.</item>
                  <item>3. It putteth out, or darkeneth the eye of the ſoul, and it benumeth and ſtupifieth it.</item>
                  <item>4. But eſpecially it provoketh GOD to withdraw himſelf, his comforts and the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, without which we may ſearch long enough before we have aſſurance. GOD hath made a ſeparation betwixt ſin and peace. As long as thou doſt cheriſh thy pride, thy love of the world, the deſires of the fleſh, or any unchriſtian practice, thou expecteſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>urance and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in vain. GOD will not encourage thee by his precious gifts in a courſe of ſinning. This worm will be gnawing upon thy conſcience: It will be a devouring canker to thy conſolations. Thou mayſt ſteal a ſpark of falſe comfort from thy worldly proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity or delight: or thou mayſt have it from ſome falſe opinions, or from the deluſions of Satan; but from GOD thou wilt have no comfort. However an <hi>Antinomian</hi> may tell thee, that thy comforts have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:022331_0177_0FB7F32A15C97BF0"/>upon thy obedience, nor thy diſcomforts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy diſobedience: and therefore may ſpeak peace to thee in the courſe of thy ſinning; yet thou ſhalt find by experience that GOD will not. If any man ſet up his idols in his heart, and put the ſtumbling-block of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to a miniſter, or to GOD, to enquire for aſſurance and comfort, GOD will anſwer that man by himſelf, and inſtead of comforting him, he will ſet his face againſt him, <hi>he will anſwer him according to the multitude of his idols.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. Another common cauſe of want of aſſurance and comfort, is, when men grow lazy in the ſpiritual part of duty. As Dr. <hi>Sibbs</hi> ſaith truly, "it is the lazy chriſtian commonly that lacketh aſſurance." The way of painful duty, is the way of fulleſt comfort. <hi>Chirſt</hi> carrieth all our comforts in his hand: if we are out of that way where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to be met, we are out of the way where comfort is to be had.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe two ways doth this lazineſs debar us of our comforts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By ſtopping the fountain, and cauſing <hi>Chriſt</hi> to withhold this bleſſing from us. Parents uſe not to ſmile upon children in their neglects and diſobedience. So far as the Spirit is grieved, he will ſuſpend his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations. Aſſurance and peace are <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to faithfulneſs and obedience: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (though our obedience do not merit them, yet) they uſually riſe and fall with our diligence in duty.

The ſoul that is beſt furniſhed with grace, when it is not in action, is like a lute well ſtringed and tuned, which while it lieth ſtill, doth make no more muſic than a common piece of wood: but when it is taken up and handled by a ſkilful lutiſt, the melody is delightful. Some degree of comfort follows every good action, as heat accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies fire, and as beams and influence iſſue from the ſun: which is ſo true, that the very heathens upon the diſcharge of a good conſcience have found comfort and peace anſwerable. This is <hi>praemium ante praemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:</hi> a reward before the reward.</p>
               <p>As a man therefore that is cold ſhould not ſtand ſtill and ſay.

Only before you ſet upon it, I adviſe you to the obſervation of theſe rules.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Come not with too peremptory concluſions of yourſelves before-hand. Do not judge too confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before you try.</item>
                  <item>2. Be ſure to be ſo well acquainted with the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to know what is the tenor of the covenant of grace, and what are the conditions of juſtification and glorification, and conſequently what are ſound marks to try thyſelf by.</item>
                  <item>3. Be a conſtant obſerver of the temper and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy heart: moſt of the difficulty of the work doth lie in true and clear diſcerning of it. Be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in obſerving the actings both of grace and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and the circumſtances of their actings: as, how frequent? how violent? how ſtrong or weak were the outward incitements? how great or ſmall the impediments? what delight, or loathing, or fear, or reluctancy did go with thoſe acts?</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. Empty thy mind of all of all thy other cares and thoughts, that they do not diſtract or divide thy mind: this work will be enough at once of itſelf, without joining others with it.</p>

                  <pb n="181" facs="unknown:022331_0180_0FB7F3305AEF0CD0"/>
2. Then fall down before GOD, and in hearty prayer deſire the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, to diſcover to thee the plain truth of thy condition, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten thee in the whole progreſs of the work.</p>
               <p>I will not digreſs to warn you here of the falſe rules and marks of trial of which you muſt beware. But I will briefly adjoin ſome marks to try your title to this reſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every ſoul that hath a title to this reſt, doth place his happineſs in it, and make it the ultimate end of his ſoul. This is the firſt mark; which is ſo plain a truth, that I need not ſtand to prove it. For this reſt conſiſteth in the full and glorious enjoyment of GOD: and he that maketh not GOD his ultimate end, is in heart a pagan and vile idolater.</p>
               <p>Let me aſk then; doſt thou truly account it thy chief happineſs to enjoy the LORD in glory, or doſt thou not? Canſt thou ſay with <hi>David, The Lord is my portion?</hi> And <hi>whom have I in heaven, but thee? And whom in earth that I deſire in compariſon of thee?</hi> If thou be an heir of reſt, it is thus with thee. Tho' the fleſh will be pleading for its own delights, and the world will be creeping into thine affection, yet in thy ordinary, ſettled, prevailing judgment and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thou preferreſt GOD before all things in the world.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thou makeſt him the end of thy deſires and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours: the very reaſon why thou heareſt and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, why thou deſireſt to live and breathe on earth, is this, that thou mayſt ſeek the LORD. Thou ſeekeſt firſt the kingdom of GOD and its righteouſneſs: tho' thou doſt not ſeek it ſo zealouſly as thou ſhouldſt; yet hath it the chief of thy deſires and endeavours: and nothing elſe deſired or preferred before it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="182" facs="unknown:022331_0181_0FB7F331B1B288C0"/>
2. Thou wilt think no labour or ſuffering too great to obtain it. And though the fleſh may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhrink, yet art thou reſolved and content to go through all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If thou be an heir of reſt, thy valuation of it will be ſo high, and thy affection to it ſo great, that thou wouldſt not exchange thy title to it, and hopes of it, for any worldly good whatſoever. If GOD would ſet before thee an eternity of earthly pleaſure on one hand, and the reſt of the ſaints on the other, and bid thee take thy choice; thou wouldſt refuſe the world, and chooſe this reſt.</p>
               <p>But if thou be yet in the fleſh, then it is clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary with thee: then doſt thou in thy heart prefer thy worldly happineſs before GOD; and though thy tongue may ſay, that GOD is the chief good, yet thy heart doth not ſo eſteem him. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The world is the chief end of thy deſires and endeavour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; thy very heart is ſet upon it; thy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt care and labour is to maintain thy eſtate, or credit, or fleſhly delights. But the life to come hath little of thy care or labour. Thou didſt never perceive ſo much excellency in the unſeen glory as to draw thy heart ſo after it; but that little pains which thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweſt that way, it is but in the ſecond place. GOD hath but the world's leaving, and that time and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour which thou canſt ſpare from the world, or thoſe few cold and careleſs thoughts which follow thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, earneſt, and delightful thoughts of earthly things: neither wouldſt thou do any thing at all for heaven, if thou kneweſt how to keep the world: but leſt thou ſhouldſt be turned into hell, when thou canſt keep the world no longer, therefore thou wilt do ſomething.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="183" facs="unknown:022331_0182_0FB7F3330A93DED8"/>
2. Therefore it is that thou thinkeſt the way of GOD too ſtrict, and wilt not be perſuaded to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant labour of walking according to the goſpel-rule: and when it comes to trial, that thou muſt forſake <hi>Chriſt</hi> or thy worldly happineſs, and the wind which was in thy back doth turn in thy face, then thou wilt venture heaven rather than earth, and (as deſperate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels uſe to ſay) thou wilt rather truſt GOD's mercy for thy ſoul, than man's for thy body; and ſo deny thy obedience to GOD.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And certainly if GOD would but give thee leave to live in health and wealth for-ever on earth, thou woul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt think it a better ſlate than reſt: let them ſeek for heaven that would, thou wouldſt think this thy chiefeſt happineſs. This is thy caſe if thou be yet an unregenerate perſon, and haſt no title to the ſaints reſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond mark which I ſhall give thee, to try whether thou be an heir of reſt, is this:</p>
               <p>As thou takeſt GOD for thy chief good, ſo, Thou doſt heartily accept of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for thy only Saviour and Lord to bring thee to this reſt. The former mark was the ſum of the firſt and great command of the law of nature, <hi>[Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God.]</hi> This ſecond mark is the ſum of the come and or condition of the goſpel, <hi>[Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.]</hi> And the performance of theſe two is the whole ſum or eſſence of godlineſs and chriſtianity. Obſerve therefore the parts of this mark, which is but a definition of faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Doſt thou find that thou art naturally a loſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned man, for thy breach of the firſt covenant? And believe that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the mediator who hath made a ſufficient ſatisfaction to the law? And hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the goſpel that he is offered without exception
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:022331_0183_0FB7F335505AEF78"/>unto all, doſt thou heartily conſent that he alone ſhall be thy Saviour? And no further truſt to thy duties and works, than as conditions required by him, and means appointed in ſubordination to him? Not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at them as in the leaſt meaſure able to ſatisfy the courſe of the law, or as a legal righteouſneſs, nor any part of it? But art content to truſt thy ſalvation on the redemption made by <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Art thou alſo content to take him for thy only Lord and King, to govern and guide thee by his laws and Spirit? And to obey him even when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the hardeſt duties, and thoſe which moſt croſs the deſires of the fleſh? Is it thy ſorrow when thou breakeſt thy reſolution herein? And thy joy when thou keepeſt cloſeſt in obedience to him? Wouldeſt thou not change thy Lord and Maſter for all the world? Thus it is with every true chriſtian. But if thou be an unbeliever it is far otherwiſe. Thou mayſt call <hi>Chriſt</hi> thy Lord and thy Saviour: but thou never ſoundeſt thyſelf ſo loſt without him, as to drive thee to truſt him, and lay thy ſalvation on him alone: or at leaſt thou didſt never heartily conſent that he ſhould govern thee as thy Lord; nor reſign up thy ſoul and life to be ruled by him; nor take his word for the law of thy thoughts and actions. It is like thou art content to be ſaved from hell by <hi>Chriſt</hi> when thou dieſt: but in the mean-time he ſhall command thee n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And if he would give thee leave, thou hadſt far rather live after the world and fleſh, than after the word and Spirit. And though thou mayſt now and then have a motion or purpoſe to the contrary; yet this that I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, is the ordinary deſire and choice of thine heart: and ſo thou art no true believer in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> for though thou confeſs him in words, yet in works thou d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> The Reaſon of the Saints Afflictions here.</head>
               <p>A Further uſe which we muſt make of the preſent doctrine is, To inform us why the people of GOD ſuffer ſo much in this life. What wonder? when you ſee their reſt doth yet remain: they are not yet come to their reſting place. We would all fain have continual proſperity, becauſe it is pleaſing to the fleſh; but we conſider not the unreaſonableneſs of ſuch deſires. We are like children, who if they ſee any thing which their appetite deſireth, cry for it: and if you tell them that it is unwholeſome, or hurtful for them, they are never the more quieted; or if you go about to heal any ſore that they have, they will notendure you to hurt them, though you tell them, that they cannot otherwiſe be healed; their ſenſe is too ſtrong for their reaſon, and therefore reaſon doth lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle perſuade them. Even ſo it is with us when GOD is affticting us: he giveth us reaſons why we muſt bear it, ſo that our reaſon is oft convinced and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and yet we cry and complain ſtill: it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but eaſe that we muſt have: ſpiritual remedies may cure the ſpirit's maladies; but that will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the fleſh.</p>
               <p>But methinks chriſtians ſhould have another palate than that of the fleſh, to try and reliſh providences by: GOD hath given them the Spirit to ſubdue the fleſh. And therefore I ſhall here give them ſome reaſons of GOD'S dealing in their preſent ſufferings, whereby the
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:022331_0185_0FB7F33908476668"/>equity and mercy therein may appear: and they ſhall be only ſuch as are drawn from the reference that theſe afflictions have to our reſt; which being a chriſtian's happineſs, and ultimate end, will direct him in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all eſtates and means.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider then, That labour and trouble are the common way to reſt, both in the courſe of nature and of grace. Can there poſſibly be reſt without motion and wearineſs? Do you not travel and toil firſt, and then reſt afterwards? The day for labour goes firſt, and then the night for reſt doth follow. Why ſhould we deſire the courſe of grace to be perverted, any more than we would do the courſe of nature? GOD did once dry up the ſea to make a paſſage for his people; and once made the ſun in the firmament to ſtand ſtill: but muſt he do ſo always? Or as oft as we would have him? It is his eſtabliſhed decree, <hi>That through many tribulations we muſt enter into the kingdom of heaven,</hi> Acts xiv. 22. And <hi>that if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo be glorified with him,</hi> 2 Tim. ii. 12. And what are we, that GOD'S ſtatutes ſhould be reverſed for our pleaſure? As <hi>Bildad</hi> ſaid to <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. xviii. 4. <hi>Shall the earth be forſaken for thee? or the rock be removed out of his place?</hi> So, <hi>muſt God pervert his eſtabliſhed order for thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider alſo, That afflictions are exceeding uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us, to keep us from miſtaking our reſting place, and ſo taking up ſhort of it. A chriſtian's motion heaven-wards is voluntary, and not conſtrained. Thoſe means therefore are moſt proſitable to him, which help his underſtanding and will in this proſecution. The moſt dangerous miſtake that our ſouls are capable of, is, to take the creature for GOD, and earth for heaven. And yet, alas, how common is this! Though we are aſhamed to ſpeak ſo much with our tongues, yet how oft do our hearts ſay, <hi>It is beſt being here!</hi> And how
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:022331_0186_0FB7F33AFAA6C158"/>contented are we with an earthly portion! So that I fear, GOD would diſpleaſe moſt of us more to afflict us here, and promiſe us reſt hereafter, than to give us our hearts deſire on earth, though he had never made us a promiſe of heaven. As if the creature without GOD, were better than GOD without the creature. Alas, how apt are we, like fooliſh children, when we are buſy at our ſports and worldly employments, to forget both our father and our home! Therefore it is a hard thing for a rich man to enter into heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is hard for him to value it more than earth, and not think he is well already. Come to a man that hath the world at will, and tell him, This is not your happineſs, you have higher things to look after; and how little will he regard you? But when affliction comes, it ſpeaks convincingly, and will be heard when preachers cannot.</p>
               <p>Sometimes a ſincere man begins to be lifted up with applauſe; and ſometimes being in health and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he hath loſt his reliſh of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the joys above; till GOD break in upon his riches, and ſeatter them abroad, or upon his children, or upon his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or upon the health of his body, and break down his mount which he thought ſo ſtrong: and then when he lieth in <hi>Manaſſah</hi>'s fetters, or is faſtened to his bed with pining ſickneſs, O what an opportunity hath the Spirit to plead with his ſoul! When the world is worth nothing, then heaven is worth ſomething.</p>
               <p>How oft have I been ready to think myſelf at home, till ſickneſs hath roundly told me, I was miſtaken! And how apt yet to fall into the ſame diſeaſe, which prevaileth till it be removed by the ſame cure! If our dear Lord did not put theſe thorns into our bed, we ſhould ſleep out our lives, and loſe our glory.</p>
               <p n="3">

3. Conſider, afflictions are GOD'S moſt effectual means, to keep us from ſtraggling out of the way to our reſt. If he had not ſet a hedge of thor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s on the right hand, and on the left, we ſhould hardly keep the way to heaven: if there be but one gap open without theſe thorns, how ready are we to turn out at it? But when we cannot go aſtray, but theſe thorns will prick us, perhaps we will be content to hold the way. When we grow wanton, or worldly, or proud; what a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means is ſickneſs, or other affliction, to reduce us? It is every chriſtian, as well as <hi>Luther,</hi> that may call affliction one of his beſt ſchool-maſters. Many a one, as well as <hi>David,</hi> may ſay by experience, <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now have I kept thy precepts.</hi> Many a thouſand poor recovered ſinners may cry, O healthful ſickneſs! O comfortable ſorrows! O gainful loſſes! O enriching poverty! O bleſſed day, that ever I was afflicted! It is not only <hi>the pleaſant ſtreams, and the green paſtures, but his rod and ſtaff al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that are our comfort.</hi> Though I know it is the word and Spirit that do the work; yet certainly the time of ſuffering is ſo opportune a ſeaſon, that the ſame word will take them then, which before was ſcarce obſerved: it doth ſo unbolt the door of the heart, that a miniſter or a friend may then be heard, and the word may have eaſier entrance to the affections.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider, afflictions are GOD'S moſt effectual means, to make us mend our pace in the way to our reſt. They are his rod, and his ſpur: what ſluggard will not awake and ſtir when he feeleth them? It were well if mere love would prevail with us, and that we were rather drawn to heaven, than driven: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our hearts are ſo bad, that mercy will not do it; it is better we be put on with the ſharpeſt ſcourge, than loiter out our time till the doors are ſhut.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="unknown:022331_0188_0FB7F349D6DD9F58"/>
O what a difference is there betwixt our prayers in health and in ſickneſs! betwixt our proſperity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity-repentings! He that before had not a tear to ſhed, or a groan to utter, now can ſob, and ſigh, and weep: he that was wont to lie like a block in prayer, and ſcarce minded what he ſaid to GOD: now afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſſeth him down, how earneſtly can he beg! How doth he mingle his prayers and his tears! And cry out, what a perſon he will be, If GOD will but hear him, and deliver him! Alas! if we did not ſometimes feel the ſpur, what a ſlow pace would moſt of us hold toward heaven!</p>
               <p>Seeing then what our vile natures require, why ſhould we be unwilling GOD ſhould do us good by a ſharp means? Sure that is the beſt dealing for us which ſureſt and ſooneſt doth further us for heaven. I leave thee, chriſtian, to judge by thy own experience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou doſt not go more watchfully, and lively, and ſpeedily in thy way to reſt, in thy ſufferings, than thou doſt in thy more pleaſing and proſperous ſtate.</p>
               <p>Laſtly conſider, GOD doth ſeldom give his people ſo ſweet a fore-taſte of their future reſt, as in their deep afflictions. He keepeth his moſt precious cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for the time of our greateſt faintings and dangers. GOD is not ſo laviſh of his choice favours as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow them unſeaſonably: he gives them at ſo fit a time, when he knoweth they are needful, and will be valued; and when he is ſure to be thanked for them, and his people rejoiced by them. Eſpecially, when our ſufferings are more directly for his cauſe, then doth be ſeldom fail of ſweetening the bitter cup. Therefore have the martyrs been poſſeſſors of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt joys, and therefore were they ſo ambitious of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom. I do not think that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> did ever ſing more joyfully, than when they were ſore with
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:022331_0189_0FB7F34E0FDE5120"/>ſcourgings, and faſt in the inner priſon, with their feet in the ſtocks. When did <hi>Chriſt</hi> preach ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to his diſciples, and aſſure them of his provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them manſions with himſelf, but when he was ready to leave them, and their hearts were ſorrowful becauſe of his departure? When did he appear among them, and ſay, <hi>peace be unto you,</hi> but when they were ſhut up together for fear of the perſecuting <hi>Jews?</hi> When did <hi>Stephen</hi> ſee heaven opened, but when he was giving up his life for the teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus?</hi> And though we be never put to the ſuffering of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, yet GOD knoweth that in our natural ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings we need ſupport.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that the time of affliction, is the time of our moſt pure, ſpiritual, and heavenly joy, for the moſt part; why ſhould a chriſtian think it ſo bad a time? Is not that our beſt eſtate, wherein we have moſt of GOD? Why elſe do we deſire to come to heaven? If we look for a heaven of fleſhly delights, we ſhall find ourſelves miſtaken. Conclude then, that affliction is not ſo bad a ſtate in our way to reſt, as the fleſh would make it. Are we wiſer than GOD? Doth not he know what is good for us better than we? Or is he not as careful of our good, as we are of our own? Ah wo to us if he were not much more! And if he did not love us better than we love either him or ourſelves!</p>
               <p>But let us hear a little what it is that we can object.</p>

               <p>I anſwer it ſeemeth GOD hath hit the right vein, where thy moſt inſtamed, diſtempered blood did lie:
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:022331_0190_0FB7F3504C938F08"/>it is his conſtant courſe to pull down men's idols, and take away that which is dearer to them than himſelf. There it is that his jealouſy is kindled; and there it is that the ſoul is moſt endangered. If GOD ſhould have taken from thee that which thou canſt let go for him, and not that which thou canſt not; or have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted thee where thou canſt bear it, and not where thou canſt not; thy idol would neither have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered nor removed; this would neither have been a ſufficient trial to thee, nor a cure, but have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed thee in thy idolatry.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. Oh, but ſaith another, if GOD would but deliver me out of it at laſt, I could be content to bear it: but I have an incurable ſickneſs, or I am like to live and die in poverty, or diſgrace, or diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, 1. Is it nothing that he hath promiſed, <hi>it ſhall work for thy good? Rom.</hi> viii. 28. and <hi>that with the affliction he will make a way to eſcape?</hi> that he will be with thee in it? and deliver thee in the fitteſt manner and ſeaſon?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it not enough that thou art ſure to be deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered at death, and that with ſo full a deliverance? Oh, what curſed unbelief doth this diſcover in our hearts! That we would be more thankful to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back again into the ſtormy ſea of the world, than to be ſafely and ſpeedily landed at our reſt! And would be more glad of a few years inferior mercies at a diſtance, than to enter upon the eternal inheritance with <hi>Chriſt!</hi> Do we call GOD our chief good, and heaven our happineſs? and yet is it no mercy or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance to be taken hence, and put into that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion?</p>

                  <pb n="192" facs="unknown:022331_0191_0FB7F3561302F950"/>
Object. 3. Oh, but ſaith another, if my affliction did not diſable me for duty, I could bear it; but it maketh me uſeleſs and utterly unprofitable.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. For that duty which tendeth to thy own benefit, it doth not diſable thee; but is the greateſt help that thou canſt expect. Thou uſeſt to complain of coldneſs, and dulneſs, and worldlineſs, and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: if affliction will not help thee againſt all theſe, by warning, quickening, rouzing thy ſpirit, I know not what will. Sure thou wilt repent throughly, and pray fervently, and mind GOD and heaven more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, either now or never.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for duty to others, and ſervice to the church, it is not thy dety when GOD doth diſable thee. He may call thee out of the vineyard in this reſpect, even before he call thee by death. If he lay thee in the grave, and put others in thy place, is this any wrong to thee? So if he call thee out before thy death, and ſet others to do the work, ſhouldſt thou not be as well content? Muſt GOD do all the work by thee? Hath he not many others as dear to him, and as fit for the employment? But alas, what deceitfulneſs lieth in theſe hearts! When we have time, and health, and opportunity to work, then we loiter, and do our Maſter but poor ſervice: but when he layeth afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon us, then we complain that he diſableth us for his work, and yet perhaps we are ſtill negligent in that part of the work which we can do. So, when we are in health and proſperity, we forget the public, and are careleſs of other men's miſeries and wants, and mind almoſt nothing but ourſelves; but when GOD afflict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th us, though he excite us more to duty for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet we complain that he diſableth us for our duty to others: as if on a ſudden we were grown ſo charitable, that we regard other men's ſouls more man our own! But is not the hand of fleſh in all this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:022331_0192_0FB7F35712119088"/>pleading its own cauſe? What pride of heart is this, to think that other men cannot do the work as well as we! Or that GOD cannot ſee to his church, and provide for his people, without us!</p>
               <p>Object. 4. Oh, but ſaith another, it is my friends that are my afflicters: they diſclaim me, and will ſcarce look at me; they cenſure me, and backbite me, and ſlander me, and look upon me with a diſdainful eye; if it were others, I could bear it, I look for no better from them: but when thoſe that are my delight, and that I looked for comfort and refreſhing from, when thoſe are as thorns in my ſides, who can bear it?</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. Whoever is the inſtrument, the affliction is from GOD, and the provoking cauſe from thyſelf: and were it not fitter that thou look more to GOD and thyſelf?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Doſt thou not know, that good men are ſtill ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in part? and that their hearts are naturally deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and deſperately wicked, as well as others? Learn therefore a better leſſon from the prophet, <hi>Mich.</hi> vii. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Truſt not</hi> (too much) <hi>in a friend, nor put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy boſom: but look rather for the</hi> LORD, <hi>and wait for the</hi> GOD <hi>of thy ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is likely thou haſt given that love and truſt to men, which was due only to GOD; or which thou haſt denied him: and then no wonder if he chaſtiſe thee by them. If we would uſe our friends as friends, GOD would make them our helps and comforts: but when once we make them our gods, by exceſſive love and truſt, then he ſuffers them to be our accuſers and tormentors: it is more ſafe to me to have any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a ſatan than a god: to be tormented by them than to idolize them. Till thou haſt learned to ſuffer
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:022331_0193_0FB7F35898453220"/>from the good, as well as the ungodly, never look to live a contented or comfortable life, nor ever think thou haſt truly learned the art of ſuffering.</p>
               <p>Object. 5. Oh but if I had that conſolation, which you ſay GOD reſerveth for our ſuffering times, I ſhould ſuffer more contentedly: but I do not perceive any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. The more you ſuffer for righteouſneſs-ſake, the more of this bleſſing you may expect; and the more you ſuffer for your own evil-doing, the longer you muſt look to ſtay till that ſweetneſs come. When we have by our folly provoked GOD to chaſtiſe us, ſhall we preſently look that he ſhould fill us with comfort? <q>That were (as Mr. <hi>Paul Bayn</hi> ſaith) to make affliction to be no affliction.</q> What good would the bitterneſs do us, if it be preſently drowned in that ſweetneſs? It is well in ſuch ſufferings, if you have but ſupporting grace; and if your ſufferings are ſanctified to work out your ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do you not neglect or reſiſt the comforts which you deſire? GOD hath filled precepts and promiſes, and other of his providences, with matter of comfort: if you overlook all theſe, and obſerve one croſs more than a thouſand mercies, who maketh you uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able but yourſelves? If you reſolve you will not be comfortable as long as any thing aileth your fleſh, you may ſtay till death before you have comfort.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Have your afflictions wrought kindly with you, and fitted you for comfort? Have they humbled you, and brought you to a faithful confeſſion and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your beloved ſin? and made you ſet cloſe to your neglected duties? and weaned your hearts from their former idols? and brought them unfeignedly to take GOD for their portion and their reſt? If this be
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:022331_0194_0FB7F35E9242D1E8"/>not done, how can you expect comfort? Should GOD bind up the ſore while it feſtereth at the bottom? It is not mere ſuffering that prepares you for comfort; but the ſucceſs and fruit of ſuffering upon your hearts.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It is not to invade the office of the miniſtry, and every man to turn a public preacher. I would not have you go beyond the bounds of your calling: we ſee by daily experience, what fruits thoſe men's teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doth bring forth, who run uncalled of GOD, and thruſt themſelves into the place of public teachers, thinking themſelves the fitteſt for the work in the pride of their hearts, while they had need to be taught the very principles of religion: how little doth GOD bleſs the labours of theſe ſelf-conceited intruders, even if they be ordained!</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither do I perſuade you to a zealous promoting of factions and parties, and venting of uncertain opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which men's ſalvation is little concerned in. Alas, what advantage hath the devil always got in the church by this impoſture! The time that ſhould be employed in drawing men's ſouls from ſin to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is employed in drawing them to opinions and parties: when men are fallen in love with their own conceits, and think themſelves the wiſeſt, how diligently do they labour to get them followers? as if to make a man a proſelyte to their opinions, were as happy a work as to convert him to <hi>Chriſt!</hi> and when they fall among the lighter, ignorant ſort of men, whoſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is all in the brain, and on their tongue, they

Theſe men ſhall ſhortly know, that to bring a man to the knowledge and love of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is another kind of work, than to bring him to be baptized again, or to be of ſuch a church, or ſuch a ſide.

               <p n="3">3. Nor do I perſuade you to ſpeak againſt men's faults behind their backs, and be ſilent before their faces, as the common cuſtom of the world is. To tell other men of their faults, tendeth little to their reformation, if they hear it not themſelves. To whiſper men's faults to others, as it cometh not from love, or from an honeſt principle, ſo uſually doth it produce no good effect: for if the party hear not of it, it cannot better him; if he do, he will take it but as the reproach of an enemy, and not as the faithful counſel of a friend, and as that which is ſpoken to make him odious, and not to make him virtuous; it tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to provoke to godlineſs, but to raiſe conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for <hi>a whiſperer ſeparateth chief friends.</hi> And how few ſhall we find that make conſcience of this horrible ſin? or that will confeſs it, and bewail it, when they are reprehended for it? eſpecially if men are ſpeaking of their enemies, or thoſe that have wronged them; or whom they ſuppoſe to have wronged them, or if it be of one that eclipſeth their glory, or that ſtandeth in the way of their gain or eſteem: or if it be one that differeth from them in judgment; or of one that is commonly ſpoke againſt by others; who is it that maketh any conſcience of back biting ſuch as theſe? And you ſhall ever obſerve, that the forwarder they are to back biting, the more backward always to faithful admoniſhing; and none ſpeak leſs of a
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:022331_0197_0FB7F36A8A1E5500"/>man's faults to his face, than choſe that ſpeak moſt of them behind his back.</p>
               <p>So far am I from perſuading therefore to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous courſe, that I would adviſe you to oppoſe it wherever you meet with it. See that you never hear a man ſpeaking againſt his neighbour behind his back (without ſome ſpecial cauſe or call) but preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke him: aſk him, whether he hath ſpoke thoſe things in a way of love to his face? if he hath not, aſk him, how he dare to pervert GOD'S preſcribed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who commandeth to rebuke our neighbour plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to tell him his fault firſt in private, and then before witneſs, till he ſee whether he will be won, or not? And how he dare do as he would not be done by?</p>
               <p>The duty therefore that I would preſs you to is of another nature, and it conſiſteth in theſe things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That you get your hearts affected with the miſery of your brethren's ſouls: be compaſſionate towards them; yearn after their ſalvation. If you did earneſtly long after their converſion, and your hearts were fully ſet to do them good, it would ſet you on work, and GOD would uſually bleſs it.</item>
                  <item>2. Take all opportunities that poſſibly you can, to inſtruct and help them to the attaining of ſalvation. And leſt you ſhould not know how to manage this work, let me tell you more particularly what you are herein to do. 1. If it be an ignorant perſon you have to deal with, who is an utter ſtranger to the myſteries of religion, and to the work of regeneration, the firſt thing you have to do, is, to acquaint him with theſe doctrines: labour to make him underſtand wherein man's chief happineſs doth conſiſt; and how far he
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:022331_0198_0FB7F36C0ACA7768"/>was once poſſeſſed of it; and what law and covenant GOD then made with him; and how he broke it; and what penalty he incurred, and what miſery he brought himſelf into thereby: teach him what need men had of a Redeemer; and how <hi>Chriſt</hi> in mercy did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and bear the penalty, and what covenant now he hath made with man; and on what terms only ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is now to be attained; and what courſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> taketh to draw men to himſelf; and what are the riches and privileges that believers have in him.</item>
               </list>
               <p>If when he underſtands theſe things, he be not moved by them: or if you find that the ſtop lieth in his will and affections, and in the hardneſs of his heart, and in the intereſt that the fleſh and the world have got in him; then ſhew him the excellency of the glory which he neglecteth, and the intolerableneſs of the loſs of it, and the extremity and eternity of the torments of the damned, and how certainly they muſt endure them; and how juſt it is for their wilful refuſals of grace; and how heinous a ſin it is to reject ſuch free and abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant mercy, and to tread under foot the blood of the covenant: ſhew him the certainty, nearneſs and terrors of death and judgment, and the vanity of all things below, which now he is taken up with; and how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they will beſtead him in that time of his extremity. Shew him that by nature he himſelf is a child of wrath, an enemy to GOD; and by actual ſin much more: ſhew him the vile and heinous nature of ſin; the abſolute neceſſity he ſtandeth in of a Saviour; the freeneſs of the promiſe; the fulneſs of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the ſufficiency of his ſatisfaction; his readineſs to receive all that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be his; and the authority and dominion which he hath purchaſed over us; ſhew him alſo the abſolute neceſſity of regeneration, faith and holineſs, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it is to have ſalvation by <hi>Chriſt</hi> without theſe; and what they are, and the true nature of them.</p>

If when he underſtandeth all this, you find his ſoul enthralled in falſe hopes, perſuading himſelf that he is a true believer, and pardoned, and reconciled, and ſhall be ſaved by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all this upon falſe grounds, (which is a common caſe) then urge him hard to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his ſtate, ſhew him the neceſſity of trying; the danger of being deceived; the commonneſs and eaſineſs of miſtaking through the deceitfulneſs of the heart; the extreme madneſs of putting it to a blind venture; or of reſting in negligent or wilful uncertainty: help him in trying himſelf: produce ſome undeniable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences from ſcripture; aſk him whether theſe be in him or not? Whether ever he round ſuch workings or diſpoſitions in his heart? Urge him to a rational anſwer: do not leave him till you have convinced him of his miſery; and then ſeaſonably and wiſely ſhew him the remedy.</p>
               <p>If he produce ſome gifts, or duties, or work, know to what end he doth produce them: if to join with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in compoſing him a righteouſneſs, ſhew him how vain and deſtructive they are: if it be by way of evidence to prove his title to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſhew him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the life of chriſtianity doth conſiſt, and how far he muſt go further, if he will be <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s diſciple. In the mean-time, that he be not diſcouraged with hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo high a meaſure, ſhew him the way by which he muſt attain it: be ſure to draw him to the uſe of all means: ſet him on hearing and reading the word, calling upon GOD, accompanying the godly: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him to leave his actual ſin, and to get out of all ways of temptation; eſpecially to forſake ungodly company; and to wait patiently on GOD in the uſe of means; and ſhew him the ſtrong hopes that in ſo doing he may have a bleſſing; this being the way that GOD will be found in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="unknown:022331_0200_0FB7EFF98E186600"/>
If you perceive him poſſeſſed with any prejudices againſt the way of holineſs, ſhew him their falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and with wiſdom and meekneſs anſwer his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
               <p>If he be addicted to delay duties he is convinced of, or lazineſs and ſtupidity endanger his ſoul, then lay it on more powerfully, and ſet home upon his heart the moſt piercing conſiderations, and labour to faſten them as thorns in his conſcience, that he may find no eaſe or reſt till he change his eſtate.</p>
               <p>But becauſe in all works the manner of doing them is of greateſt moment, and the right performance doth much further the ſucceſs; I will here adjoin a few di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, which you muſt be ſure to obſerve in this work of exhortation; for it is not every advice that uſeth to ſucceed, nor any manner of doing it that will ſerve the turn. Obſerve therefore theſe rules:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Set upon the work ſincerely, and with right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. Let thy end be the glory of GOD in the party's ſalvation. Do it not to get a name or eſteem to thyſelf; or to bring men to depend upon thee; or to get thee many followers: do not as many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and maſters will do, <hi>viz.</hi> rebuke their children and ſervants for thoſe ſins that diſpleaſe them, and are againſt their profit or their humours, as diſobedience, unthriftineſs, unmannerlineſs; but never ſeek in the right way that GOD hath appointed to ſave their ſouls. But be ſure, the main end be to recover them from miſery, and bring them into the way of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do it ſpeedily: as you would not have them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay their return, ſo do not thou delay to ſeek their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. You are purpoſing long to ſpeak to ſuch an ignorant neighbour, and to deal with ſuch a ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:022331_0201_0FB7EFFAD2F4E3D8"/>ſinner, and yet you have never done it. Alas, he runs on the ſcore all this while; he goes deeper in debt; wrath is heaping up; ſin taketh rooting: cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom doth more faſten him; engagements to ſin grow ſtronger and more numerous; conſcience grows ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the heart grows hardened; while you delay, the devil rules and rejoiceth; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſhut out; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is repulſed; GOD is daily diſhonoured; his law is violated; he is without a ſervant, and that ſervice from him which he ſhould have; time runs on; the day of viſitation haſteth; death and judgment are at the door: and what if the man die and miſs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, while you are purpoſing to teach him and help him to it? If in caſe of his bodly diſtreſs, you muſt not bid him go and come again to-morrow, when you have it by you; how much leſs may you delay the ſuccour of his ſoul? if once death ſnatch him away he is then out of the reach of your charity. That phyſician is no better than a murderer, that negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delayeth, till his patient be dead or paſt cure. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay in duty is a great degree of diſobedience, though you afterwards perform it. It ſhews an ill heart that is undiſpoſed to the work.

               <p n="3">3. Let thy exhortation proceed from compaſſion and love, and let the manner of it clearly ſhew the perſon thou dealeſt with, that it does. It is not jeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſcorning, or reproaching a man for his fault,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:022331_0202_0FB7EFFD104D2C08"/>that is a likely way to work his reformation: nor is it the right way to convert him to GOD, to rail at him, and vilify him with words of diſgrace. Men will take them for their enemies that thus deal with them: and the words of an enemy are little perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Lay by your paſſion therefore, and go to poor ſinners with tears in your eyes, that they may ſee you indeed believe them to be miſerable; and that you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly pity their caſe: deal with them with earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt humble entreatings. Let them ſee that your very bowels yearn over them, and that it is the very deſire of your hearts to do them good: let them perceive that you have no other end but the procuring their everlaſting happineſs; and that it is your ſenſe of their danger, and your love to their ſouls that forces you to ſpeak; even becauſe you know the terrors of the LORD, and for fear leſt you ſhould ſee them in eternal torments. Say to them, Why, friend, you know it is no advantage of my own that I ſeek. The way to pleaſe you, and to keep your friendſhip, were to ſooth you in your own way, or to let you alone; but love will not ſuffer me to ſee you periſh, and be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; I ſeek nothing at your hands, but that which is neceſſary to your own happineſs. It is yourſelf that will have the gain and comfort, if you come in to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If men would thus go to every ignorant wicked neighbour they have, and thus deal with them, O what bleſſed fruit ſhould we quickly ſee!</p>
               <p>I am aſhamed to hear ſome lazy hypocritical wretches revile their poor ignorant neighbours, and ſeparate from their company, and judge them unfit for their ſociety, before ever they once tried them with this compaſſionate exhortation! O you little know what a prevailing courſe this were like to prove! And how few of the vileſt drunkards or ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would prove ſo obſtinate, as wholly to reject or deſpiſe the exhortations of love! I know it muſt be
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:022331_0203_0FB7EFFFA9AE70D0"/>GOD that muſt change men's hearts! but I know alſo that GOD worketh by means, and when he meaneth to prevail with men, he uſually fitteth the means ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and ſtirreth up men to plead with them in a prevailing way, and ſo ſetteth in with his grace, and maketh it ſucceſsful. Certainly, thoſe that have tried can tell you by experience, that there is no way ſo prevailing with men, as the way of compaſſion and love. So much of theſe as they diſcern in your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, uſually ſo much doth it ſucceed with their hearts; and therefore I beſeech thoſe that are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to practiſe this courſe. Alas, we ſee moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among us, yea thoſe that would ſeem godly, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear a reproof that comes not in meekneſs and love! if there be the leaſt paſſion, or reliſh of diſgrace in it, they are ready to ſpit in your face. Yea, if you do not ſweeten your reproof with fair words, they cannot digeſt it, but their heart will riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, inſtead of a thankful ſubmiſſion and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.

               <p n="4">4. Another direction I would give you, is this: do it with all poſſible plainneſs and faithfulneſs. Do not dally with men, and hide from them their miſery or danger, or any part of it. Do not make their ſins leſs than they are; nor ſpeak of them in extenuating language. Do not encourage them in a falſe hope, no more than you would diſcourage the found hopes of the righteous. If you ſee his caſe dangerous, tell him plainly of it: Neighbour, I am afraid GOD hath not yet renewed your ſoul; and that it is yet a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:022331_0204_0FB7F00352700820"/>to the great work of regeneration and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I doubt you are not yet recovered from the power of Satan to GOD, nor brought out of the ſtate of wrath which you were born in, and have lived in: I doubt you have not choſen <hi>Chriſt</hi> above all, nor ſet your heart upon him, nor unfeignedly taken him for your ſovereign Lord. If you had, ſure you durſt not ſo eaſily diſobey him: you could not ſo neglect him and his worſhip in your family and in public: you could not ſo eagerly follow the world, and talk of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nothing but the things of this world, while <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſeldom mentioned by you. If you were in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> you would become a new creature; old things would be paſſed away, and all things would become new: you would have new thoughts, and new talk, and new company, and new endeavours, and a new converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: certainly without theſe you can never be ſaved: you may think otherwiſe, and hope better as long as you will, but your hopes will deceive you, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with you. Alas! it is not as you will, nor as I will, who ſhall be ſaved, but it is a GOD will; and GOD hath told us, that <hi>without holineſs none ſhall ſee him:</hi> and <hi>except we be born again, we cannot enter into his kingdom.</hi> And <hi>that all that would not have Chriſt to reign over them, ſhall be brought forth and deſtroyed before him:</hi> O therefore look to your ſtate in time.</p>
               <p>Thus muſt you deal roundly and faithfully with men, if ever you intend to do them good. It is not hovering at a diſtance in a general diſcourſe that will ſerve the turn: it is not in curing men's ſouls, as in curing their bodies, where they muſt not know their danger, leſt it ſadden them, and hinder the cure. They are here agents in their own cure, and if they know not their miſery, they will never bewail it, nor know how much need they have of a Saviour: if they know not the worſt, they will not labour to prevent it; but will ſit ſtill or loiter till they drop into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:022331_0205_0FB7F005EA0D4240"/>and will trifle out their time till it be too late: and therefore ſpeak to men, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the Phariſees, till they knew that he meant them. Deal plainly, or you do but deceive and deſtroy them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And as you muſt do it plainly, ſo alſo ſeriouſly, zealouſly, and effectually. The exceeding ſtupidity and deadneſs of men's hearts is ſuch, that no other dealing will ordinarily work. You muſt call loud to awake a man in a ſwoon or lethargy. If you ſpeak to the common ſort of men, of the evil of their ſin, of their need of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of the danger of their ſouls, and of the neceſſity of regeneration, they will wearily and unwillingly give you the hearing, and put off all with a ſigh, or a few good wiſhes, and ſay, GOD <hi>forgive us, we are all ſinners,</hi> and there is an end. If ever you will do them good therefore, you muſt ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en your exhortation, and ſet it home, and follow it, till you have rouzed them up, and made them begin to look about them. Let them know that thou ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not to them of indifferent things, nor about chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's games, or matters of a few days or years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, nor yet about matters of uncertainty, which may never come to paſs: but it is about the ſaving and damning of their ſouls and bodies; and whether they ſhall be bleſſed with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or tormented with devils, and that for-ever and ever; it is, how to ſtand before GOD in judgment, and what anſwer to give, and how they are like to ſpeed; and this judgment and eternal ſtate they ſhall very ſhortly ſee, they are almoſt at it; yet a few more nights and days, and they ſhall be at that laſt day: a few more breaths, they have to breathe, and they ſhall breathe their laſt; and then as certainly ſhall they ſee that mighty change, as the heaven is over their heads, and the earth under their feet. O labour to make men know, that it is mad jeſting about ſalvation or damnation; and that heaven and hell are not matters to be played with, or
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:022331_0206_0FB7F009158F39E0"/>paſſed over with a few careleſs thoughts! It is moſt certain that one of theſe days thou ſhalt be either in everlaſting, unchangeable joy or torment; and doth it not awake thee? Are there ſo few that find the way of death? Is it ſo hard to eſcape? ſo eaſy to miſcarry? And that wile we fear nothing, but think all is well? And yet you ſit ſtill and trifle! Why, what do you mean? What do you think on? The world is paſſing away: its pleaſures are fading: its honours are leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you: its profits will prove unprofitable to you: heaven or hell are a little before you: GOD is juſt, and jealous; his threatenings are true: the great day of his judgment will be terrible: your time runs on: your lives are uncertain: you are far behind hand: you have loitered long: your caſe is dangerous: your ſouls are far gone in ſin: you are ſtrange to GOD: you are hardened in evil cuſtoms: you have no aſſurance of comfort to ſhew: if you die to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, how unready a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Why, conſider, GOD ſtandeth all this while waiting your leiſure: his patience beareth: his juſtice forbeareth: his mercy entreateth you: <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtandeth offering you his blood and merits: you may have him freely, and life with him: the Spirit is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading: conſcience is accuſing and urging you: miniſters are praying for you, and calling upon you: Satan ſtands waiting when juſtice will cut off your lives, that he may have you: this is your time: now or never. What! had you rather loſe heaven than your profits or pleaſures? Had you rather burn in hell, than repent on earth? Had you rather howl and roar there, than pray day and night for mercy here? Or have devils your tormentors, than <hi>Chriſt</hi> your gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor? Will you renounce your part in GOD and glory, rather than renounce your ſins? Do you think a holy life too much for heaven: or too dear a courſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent endleſs miſery? Oh friends, what do you think

Alas! it is not a few dull words between jeſt and earneſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſleep and waking, as it were, that will waken an ignorant dead-hearted ſinner. When a dull hearer, and a dull ſpeaker meet together, a dead heart, and a dead exhortation; it is unlike to have a lively effect. If a man fall down in a ſwoon, you will not ſtand trifling with him, but lay hands on him preſently, and ſnatch him up, and rub him, and call aloud to him: if a houſe be on fire, you will not in a cold ſtrain go to tell your neighbour of it, or make an oration of the nature and danger of fire; but you will run out and cry, fire, fire: matters of moment muſt be ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealt with. To tell a man of his ſins ſo ſoftly as <hi>Eli</hi> did his ſons, or reprove him ſo gently as <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> did <hi>Ahab, Let not the king ſay ſo,</hi> doth uſually as much harm as good. I am perſuaded the very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſome men's reproof and exhortation, hath hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened many a ſinner in the way of deſtruction. To tell them of ſin, or of heaven or hell, in a dull, eaſy, careleſs language, doth make men think you are not in good earneſt; but ſcarce think yourſelves ſuch things are true. O ſirs, deal with ſin as ſin, and ſpeak of heaven and hell as they are, and not as if you were in jeſt. I confeſs I have failed much in this myſelf, the LORD lay it not to my charge!

Phyſic muſt not be given at all times, but in ſeaſon. It is an excellent example that <hi>Paul</hi> giveth us, <hi>Gal.</hi> ii. 2. He communicated the goſpel to them, yet privately to them of reputation, leſt he ſhould run in vain. Some men would take this to be a ſinful complying with their corruption, to yield ſo far to their pride and baſhfulneſs, as to teach them only in private, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would be aſhamed to own the truth in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic: but <hi>Paul</hi> knew how great a hinderance men's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is to their entertaining of the truth, and that the remedy muſt not only be fitted to the diſeaſe, but alſo to the ſtrength of the patient, and that in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the phyſician is not guilty of favouring the diſeaſe, but is praiſe-worthy for taking the right way to cure. Means will work eaſily if you take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; when the earth is ſoft, the plough will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

And ſo it is in private <hi>exhortation</hi> as well as public: if you clothe the moſt amiable truth in the ſordid rags of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming language, you will make men diſdain it, though it be the offspring of GOD, and of the higheſt nature.</item>
                  <item>4. Let all your reproofs and exhortations be backed with the authority of GOD. Let the ſinner be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that you ſpeak not from yourſelves or of your own head. Shew them the very words of ſcripture for what you ſay: preſs them with the truth and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of GOD; aſk them, Whether they believe that this is his word, and that his word is true. So much of GOD as appeareth in our words, ſo much will they take. The voice of man is contemptible: but the voice of GOD is awful and terrible.

Therefore we are commanded, <hi>to exhort one another daily,</hi> and <hi>with all long-ſuffering: the fire is not always brought out of
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:022331_0210_0FB7F00FE363A1A0"/>the flint at one ſtroke: nor men's affections kindled at the firſt exhortation.</hi> And if they were, yet if they be not followed, they will ſoon grow cold again. Weary out ſinners with your loving and earneſt entreaties; follow them, and give them no reſt in their ſin. This is true charity, and this is the way to ſave men's ſouls; and a courſe that will afford you comfort upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view.</item>
                  <item>6. Strive to bring all your exhortations to an iſſue; ſtick not in the work done, but look after the ſucceſs. I have long obſerved it in miniſters and private men, that if they ſpeak never ſo convincing words, and yet all their care is over when they have done their ſpeech, pretending that having done their duty, they leave the iſſue to GOD: theſe men ſeldom proſper in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: but thoſe whoſe very heart is ſet upon the work, and that long to ſee it take for the hearers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and uſe to enquire how it ſpeeds, GOD uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bleſſeth their labours, though more weak. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour therefore to drive all your ſpeeches to the deſired iſſue. If you are reproving ſin, ceaſe not till (if it may be) you have got the ſinner to promiſe you to leave it, and to avoid the occaſions of it: if you are exhorting to a duty, urge the party to promiſe you preſently to ſet upon it. If you would draw them to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> leave not, till you have made them confeſs, that their preſent ſtate is miſerable, and not to be reſted in: and till they have ſubſcribed to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a change; and promiſed you to fall cloſe to the uſe of means. O that all chriſtians would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to take this courſe with all their neighbours that are yet enſlaved to ſin, and ſtrangers to <hi>Chriſt!</hi>

               <p>And thus I have opened to you the firſt and great part of this duty, conſiſting in private exhortation, for the helping of poor ſouls to this reſt, that have yet no title to it; and I have ſhewed you alſo the manner how to perform it. I will now ſpeak a little of the next part.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Beſides the duty of private admonition, you muſt do your utmoſt endeavours to help men to profit by the public ordinances. And to that end, Firſt, do your endeavours for the procuring of faithful miniſters where they are wanting. This is GOD'S ordinary means of converting and ſaving. <hi>How ſhall they hear without a preacher?</hi> Not only for your own ſakes herefore, but for the poor miſerable ones about you, do all you can to bring this to paſs. Improve all your intereſt and diligence to this end. Ride, and go, and ſeek, and make friends till you prevail. Who knoweth how many ſouls may bleſs you, who have been converted by the miniſtry which you have procured? It is an higher and nobler work of charity, than if you gave all that you have to relieve their bodies.</p>
               <p>How ſmall a matter were it (and yet how excellent a work) for every gentleman of means in <hi>England,</hi> to cull out ſome one or two, or more poor boys in the country ſchools, who are the choiceſt wits, and of the moſt pious diſpoſitions, who are poor and unable to proceed in learning; and to maintain them till they are ſit for the miniſtry? It were but keeping a few ſuperfluous attendants the leſs, if they had hearts to it, it were eaſily ſpared out of their rich apparel, or ſuperfluous diet, I dare ſay, they would not be ſorry for it when they come to their reckoning: one ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:022331_0212_0FB7F013D9EC1008"/>feaſt, or one coſtly ſuit of apparel, would maintain a poor boy a year or two at the univerſity, who perhaps might come to have more true worth in him, than many a glittering lord, and to do GOD more ſervice in his church, than ever they did with all their eſtates and power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And when you enjoy the bleſſing of the goſpel, you muſt yet uſe your utmoſt diligence to help poor ſould to receive the fruit of it. To which end you muſt draw them conſtantly to hear and attend it: mind them often of what they have heard: draw them if it be poſſible, to repeat it in their families; if that cannot be, then draw them to come to others that do repeat it; that ſo it may not die in the hearing.

                  </gap>ſound opinions, nor at the time of public worſhip; nor yet to ſeparate from the church whereof you are members; but the work which I would have you meet about, is this, to repeat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the word which you have heard in public: to pour out your joint prayers for the church and your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: to join in cheerful ſinging the praiſes of GOD; to open your ſcruples and doubts, and fears, and get reſolution; to quicken each other in love and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, or holy walking: and all this not as a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated church, but as a part of the church more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent than the reſt in redeeming time, and helping the ſouls of each other heaven-ward.</p>
               <p n="3">3. One thing more I adviſe you: if you would have ſouls ſaved by the ordinances, labour ſtill to keep
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:022331_0213_0FB7F0152B57B400"/>the ordinances and miniſtry in eſteem, No man will be much wrought on by that which he deſpiſeth. I ſhall confirm you herein, not in my own words, but in his that I know you dare not diſregard, 1 Theſ. v. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Wherefore comfort yourſelves together, and edify one another, even as ye alſo do: and we beſeech you brethren to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you, and to eſteem them very highly in love for their work's ſake; and be at peace among yourſelves. Obey them that have the rule ever you, and ſubmit yourſelves; for they watch for your ſouls, as thoſe that muſt give an account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you,</hi> Heb. xiii. 17.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee part of your duty for the ſalvation of others.</p>
               <p>But where ſhall we find the man, that ſetteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to it with all his might, and that hath ſet his heart upon the ſouls of his brethren, that they may be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Let us here a little enquire, what may be the cauſes of the groſs neglect of this duty, that the hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being diſcovered, may the more eaſily be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One hinderance, is, men's own ſinfulneſs and guiltineſs. They have not been raviſhed themſelves with the heavenly delights: how then ſhould they draw others to ſeek them? They have not felt the wickedneſs of their own nature, nor their loft con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, nor their need of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor felt the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work of the Spirit: how then can they diſcover theſe to others? Ah that this were not the caſe of many a learned preacher in <hi>England!</hi> And the cauſe why they preach ſo frozenly! Men alſo are guilty
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:022331_0214_0FB7F016AE4542B8"/>themſelves of the ſins they ſhould reprove; and this ſtops their mouths, and maketh them aſhamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another hinderance, is, a ſecret infidelity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in men's hearts: Alas, ſirs, we do not ſure believe men's miſery; we do not believe ſure the threatenings of GOD are true. Did we verily believe that all the uregenerate and unholy ſhall be eternally tormented, oh how could we hold our tongues when we are among the unregenerate: how could we choſe but burſt out into tears when we look them in the face, as the prophet did when he looked upon <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el?</hi> Eſpecially when they are our kindred or friends that are near and dear to us? Thus doth ſecret unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief conſume the vigour of each grace and duty. Oh chriſtians, if you did verily believe that your poor neighbour, or wife, or huſband, or child, ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly lie for-ever in the flames of hell, except they be thoroughly changed, before death doth ſnatch them hence, would not this make you caſt off all diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, and lie at them day and night till they were perſuaded? How could you hold your tongue, or let them alone another day, if this were ſoundly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved? If you were ſure that any of your dear friends that are dead, were now in hell, and perſuading to repentance would get him out again, would not you perſuade him day and night if he were in hearing? And why ſhould you not do as much then to prevent it, while he is in your hearing, but that you do not believe GOD'S word that ſpeaks the danger? Oh were it not for this curſed unbelief, our own ſouls and our neighbour's would gain more by us than they do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This faithful dealing with men for their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is much hindered alſo by our want of compaſſion to men's ſouls. We are hard-hearted and cruel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the miſerable; and therefore (as the prieſt and
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:022331_0215_0FB7F01808421320"/>the Levite did by the wounded man) we look on them and paſs by. O what tender hearts could endure to look upon a poor, blind, forlorn ſinner, wounded by ſin and captivated by Satan, and never once open their mouths for his recovery! What though he be ſilent, and do not deſire thy help? yet his miſery cries aloud; miſery is the moſt effectual ſuitor to one that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate: if GOD had not heard the cry of our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries before he heard the cry of our prayers, and been moved by his own pity, before he was moved by our importunity, we might have long enough continued the ſlaves of Satan. Alas, what pitiful ſights do we daily ſee! The ignorant, the profane, the neglecters of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and their ſouls: their ſores are open and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all; and yet we do not pity them. You will pray to GOD for them, in cuſtomary duties, that GOD would open the eyes, and turn the hearts of your friends and neighbours: and why do you not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour their converſion if you deſire it? and if you do not deſire it, why do you aſk it? Doth not your negligence convince you of hypocriſy in your prayers, and of abuſing the moſt high GOD with your deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful words? Your neighbours are near you, your friends are in the houſe with you, you eat, and drink, and work, and walk, and talk with them, and yet you ſay little or nothing to them. Why do you not pray them to conſider and return, as well as pray GOD to convert and turn them? Have you as oft begged of them to think on their ways, and to reform, as you have taken on you to beg of GOD that they may ſo do? What if you ſhould ſee your neighbour fallen into a pit, and you ſhould preſently fall down on your knees, and pray GOD to help him out, but would neither put forth your hand to help him, nor once perſuade or direct him to help himſelf, would not any man cenſure you to be cruel and hypocritical? What the Holy Ghoſt ſaith of men's bodily miſeries, I may ſay much more of the miſery of their ſouls; <hi>If any man
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:022331_0216_0FB7F01BD82C04D0"/>ſeeth his brother in need, and ſhutteth up his compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> Or what love hath he to his brother's ſoul? The charity of our ignorant fore-fathers may riſe up in judgment againſt us, and condemn us: they would give all their eſtates almoſt, for ſo many maſſes or pardons, to deliver the ſouls of their friends from a feigned purgatory: and we will not as much as admoniſh and entreat them, to ſave them from the certain flames of hell.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another hinderance, is, a baſe man-pleaſing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that is in us. We are ſo loth to diſpleaſe men, and ſo deſirous to keep in credit and favour with them, that it makes us neglect our own duty. A fooliſh phyſician he is, and a moſt unfaithfal friend, that will let a ſick man die for fear of troubling him. And cruel wretches are we to our friends that will rather ſuffer them to go quickly to hell, than we will anger them, or hazard our reputation with them. If they did but fall in a ſwoon, we would rub them and pinch them, and never ſtick at hurting them. If they were diſtracted, we would bind them with chains, and we would pleaſe them in nothing that tended to their hurt. And yet when they are beſide themſelves in point of ſalvation, and in their madneſs poſting on to damnation, we will not ſtop them, for fear of diſpleaſing them. <hi>How can theſe men be chriſtians, that love the praiſe and favour of men, more than the ſavour of God?</hi> John xii. 43. <hi>For if they yet ſeek to pleaſe m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, they are no longer the ſervants of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. i. 10. To win them indeed they muſt become all things to all men: but to pleaſe them to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and let them periſh, that we may keep our credit with them, is a courſe ſo baſe and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly cruel, that he that hath the face of a chriſtian ſhould abhor it.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="218" facs="unknown:022331_0217_0FB7F01E55C7D610"/>
5. Another common hinderance, is, a ſinful baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. When we ſhould labour to make men aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their ſins, we are ourſelves aſhamed of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. May not theſe ſinners condemn us, when they will not bluſh to ſwear or be drunk, and we bluſh to tell them of it, and perſuade them from it? Sinners will boaſt of their ſins, and ſhew them in the open ſtreets: and ſhall not we be as bold in drawing them from ſin? Not that I would have inferiors forget their diſtance in admoniſhing their ſuperiors; but do it with all humility, and ſubmiſſion, and reſpect. But yet I would much leſs have them forget their duty to GOD and their friends, be they never ſo much their ſuperiors: it is a thing that muſt be done. Baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is unſeemly in caſes of flat neceſſity. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is not a work to be aſhamed of; to obey GOD in perſuading men from their ſins to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſave their ſouls, is not a buſineſs for a man to bluſh at. Yet, alas, what abundance of ſouls have been neglected through the prevailing of this ſin! Even the moſt of us are heinouſly guilty in this point. Reader! is not this thy own caſe? Hath not thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience told thee of thy duty many a time, and put thee on to ſpeak to poor ſinners, leſt they periſh? And yet thou haſt been aſhamed to open thy mouth to them, and ſo let them alone to ſink or ſwim; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me thou wilt ere long be aſhamed of this ſhame: O read thoſe words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and tremble: <hi>He that is aſhamed of me and of my words, before this adulterous generation, of him will the Son of Man be aſhamed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father and the angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. With many alſo pride is a great impediment. If it were to ſpeak to a great man, they would do it, ſo it would not diſpleaſe him. But to go among a company of ignorant beggars, or mean perſons, and to ſit with them in a ſmoaky naſly cottage, and there to exhort them from day to day; where is the perſon
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:022331_0218_0FB7F020486B3660"/>that will do it? Many will much rejoice if they have been inſtruments of converting a gentleman (and they have good cauſe) but for the common multitude, they look not after them: as if GOD were a reſpecter of the perſons of the rich, or the ſouls of all were not alike to him. Alas, theſe men little conſider how long <hi>Chriſt</hi> did ſtoop to us! When the GOD of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comes down in fleſh to worms, and goeth preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down among them from city to city. Not the ſillieſt women that he thought too low to confer with: few rich, and noble, and wiſe are called. It is the poor that receive the glad tidings of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>Object. O but, ſaith one, I am of ſo weak parts, that I am unable to manage an exhortation; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to men of ſtrong parts and underſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer,</hi> 1. Set thoſe upon the work who are more able. 2. Yet do not think that thou art ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed thyſelf, but uſe faithfully that ability which thou haſt; not in teaching thoſe of whom thou ſhouldſt learn, but in inſtructing thoſe that are more ignorant than thyſelf, and in exhorting thoſe that are negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the things which they do know. If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak well yourſelf, yet you can tell them what GOD ſpeaketh in his word. It is not the excellency of ſpeech that winneth the ſouls; but the authority of GOD manifeſted by that ſpeech, and the power of his word in the mouth of the inſtructor. A weak wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may tell what GOD ſaith in the plain paſſages of the word, as well as a learned man. If you cannot preach to them, yet you can ſay. Thus it is written. One of mean parts may remember the wiſeſt of their duty when they forget it.</p>
               <p>Object. It is my ſuperior: and is it ſit for me to teach or reprove my betters? Muſt the wife teach the huſband, of whom the ſcripture biddeth them learn?
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:022331_0219_0FB7F0254E704230"/>Or muſt the child teach the parents, whoſe duty it is to teach them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer,</hi> 1. It is ſit that huſbands ſhould be able to touch their wives, and parents to teach their children; and GOD expecteth they ſhould be ſo, and therefore commandeth the inſeriors to learn of them. But if they through their negligence diſable themſelves, or through their wickedneſs bring their ſouls into ſuch miſery, then it is themſelves, and not you, that break GOD's order, by bringing themſelves into diſability and miſery.</p>
               <p>Matter of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ers and manners muſt be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with in caſes of ſlat neceſſity. Though it were your miniſter, you muſt teach him in ſuch a caſe. It is the part of parents to provide for their children, and not children for their parents: and yet if the parents fall into want, muſt not the children relieve them? It is the part of the huſband to diſpoſe of the affairs of the family and eſtate: and yet if he be ſick and beſide himſelf, muſt not the wiſe do it? The rich ſhould relieve the poor: but if the rich fall into beggary, they muſt be relieved themſelves. It is the work of a phyſician to look to the health of others: and, yet if he fall ſick, ſome body muſt help him. So muſt the meaneſt ſervant admoniſh his maſter, and the child his parent, and the wiſe her huſband, and the people their miniſters, in caſes of neceſſity. Yet ſecondly, let me give you theſe two cautions here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That you do not pretend neceſſity when there is none, out of a mere deſire of teaching. There is ſcarce a more certain diſcovery of a proud heart, than to be more deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>us to teach, than to learn; eſpecially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoſe that are fitter to teach us.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="221" facs="unknown:022331_0220_0FB7F0270C40A478"/>
2. And when the neceſſity of your ſuperiors doth call for your advice, yet do it with all poſſible humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, modeſty, and meekneſs. Let them diſcern your reverence and ſubmiſſion in the humble manner of your addreſſes to them. Let them perceive that you do it not out of a mere teaching humour, or proud ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſs. If a wife ſhould tell her huſband of ſin in a maſterly railing language; or if a ſervant reprove his maſter, or a child his father in a ſaucy way, what good could be expected from ſuch reproof? But if they ſhould meekly and humbly open to him his ſin and danger, and entreat him to bear with them in what GOD commandeth, and if they could by tears teſtify their ſenſe of his caſe: what father, or maſter, or huſband could take this ill?</p>
               <p>Object. But ſome may ſay, this will make all as preachers, and cauſe all to break over the bounds of their callings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer,</hi> 1. This is not taking a paſtoral charge of ſouls, nor making an office or calling of it, as preachers do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And in the way of our callings, every good chriſtian is a teacher, and hath a charge of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's ſoul. Let it be only the voice of a <hi>Cain</hi> to ſay, <hi>Am I my brother's keeper?</hi> I would one of theſe men, that are ſo loth that private men ſhould teach them, to tell me, what if a man fall down in a ſwoon in the ſtreets, though it be your father or ſuperior, would you not take him up preſently, and uſe all means to recover him? Or would you let him lie and die, and ſay, it is the work of the phyſician, and not mine: I will not invade the phyſician's calling. In two caſes every man is a phyſician; firſt, in caſe of neceſſity, and when a phyſician cannot be had: and ſecondly, in caſe the hurt be ſo ſmall, that every man can do as
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:022331_0221_0FB7F028909D5390"/>well as the phyſician. And in the ſame two caſes, every man muſt be a teacher.</p>
               <p>Object. Some will further object, to put off this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the party is ſo ignorant, or ſtupid, or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or rooted in ſin, and hath been ſo oft exhorted in vain, that there is no hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer,</hi> How know you when there is no hope? Cannot GOD yet cure him? And have not many as far gone been cured? Should not a merciful phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an uſe means while there is life? and is it not inhuman cruelty in you to give up your friend to the devil as hopeleſs, upon mere backwardneſs to your duty, or upon groundleſs diſcouragements? What if you had been ſo given up yourſelf when you were ignorant?</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But we muſt not caſt pearls before ſwine, nor give that which is holy to dogs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer,</hi> That is but a favourable diſpenſation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for your own ſafety. When you are in danger of being torn in pieces, <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear: but what is that to you that are in no ſuch danger? As long as they will hear, you have encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ſpeak, and may not caſt them off as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous ſwine.</p>
               <p>Object. O but it is a friend that I have all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on; and by telling him of his ſin and miſery, I may loſe his love, and ſo be undone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer,</hi> Sure no man that hath the face of a chriſtian, will for ſhame own ſuch an objection as this. Yet. I doubt, it oft prevaileth in the heart. Is his love more to be valued than his ſafety? Or thy own benefit by him than the ſalvation of his ſoul? Or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lt thou connive at his damnation, becauſe he is
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:022331_0222_0FB7F02ACEE53798"/>thy friend? Is that thy beſt requital of his friendſhip? Hadſt thou rather he ſhould burn for-ever in hell, than thou ſhouldſt loſe his favour, or the maintenance thou haſt from him?</p>
               <p>To conclude this uſe, that I may prevail with every ſoul that feareth GOD, to uſe their utmoſt diligence to help all about them to this bleſſed reſt, let me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to conſider theſe following motives:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, nature teacheth the communicating of good, and grace doth eſpecially diſpoſe the ſoul thereto; the neglect therefore of this work, is a ſin both againſt nature and grace.</p>
               <p>Would you not think that man or woman unnatural, that would let their children or neighbours famiſh in the ſtreets, while they have proviſion at hand? And is not he more unnatural, that will let his children or neighbours periſh eternally, and will not open his mouth to ſave them? Certainly this is moſt barbarous cruelty. We account an unmerciful, cruel man, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry monſter, to be abhorred of all. Many vicious men are too much loved in the world, but a cruel man is abhorred of all. Now that it may appear to you what a cruel thing this neglect of ſouls is, do but conſider theſe two things. Firſt, how great a work it is. Secondly, how ſmall a matter it is that thou refuſeſt to do for the accompliſhing ſo great a work. Firſt, it is to ſave thy brother from eternal flames, that he may not there lie roaring in endleſs remedileſs tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is to bring him to the everlaſting reſt, where he may live in inconceivable happineſs with GOD. Secondly, and what is it that you ſhould do to help him herein? Why, it is to perſuade him, and lay open to him his ſin, and his duty, his miſery, and the remedy, till you have made him willing to yield to the offers and commands of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And is this ſo
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:022331_0223_0FB7F02EDB1238B8"/>great a matter for to do, to the attaining ſuch a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed end? Is not the ſoul of a huſband, or wife, or child, or neighbour, worth a few words? It is worth this, or it is worth nothing. If they lay dying in the ſtreets, and a few words would ſave their lives, would not every man ſay, he was a cruel wretch that would let them periſh rather than ſpeak to them? Even the covetous hypocrite, that <hi>James</hi> reproveth, would give a few words to the poor, and ſay, <hi>Go and be warmed, and be clothed.</hi> What a barbarous, unmerciful wretch then art thou, that wilt not vouchſafe a few words of ſerious, ſober admonition, to ſave the ſoul of thy neighbour or friend? Cruelty and unmercifulneſs to men's bodies, is a moſt damnable ſin; but to their ſouls much more, as the ſoul is of greater worth than the body, and as eternity is of greater moment than this ſhort time.</p>
               <p>Alas! you do not ſee or feel what caſe their ſouls are in, when they are in hell, for want of your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful admonition. Little know you what many a ſoul may now be feeling, who have been your neighbours and acquaintance, and died in their ſins, on whom you never beſtowed one hour's ſober advice for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting their unhappineſs. If you knew their miſery, you would now do more to bring them out of hell: but, alas! it is too late, you ſhould have done it while they were with you; it is now too late. As one ſaid of phyſicians, <q>That they were the moſt happy men, becauſe all their good deeds and cures were ſeen above ground to their praiſe, but all their miſtakes and neglects were buried out of ſight.</q> So I may ſay to you, many a neglect of yours to the ſouls about you, may be now buried with thoſe ſouls in hell, out of your ſight, and therefore now it doth not much trouble you; but alas! they feel it, though you feel it not. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> cried out, <hi>My bowels, my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, I cannot hold my peace,</hi> becauſe of a temporal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:022331_0224_0FB7F0304BF29FD0"/>of his people: and do not our bowels yearn? And can we hold our peace at men's eternal deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, What a rate <hi>Chriſt</hi> did value ſouls at, and what he hath done towards the ſaving of them: he thought them worth his blood, and ſhall not we think them worth the breath of our mouths? Will you not do a little, where he hath done ſo much?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, What a deal of guilt this neglect doth lay upon thy ſoul. Firſt, thou art guilty of the murder and damnation of all thoſe ſouls whom thou doſt neglect. He that ſtandeth by, and ſeeth a man in a pit, and will not pull him out if he can, doth drown him. And he that ſtandeth by while thieves rob him, or murderers kill him, and will not help him if he can, is acceſſary to the fact. And ſo he that will ſilently ſuffer men to damn their ſouls, or will let Satan and the world deceive them, and not offer to help them, will certainly be judged guilty of damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. And is not this a moſt dreadful conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? O ſirs, how many ſouls then have every one of us been guilty of damning! What a number of our neighbours and acquaintance are dead, in whom we diſcerned no ſigns of ſanctification, and we never once plainly told them of it, or how to be recovered! If you had been the cauſe but of burning a man's houſe through your negligence, or of undoing him, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying his body, how would it trouble you as long as you lived? If you had but killed a man unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it would much diſquiet you. We have known thoſe that have been guilty of murder, that could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſleep quietly after, nor have one comfortable day, their own conſciences did ſo vex and torment them. O what a heart muſt thou have, that haſt been guilty of murdering ſuch a multitude of precious ſouls! Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, when thou lookeſt thy friend or carnal
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:022331_0225_0FB7F0318B8C5450"/>neighbour in the face; and think with thyſelf, can I find in my heart, through my ſilence and negligence, to be guilty of his everlaſting burning in hell? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks ſuch a thought ſhould even untie the tongue of the dumb.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as you are guilty of their periſhing, ſo are you of every ſin which in the mean-time they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. If they were converted, they would break off their courſe of ſinning: and if you did your duty, you know not but they might be converted. As he that is guilty of a man's drunkenneſs, is guilty of all the ſins which that drunkenneſs doth cauſe him to commit: ſo he that is guilty of a man's continuing unregenerate, is alſo guilty of the ſins of his unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy. How many curſes and oaths, and other ſins of a moſt heinous nature are many of you guilty of, that little think of it? You that take much pains for your own ſouls, and ſeem fearful of ſinning, would take it ill of one that ſhould tell you, that you are guilty of weekly, or daily whoredoms, and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſwearing, and lying. And yet it is too true, even beyond all denial, by your neglect of helping thoſe who do commit them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You are guilty alſo of all thoſe judgments, which thoſe men's ſins bring upon the town or country where they live. I know, you are not ſuch atheiſts, but you believe it is GOD that ſendeth ſickneſs, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and war; and alſo that it is only ſin that mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to this indignation. What doubt then is there, but you are the cauſe of judgments, who do not ſtrive againſt thoſe ſins which cauſe them? GOD hath ſtaid long in patience, to ſee if any would deal plainly with the ſinners of the times, and ſo free their own ſouls from the guilt: but when he ſeeth that there is none, but all become guilty; no wonder then if he lay the judgment upon all. We have all ſeen
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:022331_0226_0FB7F033CD2478B0"/>the drunkards, and heard the ſwearers, in our ſtreets, and we would not ſpeak to them: we have all lived in the midſt of an ignorant, worldly, unholy people; and we have not ſpoke to them with earneſtneſs, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and love; no wonder then if GOD ſpeak in his wrath both to them and us. <hi>Eli</hi> did not commit the ſin himſelf, and yet he ſpeaketh ſo coldly againſt it, that he muſt bear the puniſhment. GOD locketh up the clouds, becauſe we have ſhut up our mouths. The earth is grown as hard as iron to us, becauſe we have hardened our hearts againſt our miſerable neighbours. The cries of the poor for bread are loud, becauſe our cries againſt ſin have been ſo low. Sickneſſes run a pace from houſe to houſe, and ſweep away the poor unprepared inhabitants, becauſe we ſwept not out the ſin that breedeth them. As <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid in another caſe, <hi>Luke</hi> xix. 40. <hi>If theſe ſhould hold their peace, the ſtones would ſpeak:</hi> ſo, becauſe we held our peace at the ignorance, ungodlineſs, and wickedneſs of our places, therefore do theſe plagues and judgments ſpeak.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider, What a thing it will be, to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your poor friends in thoſe flames, and to think that your neglect was a great cauſe of it! And that there was a time when you might have done much to prevent it. If you ſhould there periſh with them, it would be no ſmall aggravation of your torment; if you be in heaven, it would ſure be a ſad thought, were it poſſible that any ſorrow could dwell there, to hear a multitude of poor ſouls there to cry out for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. O if you would but have told me plainly of my ſin and danger, and dealt roundly with me. I might have eſcaped all this torment, and been now in reſt! O what a ſad voice will this be!</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider, How diligent are the enemies of theſe poor ſouls to draw them to hell. And if no body be diligent in helping them to heaven, what is like to
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:022331_0227_0FB7F0354E9C6310"/>become of them? The devil is tempting them day and night: their inward luſts are ſtill working and withdrawing them: the fleſh is ſtill pleading for its delights and profits: their old companions are ready to entice them to ſin, and to diſgrace GOD'S ways and people to them, and to contradict the doctrine of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that ſhould ſave them, and to increaſe their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of holineſs. Seducing teachers are exceeding diligent in ſowing tares, and in drawing off the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable from the way to life: and ſhall a ſeducer be ſo unwearied in proſelyting poor ungrounded ſouls to his fancies? And ſhall not a ſound chriſtian be much more unwearied in labouring to win men to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and life?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider, The neglect of this doth very deeply wound when conſcience is awakened. When a man comes to die, conſcience will aſk him, What good haſt thou done in thy life-time? The ſaving of ſouls is the greateſt good; What haſt thou done towards this? How many haſt thou dealt faithfully with? I have oft obſerved, that the conſciences of dying men, very much wound them for this omiſſion. For my own part (to tell you my experience) when ever I have been near death, my conſcience hath accuſed me more for this than for any ſin: it would bring every ignorant, profane neighbour to my remembrance, to whom I never made known their danger: it would tell me, thou ſhouldſt have gone to them in private, and told them plainly of their deſperate danger, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out baſhfulneſs or daubing, though it had been when thou ſhouldſt have eaten or ſlept, if thou hadſt no other time: conſcience would remember me, how at ſuch a time, or ſuch a time. I was in company with the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, or was riding by the way with a wilful ſinner, and had a fit opportunity to have dealt with him, but did not: or at leaſt did it by halves, and to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. The LORD grant I may better obey conſcience
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:022331_0228_0FB7F03793FA8080"/>hereafter while I live and have time, that it may have leſs to accuſe me of at death!</p>
               <p n="7">7. Conſider, laſtly, the happy conſequences of this work, where it is faithfully done: to name ſome:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. You may be inſtrumental in that bleſſed work of ſaving ſouls, a work that <hi>Chriſt</hi> came down and died for, a work that the angels of GOD rejoice in; for, ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>If any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him, let him know, that he which converteth the ſinner from the error of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſins.</hi> James v. 19, 20. And how can GOD more highly honour you, than to make you inſtruments in ſo great a work?</item>
                  <item>2. Such ſouls will bleſs you here and hereafter. They may be angry with you at firſt; but if your words ſucceed, they will bleſs the day that ever they knew you, and bleſs GOD that ſent you to ſpeak to them.</item>
                  <item>3. It bringeth much advantage to yourſelves: firſt, it will increaſe your graces, both as it is a courſe that GOD will bleſs, and as it is an acting of them in this perſuading of others: he that will not let you loſe a cup of water which is given for him, will not let you loſe theſe greater works of charity; beſides, thoſe that have practiſed this duty, muſt find by experience, that they never go on more proſperouſly towards heaven, than when they do moſt to help others thither with them: it is not here as with worldly treaſure, the more you give away, the leſs you have: but the more you give, the more you have: the ſetting forth <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his fulneſs to others, will warm your own hearts; the opening the evil and danger of ſin to others, will increaſe your hatred of it. Secondly, it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:022331_0229_0FB7F0390B718120"/>your glory as well as your grace, both as a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which GOD will reward, (<hi>For they that convert ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to righteouſneſs ſhall ſhine as the ſtars for-ever and ever.</hi> Dan. xii. 3.) and alſo as we ſhall there behold them in heaven, and be their aſſociates in bleſſedneſs, whom GOD made us here the inſtruments to convert. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, however, it will give us much peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whether we ſucceed or not, to think that we were faithful, and did our beſt to ſave them, and that we are clear from the blood of all men. Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that is a work, that if it ſucceed doth exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly rejoice an honeſt heart: he that hath any ſenſe of GOD's honour, or the leaſt affection to the ſoul of his brother, muſt needs rejoice much at his converſion, whoſoever be the inſtrument, but eſpecially when GOD maketh ourſelves the means of ſo bleſſed a work.</item>
               </list>
               <p>For my own part, it is an unſpeakable comfort to me, that GOD hath made me an inſtrument for the recovering of ſo many from bodily diſeaſes, and ſaving their natural lives; but all this is nothing to the comfort I have in the ſucceſs of my labours, in the converſion and comfirmation of ſouls; it is ſo great a joy to me, that it drowneth the painfulneſs of my daily duties, and the trouble of my daily languiſhing and bodily griefs. And maketh all theſe, with all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and difficulties in my work, to be eaſy: and of all the perſonal mercies that ever I received, next to his love in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to my ſoul, I moſt joyfully bleſs him for the plenteous ſucceſs of my endeavours upon others: O what fruits then might I have ſeen, if I had been more faithful, and plied the work in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and public as I ought! I know we have need to be very jealous of our deceitful hearts in this point, leſt our rejoicing ſhould come from our pride. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally we would every man, be in the place of GOD, and have the praiſe of every good work aſcribed to ourſelves: but yet to imitate our Father in goodneſs,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:022331_0230_0FB7F03B8B361630"/>and to rejoice in that degree we attain to, is the part of every child of GOD. I tell you therefore, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you from my own experience, that if you did but know what a joyful thing it is to be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſaving of ſouls, you would ſet upon it preſently, and follow it night and day through the greateſt diſcouragements and reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewed you what ſhould perſuade you to this duty. Let me now conclude with a word of entreaty: firſt, to all the godly in general. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſome above others in particular.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> An Advice to ſome more particularly to help others to this Reſt.</head>
               <p>UP then every man that hath a tongue, and is a ſervant of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and do ſomething of this your Maſter's work: Why hath he given you a tongue but to ſpeak in his ſervice? And how can you ſerve him more eminently, than in the ſaving of ſouls? He that will pronounce you bleſſed at the laſt day, and ſentence you to the kingdom prepared for you, becauſe you fed him, and clothed him, and viſited him, in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, will ſurely pronounce you bleſſed for ſo great a work as the bringing over of ſouls to his kingdom. He that ſaith, <hi>The poor you have always with you,</hi> hath left the ungodly always with you, that you might ſtill have matter to exerciſe you charity upon. O if you have the hearts of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> or of men in you, let them yearn towards your poor, ignorant, ungodly and neighbours! Alas, there is but a ſtep betwixt them, and death, and hell; many hundred diſeaſes are wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:022331_0231_0FB7F03DA8EDEBA8"/>ready to ſeize them, and if they die unregenerate, they are loſt for-ever. Have you hearts of rock, that cannot pity men in ſuch a caſe? If you believe not the word of GOD, how are you chriſtians yourſelves? If you do but believe it, why do you not beſtir you to help others? Do you not care who is damned, ſo you be ſaved? If ſo, you have as much cauſe to pity your ownſelves; for it is a frame of ſpirit inconſiſtent with grace: ſhould you not rather ſay, as the lepers of <hi>Samaria,</hi> is it not a day of glad tidings, and we ſit ſtill, and hold our peace? Hath GOD had ſo much mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on you, and will you have no mercy on your poor neighbours? You need not go far to find objects for your pity: look but into the ſtreets, or into the next houſe to you, and you will probably find ſome. Have you not a neighbour that ſets his heart below, and neglecteth eternity? What bleſſed place do you live in, where there is none ſuch? If there be not ſome of them in thine own family, it is well; and yet art thou ſilent? Doſt thou live cloſe by them, or meet them in the ſtreets, or labour with them, or travel with them, or ſit ſtill and talk with them, and ſay nothing to them of their ſouls, or the life to come? If their houſes were on fire, thou wouldſt run and help them; and wilt thou not help them when their ſouls are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the fire of hell? If thou knoweſt but a remedy for their diſeaſes thou wouldſt tell it them, or elſe thou wouldſt judge thyſelf guilty of their death. <hi>Cardan</hi> ſpeaks of one that had a receipt that would diſſolve the ſtone in the bladder, and he makes no doubt but that man is in hell, becauſe he never revealed it to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died: what ſhall we ſay then of them that know the remedy for curing ſouls, and do not reveal it; nor perſuade men to make uſe of it? Is it not hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrify to pray <hi>that God</hi>'s <hi>name may be hallowed,</hi> and never endeavour to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ring men to <hi>hallow</hi> it? And can you pray, <hi>Let thy kingdom come;</hi> and yet never labour for the coming or increaſe of that kingdom? Is it not
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:022331_0232_0FB7F03FC8B92B68"/>grief to your hearts to ſee the kingdom of Satan flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and to ſee him lead captive ſuch a multitude of ſouls? you ſay you are ſoldiers of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and will you do nothing againſt his prevailing enemies? You pray alſo daily, <hi>That his will may be done;</hi> and ſhould you not daily then perſuade men to do it? You pray, <hi>That God would forgive them th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ir ſins, and that he would not lead them into temptation, but deliver them from evil.</hi> And yet will you not help them againſt temptations, nor help to deliver them from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt evil? Nor help them to repent and believe, that they may be forgiven? Alas, that your prayers and your practice ſhould ſo much diſagree! Look about you therefore, chriſtians, with an eye of compaſſion on the ſinners about you; be not like the Prieſt or Levite that ſaw the man wounded, and paſſed by: GOD did not ſo paſs by you, when it was your own caſe. Are not the ſouls of your neighbours fallen into the hands of Satan? Doth not their miſery cry out to you, help, help! As you have any compaſſion towards men in the greateſt miſery, help! As you have the hearts of men, and not of tygers in you, help!</p>
               <p>But as this duty lieth upon all in general, ſo upon ſome more eſpecially, according as GOD hath called or qualified them thereto. To them therefore more particularly I will addreſs my exhortation: whether they be ſuch as have more opportunity and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for this work, or ſuch as have better abilities to perform it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All you that GOD hath given more learning and knowledge to, or endued with better utterance than your neigbours; GOD expecteth this duty eſpecially at your hand. The ſtrong are made to help the weak, and thoſe that ſee muſt direct the blind. GOD look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for this faithful improvement of your parts and gifts, which if you neglect, it were better for you that
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:022331_0233_0FB7F043439F5670"/>you never had received them: for they will but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your condemnation, and be as uſeleſs to your own ſalvation as they were to others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All thoſe that have eſpecially familiarity with ſome ungodly men, and that have intereſt in them, GOD looks for this duty at their hands. <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did eat and drink with the publicans and ſinners, but it was only to be their phyſician, and not their companion. GOD might give you intereſt in them to this end, that you might be a means of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. They that will not regard the words of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will regard a brother, or ſiſter, or huſband, or wife, or near friend: beſides that the bond of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip doth engage you to more kindneſs and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Phyſicians that are much about dying men, ſhould in a ſpecial manner make a conſcience of this duty: they have a treble advantage. Firſt, they are at hand. Secondly, they are with men in ſickneſs and dangers, when the ear is more open, and the heart leſs ſtubborn than in time of health. He that made a ſcorn of godlineſs before, will hear counſel then, if ever he will hear it. Thirdly, beſides, they look upon their phyſician as a man in whoſe hand is their life: or who at leaſt may do much to ſave them, and therefore they will the more regard his advice. Therefore you that are of this honourable profeſſion, do not think this a work beſides your calling, as if it belonged to none but miniſters; except you think it beſides your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be compaſſionate, or to be chriſtians. Help to fit your patients for heaven, and whether you ſee they are for life or death, teach them both how to live and how to die, and give them ſome phyſic for their ſouls, as you do for their bodies. Bleſſed be GOD that very many of the chief phyſicians of this age have, by
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:022331_0234_0FB7F045CEA3F0A8"/>their eminent piety, vindicated their profeſſion from the common imputation of atheiſm and profaneneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another ſort that have excellent advantage for this duty, are men that have wealth and authority, and are of great place or command in the world, eſpecially that have many who live in dependance on them. O what a world of good might gentlemen and lords do, that have a great many tenants, and that are the leaders of the country, if they had but hearts to improve their intereſt and advantage! Little do you that are ſuch, think of the duty that lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you in this. Have you not all honour and riches from GOD? Is it not evident then, that you muſt employ them for the advantage of his ſervice? Do you not know who hath ſaid, <hi>That to whom men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit much, from them they will expect the more?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have the greateſt opportunities to do good, of moſt men in the world. Your tenants dare not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict you, leſt you diſpoſſeſs them or their children of their habitations: they fear you more, than the threatenings of the ſcriptures; they will ſooner obey you than GOD. If you ſpeak to them of GOD. and their ſouls, you may be regarded, when even a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſhall be deſpiſed. O therefore as you value the honour of GOD, your own comfort, and the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſouls, improve your intereſt to the utmoſt for GOD. Go viſit your tenants' and neighbours' houſes, and ſee whether they worſhip GOD in their families, and take all opportunities to preſs them to their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Do not deſpiſe them, becauſe they are poor or ſimple. Remember, GOD is no reſpecter of perſons; your fleſh is of no better metal than theirs; nor will the worms ſpare your faces or hearts any more than theirs; nor will your bones or duſt bear the badge of your gentility; you muſt be all equals when you ſtand in judgment; and therefore help the ſoul of a
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:022331_0235_0FB7F04851003FC8"/>poor man, as well as if he were a gentleman: and let men ſee that you excell others as much in piety, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs, compaſſion and diligence in GOD'S work, as you do in riches and honour.</p>
               <p>I confeſs you are like to be ſingular if you take this courſe; but then remember, you ſhall be ſingular in glory, for <hi>few great, and mighty, and noble are called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Another ſort that have ſpecial opportunity to help others to heaven, are the miniſters of the goſpel: as they have, or ſhould have more ability than others, ſo it is the very work of their calling; and every one expecteth it at their hands, and will better ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their teachers, than to others. I intend not theſe inſtructions ſo much to teachers, as to others, and therefore I ſhall ſay but little to them; and if all, or moſt miniſters among us were as faithful and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent as ſome, I would ſay nothing. But becauſe it is otherwiſe, let me give theſe two or three words of advice to my brethren in this office.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be ſure that the recovering and ſaving ſouls, be the main end of your ſtudies and preaching. O do not propound any low and baſe ends to yourſelves. This is the end of your calling, let it be alſo the end of your endeavours. GOD forbid that you ſhould ſpend a week's ſtudy to pleaſe the people, or to ſeek the advancing your own reputations. Dare you appear in the pulpit on ſuch a buſineſs, and ſpeak for yourſelves, when you are ſent and pretend to ſpeak for <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Set out the work of GOD as ſkilfully as you can; but ſtill let the winning of ſouls be your end, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways judge that the beſt means, that moſt conduceth to the end. Do not think that GOD is beſt ſerved by a neat, ſtarched oration: but that he is the able, ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miniſter, that is beſt ſkilled in the art of inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:022331_0236_0FB7F0499373F718"/>convincing, perſuading, and that is the beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that is beſt in theſe. Let the vigor alſo of your perſuaſions ſhew, that you are ſenſible on how weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a buſineſs you are ſent. Preach with that ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fervour as men that believe their own doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and know their hearers muſt either be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, or be damned. What you would do to ſave them from everlaſting burning, that do while you have the opportunity and price in your hand, that people may diſcern you mean as you ſpeak; and that you are not ſtage-players, but preachers of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of ſalvation. Remember what <hi>Cicero</hi> faith, <q>That if the matter be never ſo combuſtible, yet if you put not fire to it, it will not burn.</q> And what <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaith. <q>That an hot iron will pierce, when a cold one will not.</q> And if the wiſe men of the world account you mad, ſay as <hi>Paul, If we are beſide ourſelves, it is to God:</hi> and remember that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſo buſy in doing of good, that his friends themſelves begun to lay hands on him, thinking he had been beſide himſelf, <hi>Mark</hi> iii.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond and chief word of advice that I would give you, is this: do not think that all your work is in ſtudies, and in the pulpit. I confeſs that is great; but, alas! it is but a ſmall part of your taſk. You are ſhepherds and muſt know every ſheep, and what is their diſeaſe, and mark their ſtrayings, and help to cure them, and fetch them home.</p>
               <p>O learn of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> xx. 19, 20.31. to preach publicly, and from houſe to houſe, night and day with tears. Let there not be a ſoul in your charge that ſhall not be particularly inſtructed and watched over.

<pb n="238" facs="unknown:022331_0237_0FB7F04B0A84EEA0"/>of their ſeveral relations, and uſe the means to increaſe their abilities. See whether they daily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip GOD in their families, and ſet them in a way, and teach them how to do it: confer with them about the doctrines and practice of religion, and how they receive and profit by public teaching, and anſwer all their carnal objections; keep in familiarity with them that you may maintain your intereſt in them, and improve all your intereſt for GOD. See that no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers creep in amongſt them, or if they do, be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to countermine them, and preſerve your people from the infection of hereſies and ſchiſms; or if they be infected, be diligent to procure their recovery; not with paſſion and lordlineſs, but with patience and condeſcenſion: as <hi>Maſculus</hi> did by the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> viſiting them in priſon, where the magiſtrate had caſt them, and there inſtructing and relieving them; and though they reviled him when he came, and called him a falſe prophet and antichriſtian ſeducer that thirſted for their blood, yet he would not ſo leave them, till at laſt by his meekneſs and love he had overcome them, and recovered many to the truth, and to unity with the church.</p>
               <p>If any be <hi>weak in the faith, receive him, but not to doubtful diſputations.</hi> If any be too careleſs of their duties, and too little ſavour the things of the Spirit, let them be pitied, and not neglected: if any walk ſcandalouſly and diſorderly, deal with them for their recovery, with all diligence and patience, and ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the heinouſneſs and danger of their ſin: if they prove obſtinate, after all, then avoid them, and caſt them off: if they be ignorant, it may be your fault as well as theirs; but however, they are fitter to be inſtructed than rejected, except they abſolutely reſuſe to be taught. <hi>Chriſt</hi> will give you no thanks for keeping, or putting out ſuch from his ſchool that are unlearned, when their deſire or will is to be
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:022331_0238_0FB7F04C8C9442B8"/>taught. I confeſs it is eaſier to ſhut out the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, than to beſtow our pains night and day in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; but wo to ſuch ſlothful, unfaithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Who then is a faithful and a wiſe ſervant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his houſehold, to give them their meat in due ſeaſon, according to every one's age and capacity? <hi>Bleſſed is that ſervant whom his Lord, when he cometh, ſhall find ſo doing.</hi> O be not aſleep while the wolf is waking! Let your eye be quick in obſerving the dangers and ſtrayings of your people. If jealouſies, heart-burnings, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions ariſe among them, quench them before they break out into raging, irreſiſtible flames. As ſoon as you diſcern any to turn worldly, or proud, or fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, or ſelf-conceited, or diſobedient, or cold, and ſlothful in his duty; delay not, but preſently make out for his recovery: remember how many are loſers in the loſs of a ſoul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do not daub, or deal ſlightly with any; ſome will not tell their people plainly of their ſins, becauſe they are great men; as if none but the poor ſhould plainly be dealt with: do not you ſo, but reprove them ſharply, (though differently and with wiſdom) that they may be ſound in faith. GOD doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently engage us to deal plainly; he hath bid us ſpeak and fear not: he hath promiſed to ſtand by us; and he will be our ſecurity. I had rather hear from the mouth of <hi>Balak,</hi> GOD <hi>hath kept thee from honour;</hi> or from <hi>Ahab, feed him with the bread and water of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;</hi> than to hear conſcience ſay, <hi>Thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed ſouls to damnation by thy cowardice and ſilence;</hi> or to hear GOD ſay, <hi>Their blood will I require at thy hands;</hi> or to hear from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the judge, <hi>Caſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervant into outer darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth;</hi> yea, or to hear theſe ſinners cry out againſt me in eternal fire, and with implacable rage to charge me with their undoing.</p>

                  <pb n="240" facs="unknown:022331_0239_0FB7F04F011DCC10"/>
And as you muſt be plain and ſerious, ſo labour to be ſkilful and diſcreet, that the manner may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what anſwer the excellency of the matter. How oft have I heard a ſtammering tongue, with ridiculous expreſſions, vain repetitions, tedious circumlocutions, and unſeemly pronunciation, ſpoil moſt precious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and make the hearers either loath it, or laugh at it! How common are theſe extremes, while one ſpoils the food of life by affectation, and new-faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mincing, and pedantic toys, either ſetting forth a little and mean matter with a great deal of froth, and gaudy dreſſing; or hiding excellent truths in a heap of vain rhetoric on the other ſide! How many by their ſlovenly dreſſing, make men loath the food of life, and caſt up that which ſhoul nouriſh them! Such novices are admitted into the ſacred function, to the hardening of the wicked, and the diſgrace of the work of the LORD; and thoſe that are not able to ſpeak ſenſe or reaſon, are made the ambaſſadors of the moſt high GOD.</p>
               <p>O therefore let me beſpeak you my brethren, in the name of the LORD, eſpecially thoſe that are more young and weak, that you tremble at the greatneſs of this holy employment, and run not up into a pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit as boldly as into the market-place: ſtudy and pray, pray and ſtudy, till you are become workmen that need not be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word of truth, that your people may not be aſhamed, or weary to hear you: but that beſides your clear unfolding the doctrine of the goſpel, you may alſo be maſters of your people's affections. It is a work that requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your moſt ſerious ſearching thoughts: running, haſty, eaſy ſtudies, bring forth blind births. When you are the moſt renowned doctors in the church of GOD, alas, how little is it that you know, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of all that which you are ignorant of!</p>

                  <pb n="241" facs="unknown:022331_0240_0FB7F050582964F0"/>
4. Be ſure that your converſation be teaching as well as your doctrine. Do not confute your doctrine by your practice. Be as forward in an holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly life, as you are in preſſing it on others. Let your diſcourſe be as edifying and ſpiritual, as you teach them theirs muſt be: for evil language give them good; and bleſſing for their curſing. Suffer any thing, rather than the goſpel and men's ſouls ſhould ſuffer: <hi>Become all things</hi> (lawful) <hi>to all men, if by any means you may win ſome.</hi> Let men ſee that you uſe not the miniſtry only for a trade to live by; but that your hearts are ſet upon the welfare of their ſouls. Whatſoever meekneſs, humility, condeſcenſion, or ſelf-denial you teach them from the goſpel, O teach it them alſo by your undiſſembled example. This is to be guides, and pilots, and governors of the church indeed.</p>
               <p>What an odious ſight is it, to ſee pride and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preach humility! and an earthly-minded man preach for an heavenly converſation!</p>
               <p>Do I need to tell you that are teachers of others, that we have but a little while longer to preach? And but a few more breaths to breathe? And then we muſt come down, and be accountable for our work? Do I need to tell you, that we muſt die, and be judged as well as our people? Or that juſtice is moſt ſevere about the ſanctuary? And <hi>judgment beginneth at the houſe of</hi> GOD?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The laſt whom I would perſuade to this great work of helping others to the heavenly reſt, is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and maſters of families. All you that GOD hath intruſted with children or ſervants, conſider what duty lieth on you for furthering their ſalvation. That this exhortation may be the more effectual with
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:022331_0241_0FB7F051CC2D3000"/>you, I will lay down ſeveral conſiderations for you ſeriouſly to think on.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What plain and preſſing commands of GOD are there, that require this great duty at your hand! <hi>Deut.</hi> vi. 6, 7, 8. <hi>And theſe words which I command thee this day ſhall be in thy heart, and thou ſhalt teach them diligently to thy children, ſpeaking of them when thou ſitteſt in thy houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi> And how well is GOD pleaſed with this in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> xviii. 17.19. <hi>Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do? For I know him, that he will command his children, and his houſehold after him, that they ſhall keep the way of the</hi> LORD. <hi>Prov.</hi> xxii. 6. <hi>Train up a child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</hi> So that you ſee it is a work that the LORD of heaven and earth hath laid upon you; and how then dare you neglect it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. You will elſe be witneſſes againſt your own ſouls: your great care and pains, and coſt for their bodies, will condemn you for your neglect of their precious ſouls: you can ſpend yourſelves in toiling and caring for their bodies, and even neglect your own ſouls, and venture them ſometimes upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable courſes, and all to provide for your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity: and have you not as much reaſon to provide for their ſouls? Do you not believe that your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt be everlaſtingly happy or miſerable? And ſhould not that be fore-thought in the firſt place?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, GOD hath made your children to be your charge; yea, and your ſervants too: every one will conſeſs they are the miniſter's charge, and what a dreadful thing is it for them to neglect them, when GOD hath told them, That if they tell not the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:022331_0242_0FB7F055CF710890"/>of their ſin and danger, their blood ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at that miniſter's hands! and is not your charge as great and as dreadful as theirs? Have not you a greater charge of your own families than any mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath? Yea, doubtleſs, and your duty it is to teach, and admoniſh, and reprove them, and watch over them, at your hands elſe will GOD require the blood of their ſouls. The greateſt charge it is, that ever you were intruſted with, and wo to you if you prove unfaithful, and betray your truſt, and ſuffer them to be ignorant for want of your teaching, or wicked for want of your admonition or correction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Look into the diſpoſitions and lives of your children, and ſee what a work there is for you to do. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is not one ſin that you muſt help them againſt, but thouſands; their name is legion, for they are many: it is not one weed that muſt be pulled up, but the field is overſpread with them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> and how hard is it to prevail againſt any one of them! They are hereditary diſeaſes, bred in their natures: they are as near them as the very heart; and how tenacious are all things of that which is natural! How hard to teach a hare not to be afraid, or a lion or tyger not to be fierce! Beſides, the things you muſt teach them, are quite above them; yea, and clean contrary to the intereſt and deſires of their fleſh: how hard is it to teach a man to be willing to be poor and deſpiſed for <hi>Chriſt;</hi> to deny themſelves, and diſpleaſe the fleſh; to forgive an enemy; to love thoſe that hate us; to watch againſt temptations; to avoid occaſions and appearances of evil; to believe in a crucified Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; to rejoice in tribulation; to make GOD their delight and love; and to have their hearts in heaven, while they live on earth! I think none of this is eaſy, they that think otherwiſe, let them try and judge; yet all this muſt be learned, or they are undone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. If you help them not to ſome trade, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:022331_0243_0FB7F0570BFC67B8"/>live in the world; but if they be deſtitute of theſe things they ſhall not live in heaven. If the mariner be not ſkilful, he may be drowned; and if the ſoldier be not ſkilful, he may be ſlain: but they that cannot do the things above-mentioned, will pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for-ever; <hi>For without holineſs no man ſhall ſee God.</hi> O that the LORD would make all you that are parents ſenſible what a work and charge doth lie upon you! You that neglect this important work, and talk to your families of nothing but the world, I tell you the blood of ſouls lies on you: make as light of it as you will, if you repent not and amend, the LORD will ſhortly call you to an account for the guilt of your children's everlaſting undoing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Think with yourſelves, what a world of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort you may have if you be faithful in this duty: if you ſhould not ſucceed, yet you have freed your own ſouls; and though it be ſad, yet you may have peace in your own conſciences: but if you do ſucceed, the comfort is inexpreſſible. For,
<list>
                     <item>1. Good children will be truly loving to their parents; when a little matter will make ungodly children caſt off their very natural affection.</item>
                     <item>2. Good children will be moſt obedient to you; they dare not diſobey you, becauſe of the command of GOD, except you ſhould command them that which is unlawful, and then they muſt obey GOD rather than men.</item>
                     <item>3. And if you ſhould fall into want, they would be moſt faithful in relieving you, as knowing they are tied by a double bond of nature and of grace.</item>
                     <item>4. And they will alſo be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to your ſouls, they will be delighting you with holy conference and actions; when wicked children will be grieving you with curſing, and ſwearing, or drunkenneſs, or diſobedience.</item>
                     <item>5. But the greateſt joy will be when you ſhall ſay, <hi>Here am I, and the children thou haſt given me.</hi> And are not all theſe comforts enough to perſuade you to this duty?</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="245" facs="unknown:022331_0244_0FB7F05954B29D50"/>
6. Conſider further, that the very welfare of church and ſtate lieth mainly on this duty of well-educating children; and without this, all other means are like to be far leſs ſucceſsful. I ſeriouſly profeſs to you, that I verily think all the ſins and miſeries of the land may acknowledge this ſin for their nurſe. It is not good laws and orders that will reform us, if the men be not good, and reformation begin not at home; when children go wicked from the hands of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, in every profeſſion they bring this fruit of their education with them. I tell you ſeriouſly, this is the cauſe of all our miſeries in church and ſtate, even the want of a holy education of children. Many lay the blame on this neglect, and that; but there is none hath ſo great a hand in it as this.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I entreat you that are parents, to conſider what excellent advantages you have above all others for the ſaving of your children.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are under your hands while they are young, and tender, and flexible; but they come to miniſters when they are grown older, and ſlif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er, and ſettled in their ways, and think themſelves too good to be catechiſed. You have a twig to bend, and we an oak: you have the young plants of ſin to pluck up, and we the deep-rooted vices. The conſciences of children are not ſo ſeared with a cuſtom of ſinning, and long reſiſting grace, as others. You have the ſoft and tender earth to plough in, and we have the hard and ſtony ways, that have been trodden on by many years practice of evil. We have a double taſk, firſt to unteach them, and then to teach them better; but you have but one. We muſt unteach them all that the world, and the fleſh, and wicked company, and the devil have been diligently teaching them in many years. You have them before they are poſſeſſed with prejudice againſt the truth; but we have them
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:022331_0245_0FB7F05B8865A498"/>to teach, when they have many years lived among thoſe that have taught them to think GOD'S ways to be fooliſh. Doth not the experience of all the world ſhew you the power of education? What elſe makes all the children of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be <hi>Jews?</hi> And all the children of the <hi>Turks</hi> to be <hi>Mahometans?</hi> And of chriſtians to be in profeſſion chriſtians? And of each ſect or party in religion to follow their parents? Now what an advantage have you to uſe all this for the furtherance of their happineſs!</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider alſo, that you have the affections of your children more than any others: none in the world hath that intereſt in their hearts as you. You will receive that counſel from an undoubted friend, that you would not do from an enemy, or a ſtranger. Now, your children know you are their friends, and adviſe them in love; and they cannot but love you again. Nature hath almoſt neceſſitated them to love you. O therefore improve this your intereſt in them for their good!</p>
               <p n="3">3. You have alſo the greateſt authority over them. You may command them, and they dare not diſobey you, or elſe it is your own fault, for the moſt part; for you can make them obey you in your buſineſs; yea, you may correct them to enforce obedience. Your authority alſo is the moſt unqueſtionable autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the world. The authority of kings and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments have been diſputed, but yours is paſt diſpute. And therefore if you uſe it not to bring them to GOD, you are without excuſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Beſides, their dependance is on you for their maintenance. They know you can either give them, or deny them what you have, and ſo puniſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them at your leaſure. But on miniſters or neighbours they have no ſuch dependance.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="247" facs="unknown:022331_0246_0FB7F06072ECF108"/>
5. Moreover, you that are parents know the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and inclinations of your children, what vices they are moſt inclined to, and what inſtruction or reproof they moſt need: but miniſters cannot ſo well know this.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Above all, you are ever with them, and ſo have opportunity, as you know their faults, ſo to apply the remedy. You may be ſtill talking to them of the word of GOD, and minding them of their ſtate and duty, and may follow and ſet home every word of advice, as they are in the houſe with you, or in the ſhop, or in the field. O what an excellent advantage is this, if you have hearts to uſe it! Eſpecially you mothers, remember this; you are more with your children while they are little ones than their fathers: be you therefore ſtill teaching them as ſoon as ever they are capable of learning: you cannot do GOD ſuch eminent ſervice yourſelves as men; but you may train up children that may do it, and then you will have part of the comfort and honour. What a deal of pains are you at with the bodies of your children more than the fathers? And what do you ſuffer to bring them into the world; and will not you be at as much pains for the ſaving of their ſouls? You are naturally of more tender affections than men; and will it not move you to think that your children ſhould periſh for-ever? Therefore I beſeech you, for the ſake of the children of your bowels, teach them, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them, watch over them, and give them no reſt till you have brought them to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewed you reaſon enough to make you diligent in teaching your children.</p>
               <p>Let us next hear what is uſually objected againſt this by negligent men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="unknown:022331_0247_0FB7F0624C5A8D48"/>
Object. 1. We do not ſee but thoſe children prove as bad as others, that are taught the ſcriptures, and brought up ſo holily; and thoſe prove as honeſt men, that have none of this ado with them.</p>
               <p>Anſw. Who art thou, O man, that diſputeſt againſt GOD? Hath GOD charged <hi>you to teach your children diligently his word, ſpeaking of it as you ſit at home, and as you walk abroad, as you lie down, and as you riſe up;</hi> and dare you reply, that it is as good let it alone? Why, this is to ſet GOD at defiance; and as it were to ſpit in his face, and give him the lie. Will you take it well at your ſervants, if when you command them to do a thing, they ſhould return you an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that they do not ſee but it were as good let it alone? Wretched worm! dareſt thou thus lift up thy head againſt the Lord that made thee, and muſt judge thee? Is it not he that commandeth thee? If thou believe that this is the word of GOD, how dareſt thou ſay, It is as good diſobey it? This is deviliſh pride indeed, when ſuch ſottiſh, ſinful duſt ſhall think themſelves wiſer than the living GOD.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But what if ſome prove bad that are well brought up? It is not the generality of them. Will you ſay that <hi>Noah</hi>'s family was no better than the drowned world, becauſe there was one <hi>Ham</hi> in it? Nor <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s, becauſe there was one <hi>Abſalom?</hi> Nor <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, becauſe there was one <hi>Judas?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But what if it were ſo? Have men need of the leſs teaching, or the more? You have more wit in the matters of this world. You will not ſay, I ſee many labour hard, and yet are poor, and therefore it is as good never to labour at all: You will not ſay, many that go to ſchool learn nothing, and therefore they may learn as much though they never go; or many that are great tradeſmen break, and therefore
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:022331_0248_0FB7F063D2D90AF0"/>it is as good never to trade at all; or many plough and ſow, and have nothing come up, and therefore it is as good never to plough more. What a fool were he that ſhould reaſon thus! And is not he a thouſand times worſe, that ſhall reaſon thus for men's ſouls? <hi>Peter</hi> reaſons the clean contrary way, <hi>If the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the ungodly and ſinner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</hi> 1 Pet. iv. 18. And ſo doth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Luke xiii. 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate; for many ſhall ſeek to enter, and not be able.</hi> Other men's miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages ſhould quicken our diligence, and not make us caſt away all. What ſhould you think of that man that ſhould look over into his neighbour's garden, and becauſe he ſees here and there a nettle or weed among much better ſtuff, ſhould ſay, Why, you may ſee theſe men that beſtow ſo much pains in digging and weeding, have weeds in their garden as well as I that do nothing, and therefore who would be at ſo much pains? Juſt thus doth the mad world talk. You may ſee now that thoſe that pray, and read, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſermons, have their faults as well as we, and have wicked perſons among them as well as we: yea, but that is not the whole garden, as yours is; it is but here and there a weed, and as ſoon as they ſpy it, they pluck it up, and caſt it away.</p>
               <p>Object. 2. Some further object, it is the work of miniſters to teach both us and our children, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may be excuſed.</p>
               <p>Anſwer 1. It is firſt your duty, and then the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's. It will be no excuſe for you, becauſe it is their work, except you could prove it were only theirs. Magiſtrates muſt govern both you and your children: doth it therefore follow that you muſt not govern them? It belongs to the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It belongs to their office to govern the church, and to teach with authority; and great and ſmall are commanded to obey them, <hi>Heb.</hi> xiii. 7.17. But this is unknown, and hearers look on themſelves as free-men, that may obey or not, at their own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. People think we have authority to ſpeak to them when they pleaſe to hear, and no more. Nay, few of the godly themſelves underſtand the authority that their teachers have over them from <hi>Chriſt:</hi> they know how to value a miniſter's gifts, but not how they are bound to obey him becauſe of his office: not that they ſhould obey him in evil, nor that he ſhould be a final decider of all controverſies, nor ſhould exerciſe his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in things of no moment; but as a ſchoolmaſter may command his ſcholars when to come to ſchool, and what book to read, and what form to be of, and as they ought to obey him, and learn of him, and not to ſet their wits againſt his, but to take his word, and believe him as their teacher, till they underſtand as well as he, and are ready to leave his ſchool; juſt ſo are the people bound to obey and learn of their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Now this miniſterial authority is unknown, and ſo miniſters are the leſs capable of doing their work, which comes to paſs,

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> A far greater clog than this doth lie upon miniſters, which few take notice of; and that is, the fewneſs of miniſters, and the greatneſs of congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

Cannot you find time to ſpeak to them as they are at their work? Have you not time to inſtruct them on the Lord's day? You can find time to talk idly, as poor as you are; and can you find no time to talk of the way to life? You can find time on the Lord's day
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:022331_0251_0FB7F06E52A65A60"/>for your children to play, or walk or talk in the ſtreets, but no time to mind the life to come. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks you ſhould rather ſay to your children, I have no lands to leave you; you have no hope of great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters here; be ſure therefore to make the LORD your portion, that you may be happy hereafter; if you could get riches, they would ſhortly leave you, but the riches of grace and glory will be everlaſting. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks you ſhould ſay, <hi>As Peter, ſilver and gold I have none, but ſuch as I have, I give you.</hi> The kingdoms of the world cannot be had by beggars, but the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven may.</p>
               <p>O what a terrible reckoning will many poor men have, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall plead his cauſe, and judge them! May not he ſay, I made the way to worldly honours inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible to you, that you might not look after it for yourſelves, or your children: but heaven I ſet open, that you might have nothing to diſcourage you: I confined riches and honours to a few; but my blood and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I offered to all, that none might ſay, I was not invited: I tendered heaven to the poor, as well as the rich: I made no exception againſt the meaneſt beggar; why then did you not come yourſelves, and bring your children, and teach them the way to the eternal inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance? Do you ſay you were poor? Why, I did not ſet heaven to ſale for money; I called thoſe that had nothing, to take it freely; only on condition they would take me for their Saviour and LORD, and give up themſelves to me in obedience and love.</p>
               <p>What can you anſwer <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he ſhall thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you? Is it not enough that your children are poor and miſerable here, but you would have them be worſe for everlaſting? If your children were beggars, yet if they were ſuch beggars as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by angels into the preſence of GOD. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, as GOD will ſave no man becauſe he is a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:022331_0252_0FB7F06FD6425D40"/>ſo will he ſave no man becauſe he is a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. GOD hath ſo ordered it in his providence, that riches are common occaſions of men's damnation, and will you think poverty a ſufficient excuſe? The hardeſt point in all our work is to be weaned from the world, and in love with heaven; and if you will not be weaned from it, that have nothing in it but labour and ſorrow, you have no excuſe. The poor cannot have time, and the rich will not have time, or they are aſhamed to be ſo forward: the young think it too ſoon, and the old too late; and thus moſt men inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaved, have ſomewhat to ſay againſt their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſendeth to invite them, they ſay, <hi>I pray thee have me excuſed.</hi> O unworthy gueſts of ſuch a bleſſed feaſt, and worthy to be turned into everlaſting burnings!</p>
               <p>Object. 4. But ſome will object, we have been brought up in ignorance ourſelves, and therefore we are unable to teach our children.</p>
               <p>Anſw. Indeed this is the very ſore of the land: but is it not a pity that men ſhould ſo receive their deſtruction by tradition? Would you have this courſe to go on thus ſtill? Your parents did not teach you, and therefore you cannot teach your children, and therefore they cannot teach theirs: by this courſe the knowledge of GOD would be baniſhed out of the world, and never be recovered. But if your parents did not teach you, why did not you learn when you came to age? The truth is, you had no hearts for it; for be that hath not knowledge, cannot value it, or love it. But yet, though you have greatly ſinned, it is not too late, if you will but follow my faithful advice in theſe four points.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Get your hearts deeply ſenſible of your own ſin and miſery, becauſe of this long time which you

What a deal of time have you ſpent to little purpoſe? Your life is near done, and your work all undone. You are ready to die, before you have learned to live. Should not GOD have had a better ſhare of your lives, and your ſouls been more regarded and provided for? In the midſt of theſe thoughts, caſt down yourſelves in ſorrow, as at the feet of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> bewail your felly, and beg pardon and recovering grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then think as ſadly how you have wronged your children. If an unthrift that hath ſold all his lands, will lament it for his children's ſake, as well as his own, much more ſhould you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Next ſet preſently to work, and learn yourſelves. If you can read, do; if you cannot, get ſome that can; and be much among theſe that will inſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

GOD for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid you ſhould be ſo mad, as to ſay, I am now too old to learn; except you be too old to ſerve GOD, and be ſaved, how can you be too old to learn to be ſaved? Why not rather, I am too old to ſerve the devil and the world, I have tried them too long to truſt them any more. What if your parents had not taught you any trade to live by? Would not you have ſet yourſelves to learn, when you had come to age? Remember that you have ſouls to care for, as well as your children, and therefore firſt begin with yourſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. While you are learning yourſelves, teach your children what you do know; and what you cannot
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:022331_0254_0FB7F07753F1CA08"/>teach them yourſelves, put them to learn of others that can: perſuade them into the company of thoſe who will be glad to inſtruct them. Have you no neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that will be helpful to you herein? O do not keep yourſelves ſtrange to them, but go among them, and deſire their help, and be thankful to them, that they will entertain you in their company. GOD for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that you ſhould be like thoſe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Luke</hi> xi. 52. <hi>that would neither enter into the kingdom of God themſelves, nor ſuffer thoſe that would to enter.</hi> GOD forbid you ſhould be ſuch barbarous wretches, as to hinder your children from being godly, and to teach them to be wicked! If any thing that walks in fleſh may be called a devil, I think it is a parent that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth his children from ſalvation: nay, I will ſay more, I verily think that in this they are far worſe than the devil. GOD is a righteous judge, and will not make the devil himſelf worſe than he is: I pray you be patient while you conſider it, and then judge yourſelves. They are the parents of their children, and ſo is not the devil: do you think then that it is as great a fault in him to ſeek their deſtruction, as in them? Is it as great a fault for the wolf to kill the lambs, as for their own dams to do it? Is it ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid a fault for an enemy in war to kill a child, or for a bear or a mad dog to kill it, as for the mother to daſh its brains againſt a wall? You know it is not: do you think then that it is ſo hateful a thing in Satan to entice your children to fin and hell, and to diſcourage and diſſuade them from holineſs, as it is in you? You are bound to love them by nature, more than Satan is. O then, what people are thoſe that will teach their children, inſtead of holineſs, to curſe, and ſwear, and rail, and back-bite, to be proud and revengeful, to break the Lord's day, and to deſpiſe his ways, to ſpeak wantonly and filthily, to ſcorn at holineſs, and glory in ſin! O when GOD ſhall aſk theſe children, where learned you this language and practice? and they ſhall
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:022331_0255_0FB7F07992325340"/>ſay, I learned it of my father or mother: I would not be in the caſe of thoſe parents for all the world! Alas, is it a work that is worth the teaching, to undo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for-ever? Or can they not without teaching learn it too eaſily of themſelves? Do you need to teach a ſerpent to ſting, or a lion to be fierce? Do you need to ſow weeds in your garden? Will they not grow of themſelves? To build an houſe requires ſkill and teaching, but a little may ſerve to ſet a town on fire: to heal the wounded or the ſick, requireth ſkill; but to make a man ſick, or to kill him, requireth but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. You may ſooner teach your children to ſwear, than to pray; and to mock at godlineſs, than to be truly godly. If theſe parents were ſworn enemies to their children, and ſhould ſtudy ſeven years how to do them the greateſt miſchief, they could not poſſibly find out a ſurer way, than by drawing them to ſin, and withdrawing them from GOD.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore conclude with this earneſt requeſt to all chriſtian parents that read theſe lines, that they would have compaſſion on the ſouls of their poor chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and be faithful to the great truſt GOD hath put on them. O ſirs! If you cannot do what you would do for them, yet do what you can. Both church and ſtate, city and country, groan under the neglect of this weighty duty; your children know not GOD, nor his laws; but take his name in vain, and ſlight his worſhip: and you do neither inſtruct them, nor correct them, and therefore GOD doth correct both them and you. You are ſo tender of them, that GOD is the leſs tender both of them and you. Wonder not if GOD make you ſmart for your childrens ſins; for you are guilty of all they commit, by your neglect of doing your duty to reſorm them; even as he that maketh a man drunk, is guilty of all the ſin that he committeth in his drunkenneſs. Will you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve therefore to ſet upon this duty, and neglect it no longer? Remember <hi>Eli:</hi> your children are like

As ever you would not be charged before GOD for murderers of their ſouls; and as ever you would not have them cry out againſt you in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſire, ſee that you teach them how to eſcape it, and bring them up in holineſs, and the fear of GOD.</p>
               <p>You have heard that the GOD of heaven doth flatly command it; I charge every one of you therefore, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your allegiance to him, as you will very ſhortly anſwer the contrary at your peril, that you will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuſe or neglect this moſt neceſſary work. If you are not willing to do it, now you know it to be ſo plain and ſo great a duty, you are flat rebels, and no true ſubjects of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If you are willing to do it, but know not how, I will add a few words of direction to help you.</p>

Be yourſelves ſuch as you would have them be: practice is the moſt effectual teaching of children, who are addicted to imitation, eſpecially of their parents.

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Reproving our Expectations of Reſt on Earth.</head>
               <p>DOTH this reſt remain? How great then is our ſin and folly to ſeek and expect it here! Where ſhall we find the chriſtian that deſerves not this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof? Surely we may all cry guilty to this. We know not how to enjoy convenient houſes, goods, lands, and revenues, but we ſeek reſt in theſe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We ſeldom, I fear, have ſuch ſweet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting thoughts of GOD and glory, as we have of our earthly delights. How much reſt do we ſeek in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, walks, apparel, eaſe, recreation, ſleep, pleaſing meats and drinks, company, health and ſtrength, and long life? Nay, we can ſcarce enjoy the neceſſary means that GOD hath appointed for our ſpiritual good, but we are ſeeking reſt in them. Our books, our preachers, ſermons, friends, abilities for duty, do not our hearts quiet themſelves in them, even more than in GOD? Indeed, in words we diſclaim,
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:022331_0263_0FB7F09851282E70"/>and GOD hath uſually the pre-eminence in our tongues and profeſſions: but do we not deſire theſe more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently when we want them, than we do the LORD himſelf? Do we not cry out more ſenſibly, O my friend, my goods, my health! than, O my GOD! Do we not miſs miniſtry and means more paſſionately than we miſs our GOD? Do we not beſtir ourſelves more to obtain and enjoy theſe, than we do to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our communion with GOD? Do we not delight more in the poſſeſſion of theſe, than we do in the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of GOD himſelf? Nay, are not thoſe mercies and duties more pleaſant to us, wherein we ſtand at the greateſt diſtance from GOD? We can read, and ſtudy, and confer, preach and hear, day after day, without much wearineſs; becauſe in theſe we have to do with inſtruments and creatures: but in ſecret pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and converſing with GOD immediately, where no creature interpoſeth, how dull, how heartleſs and weary are we! And if we loſe creatures or means, doth it not trouble us more than our loſs of GOD? If we loſe but a friend, or health, all the town will hear of it: but we can miſs our GOD and ſcarce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan our miſery. Thus it is apparent, we make the creature our reſt. It is not enough, that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing helps in our way to heaven; but they muſt alſo be made our heaven itſelf. Reader, I would as willingly make thee ſenſible of this ſin, as of any ſin in the world; for the LORD'S greateſt quarrel with us is in this point. Therefore I moſt carneſtly beſeech thee to preſs upon thine own conſcience theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is groſs idolatry to make any creature or means our reſt: to ſettle the ſoul upon it, and ſay, now I am well, upon the bare enjoyment of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: what is this, but to make it our God? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, to be the ſoul's reſt is GOD'S own prerogative. And as it is palpable idolatry to place our reſt in
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:022331_0264_0FB7F09AAF97A3B8"/>riches and honours; ſo it is but a more refined idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to take up our reſt in excellent means, in the church's proſperity, and in its reformation. When we would have all that out of GOD, which is to be had only in GOD; what is this but to run away from him to the creature, and in our hearts to deny him? When we fetch more of our comfort from the thoughts of proſperity, and thoſe mercies which we have at a diſtance from GOD, than from the fore-thoughts of our everlaſting bleſſedneſs in him. Are we chriſtians in judgment, and pagans in affection? Do we give our ſenſes leave to be the chooſers of our happineſs, while reaſon and faith ſtand by? O how ill muſt our dear LORD needs take it, when we give him cauſe to complain, as ſometime he did of our fellow-idolaters, <hi>Jer.</hi> l. 6. that we have been loſt ſheep, and have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten our reſting-place! When we give him cauſe to ſay, my people can find reſt in any thing rather than in me! They can find delight in one another, but none in me; they can rejoice in my creatures and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, but not in me; yea, in their very labours and duty they ſeek for reſt, but not in me; they had rather be any where than be with me: are theſe their gods? Have theſe delivered and redeemed them? Will theſe be better to them than I have been, or than I would be? If yourſelves have but a wife, a huſband, a ſon, that had rather be any where than in your company, and is never ſo merry as when fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from you, would you not take it ill yourſelves? Why ſo muſt our GOD needs do. For what do we but lay theſe things in one end of the balance, and GOD in the other, and fooliſhly prefer them before him? As <hi>Elkanah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Hannah, Am not I better to thee than ten ſons?</hi> So when we are longing after crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we may hear GOD ſay, am not I better than all the creatures to thee?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="266" facs="unknown:022331_0265_0FB7F09C55497680"/>
2. Conſider how thou contradicteſt the end of GOD in giving theſe things. He gave them to help thee to him, and doſt thou take up with them in his ſtead? He gave them that they might be refreſhments in thy journey; and wouldſt thou now dwell in thy inn, and go no further? Thou doſt not only contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict GOD herein, but loſeſt that benefit which thou mighteſt receive by them, yea, and makeſt them thy great hurt and hinderance. Surely, it may be ſaid of all our comforts and all ordinances, and the bleſſedeſt enjoyments in the church on earth, as GOD ſaid to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> of his ark, <hi>Numb.</hi> x. 33. <hi>The ark of the covenant went before them, to ſearch out for them a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place.</hi> So do all GOD'S mercies here. They are not that reſt, (as <hi>John</hi> profeſſeth he was not the <hi>Chriſt</hi>) but they are voices crying in this wilderneſs, to bid us prepare; for the kingdom of GOD, our true reſt, is at hand. Therefore to reſt here, were to turn all mercies clean contrary to their own ends, and our own advantages, and to deſtroy ourſelves with that which ſhould help us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, whether it be not the moſt probable way, to cauſe GOD, either, firſt, to deny thoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which we deſire; or, ſecondly, to take from us theſe which we enjoy; or, thirdly, to imbitter them, or curſe them to us? Certainly, GOD is no where ſo jealous as here: if you had a ſervant whom your wife loved better than ſhe did yourſelf, would you not take it ill of ſuch a wife, and rid your houſe of ſuch a ſervant? Why ſo, if the LORD ſee you begin to ſettle in the world, and ſay, here I will reſt, no wonder if he ſoon in his jealouſy unſettle you. If he love you, no wonder if he take that from you wherewith he ſees you about to deſtroy yourſelves.</p>
               <p>It hath been long my obſervation of many, that when they have attempted great works, and have juſt
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:022331_0266_0FB7F0A08E059980"/>finiſhed them; or have aimed at great things in the world, and have juſt obtained them; or have lived in much trouble, and juſt come to begin with ſome content to look upon their condition, and reſt in it, they are near to death and ruin. When a man is once at this language, <hi>Soul, take thy eaſe;</hi> the next news uſually is, <hi>Thou fool, this night,</hi> or this month, or this year, <hi>ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee, and then whoſe ſhall theſe things be?</hi> O what houſe is there where this fool dwelleth not? Let you and I conſider, whether this be not our own caſe. Have not I after ſuch an unſettled life, and after ſo many longings and prayers for theſe days! Have not I thought of them with too much content, and been ready to ſay, <hi>Soul, take thy reſt?</hi> Have not I comforted myſelf more in the fore-thoughts of enjoying theſe, than of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to heaven, and enjoying GOD? What wonder then if GOD cut me off, when I am juſt ſitting down in this ſuppoſed reſt? And hath not the like been your condition? Many of you have been ſoldiers, driven from houſe and home, endured a life of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and blood, been deprived of miniſtry and means: did you not reckon up all the comforts you ſhould have at your return; and glad your hearts with ſuch thoughts, more than with the thoughts of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to heaven? Why, what wonder if GOD now croſs you, and turn ſome of your joy into ſadneſs? Many a ſervant of GOD hath been deſtroyed from the earth, by being over-valued and over-loved. I pray GOD you may take warning for the time to come, that you rob not yourſelves of all your mercies. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, our diſcontents and murmurings are not ſo provoking to GOD, nor ſo deſtructive to the ſinner, as our too ſweet enjoying, and reſt of ſpirit, in a pleaſing ſtate. If GOD hath croſſe any of you in wife, children, goods, friends, either by taking them from you, or the comfort of them: try whether this be not the cauſe; for whereſoever your deſires ſtop,
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:022331_0267_0FB7F0A213020B08"/>and you ſay, now I am well; that condition you make your god, and engage the jealouſy of GOD againſt it. Whether you be friends to GOD or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, you can never expect that GOD ſhould ſuffer you quietly to enjoy your idols.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider, if GOD ſhould ſuffer thee thus to take up thy reſt here, it were one of the greateſt curſes that could befal thee: it were better for thee if thou never hafſt a day of eaſe in the world; for then wearineſs might make thee ſeek after true reſt. But if he ſhould ſuffer thee to ſit down and reſt here, where were thy reſt when this deceives thee? A reſtleſs wretch thou wouldſt be through all eternity. To have their good things on the earth, is the lot of the moſt miſerable periſhing ſinners. Doth it become chriſtians then to expect ſo much here? Our reſt is our heaven; and where we take our reſt, there we make our heaven: and wouldſt thou have but ſuch a heaven as this? It will be but a handful of waters to a man that is drowning, which will help to deſtroy, but not to ſave him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider, thou ſeekeſt reſt where it is not to be found, and ſo wilt loſe all thy labour. I think I ſhall eaſily evince this by theſe clear demonſtrations following:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Our reſt is only in the full obtaining our ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end; but that is not to be expected in this life. Is GOD to be enjoyed in the beſt reformed church here, as he is in heaven? You confeſs he is not; how little of GOD, (not only) the multitude of the blind world, but ſometimes the ſaints themſelves enjoy! And how poor comforters are the beſt ordinances and enjoyments without GOD! Should a traveller take up his reſt in the way? No, becauſe his home is his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney's en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. When you have all that creatures and means
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:022331_0268_0FB7F0A722161EB8"/>can afford, have you that you ſought for? Have you that you believe, pray, ſuffer for? I think you dare not ſay ſo. Why then do we once dream of reſting here? We are like little children ſtrayed from home; and GOD is now fetching us home; and we are readly to turn into any houſe, ſtay and play with every thing in our way, and ſit down on every green bank, and much ado there is to get us home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As we have not yet obtained our end, ſo are we in the midſt of labours and dangers; and is there any reſting here? What painful work doth lie upon our hands! Look to our brethren, to our ſouls, to GOD; and what a deal of work in reſpect of each of theſe, doth lie before us! And can we reſt in our labours? Indeed we may eaſe ourſelves ſometimes in our troubles; but that is not the reſt we are now ſpeaking of; we may reſt on earth, as the ark is ſaid to reſt in the midſt of <hi>Jordan, J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They would have been loth to have taken up their dwelling there. Should <hi>Iſrael</hi> have ſettled his reſt in the wilderneſs, among ſerpents, and enemies, and wearineſs and famine? Should <hi>Noah</hi> have made the ark his home, and been loth to come forth when the waters were fallen? Should the mariner chooſe his dwelling on the ſea. and ſettle his reſt in the midſt of rocks, and ſands, and tempeſts? Though he may adventure through all theſe, for a commodity of worth: yet I think he takes it not for his reſt. Should a ſoldier reſt in the midſt of fight, when he is in the very thickeſt of his enemies? And are not chriſtians ſuch travellers, ſuch mariners, ſuch ſoldiers? Have you not fears within, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles without? Are we not in the thickeſt of continual dangers?

Enquire of worldly pleaſure and eaſe, can they give you any tidings of true reſt? Even ſuch as the ſiſh in ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bait; when the pleaſure is ſweeteſt, death is the neareſt. Such is the reſt that all worldly pleaſures afford. Go to learning, to the pureſt, plentifulleſt, powerfulleſt ordinances, or compaſs ſea and land to find out the moſt perfect church; and enquire whether there your ſoul may reſt?

O how well might all theſe anſwer us, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did <hi>Rachel, Am I inſtead of God?</hi> So may the higheſt perfections on earth ſay, are we inſtead of GOD? Go take a view of all eſtates of men in the world, and ſee whether any of them have found this reſt. Go to the huſbandman, behold his endleſs labours, his continual care and toil, and wearineſs, and you will eaſily ſee, that there is no reſt: go to the tradeſman, and you ſhall find the like: if I ſhould ſend you lower, you would judge your labour loſt: go to the painful miniſter, and there you will yet more eaſily be ſatisfied; for though his ſpending, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs labours are exceeding ſweet, yet it is not becauſe they are his reſt, but in reference to his people's, and his own eternal reſt: if you would aſcend to magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracy, and enquire at the throne, you would find there is no condition ſo reſtleſs. Doubtleſs neither court, nor country, towns or cities, ſhops or fields, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries, libraries, ſolitarineſs, ſociety, ſtudies, or pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, can afford any ſuch thing as this reſt. If you could enquire of the dead of all generations, or if you could aſk the living through all dominions, they would all tell you, here is no reſt; and all mankind may ſay, <hi>All our days are ſorrow, and our labour is grief, and our hearts take no reſt,</hi> Eccleſ. ii. 23.</p>
               <p>If other men's experience move you not, do but take a view of your own: can you remember the eſtate that did fully ſatisfy you? Or if you could, will it prove a laſting ſtate? For my own part, I have run through ſeveral ſtates of life, and though I never had the neceſſities which might occaſion diſcontent. yet did I never find a ſettlement for my ſoul; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we may all ſay of our reſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> of our hopes, <hi>If it were in this life only, we were of all men moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.</hi> If then either ſcripture, or reaſon, or the

How muſt GOD even drive us, and fire us out of every condition, leſt we ſhould ſit down and reſt there!

If the Lord, ſeeing our perverſeneſs, ſhall now proceed in the cure, and take the creature quite away, then how do we labour, and care, and cry, and pray, that GOD would reſtore it, that we may make it our reſt again! And while we are deprived of its enjoyment, and have not our former idol, yet rather than come to GOD, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ourſelves in our hopes of recovering our form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtate; and as long as there is the leaſt likelihood of obtaining it, we make thoſe very hopes our reſt: if the poor by labouring all their days, have but hopes of a fuller eſtate when they are old (though an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to one they die before they have obtained it) yet do they reſt themſelves on thoſe expectations. Or if GOD doth take away both preſent enjoyments, and all hopes of recovering them, how do we ſearch about from creature to creature, to find out ſomething to ſupply the room, and to ſettle upon inſtead thereof! Yea, if we can find no ſupply, but are ſure we ſhall live in poverty, in ſickneſs, in diſgrace, while we are on earth, yet will we rather ſettle in this miſery, and make a reſt of a wretched being, than we will leave all and come to GOD.</p>

A man would think, that a multitude of poor people, who beg their bread, or can ſcarce with their hardeſt labour have ſuſtenance for their lives, ſhould eaſily be driven from reſting here, and willingly look to heaven for reſt; and the ſick, who have not a day of eaſe, or any hope of recovery left them. But O the curſed averſeneſs of our ſouls from GOD! We will rather account our miſery our happineſs, yea that which we daily groan under as intolerable, than we will take up our happineſs in GOD. If any place in hell were tolerable, the ſoul would rather take up its reſt there, than come to GOD. Yea, when he is bringing us over to him, and hath convinced us of the worth of his ways and ſervice, the laſt deceit of all is here, we will rather ſettle upon thoſe ways that lead to him, and thoſe ordinances that ſpeak of him, and thoſe gifts which flow from him, than we will come clean over to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Marvel not that I ſpeak ſo much of reſting in theſe; beware leſt it prove thy own caſe: I ſuppoſe thou art ſo convinced of the vanity of riches and honour, and pleaſure, that thou canſt more eaſily diſclaim theſe: but for thy ſpiritual helps, thou lookeſt on theſe with leſs ſuſpicion, and thinkeſt thou canſt not delight in them too much, eſpecially ſeeing moſt of the world deſpiſe them, or delight in them too little. But doth not the increaſe of thoſe helps dull thy longings after heaven? I know the means of grace muſt be loved and valued; and he that delighteth in any worldly thing more than in them, is not a chriſtian: but when we are content with duty inſtead of GOD, and had rather be at a ſermon than in heaven; and a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a church here, than of that perfect church, and rejoice in ordinances but as they are part of our earthly proſperity: this is a ſad miſtake.</p>

So far rejoice in the creature as it comes from GOD, or leads to him, or brings thee ſome report of his love: ſo far let thy ſoul take comfort in ordinances as GOD doth accompany them, or gives himſelf unto thy ſoul by them: ſtill remembering, when thou haſt even what thou doſt moſt deſire, yet this is not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yet theſe are but the firſt fruits. It is not enough that GOD alloweth us all the comfort of travellers, and accordingly to rejoice in all his mercies, but we muſt ſet up our ſtaff as if we were at home. While we are preſent in the body, we are abſent from the LORD; and while we are abſent from him, we are abſent from our reſt. If GOD were as willing to be abſent from us, as we from him, and if he were as loth to be our reſt, as we are loth to reſt in him, we ſhould be left to an eternal reſtleſs ſeparation. In a word, as you are ſenſible of the ſinfulneſs of your earthly diſcontents, ſo be you alſo of your irregular contents, and pray GOD to pardon them much more. And above all the plagues and judgments of GOD on this ſide hell, ſee that you watch and pray againſt this [of ſettling any where ſhort of heaven, or repoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſouls on any thing below GOD.] Or elſe, when the bough which you tread on breaks, and the things which you reſt upon deceive you, you will perceive your labour all loſt, and your higheſt hopes will make you aſhamed. Try if you can perſuade Satan to leave tempting, and the world to ceaſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and ſeducing; if you can bring the glory of GOD from above, or remove the court from heaven to earth, and ſecure the continuance of this through eternity, then ſettle yourſelves below, and ſay, Soul, take thy reſt here; but till then admit not ſuch a thought.</p>

               <p>WE have now by the guidance of the word of the LORD, and by the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, ſhewed you the nature of the reſt of the ſaints; and acquainted you with ſome duties in relation thereto: We come now to the cloſe of all, to preſs you to the great duty which I chiefly intended when I begun this ſubject.</p>
               <p>Is there a reſt, and ſuch a reſt remaining for us? Why then are our thoughts no more upon it? Why are not our hearts continually there? Why dwell we not there in conſtant contemplation? Aſk your hearts in good earneſt, What is the cauſe of this neglect? Hath the eternal GOD provided us ſuch a glory, and promiſed to take us up to dwell with himſelf? And is not this worth the thinking on?

Will not GOD give us leave to approach this light? Or will he not ſuffer our ſouls to taſte and ſee it? Then what mean all his earneſt invitations? Why doth he ſo condemn our earthly-mindedneſs, and command us to ſet our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections above? If the fore-thoughts of glory were forbidden fruits, perhaps we ſhould be ſooner drawn unto them. Sure I am, where GOD hath forbidden us to place our thoughts and our delights, thither it is eaſy enough to draw them. If he ſay, love not the world, nor the things of the world, we doat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it nevertheleſs. How unweariedly can we think of vanity, and day after day employ our minds about it! And have we no thoughts of this our reſt? How
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:022331_0275_0FB7F0BA36CFE7F8"/>freely and how frequently can we think of our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, our friends, our labours, our fleſh, our ſtudies, our news; yea, our very miſeries, our wrongs, our ſufferings, and our fears! But where is the chriſtian whoſe heart is on this reſt? What is the matter? Why are we not taken up with the views of glory, and our ſouls more accuſtomed to theſe delightful medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Are we ſo full of joy that we need no more; or is there no matter in heaven for our joyous thoughts; or rather, are not our hearts carnal and blockiſh? Earth will tend to earth. Had we more ſpirit, it would be otherwiſe with us. As St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> caſt by <hi>Cicero</hi>'s writings, becauſe they contained not the name of <hi>Jeſus;</hi> ſo let us humble and caſt down theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual hearts, that have in them no more of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and glory. As we ſhould not own our duties any further than ſomewhat of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in them, ſo ſhould we no further own our hearts: and as we ſhould delight in the creatures no longer than they have reference to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and eternity, ſo no further ſhould we approve of our own hearts. Why did <hi>Chriſt</hi> pronounce his diſciples eyes and ears bleſſed, but as they were the doors to let in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his works and words into their heart? Bleſſed are the eyes that ſo ſee, and the ears that ſo hear, that the heart is thereby raiſed to this heavenly frame. Sirs, ſo much of your hearts as is empty of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and heaven, let it be filled with ſhame and ſorrow, and not with eaſe.</p>

<pb n="277" facs="unknown:022331_0276_0FB7F0BFF6E26658"/>thou art therefore that readeſt theſe lines, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thee, as thou tendereſt thine allegiance to the God of heaven, as ever thou hopeſt for a part in this glory, that thou preſently take thy heart to taſk; chide it for its wilful ſtrangeneſs to GOD; turn thy thought from the purſuit of vanity, bend thy ſould to ſtudy eternity; habituate thyſelf to ſuch contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and let not thoſe thoughts be ſeldom and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory, but ſettle upon them; dwell here, bathe thy ſoul in heaven's delights; drench thine affections in theſe rivers of pleaſure; and if thy backward ſoul begin to flag, and thy thoughts to fly abroad, call them back, hold them to their work, put them on, bear not with their lazineſs; and when thou haſt once tried this work, and followed on till thou haſt got acquainted with it, and kept a cloſe guard upon thy thoughts till they are accuſtomed to obey, thou wilt then find thyſelf in the ſuburbs of heaven, and as it were in a new world; thou wilt then find that there is ſweetneſs in the work and way of GOD, and that the life of chriſtianity is a life of joy: thou wilt meet with thoſe abundant conſolations which thou haſt prayed, and panted, and groaned after, and which ſo few chriſtians obtain, becauſe they know not the way to them, or elſe make not conſcience of walking in it.</p>
               <p>You ſee the work now before you: this, this is that I would fain perſuade you to practiſe: let me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak your conſciences in the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and command you by the authority I have received from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that you faithfully ſet upon this duty, and fix your eye more ſtedfaſtly on your reſt. Do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that I perſuade you ſo earneſtly: though indeed if we were truly reaſonable men, it would be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that men ſhould need ſo much perſuaſion to ſo ſweet and plain a duty: but I know the employment is high, the heart is earthly, and will ſtill draw back;
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:022331_0277_0FB7F0C165C459A8"/>the temptations and hinderances will be many and great, and therefore I fear all theſe perſuaſions are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enough: ſay not, We are unable to ſet our own hearts on heaven, this muſt be the work of GOD: therefore all your exhortation is in vain. I tell you, though GOD be the chief diſpoſer of your hearts, yet next under him you have the greateſt command of them yourſelves, and a great power in the ordering of your own thoughts, and determining your own wills: though without <hi>Chriſt</hi> you can do nothing, yet under him you may do much, and muſt do much, or elſe you will be undone through your neglect: do your own parts, and you have no cauſe to diſtruſt whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> will do his.</p>
               <p>I will here lay down ſome conſiderations, which if you will but deliberately weigh with an impartial judgment, I doubt not will prove effectual with your hearts, and make you reſolve upon this excellent duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, a heart ſet upon heaven, will be one of the moſt unqueſtionable evidences of a true work of ſaving grace upon thy ſoul. Would you have a ſign infallible, not from me, or from the mouth of any man, but from the mouth of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, which all the enemies of the uſe of marks can lay no exceptions againſt? Why here is ſuch a one, <hi>Maſt.</hi> vi. 21. <hi>Where your treaſure is, there will your heart be alſo.</hi> Know once aſſuredly where your heart is, and you may eaſily know that your treaſure is there. GOD is the ſaints treaſure and happineſs: heaven is the place where they fully enjoy him: a heart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet upon heaven, is no more but a heart ſet upon GOD, deſiring this full enjoyment: and ſurely a heart ſet upon GOD through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is the trueſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſaving grace. External actions are the eaſieſt diſcovered; but thoſe of the heart are the ſureſt evidences. When thy learning will be no good proof
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:022331_0278_0FB7F0C3DFDC1508"/>of thy grace; when thy knowledge, thy duties, and thy gifts will fail thee, when arguments from thy tongue and thy hand may be confuted; then will this argument from the bent of thy heart prove thee ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere. Take a poor chriſtian that can ſcarce ſpeak <hi>Engliſh</hi> about religion, that hath a weak underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a failing memory, a ſtammering tongue, yet his heart is ſet on GOD, he hath choſen him for his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his thoughts are on eternity, his deſires there, his dwelling there; he cries out, O that I were there! he takes that day for a time of impriſonment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath not taken one refreſhing view of eternity. I had rather die in this man's condition, than in the caſe of him that hath the moſt eminent gifts, and is moſt admired for parts and duty, whoſe heart is not taken up with GOD. The man that <hi>Chriſt</hi> will find out at the laſt day, and condemn for want of a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-garment, will he be that wants this frame of heart. The queſtion will not then he, how much you have known or talked? but, how much have you loved, and where was your heart? Why then, as you would have a ſure teſtimony of the love of GOD, and a ſure proof of your title to glory, labour to get your hearts above. GOD will acknowledge you love him, when he ſees your hearts are ſet upon him. Get but your hearts once truly in heaven, and without all queſtion yourſelves will follow. If ſin and ſatan keep not thence your affections, they will never be able to keep away your perſons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, a heavenly mind is a joyful mind: this is the neareſt and the trueſt way to comfort; and without this you muſt needs be uncomfortable. Can a man be at the fire, and not be warm? or in the ſunſhine, and not have light? Can your heart be in heaven, and not have comfort? What could make ſuch frozen uncomfortable chriſtians, but living ſo far as they do from heaven? And what makes others ſo
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:022331_0279_0FB7F0C61BC94BE8"/>warm in comforts, but their frequent acceſs ſo near to GOD? When the ſun in the ſpring draws near our part of the earth, how do all things congratulate its approach! The earth looks green and caſteth off her mourning habit; the trees ſhoot forth; the plants revive; the birds ſing; the face of all things ſmiles upon us, and all the creatures below rejoice. If we would but keep theſe hearts above, what a ſpring would be within us; and all our graces be freſh and green! How would the face of our ſouls be changed, and all that is within us rejoice! How ſhould we forget our winter-ſorrows, and withdraw our ſouls from our ſad retirements! How early ſhould we riſe (as theſe birds in the ſpring) to ſing the praiſe of our great Creator! O chriſtian! get above; believe it, that region is warmer than this below. Thoſe that have been there have found it ſo, and thoſe that have come thence have told us ſo; and I doubt not but thou haſt ſometimes tried it thyſelf. I dare appeal to thy own experience: when is it that you have largeſt comforts? Is it not after ſuch an exerciſe as this, when thou haſt got up thy heart, and converſed with GOD, and talked with the inhabitants of the higher world, and viewed the manſions of the ſaints and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and filled thy ſoul with the fore-thoughts of glory? If thou knoweſt by experience what this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is, I dare ſay thou knoweſt what ſpiritual joy is. If it be the countenance of GOD that fills us with joy, then they that moſt behold it, muſt be ful eſt of theſe joys. If you never tried this, nor lived this life of heavenly contemplation, I never wonder that you walk uncomfortably, and know not what the joy of the ſaints means: can you have comforts from GOD, and never think of him? Can heaven rejoice you when you do not remember it? Doth any thing in the world glad you, when you think not on it? Whom ſhould we blame then, that we are ſo void of conſolation, but our own negligent unſkilful hearts?
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:022331_0280_0FB7F0C78E487E80"/>GOD hath provided us a crown of glory, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſet it ſhortly on our heads, and we will not ſo much as think of it: he holdeth it out to us, and biddeth us behold and rejoice; and we will not ſo much as look at it. What a perverſe courſe is this, both againſt GOD and our own joys!</p>
               <p>I confeſs, though in fleſhly things the preſenting a comforting object is ſufficient to produce an anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble delight, yet in ſpirituals we are more diſabled: GOD muſt give the joy itſelf, as well as afford us matter for joy: but yet withal, it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that GOD doth work upon us as men, and in a rational way doth raiſe our comforts: he enableth and exciteth us to mind theſe delightful objects, and from thence to gather our own comforts; therefore he that is moſt ſkilful and painful in this gathering art, is uſually the fulleſt of the ſpiritual ſweetneſs. It is by believing that we are filled with joy and peace; and no longer than we continue our believing. It is in hope that the ſaints rejoice, yea, in this hope of the glory of GOD; and no longer than they continue hoping. And here let me warm you of a dangerous ſnare, an opinion which will rob you of all your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: ſome think, if they ſhould thus fetch in their own by believing and hoping, and work it out of ſcripture-promiſes by their own thinking and ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then it would be a comfort only of their own hammering out (as they ſay) and not the genuine joy of the Holy Ghoſt. A deſperate miſtake, raiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ground that would overthrow almoſt all duty, as well as this; which is their ſetting the workings of GOD'S ſpirit and their own ſpirits in oppoſition, when their ſpirits muſt ſtand in ſubordination to GOD'S: they are conjunct cauſes, co-operating to the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one and the ſame effect. GOD'S ſpirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our comforts by ſetting our own ſpirits at work upon the promiſes, and raiſing our thoughts to the
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:022331_0281_0FB7F0C910094D08"/>place of our comforts. As you would delight a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man by ſhewing him money, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

GOD uſeth not to caſt in our joys while we are idle, or taken up with other things. It is true, he ſometimes doth it ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, but uſually in the aforeſaid order: and his ſometimes ſudden, extraordinary caſting of comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts in our hearts, ſhould be ſo far from hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering endeavours in a meditating way, that it ſhould be a ſingular motive to quicken us to it; even as a taſte given us of ſome cordial, will make us deſire and ſeek the reſt. GOD feedeth not ſaints as birds do their young, bringing it to them, and putting it in their mouth, while they lie ſtill in the neſt, and only gape to receive it: but as he giveth to man the fruits of the earth, the increaſe of our land in corn and wine, while we plough and ſow, and weed, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and dung, and dreſs, and then with patience ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his bleſſing; ſo doth he give the joys of the ſoul. Yet I deny not, that if any ſhould think to work out his own comforts by meditation, as to attempt the work in his own ſtrength, the work would prove to be like the workman, and the comfort he would gather would be like both; even mere vanity; even as the huſbandman's labour without the ſun, and rain, and bleſſing of GOD.</p>
               <p>So then you may eaſily ſee, that cloſe meditation on the matter and cauſe of your joy, is GOD'S way to procure ſolid joy. For my part, if I ſhould find my joy of another kind, I ſhould be very prone to doubt of its ſincerity. If I find a great deal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and know not how it came, nor upon what ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ground it was raiſed, nor what conſiderations feed and continue it, I ſhould be ready to queſtion
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:022331_0282_0FB7F0CCD42B0278"/>whether this be from GOD. Our love to GOD ſhould not be like that of fond lovers, who love violently, but they know not why. I think a chriſtian's joy ſhould be rational joy, and not to rejoice and know not why. In ſome extraordinary caſe, GOD may caſt in ſuch an extraordinary kind of joy; yet it is not his uſual way. And if you obſerve the ſpirit of moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable chriſtians, you will find the reaſon to be their expectation of ſuch kind of joys; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are their ſpirits variouſly toſſed, and inconſtantly tempered: when they meet with ſuch joys, then theſe are cheerful and lifted up; but becauſe theſe are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhort-lived, therefore they are ſtraight as low as hell. And thus they are toſſed as a veſſel at ſea, up and down, but ſtill in extremes; whereas alas, GOD is moſt conſtant, <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſame, heaven the ſame, and the promiſe the ſame; and if we took the right courſe for fetching in our comfort from theſe, ſure our comforts would be more ſettled and conſtant, tho' not always the ſame. Whoever thou art therefore that readeſt theſe lines, I entreat thee in the name of the LORD, and as thou valueſt the life of conſtant joy, and that good conſcience which is a continual feaſt, that thou wouldſt ſeriouſly ſet upon this work, and learn the art of heavenly-mindedneſs, and thou ſhalt find the increaſe an hundred fold, and the benefit abundantly exceed thy labour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, a heart in heaven will be a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent preſervative againſt temptations, and a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means to ſave the conſcience from the wounds of ſin: GOD can prevent our ſinning, though we be careleſs, and ſometimes doth; but this is not his uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al courſe; nor is this our ſafeſt way to eſcape. When the mind is either idle, or ill employed, the devil needs not a greater advantage: if he find but the mind empty, there is room for any thing that he will bring in; but when he finds the heart in heaven, what
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:022331_0283_0FB7F0CE763D3930"/>hope that his motions ſhould take? Let him entice to any forbidden courſe, the ſoul will return <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>'s anſwer, <hi>I am doing a great work, and cannot come,</hi> Neh. vi. 3. Several ways will this preſerve us againſt temptation. <hi>Firſt,</hi> By keeping the heart em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By clearing the underſtanding, and confirming the will. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By pre-poſſeſſing the affections. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By keeping us in the way of GOD's bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By keeping the heart employed: when we are idle, we tempt the devil to tempt us; as it is an encouragement to a thief, to ſee your doors open, and nobody within; and as we uſe to ſay, <q>Careleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons make thieves;</q> ſo it will encourage Satan, to find your hearts idle: but when the heart is taken up with GOD, it cannot have time to hearken to tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: it cannot have time to be luſtful and wanton, ambitious or worldly.</p>
               <p>If you were but buſied in your lawful callings, you would not be ſo ready to hearken to temptations: much leſs if you were buſied above with GOD: will you leave your plough and harveſt in the field? Or leave the quenching of a fire in your houſes, to run hunting of butterflies? Would a judge riſe, when he is ſitting upon life and death, to go and play among the boys in the ſtreets? No more will a chriſtian, when he is buſy with GOD, give ear to the alluring charms of Satan. The love of GOD is never idle; it worketh great things where it truly is; and when it will not work, it is not love. Therefore being ſtill thus working, it is ſtill preſerving.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A heavenly mind is freeſt from ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is of cleareſt underſtanding in ſpiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. A man that is much in converſing above, hath truer and livelier apprehenſions of things concerning
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:022331_0284_0FB7F0CFC9890270"/>GOD and his ſoul, than any reading or learning can beget: though perhaps he may be ignorant in divers controverſies, and matters that leſs concern ſalvation; yet thoſe truths which muſt eſtabliſh his ſoul, and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſerve him from temptation, he knows far better than the greateſt ſcholars; he hath ſo deep an inſight into the evil of ſin, the vanity of the creature, the brutiſhneſs of ſenſual delights, that temptations have little power on him; for theſe earthly vanities are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's baits, which with the clear-ſighted have loſt their force. <hi>In vain</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) the net is ſpread in the ſight of any bird.</hi> And in vain doth Satan lay his ſnares to ontrap the ſoul that plainly ſees them. When the heavenly mind is above with GOD, he may from thence diſcern every danger that lies below: nay, if he did not diſcover the ſnare, yet were he likelier far to eſcape it than any others. A net or bait that is laid on the ground, is unlikely to catch the bird that flies in the air; while ſhe keeps above, ſhe is out of the danger, and the higher the ſafer; ſo it is with us. Satan's temptations are laid on the earth, earth is the place, and earth is the ordinary bait: how ſhall theſe enſnare the chriſtian, who hath left the earth and walks with GOD?</p>
               <p>Do you not ſenſibly perceive, that when your hearts are ſeriouſly fixed on heaven, you become wiſer than before? Are not your underſtandings more ſolid; and your thoughts more ſober? Have you not truer appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of things than you had? For my own part, if ever I be wiſe, it is when I have been much above, and ſeriouſly ſtudied the life to come: methinks I find my underſtanding after ſuch contemplations, as much to differ from what it was before, as I before differed from a fool or an idiot: when my underſtanding is weakened and befooled with common employment, and with converſing long with the vanities below, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks a few ſober thoughts of my Father's houſe, and
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:022331_0285_0FB7F0D16D78D2C8"/>the bleſſed proviſion of his family in heaven, doth make me (with the prodigal) to come to myſelf again. Surely, when a chriſtian withdraws himſelf from his earthly thoughts, and begins to converſe with GOD in heaven, he is as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> taken from the beaſts of the field to the throne, and his underſtanding returneth to him again. O when a chriſtian hath had but a glimpſe of eternity, and then looks down on the world again, how doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Do you not think (except men are ſtark devils) that it would be a harder matter to entice a man to ſin, when he lies a dying, than it was bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tion? If he ſhould then tell him of riches, or honours, or ſhew him cards, or dice, or a whore, would the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (think you) be as ſtrong as before? Would he not anſwer, Alas! what is all this to me, who muſt preſently appear before GOD, and give account of all my life, and ſtraightways be in another world? Why, if the apprehenſion of the nearneſs of etern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ty will work ſuch ſtrange effects upon the ungodly, and make them wiſer than to be deceived ſo eaſily, as they were wont to be in time of health; what effects would it work in thee, if thou couldſt always dwell in the views of GOD, and in lively thoughts of thine everlaſting ſtate? Surely, a believer, if he improve his faith, may have truer apprehenſions of the life to come, in the time of his health, than an unbeliever hath at the hour of his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="unknown:022331_0286_0FB7F0D5B8574378"/>
Thirdly, a heavenly mind is fortified againſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe the affections are pre-poſſeſſed with the delights of another world. When the ſoul is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with good, though the underſtanding never ſo clearly apprehend the truth, it is eaſy for Satan to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that ſoul. Mere ſpeculations (be they never ſo true) which ſink not into the affections, are poor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives againſt temptations. He that loves moſt, and not he that knows moſt, will eaſieſt reſiſt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſin. There is in a chriſtian a kind of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al taſte, whereby he knows theſe things, beſides his mere reaſoning power: the will doth as ſweetly reliſh goodneſs, as the underſtanding doth truth; and here lies much of a chriſtian's ſtrength. If you ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with a ſimple man, and labour to perſuade him that ſugar is not ſweet, or that wormwood is not bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; perhaps you might by ſophiſtry over-argue his mere reaſon, but yet you could not perſuade him againſt his ſenſe; whereas a man that hath loſt his taſte, is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier deceived for all his reaſon. So it is here. When thou haſt had a freſh delightful taſte of heaven, thou wilt not be ſo eaſily perſuaded from it: you cannot perſuade a very child to part with his apple, while the taſte of its ſweetneſs is yet in its mouth.</p>
               <p>O that you would be perſuaded to be much in feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the hidden manna, and to be frequently taſting the delights of heaven! It is true, it is a great way off from our ſenſe, but faith can reach as far as that. How would this raiſe thy reſolutions, and make thee laugh at the fooleries of the world, and ſcorn to be cheated with ſuch childiſh toys! What if the devil had ſet upon <hi>Paul</hi> when he was in the third heaven? Could he then have perſuaded his heart to the pleaſures, or profits, or honours of the world? Though the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> below may be enticed to idolatry, and from eating and drinking to riſe up to play; yet <hi>Moſes</hi> in the mount with GOD will not do ſo: and if they had
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:022331_0287_0FB7F0D688C5F0F0"/>been where he was, and had but ſeen what he there ſaw, perhaps they would not ſo eaſily have ſinned. O if we could keep our ſouls continually delighted with the ſweetneſs above, with what diſdain ſhould we ſpit out the baits of ſin!</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whilſt the heart is ſet on heaven, a man is under GOD's protection; and therefore if Satan then aſſault him, GOD is more engaged for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>Let me entreat thee then, if thou be a man that is haunted with temptation (as doubtleſs thou art, if thou be a man) if thou perceive thy danger, and wouldſt fain eſcape it; uſe much this powerful remedy, keep cloſe with GOD by a heavenly mind; and when the temptation comes, go ſtraight to heaven, and turn thy thoughts to higher things; thou ſhalt find this a ſurer help than any other. Follow your buſineſs above with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and keep your thoughts to their heavenly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and you ſooner will this way vanquiſh the temptation, than if you argued or talked it out with the tempter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider, the diligent keeping of your hearts on heaven, will preſerve the vigour of all your graces, and put life into your duties. It is the heavenly chriſtian, that is the lively chriſtian: it is our ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to heaven that makes us ſo dull: it is the end that quickens all the means; and the more frequently and clearly this end is beheld, the more vigorous will all our motions be. How doth it make men unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly labour, and fearleſsly venture, when they do but think of the gainful prize! How will the ſoldier hazard his life, and the mariner paſs through ſtorms and waves! How cheerfully do they compaſs ſea and land, when they think of an uncertain periſhing treaſure! O what life then would it put into a chriſtian's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:022331_0288_0FB7F0D98E1D8298"/>if he would frequently think of his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treaſure! We run ſo ſlowly, and ſtrive ſo lazily, becauſe we ſo little mind the prize. When a chriſtian hath been taſting the hidden manna, and drinking of the ſtreams of the paradiſe of GOD, what life doth this put into him! How ſervent will his ſpirit be in prayer, when he conſiders that he prays for no leſs than heaven!</p>
               <p>Obſerve but the man who is much in heaven, and you ſhall ſee he is not like others; there is ſomewhat of that which he hath ſeen above, appeareth in all his duty and converſation: nay, take but the ſame man immediately when he is returned from theſe views of bliſs, and you may eaſily perceive he excels himſelf. If he be a preacher, how heavenly are his ſermons! What clear deſcriptions, what high expreſſions hath he of that reſt! If he be a private chriſtian, what heavenly conference, what heavenly prayers, what an heavenly carriage hath he! May you not even hear in a preacher's ſermons, or in the private duties of another, when they have been moſt above? When <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had been with GOD in the mount, it made his face ſhine, that the people could not behold him. If you would but ſet upon this employment, even ſo it would be with you: men would ſee the face of your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſhine, and ſay, <hi>Surely he hath been with God!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, a heavenly nature goes before this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly employment; but yet the work will make it more heavenly: there muſt be life, before we can feed; but our life is continued and increaſed by feeding. Therefore, let me inform thee, if thou lie complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of deadneſs and dulneſs, that thou canſt not love <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor rejoice in his love; that thou haſt no life in prayer, nor any other duty, and yet never triedſt this quickening courſe, or at leaſt art careleſs and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in it; thou art the cauſe of thy own complaints;
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:022331_0289_0FB7F0E2E203CB50"/>thou dulleſt thine own heart; thou denieſt thyſelf that life which thou talkeſt of. Is not <hi>thy life hid with Chriſt in God?</hi> Whither muſt thou go but to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for it? And whither is that, but to heaven, where he is? <hi>Thou wilt not come to Chriſt that thou mayſt have life.</hi> If thou wouldſt have light and heat, why art thou then no more in the ſunſhine? If thou wouldſt have more of that grace which flows from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> why art thou no more with <hi>Chriſt</hi> for it? Thy ſtrength is in heaven, and thy life in heaven, and there thou muſt daily fetch it, if thou wilt have it. For want of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to heaven, thy ſoul is as a candle that is not lighted, and thy duties as a ſacrifice which hath no fire. Fetch one coal daily from this altar, and ſee if thy offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will not burn. Light thy candle at this flame, and feed it daily with oil from hence, and ſee if it will not gloriouſly ſhine: keep cloſe to this reviving fire, and ſee if thy affections will not be warm. Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waileſt thy want of love to GOD (and well thou mayſt, for it is a heinous crime, a killing ſin) why, lift up thy eye of faith to heaven, behold his beauty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template his excellencies, and ſee whether his amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs will not fire thy affections, and his goodneſs raviſh thy heart. As the eye doth incenſe the ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al affections, by gazing on alluring objects; ſo doth the eye of faith in meditation inflame our affections towards our LORD, by gazing on that higheſt beauty. Whoever thou art, that art a ſtranger to this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be thy parts and profeſſion ever ſo great, let me tell thee, thou ſpendeſt thy life but in triſling or idleneſs; thou ſeemeſt to live, but thou art dead: I may ſay of thee, as <hi>Seneca</hi> of idle <hi>Vacia. Sci latere, vivere neſcis;</hi> thou knoweſt how to lurk in idleneſs, but how to live thou knoweſt not. And as the ſame <hi>Seneca</hi> would ſay, when he paſſed by that ſluggard's dwelling, <hi>Ibi ſitus eſt Vacia;</hi> ſo it may be ſaid of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hy graces: they all come from GOD as their fountain, and lead to GOD as their end, and are exerciſed on GOD as their chief object: ſo that GOD is their all in all. From heaven they come, and to heaven they will direct and move thee. And as exerciſe maintaineth appetite, ſtrength and livelineſs to the body; ſo doth it alſo to the ſoul. <hi>Uſe limbs, and have limbs,</hi> is the known proverb. And uſe grace and ſpiritual life in theſe heavenly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, and you ſhall find it quickly cauſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. The exerciſe of your mere abilities of ſpeech will not much advantage your graces; but the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of theſe heavenly giſts, will inconceivably help the growth of both: for as the moon is then moſt full and glorious, when it doth moſt directly face the ſun; ſo will your ſouls be both in gifts and graces, when you moſt nearly view the face of GOD. This will feed your tongue with matter, and make you abound and everflow, both in preaching, praying, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. Beſides the ſire which you fetch from heaven for your ſacriſices, is no falſe or ſtrange fire. As your livelineſs will be much more; ſo it will be alſo more ſincere.</p>
               <p>The zeal which is kindled by your meditations on heaven, is moſt like to prove an heavenly zeal; and the livelineſs of the ſpirit which you ſetch from the face of GOD, muſt needs be the divineſt life. Some men's fervency is drawn only from their books, and ſome from ſtinging affliction, and ſome from the mouth of a moving miniſter, and ſome from the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an attentive auditory: but he that knows
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:022331_0291_0FB7F0ED0A4476B8"/>this way to heaven, and derives it daily from the pure fountain, ſhall have his ſoul revived with the water of life, and enjoy that quickening which is the ſaint's peculiar: by this faith thou mayſt offer <hi>Abel</hi>'s ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, more excellent than that of common men, and by it obtain witneſs that thou art righteous, GOD teſtifying of thy gifts, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 4. When others are ready, as <hi>Baal</hi>'s prieſts, to beat themſelves, and cut their fleſh, becauſe their ſacrifices will not burn: then if thou canſt get but the ſpirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> and in the chariot of contemplation ſoar aloft, till thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheſt near to the quickening ſpirit, thy ſoul and ſacrifice will gloriouſly flame, though the fleſh and the world ſhould caſt upon them the water of all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. Say not now, how ſhall we get ſo high? Or how can mortals aſcend to heaven? For faith hath wings, and meditation is its chariot; its office is to make abſent things as preſent. Do you not ſee how a little piece of glaſs, if it do but rightly face the ſun, will ſo contract its beams and heat, as to ſet on fire that which is behind it, which without it would have received but little warmth? Why thy faith is as the burning glaſs to thy ſacrifice, and meditation ſets it to face the ſun; only take it not away too ſoon, but hold it there a while, and thy ſoul will feel the happy effect.</p>
               <p>If we could get into the holy of holies, and bring thence the name and image of GOD, and get it cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in our hearts, this would enable us to work wonders; every duty we performed would be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and they that heard would be ready to ſay, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man ſpake as this man ſpeaketh. The Spirit would poſſeſs us, as thoſe flaming tongues, and make us eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſpeak (not in the variety of the confounded languages, but) in the primitive pure language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the wonderful works of GOD. We ſhould then be in every duty, whether prayer, exhortation,

A man will more quietly endure the lancing of his ſores, when he thinks on the eaſe that will follow. What then will not a believer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, when he thinks of the reſt to which it tendeth? What if the way be never ſo rough, can it be tedious if it lead to heaven? O ſweet ſickneſs, ſweet reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, impriſonments, or death, which is accompanied with theſe taſtes of our future reſt! Believe it, thou wilt ſuffer heavily, thou wilt die moſt ſadly, if thou haſt not at hand the foretaſtes of this reſt. Therefore as thou wilt then be ready with <hi>David</hi> to pray, <hi>Be not far from me, for trouble is near:</hi> ſo let it be thy chief care not to be far from GOD and heaven, when trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is near, and <hi>thou wilt find him a very preſent help in trouble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All ſufferings are nothing to us, ſo far as we have the foreſight of this ſalvation. No bolts, nor bars, nor diſtance of place can ſhut out theſe ſupporting joys, becauſe they cannot confine our faith and thoughts, although they may confine our fleſh. <hi>Chriſt</hi> and faith are ſpiritual, and therefore priſons and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments cannot hinder their intercourſe. Even when perſecution and fear hath ſhut the doors, <hi>Chriſt</hi> can come in, and ſtand in the midſt, and ſay, <hi>Peace be unto you.</hi> It is not the place that gives the reſt, but the preſence and beholding of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in it. If the Son of GOD will walk with us in it, we may walk ſafely
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:022331_0294_0FB7F0F30E98D100"/>in the midſt of thoſe flames, which ſhall devour thoſe that caſt us in: why then, keep thy ſoul above with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> be as little as may be out of his company, and then all conditions will be alike to thee. What made <hi>Moſes chooſe affliction with the people of God, rather than enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon? He had reſpect to the recompenſe of reward.</hi> Yea, our LORD himſelf did fetch his encouragements to ſufferings from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of his glory: <hi>for to this end he both died and roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living, Rom.</hi> xiv. 9. <hi>Even Jeſus, the author and finiſher of our faith, for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the throne of God.</hi>

Conſider, It is he that hath his converſation in heaven, who is the profitable chriſtian to all about him: with him you may take ſweet counſel, and go up to the celeſtial houſe of GOD. When a man is in a ſtrange country, far from home, how glad is he of the company of one of his own nation! How delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is it to them to talk of their country, of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and the affairs of their home! Why, with a heavenly chriſtian thou mayſt have ſuch diſcourſe; for he hath been there in the ſpirit, and can tell thee of the glory and reſt above. To diſcourſe with able men, of clear underſtandings, about the difficulties of religion, yea, about languages and ſciences, is both pleaſant and profitable; but nothing to this heavenly diſcourſe of a believer. O how refreſhing are his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions! How his words pierce the heart! How they transform the hearers! <hi>How doth his doctrine drop as the rain, and his ſpeech diſtil as the dew, as the ſmall rain upon the tender herb, and as the ſhowers upon the graſs; while his tongue is expreſſing the name of the Lord, and aſcribing greatneſs to his God!</hi> This is the man who is as <hi>Job, when the candle of God did ſhine upon his head, and when by his light he walked through darkneſs: when
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:022331_0295_0FB7F0F489B15E78"/>the ſecret of God was upon his tabernacle, and when the Almighty was yet with him: then the ear that heard him, did bleſs him; and the eye that ſaw him, give witneſs to him,</hi> Job xxix. 3, 4, 5, 11. Happy the people that have an heavenly miniſter: happy the children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that have an heavenly father or maſter; happy the man that hath heavenly aſſociates; if they have but hearts to know their happineſs. This is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, who will watch over thy ways, who will ſtrengthen thee when thou art weak; who will cheer thee when thou art drooping, and comfort thee with the ſame comforts, wherewith he hath been ſo often comforted himſelf. This is he that will be blowing the ſpark of thy ſpiritual life, and always drawing thy ſoul to GOD, and will be ſaying to thee, as the <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> woman, <hi>Come and ſee one that hath told me all that ever I did,</hi> one that hath raviſhed my heart with his beauty, one that hath loved our ſouls to the death: is not this the <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Is not the knowledge of GOD and him eternal life? Is it not the glory of the ſaints to ſee his glory? If thou travel with this man on the way, he will be directing and quickening thee in thy journey to heaven: if thou be buying or ſelling, or trading with him in the world, he will be counſelling thee to lay out for the ineſtimable treaſure: if thou wrong him, he can pardon thee, remembering that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not only pardoned great offences to him, but will alſo give him this invaluable portion. This is the chriſtian of the right ſtamp; this is the ſervant that is like his LORD; theſe be the innocent that ſave the iſland, and all about them are the better where they dwell. I fear the men I have deſcribed are very rare; but were it not for our ſhameful negligence, ſuch men might we all be!</p>

                  <hi>CHAP.III.</hi> Containing ſome Hinderances of Heavenly-mindedneſs.</head>
               <p>AS thou valueſt the comforts of a heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, I here charge thee from GOD, to beware moſt carefully of theſe impediments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is, the living in a known ſin. Obſerve this. What havoc will this make in thy ſoul! O the joys that this hath deſtroyed! The bleſſed communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with GOD, that this hath interrupted! The ruins it hath made amongſt men's graces! The duties that it hath hindered! And above all others, it is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to this great duty.</p>
               <p>I deſire thee in the fear of GOD, ſtay here a little, and ſearch thy heart. Art thou one that hath uſed violence with thy conſcience? Art thou a wilful ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecter of known duties, either public or private? Art thou a ſlave to thine appetite, in eating or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or to any other commanding ſenſe? Art thou a ſeeker of thine own eſteem, and a man that muſt needs have men's good opinion? Art thou a peeviſh or paſſionate perſon, ready to take fire at every word, or every ſuppoſed ſlight? Art thou a deceiver of others in thy dealing; or one that hath ſet thyſelf to riſe in the world? Not to ſpeak of greater ſins, which all take notice of. If this be thy caſe, I dare ſay, heaven and thy ſoul are very great ſtrangers; I dare ſay, thou art ſeldom with GOD, and there is little hope it ſhould be better, as long as thou continueſt in theſe tranſgreſſions: theſe beams in thine eyes will not ſuffer thee to look to heaven; theſe will be a cloud between thee and GOD. How ſhouldſt thou take
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:022331_0297_0FB7F1018898FD20"/>comfort from heaven, who taketh ſo much pleaſure in the luſts of the fleſh? Every wilful ſin will be to thy comforts as water to fire; when thou thinkeſt to quicken them, this will quench them; when thy heart begins to draw near to GOD, this will preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fill thee with doubting. Beſides it doth utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſe thee, and diſable thee to this work; when thou ſhouldſt wind up thy heart to heaven, it is biaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed another way; it is entangled, and can no more aſcend in divine meditation, than the bird can fly whoſe wings are clipt, or that is taken in the ſnare. Sin doth cut the very ſinews of the ſoul; therefore I ſay of this heavenly life, as Mr. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lton</hi> ſaith of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <q>Either it will make thee leave ſinning, or ſin will make thee leave it,</q> and that quickly too: for theſe cannot continue together. If heaven and hell can meet together, then mayſt thou live in thy ſin, and in the taſtes of glory. If therefore thou find thyſelf guilty, never doubt but this is the cauſe that eſtrangeth thee from heaven; and take heed leſt it keep out thee, as it keeps out thy heart. Yea, if thou be a man that hitherto haſt eſcaped, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt no reigning ſin in thy ſoul, yet let this warning move thee to prevention, and ſtir up a dread of this danger in thy ſpirit, eſpecially reſolve to keep from the occaſions of ſin, and, as much as poſſible, out of the way of temptations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond hinderance carefully to be avoided, is, an earthly mind: for you may eaſily conceive, that this cannot ſtand with an heavenly mind. GOD and mammon, earth and heaven. cannot both have the delight of thy heart. This makes thee like <hi>Anſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e found on earth, and beginneſt to taſte a ſweetneſs in gain, and to aſpire after an higher eſtate,
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:022331_0298_0FB7F1072021B158"/>and art driving on thy deſign; believe it, thou art marching with thy back upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and art poſting apace from this heavenly life. Hath not the world that from thee, which GOD hath from the believer? When he is bleſſing himſelf in GOD, and rejoicing in hope of the glory to come; then thou art bleſſing thyſelf in thy proſperity.</p>
               <p>It may be thou holdeſt on thy courſe of duty, and prayeſt as oft as thou didſt before; it may be thou keepeſt in with good miniſters, and with good men, and ſeemeſt as forward in religion as ever: but what is all this to the purpoſe? Mock not thy ſoul, man; for GOD will not be mocked. Thine earthly mind may conſiſt with thy common duties; but it cannot conſiſt with this heavenly duty. I need not tell thee this, if thou wouldſt not be a traitor to thy own ſoul: thou knoweſt thyſelf how ſeldom and cold, how curſory and ſtrange thy thoughts have been of the joys hereafter, ever ſince thou didſt trade ſo eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the world.</p>
               <p>Methinks I even perceive thy conſcience ſtir now, and tell thee plainly, that this is thy caſe: hear it, man! O hear it now; leſt thou hear it in another manner when thou wouldſt be full loth. O the curſed madneſs of many that ſeem to be religious! who thruſt themſelves into the multitude of employments, and think they can never have buſineſs enough, till they are ſo loaded with labours, and clogged with cares, that their ſouls are as unfit to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erſe with GOD, as a man to walk with a mountain on his back. And when all is done, and they have loſt that heaven they might have had upon earth, they take up a few rotten arguments to prove it lawful, and then they think that they have ſalved all. They miſs not the pleaſures of this heavenly life, if they can but quiet
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:022331_0299_0FB7EDB94B507818"/>their conſciences, while they faſten upon lower and baſer pleaſures:</p>
               <p>For thee, O chriſtian! who haſt taſted of theſe pleaſures, I adviſe thee, as thou valueſt their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ever thou wouldſt taſte of them any more, take heed of this gulph of an earthly mind: For if once thou comeſt to this, <hi>that thou wilt be rich, thou falleſt into temptation, and a ſnare, and into divers fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and hurtful luſts.</hi> Keep theſe things as thy upper garments ſtill looſe about thee, that thou mayſt lay them by whenever there is cauſe: but let GOD and glory be next thy heart, yea, as the very blood and ſpirit by which thou liveſt: ſtill remember that of the Spirit, <hi>The friendſhip of the world is enmity with God: whoſoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.</hi> And, <hi>love not the world, nor the things in the world: if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> This is plain dealing; and happy he that faithfully receives it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third hinderance which I muſt adviſe thee to beware, is, the company of ungodly and ſenſual men. Not that I would diſſuade thee from neceſſary converſe, or from doing them any office of love: nor would I have thee conclude them to be dogs and ſwine, that ſo thou mayeſt evade the duty of reproof; nor yet to judge them ſuch at all, before thou art certain they are ſuch indeed.</p>
               <p>But it is the unneceſſary ſociety of ungodly men, and familiarity with unprofitable companions, though they be not ſo apparently ungodly, that I diſſuade you from. It is not only the open profane, the ſwearer, the drunkard, that will prove hurtful to us; but dead-hearted formaliſts, or perſons merely civil and moral, or whoſe conference is empty, unſavoury, and barren, may much divert our thought from heaven.
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:022331_0300_0FB7EDBBE88F2208"/>As mere idleneſs, and forgetting GOD, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>tious, fleſhly life: ſo alſo will uſeleſs company a ſurely keep our hearts from heaven, as the company of men more diſſolute and profane. Alas! our dulneſs and backwardneſs is ſuch, that we have need of the moſt conſtant and powerful helps: a clod, or a ſtone that lies on the earth, is as prone to ariſe and fly in the air, as our hearts are to move towards heaven. You need not hold them from flying up to the ſkies; it is ſufficient that you do not help them. If our ſpirits have not great aſſiſtance, they may eaſily be kept from flying aloft, though they never ſhould meet with the leaſt impediment. O think of this in the choice of your company: when your ſpirits need no help to lift them up, but as the flames, you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways mounting upward, and carrying with you all that is in your way, then you may indeed be leſs careful of your company; but till then be careful therein. As it is reported of a lord that was near his death, and the doctor that prayed with him read over the litany, <hi>For all wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n labouring with child, for all ſick perſons, and young children,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>From lightning and tempeſt; from plague, peſtilence, and famine; from battle and murder, and from ſudden death.</hi> Alas! ſaith he, what is this to me, who muſt preſently die? So mayſt thou ſay of ſuch men's conference; alas! what is this to me, who muſt ſhortly be in reſt? What will it advantage thee to a life with GOD, to hear where the fair is ſuch a day, or how the market goes, or what weather it is, or is like to be, or when the moon changed, or what news is ſtirring? What will it conduce to the raiſing thy heart Godward, to hear that this is an able miniſter, or that an able chriſtian, or that this was an excellent ſermon, or that is an excellent book; to hear a diſcourſe of baptiſms, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, the order of GOD'S decrees, or other ſuch controverſies of great difficulty, and leſs importance?
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:022331_0301_0FB7EDC36A319AF0"/>Yet this, for the moſt part, is the ſweeteſt diſcourſe that you are likely to have of a formal dead-hearted profeſſor. If thou hadſt newly been warming thy heart with the joys above, would not this diſcourſe quickly freeze it again? I appeal to the judgment of any man that hath tried it, and maketh obſervations on the frame of his ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth hinderance to heavenly converſation, is, diſputes about leſſer truths, and eſpecially when a man's religion lies only in his opinions; a ſure ſign of an unſanctified ſoul. If ſad examples be regarded, I need ſay the leſs upon this. It is legibly written in the faces of thouſands; it is viſible in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of our deceaſed nation. They are men leaſt acquainted with a heavenly life, who are the violent diſputers about the circumſtantials of religion: he whoſe religion is all in his opinions, will be moſt frequently and zealouſly ſpeaking his opinions: and he whoſe religion lies in the knowledge and love of GOD in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of that time when he ſhall enjoy GOD and <hi>Chriſt.</hi> As the body doth languiſh in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fevers, when the native heat abates within, and an unnatural heat inflaming the external parts ſucceeds; ſo when the zeal of a chriſtian doth leave the internals of religion, and fly to externals, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior things, the ſoul muſt need conſume and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. Yea, though you were ſure your opinions were true, yet when the chief of your zeal is turned thither, and the chief of your conference there laid out, the life of grace decays within.</p>
               <p>Therefore let me adviſe you that aſpire after this joyous life, ſpend not your thoughts, your time, your zeal, or your ſpeeches upon quarrels that leſs concern your ſouls: but when others are feeding on huſks or ſhells, or on this heated food which will burn their lips, far ſooner than warm and ſtrengthen their hearts;
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:022331_0302_0FB7EDC70A65F8D8"/>then do you feed on the joys above. I could wiſh you were all underſtanding men, able to defend every truth of GOD; but ſtill I would have the chief to be chiefly ſtudied, and none to ſhoulder out your thoughts of eternity: the leaſt controverted points are uſually moſt weighty, and of moſt neceſſary uſe to our ſouls.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As you value the comforts or a heavenly life, take heed of a proud and lofty ſpirit. There is ſuch an antipathy between this ſin and GOD, that thou wilt never get thy heart near him, as long as this prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in it. If it caſt the angels from heaven that were in it, it muſt needs keep thy heart eſtranged from it. If it caſt our firſt parents out of paradiſe, and ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the LORD and us, it muſt needs keep our hearts from paradiſe, and increaſe the curſed ſeparation from our GOD. The delight of GOD is an humble ſoul, even him that is contrite, and trembleth at his word: and the delight of an humble ſoul is in GOD: and ſure where there is mutual delight, there will be freeſt admittance, and heartieſt welcome, and moſt frequent converſe. Well then, art thou a man of worth in thine own eyes? And very tender of thine eſteem with others? Art thou one that much valueſt applauſe and feeleſt delight when thou heareſt of thy great eſteem with men; and art dejected when thou heareſt that men ſlight thee? Doſt thou love thoſe moſt who beſt honour thee; and doth thy heart bear a grudge at thoſe that thou thinkeſt undervalue thee? Wilt thou not be brought to ſhame thyſelf, by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confeſſion when thou haſt ſinned againſt GOD, or injured thy brother? Art thou one that honoureſt the rich? and thinkeſt thyſelf ſomebody if they value and own thee? but lookeſt ſtrangely at the poor, and art almoſt aſhamed to be their companion? Art thou unacquainted with the deceitfulneſs and wickedneſs of thy heart? Or knoweſt thyſelf to be vile only by reading, not by feeling thy vileneſs? Art thou readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:022331_0303_0FB7EDC850A8F808"/>to defend thyſelf and maintain thine innocency, than to accuſe thyſelf, or confeſs thy fault? Canſt thou hardly hear a cloſe reproof, or plain-dealing without difficulty and diſtaſte? Art thou readier in thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to teach than to learn; and to dictate to others, than to hearken to their inſtructions? Art thou bold and confident of thy own opinions, and little ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of the weakneſs of thy underſtanding? but a ſlighter of the judgment of all that are againſt thee? Is thy ſpirit more diſpoſed to command than to obey? Art thou ready to cenſure the doctrine of thy teachers, the actions of thy rulers, and the perſons of thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? And to think, if thou wert a judge, thou wouldſt be more juſt; or if thou wert a miniſter, thou wouldſt be more fruitful and more faithful? If theſe ſymptoms be in thy heart, beyond doubt thou art a proud perſon. Thou art abominably proud; there is too much of hell abiding in thee, for thee to have any acquaintance at heaven: thy ſould is too like the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to have any familiarity with GOD.</p>
               <p>I entreat you be very jealous of your ſouls in this point: there is nothing will more eſtrange you from GOD: I ſpeak the more of it, becauſe it is the moſt common and dangerous ſin, and moſt promoting the great ſin of infidelity: you would little think what humble carriage, what exclaiming againſt pride, what ſelf-accuſing may ſtand with this deviliſh ſin of pride. O chriſtian, if thou wouldſt live continually in the preſence of thy LORD, and lie in the duſt, he would thence take thee up; deſcend firſt with him into the grave, and thence thou mayſt aſcend with him to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Learn of him to be meek and lowly, and then thou mayſt taſte of this reſt to thy ſoul. Thy ſoul elſe will be <hi>as the troubl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d ſea, which cannot reſt:</hi> and inſtead of theſe ſweet delights in GOD, thy pride will fill thee with perpetual diſquietneſs.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="305" facs="unknown:022331_0304_0FB7EDCBDF95F7D0"/>
6. Another impediment to this heavenly life is, lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſlothfulneſs of ſpirit: and I verily think for knowing men, there is nothing hinders more than this. If it were only the exerciſe of the body, the moving of the lips, the bending of the knee; then men would as commoly ſtep to heaven, as they go a few miles to viſit a friend; yea, if it were to ſpend our days in numbering beads, and repeating certain words and prayers, or in the outward parts of duties commanded by GOD, yet it were comparatively eaſy: further, if it were only in the exerciſe of parts and gifts, it were eaſier to be heavenly-minded. But it is a work more difficult than all this: to ſeparate our thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from the world; to draw forth all our graces in their order, and exerciſe each on its proper object, to hold them to this, till the work doth thrive and proſper in their hands; this is the difficult taſk. Heaven is above thee, the way is upwards; doſt thou think, who art a feeble ſinner, to travel daily this ſteep aſcent without a great deal of labour and reſolution? Canſt thou get that earthly heart to heaven, and bring that backward mind to GOD, while thou lieſt ſtill, and takeſt thine eaſe? If lying down at the foot of the hill, and looking toward the top, and wiſhing we were there, would ſerve the turn, then we ſhould have dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly travellers for heaven.

It is true, the work is ſweet, and no condition on earth ſo deſirable; but therefore it is that our hearts are ſo backward, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the beginning, till we are acquainted with it.

                  </gap>e, here, reader, as before the LORD, whether this be not thine own caſe. Thou haſt known that heaven is all thy hopes; thou knoweſt thou muſt ſhortly be turned hence, and that nothing below can yield thee reſt; thou knoweſt alſo that a ſtrange heart, a ſeldom and careleſs thinking of heaven, can fetch but little comfort thence: and doſt thou yet for all this let ſlip thy opportunities, when thou ſhouldſt walk above, and live with GOD? Doſt thou commend the ſweetneſs of an heavenly life, and yet didſt never once try it thyſelf? But as the ſluggard that ſtretched himſelf on his bed, and cried, O that this were working! So doſt thou live at thy caſe, and ſay, O that I could get my heart to heaven! How many read books, and hear ſermons, in expectation to hear of ſome eaſy courſe, or to meet with a ſhorter cut to comforts, than ever they are like to find? And if they can hear of none from the preachers of truth, they will ſnatch it with rejoicing from the teachers of falſehood; and preſently applaud the excellency of the doctrine, becauſe it hath fitted their lazy temper; and think there is no other doctrine will comfort the ſoul, becauſe it will not comfort it with hearing and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on. And while they pretend enmity only to the law, they oppoſe the eaſier conditions of the goſpel, and caſt off the burden which all muſt bear that find reſt to their ſouls: the LORD of light and ſpirit of comfort, ſhew theſe men in time, a ſurer way for laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comfort. It was an eſtabliſhed law among the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi,</hi> That if a man were perceived to be idle and lazy, he muſt give an account before the magiſt rate, how he came by his victuals and maintenance: and ſure, when I ſee theſe men lazy in the uſe of GOD'S appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed means for comfort, I cannot but queſtion how they come by their comforts: I would they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it throughly themſelves; for GOD will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an account of it from them. Idleneſs, and not
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:022331_0306_0FB7EDCE52B8BD68"/>improving the truth in painful duty, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe of men's ſeeking comfort from error: even as the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they had no comfortable anſwer from GOD, becauſe of their own ſin and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, would run to ſeek it from the idols of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: ſo when men are falſe-hearted, and the Spirit of truth denies them comfort, becauſe they deny him obedience, they will ſeek it from a lying ſpirit.</p>
               <p>My advice to ſuch a lazy ſinner, is this: as thou art convicted that this work is neceſſary to thy comfort, ſo reſolvedly ſet upon it: if thy heart draw back, and be undiſpoſed, force it on with the command of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and if thy reaſon begin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o diſpute the work, force it with producing the command of GOD; and quicken it with the conſideration of thy neceſſity, and the other motives before propounded: and let the inforcements that brought thee to the work, be ſtill in thy mind to quicken thee in it. Do not let ſuch an incomparable treaſure lie before thee, while thou lieſt ſtill with thy hand in thy boſom: let not thy life be a continual vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which might be a continual feaſt, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou wilt not be at the pains. When thou haſt once taſted the ſweetneſs of it, and a little uſed thy heart to the work, thou wilt find the pains thou takeſt abundantly recompenſed. Only ſit not ſtill with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate ſpirit, while comforts grow before thine eyes. Neither is it a few formal, lazy, running thoughts, that will fetch thee this conſolation from above: no more than a few lazy formal words will prevail with GOD inſtead of fervent prayer. I know <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the fountain, and I know this, as every other gift, is of GOD: but yet if thou aſk my advice, how to obtain theſe waters of conſolation; I muſt tell thee, there is ſomething alſo for thee to do: the goſpel hath its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and works, though not ſuch impoſſible ones, as the law; <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath his yoke and his burden, though eaſy, and thou muſt take it up, or thou wilt never
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:022331_0307_0FB7EDD4B9CA9228"/>find reſt to thy ſoul. I know ſo far as you are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, you need not all this ſtriving and violence, but that is but in part, and in part you are carnal; and as long as it is ſo, there is no talk of eaſe. It was the <hi>Parthians</hi> cuſtom, that none muſt give their children any meat in the morning, before they ſaw the ſweat on their faces; and you ſhall find this to be GOD'S moſt uſual courſe, not to give his children the taſte of his delights, till they begin to ſweat in ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them. Therefore lay them both together, and judge whether an heavenly life, or thy caſe be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and make the choice accordingly. Yet this let me ſay, thou needeſt not expend thy thoughts more than now thou doſt; it is but only to employ them better: I preſs thee not to buſy thy mind much more than thou doſt; but to buſy it upon better and more pleaſant objects. Employ but ſo many ſerious thoughts every day, upon the excellent glory of the life to come, as thou now employeſt on the affairs in the world: nay, as thou daily loſeſt on vanities, and thy heart will be at heaven in a ſhort ſpace.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is alſo a dangerous hinderance, to content ourſelves with the mere preparatives to this heavenly life, while we are ſtrangers to the life itſelf: when we take up with the mere ſtudies of heavenly things, and the notions and thoughts of them in our brain, or the talking of them with one another, as if this were all that makes us heavenly people. There is none in more danger of this ſnare, than thoſe that are much in public duty, eſpecially preachers of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. O how eaſily may they be deceived here, while they do nothing more than read of heaven, and ſtudy of heaven, and preach of heaven, and pray, and talk that GOD would reveal to our hearts the danger of this ſnare! Alas, all this is but mere preparation: this is not the life we ſpeak of, though it is a help
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:022331_0308_0FB7EDD80CEADAB0"/>thereto. I entreat every one of my brethren in the miniſtry, that they ſearch and watch againſt this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: this is but gathering the materials, and not the erecting the building: this is but gathering man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na for others, not eating and digeſting ourſelves; as he that ſits at home may ſtudy geography, and draw moſt exact deſcriptions of countries, and yet never ſee them, nor travel toward them: ſo may you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to others the joys of heaven, and yet never come near it in your own hearts: if you ſhould ſtudy of nothing but heaven while you lived, and preach of nothing but heaven to your people, yet might your own hearts be ſtrangers to it: we are under a more ſubtle temptation than other men, to draw us from this heavenly life: if our employments lay at a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſtance from heaven, we ſhould not he ſo apt to be thus deluded: but when we find ourſelves employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon nothing elſe, we are eaſier drawn to take up here. Studying and preaching of heaven is liker to an heavenly life, than thinking and talking of the world is, and the likeneſs it is that may deceive us: this is to die the moſt miſerable death, even to famiſh ourſelves, becauſe we have bread on our tables, and to die for thirſt while we draw water for others: thinking it enough that we have daily to do with it, though we never drink it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Some general Helps to Heavenly-mindedneſs.</head>
               <p>HAVING thus ſhewed thee what hinderances will reſiſt thee in the work. I ſhall now lay down ſome poſitive helps. But firſt, I expect that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve againſt the fore-mentioned impediments, that
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:022331_0309_0FB7EDE73354EE20"/>thou read them ſeriouſly, and avoid them faithfully, or elſe thy labour will be all in vain; thou doſt but go about to reconcile light and darkneſs, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial,</hi> heaven and hell in thy ſpirit; I muſt tell thee alſo, that I expect thy promiſe, faithfully to ſet upon the helps which I preſcribe thee; and that the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them will not bring heaven into thy heart, but in their conſtant practice the Spirit will do it.</p>
               <p>As thou valueſt then theſe fore-taſtes of heaven, make conſcience of performing theſe following duties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Know heaven to be the only treaſure, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to know what a treaſure it is; be convinced that thou haſt no other happineſs, and be convinced what happineſs is there: if thou doſt not ſoundly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be the chief good, thou wilt never ſet thy heart upon it; and this conviction muſt fink into thy affections: for if it be only a notion, it will have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle operation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Labour as to know heaven to be the only hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, ſo alſo to be thy happineſs. Though the knowledge of excellency and ſuitableneſs may ſtir up that love which worketh by deſire, yet there muſt be the knowledge of our intereſt or propriety, to the ſetting at work our love of complacency. We may confeſs heaven to be the beſt condition, though we deſpair of enjoying it; and we may deſire and ſeek it, if we ſee the obtainment to be but probable; but we can never delightfully rejoice in it, till we are perſuaded of our title to it. What comfort is it to a man that is naked, to ſee the rich attire of others? Or, to a man that hath not a bit to put in his mouth, to ſee a feaſt which he muſt not taſte of? What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light hath a man that hath not a houſe to put his head in, to ſee the ſumptuous buildings of others? Would not all this rather increaſe his anguiſh, and make him
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:022331_0310_0FB7EDEA201B3918"/>more ſenſible of his miſery? So, for a man to know the excellencies of heaven, and not to know whether he ſhall ever enjoy them, may well raiſe deſire to ſeek it, but it will raiſe but little joy and content.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another help to the fore-taſte of reſt is this: la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to apprehend how near it is; think ſeriouſly of its ſpeedy approach. That which we think is near at hand, we are more ſenſible of than that which we behold a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> a diſtance. When we hear of war or famine in another country, it troubleth us not ſo much; or if we hear it propheſied of a long time hence, ſo if we hear of plenty a great way off, or of a golden age that ſhall fall out, who knows when, this never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth us. But if judgments or mercies draw near, then they affect us. This makes men think on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo inſenſibly, becauſe they conceit it at a great diſtance: they look on it as twenty, or thirty, or forty years off; and this it is that dulls their ſenſe. As wicked men are fearleſs and ſenſeleſs of judgment, becauſe the ſentence is not ſpeedily executed; ſo are the good deceived of their comforts, by ſuppoſing them further off than they are. How much better were it to receive the ſentence of death in ourſelves, and to look on eternity as near at hand? Surely, reader, thou ſtandeſt at the door, and hundreds of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are ready waiting to open the door and let thee in. Are not the thirty or forty years of thy life that are paſt, quickly gone? Are they not a very little time when thou lookeſt back on them? And will not all the reſt be ſhortly ſo too? Do not days and nights come very thick? Doſt thou not feel that building of fleſh to ſhake, and perceive thy houſe of clay to tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Look on thy glaſs, ſee how it runs: look on thy watch, how faſt it getteth; what a ſhort moment is between us and our reſt; what a ſtep is it from hence to everlaſtingneſs! While I am thinking and writing of it, it haſteth near, and I am even entering into it
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:022331_0311_0FB7EDEBA7BB7A70"/>before I am aware. While thou art reading this, it poſteth on, and thy life will be gone as a tale that is told. Mayſt thou not eaſily foreſee thy dying time, and look upon thyſelf as ready to depart? It is but a few days till thy friends ſhall lay thee in the grave, and others do the like for them. If you verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved you ſhould die to-morrow, how ſeriouſly would you think of heaven to-night! The true apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the nearneſs of eternity, doth make men's thoughts of it quick and piercing; put life into their fears and ſorrows, if they be unfit: and into their deſires and joys, if they have aſſurance of its glory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another help to this is, to be much in ſerious diſcourſing of it, eſpecially with thoſe that can ſpeak from their hearts. It is pity (ſaith Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi>) that chriſtians ſhould ever meet together, without ſome talk of their meeting in heaven: it is pity ſo much precious time is ſpent in vain diſcourſes and uſeleſs diſputes, and not a ſober word of heaven. Methinks we ſhould meet together on purpoſe to warm our ſpirits with diſcourſing of our reſt. To hear a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter or private chriſtian ſet forth that glorious ſtate, with power and life from the promiſes of the goſpel, methinks ſhould make us ſay, as the two diſciples, <hi>Did not our hearts burn within us, while he was opening to us the ſcripture?</hi> While he was opening to us the windows of heaven? Get then together fellow-chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and talk of the affairs of your country and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and comfort one another with ſuch words. This may make our hearts revive within us, as it did <hi>Jacob</hi>'s to hear the meſſage that called him to <hi>Caſhen,</hi> and to ſee the chariots that ſhould bring him to <hi>Joſeph.</hi> O that we were furniſhed with ſkill and reſolution to turn the ſtream of men's common diſcourſe to theſe more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and precious things! And when men begin to talk of things unprofitable, that we could tell how to put in a word for heaven.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="313" facs="unknown:022331_0312_0FB7EDED180E3BD0"/>
5. Another help is this, make it thy buſineſs in every duty, to wind up thy affections nearer heaven. A man's attainments from GOD are anſwerable to his own deſires and ends: that which he ſincerely ſeeks he finds; GOD'S end in the inſtitution of his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces was, that they be as ſo many ſtepping-ſtones to our reſt, and as the ſtairs by which (in ſubordination to <hi>Chriſt</hi>) we may daily aſcend unto it in our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: let this be thy end in uſing them, as it was GOD'S end in ordaining them; and doubtleſs they will not be unſucceſsful. Men that are ſeparated by ſea and land, can yet by letters carry on great trades, even to the value of their whole eſtate: and may not a chriſtian in the wiſe improvement of duties, drive on this happy trade for reſt? Come not therefore with any lower ands to duties: renounce formality, cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomarineſs and applauſe. When thou kneeleſt down in ſecret or public prayer, let it be in hope to get thy heart neater GOD before thou riſeſt off thy knees: when thou openeſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> or other books, let it be with this hope, to meet with ſome paſſage of divine truth, and ſome ſuch bleſſing; of the Spirit with it, as may raiſe thine affections nearer heaven: when thou art ſetting thy foot out of thy door to go to the public worſhip, ſay, I hope to meet with ſomewhat from GOD that may raiſe my affections before I return; I hope the Spirit will give me the meeting, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en my heart with thoſe celeſtial delights; I hope that <hi>Chriſt</hi> will appear to me in the way, and ſhine about me with light from heaven, and let me hear his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing and reviving voice, and cauſe the ſcales to fall from mine eyes, that I may ſee more of that glory than I ever yet ſaw; I hope before I return to my houſe, my LORD will take my heart in hand, and bring it within the view of reſt, and ſet it before his Father's preſence, that I may return, as the ſhepherds from the heavenly viſion, glorifying and praiſing GOD. Remember alſo to pray for thy teacher, that
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:022331_0313_0FB7EDEF54F0F258"/>GOD would put ſome divine meſſage into his mouth, which may leave an heavenly reliſh on thy ſpirit.</p>
               <p>If theſe were our ends, and this our courſe when we ſet to duty, we ſhould not be ſo ſtrange as we are to heaven.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another help is this: make an advantage of every object thou ſeeſt, and of every paſſage of Divine Providence, and of every thing that befa's in thy labour and calling, to mind thy ſoul of its approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſt. As all providences an creatures are means to our reſt, ſo do they point us to that as their end. Every creature hath the name of GOD and of our final reſt written upon it, which a conſiderate believer may as truly diſcern, as he can read upon a hand in a croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the name of the town or city it points to. This ſpiritual uſe of creatures and providences is GOD'S great end in beſtowing them on man; and he that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks this end, muſt needs rob GOD of his chief praiſe, and deny him the greateſt part of his thanks. This relation that our preſent mercies have to our great eternal mercies, is the very quinteſſence and ſpirit of all theſe mercies; therefore do they loſe the very ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of all their mercies, and take nothing but the huſks, who overlook this relation, and draw not forth the ſweetneſs of it in their contemplations. GOD's ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt dealings with us would not be half ſo ſweet as they are, if they did not intimate ſome further ſweetneſs. As ourſelves have a fleſhly and ſpiritual uſe, and are fitted to the nouriſhing of both our parts. He that receives the carnal part and no more, may have his body comforted by them, but not his ſoul. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that chriſtians were ſkilled in this art! You can open your bibles, and read there of GOD and of glory: O learn to open the creatures, and the ſeveral paſſages of Providence, to read of GOD and glory there. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:022331_0314_0FB7EDF10DC183D0"/>by ſuch a ſkilful improvement we might have a fuller taſte of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and heaven, in every bit we eat, and in every draught we drink, than moſt men have in the uſe of the ſacrament.</p>
               <p>If thou proſper in the world, let it make thee more ſenſible of thy perpetual proſperity: if thou be weary of thy labours, let it make thy thoughts of reſt more ſweet: if things go croſs with thee, let it make thee more carneſtly deſire that day, when all thy ſufferings and ſorrows ſhall ceaſe. Is thy body refreſhed with food or ſleep? remember the inconceivable refreſhings with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Doſt thou hear any news that makes thee glad? remember what glad tidings it will be to hear the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Is GOD communicating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to thy ſpirit? remember that time when thy joy ſhall be full. Doſt thou hear or feel the tempeſt of wars, or ſee any cloud of blood ariſing? remember the day that thou ſhalt be houſed with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> where there is nothing but ealmneſs and amiable union, and where we ſhall ſolace ourſelves in perfect peace, under the wings of the prince of peace. Thus you may ſee what advantages to an heavenly life every condition and creature doth aſſord us, if we have but hearts to apprehend and improve them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Another ſingular help is this: be much in that angelical work of praiſe. As the moſt heavenly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits will have the moſt heavenly employment, ſo the more heavenly the employment, the more will it make the ſpirit heavenly: though the heart be the fountain of all our actions, yet do thoſe actions, by a kind of reflection, work much on the heart from whence they ſpring: the like alſo may be ſaid of our ſpeeches. So
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:022331_0315_0FB7EDF68B4200F8"/>that the work of praiſing GOD, being the moſt heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly work, is likely to raiſe us to the moſt heavenly temper. This is the work of thoſe ſaints and angels, and this will be our own everlaſting work: if we were more taken up in this employment now, we ſhould be liker to what we ſhall be then. When <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was aſked what he thought of muſic, he anſwers <hi>Jovem neque canere, neque citharam pulſare;</hi> that <hi>Jupiter</hi> did neither ſing, nor play on the harp; thinking it an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable art to men, which was no more delightful to GOD. But chriſtians may better argue from the like ground, that ſinging of praiſe is a moſt profitable duty, becauſe it is as it were ſo delightful to GOD himſelf, that he hath made it his people's eternal work; <hi>

The livelieſt emblem of heaven that I know upon earth is, when the people of GOD in the deep ſenſe of his excellency and bounty, from hearts abounding with love and joy, join together both in heart and voice, in the cheerful and melodious ſinging of his praiſes. Thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the uſe of ſinging, diſcloſe their unheavenly unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced hearts, as well as their ignorant underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Had they felt the heavenly delights that many of their brethren in ſuch duties have felt, they would have been of another mind! And whereas they are wont to queſtion, whether ſuch delights be genuine, or any better than carnal or deluſive? ſurely the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reliſh of GOD and heaven that is in them, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the ſaints in ſcriture, whoſe ſpirits have been raiſed by the ſame duty, and the command of ſcripture for the uſe of this means, one would think ſhould quickly deſtroy the controverſy. And a man
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:022331_0316_0FB7EDFD98048770"/>may as truly ſay of theſe delights, as of the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Spirit, that they witneſs themſelves to be of GOD.</p>
               <p>Little do we know how we wrong ourſelves, by ſhutting out of our prayers the praiſes of GOD, or allowing them ſo narrow a room as we uſually do.

                  </gap>ſed; both their own worth and their aggravating circumſtances, as often as thou ſtudieſt the ſins thou haſt committed. O let GOD'S praiſe be much in your mouths. Seven times a day did <hi>David</hi> praiſe him: yea, his praiſe was continually of him. As he that offereth praiſe, glorifieth GOD, ſo doth he moſt rejoice and glad his own ſoul. <hi>Offer therefore the ſacrifice of praiſe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: in the midſt of the church let us ſing his praiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſs, to a man of a languiſhing body, where the heart faints, and the ſpirits are feeble, the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful praiſing of GOD is more difficult; becauſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is the ſoul's inſtrument, and when it lies unſtring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or untuned, the muſic is likely to be according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Yet a ſpiritual cheerfulneſs there may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the heart may praiſe, if not the voice. But where the body is ſtrong, the ſpirits lively, and the heart cheerful, and the voice at command, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage have ſuch for this heavenly work? With what alacrity may they ſing forth praiſes? O the madneſs of healthful youth that lay out this vigour of body and mind upon vain delights, which is ſo ſit for the nobleſt work of men! And O the ſinful folly of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who drench their ſpirits in continual ſadneſs, and
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:022331_0317_0FB7EDFF0FD3E528"/>waſte their days in complaints and groans, and ſo make themſelves unfit for this ſweet and heavenly work! that when they ſhould join with the people of GOD in his praiſe, and delight their ſouls in ſinging to his name, they are ſtudying their miſeries, and ſo rob GOD of his praiſe, and themſelves of their ſolace. But the greateſt deſtroyer of our comfort in this duty is our ſticking in the tune and melody, and ſuffering the heart to be all the while idle, which ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the chief part of the work.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Another thing I will adviſe you to is this: be a careful obſerver of the drawings of the Spirit, and fearful of quenching its motions, of reſiſting its work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: if ever thy ſoul get above this earth, and get acquainted with this living in heaven, the Spirit of GOD muſt be to thee as the chariot to <hi>Elijah;</hi> yea, the very living principle by which thou muſt move and aſcend to heaven. O then grieve not thy guide, quench not thy life: if thou doſt, no wonder if thy ſoul be at a loſs; you little think how much the life of all your graces depends upon your ready and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial obedience to the Spirit: when the Spirit urgeth thee to ſecret prayer, and thou refuſeſt obedience; when he forbids thee a known tranſgreſſion, and yet thou wilt go on; when he telleth thee which is the way, and which not, and thou wilt not regard, no wonder if heaven and thy ſoul be ſtrange: if thou wilt not follow the Spirit while it would draw thee to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to duty; how ſhould it lead thee to heaven, and bring thy heart into the preſence of GOD? O what bold acceſs ſhall that ſoul find in its approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to the Almighty, that is accuſtomed to a conſtant obeying of the Spirit! And how backward, how dull, and ſtrange, and aſhamed will he be to theſe addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, who hath long uſed to break away from the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that would have guided him! I beſeech thee learn well this leſſon, and try this courſe; let not the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:022331_0318_0FB7EE009170F740"/>of thy body only, but the thoughts of thy heart be at the Spirit's beck. Doſt thou not feel ſometimes a ſtrong impulſion to retire from the world, and draw near to GOD? O do not thou diſobey, but take the offer, and hoiſt up ſail while thou mayſt have this bleſſed gale. When this wind blows ſtrongeſt, thou goeſt faſteſt, either backward or forward. The more of this Spirit we reſiſt, the deeper will it wound, and the more we obey, the ſpeedier is our pace; as he goes heavieſt that hath the wind in his face, and he eaſieſt that hath it in his back.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> A Deſcription of heavenly Contemplation.</head>
               <p>THE main thing intended is yet behind, and that which I aimed at when I ſet upon this work. All that I have ſaid is but the preparation to this. I once more entreat thee therefore, as thou art a man that makeſt conſcience of a revealed duty, and that dareſt not wilfully reſiſt the Spirit, as thou valueſt the high delights of a ſaint, and as thou art faithful to the peace and proſperity of thine own ſoul, that thou diligently ſtudy the directions following; and that thou ſpeedily and faithfully put them in practice: I pray thee therefore, reſolve before thou readeſt any further, and promiſe here as before the LORD, that if the following advice be wholeſome to thy ſoul, thou wilt ſeriouſly ſet thyſelf to the work, and that no lazineſs of ſpirit ſhall take thee off, nor leſſer bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs interrupt thy courſe, but that thou wilt approve thyſelf a doer of this word, and not an idle hearer only. Is this thy promiſe, and wilt thou ſtand to it? Reſolve, man, and then I ſhall be encouraged to give
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:022331_0319_0FB7EE020E7AB9E0"/>thee my advice; only try it throughly, and then judge: if in the faithful following of this courſe thou doſt not find an increaſe of all thy graces, and art not made more ſerviceable in thy place; if thy ſoul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy not more fellowſhip with GOD, and thy life be not fuller of pleaſure, and thou have not comfort rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier by thee at a dying hour, and when thou haſt greateſt need; then throw theſe directions back in my face, and exclaim againſt me as a deceiver for-ever: except GOD ſhould leave thee uncomfortable for a little ſeaſon, for the more glorious manifeſtation of his attributes, and thy integrity; and ſingle thee out as he did <hi>Job,</hi> for an example of conſtancy and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which would be but a preparative for thy ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler comfort. Certainly GOD will not forſake this his own ordinance, but will be found of thoſe that thus diligently ſeek him. GOD hath, as it were, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to meet thee in this way: do not thou fail to give him the meeting, and thou ſhalt find by experience that he will not fail.</p>
               <p>The duty which I preſs upon thee ſo earneſtly, I ſhall now deſcribe: it is the ſet and ſolemn acting of all the powers of the ſoul upon this moſt perfect ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (reſt) by meditation.</p>
               <p>I will a little more fully explain the meaning of this deſcription, that ſo the duty may lie plain before thee. 1. The general title that I give this duty is (meditation): not as it is preciſely diſtinguiſhed from cogitation, conſideration, and contemplation; but as it is taken in the larger and uſual ſenſe for cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on things ſpiritual, and ſo comprehending conſideration and contemplation.</p>
               <p>That meditation is a duty of GOD'S ordaining, not only in his written law, but alſo in nature itſelf, I never met with the man that would deny: but that
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:022331_0320_0FB7EE03B0AF4990"/>it is a duty conſtantly practiſed, I muſt, with ſorrow, deny: it is in word confeſſed to be a duty by all, but by the conſtant neglect denied by moſt: and (I know not by what fatal ſecurity it comes to paſs, that) men that are very tender conſcienced towards moſt other duties, yet as eaſily overſlip this, as if they knew it not to be a duty at all; they that are preſently trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled if they omit a ſermon, a faſt, a prayer in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic or private, yet were never troubled that they have omitted meditation, perhaps all their life-time to this very day: though it be that duty by which all other duties are improved, and by which the ſoul digeſteth truths, and draweth forth their ſtrength for its nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. Certainly, I think, that as a man is but half an hour taking into his ſtomach that meat which he muſt have ſeven or eight hours to digeſt; ſo a man may take into his underſtanding and memory more truth in one hour, than he is able well to digeſt in many. Therefore GOD commanded <hi>Juſhua, That the book of the law ſhould not depart out of his mouth, but that he ſhould meditate therein day and night: that he might obſerve to do according to that which is written therein.</hi> As digeſtion is the turning of the food into chyle and blood, and ſpirits and fleſh; ſo meditation rightly managed, turneth the truths received and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered into warm affection, raiſed reſolution, and holy converſation. Therefore what good thoſe men are likely to get by ſermons or providences, who are unaccuſtomed to meditation, you may eaſily judge. And why ſo much preaching is loſt among us, and men can run from ſermon to ſermon, and yet have ſuch languiſhing ſtarved ſouls, I know no truer cauſe than their neglect of meditation. If men heard one hour and meditated ſeven; if they did as conſtantly digeſt their ſermons as they hear them, they would find another kind of benefit by ſermons, than the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſort of chriſtians do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="322" facs="unknown:022331_0321_0FB7EE0D0B78DBF0"/>
But becauſe meditation is a general word, and it is not all meditation that I here intend, I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay down the difference whereby this I am urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is diſcerned from all other ſorts of meditation. And the difference is taken from the act, and from the object of it.</p>
               <p>From the act, which I call the ſet and ſolemn act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all the powers of the ſoul.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. I call it the acting of them, for it is action that we are directing you in now, and not diſpoſitions; yet theſe alſo are neceſſarity preſuppoſed: it muſt be a ſoul that is qualified for the work, by the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural grace of the Spirit, which muſt be able to perform this heavenly exerciſe. It is a work of the living, and not of the dead: it is a work or all other the moſt ſpiritual, and therefore not to be well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a heart that is merely carnal.</item>
                  <item>2. I call this meditation the acting of the powers of the ſoul, meaning the ſoul as rational. It is the work of the ſoul; for bodily exerciſe doth here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit but little. The ſoul hath its labour and its eaſe, its buſineſs and its idleneſs, as well as the body; and diligent ſtudents are uſually as ſenſible of the labour and wearineſs of their ſpirits, as they are of that of the members of the body. This action of the ſoul is it I perſuade thee to.</item>
                  <item>3. I call it the acting of ALL the powers of the ſoul, to difference it from the common meditation of ſtudents, which is uſually the mere employment of the brain. It is not a bare thinking that I mean, nor the mere uſe of invention or memory, but a buſineſs of a higher and more excellent nature.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="unknown:022331_0322_0FB7EE130D241320"/>
The underſtanding is not the whole ſoul, and therefore cannot do the whole work: as GOD hath made ſeveral parts in man, to perform their ſeveral offices for his nouriſhment and life; ſo hath he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the faculties of the ſoul to perform their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral offices for his ſpiritual life: ſo the underſtanding muſt take in truths, and prepare them for the will, and it muſt received them, and commend them to the affections: the beſt digeſtion is in the bottom of the ſtomach; the affections are as it were the bottom of the ſoul, and therefore the beſt digeſtion is there: while truth is but a ſpeculation ſwimming in the brain, the ſoul hath not taken faſt hold of it; <hi>Chriſt</hi> and heaven have various excellencies, and therefore GOD hath formed the ſoul with a power of divers ways of apprehending, that ſo we might be capable of enjoying thoſe excellencies.</p>
               <p>What good could all the glory of heaven have done us? or what pleaſure ſhould we have had in the goodneſs of GOD himſelf, if we had been without the affections of love and joy, whereby we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being delighted in that goodneſs? So alſo, what ſtrength or ſweetneſs canſt thou receive by thy meditations on eternity, while thou doſt not exerciſe thoſe affections which are the ſenſes of the ſoul, by which it muſt receive this ſtrength and ſweetneſs?</p>
               <p>This is it that hath deceived chriſtians in this buſineſs: they have thought meditation is nothing but the bare thinking on truths, and the rolling of them in the underſtanding and memory, when every ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy can do this.</p>
               <p>Therefore this is the great taſk in hand, and this is the work that I would ſet thee on; to get theſe truths from thy head to thy heart; that all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which thou haſt heard of heaven, and all the
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:022331_0323_0FB7EE17463222C8"/>notions thou haſt conceived of this reſt, may be turned into the blood and ſpirit of affection, and thou mayſt feel them revive thee, and warm thee at the heart, and mayſt ſo think of heaven, as heaven ſhould be thought on.</p>
               <p>If thou ſhouldſt ſtudy nothing but heaven while thou liveſt, and ſhouldſt have thy thoughts at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to turn them hither on every occaſion, and yet ſhouldſt proceed no further than this; this were not the meditation that I intended: as it is thy whole ſoul that muſt poſſeſs GOD hereafter, ſo muſt the whole in a lower manner, poſſeſs him here. I have ſhewn you in the beginning of this treatiſe, how the ſoul muſt enjoy the LORD in glory, to wit, by knowing, by loving, by joying in him: why, the very ſame way muſt thou begin thy enjoyment here.</p>
               <p>So much as thy underſtanding and affections are ſincerely acted upon GOD, ſo much doſt thou enjoy him: and this is the happy work of this meditation. So that you ſee here is ſomewhat more to be done, than barely to remember and think of heaven: as run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſuch like labours, do not only ſtir a hand or foot, but ſtrain and exerciſe the whole body; ſo doth meditation the whole ſoul.</p>
               <p>As the whole was filled with ſin before, ſo the whole muſt be filled with GOD now: as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of knowledge, and gifts, and faith to remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that if thou haſt all theſe without love, thou art but <hi>as a ſounding braſs, or as a tinkling cym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>l,</hi> ſo I may ſay of the exerciſe of theſe, if in this work of meditation, thou exerciſe knowledge, and gifts, and faith of miracles, and not love and joy, thou doſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; if thy meditation tends to fill thy note-book with notions and good ſayings concerning GOD, and not thy heart with longings after him, and delight in
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:022331_0324_0FB7EE1A2A1479E8"/>him, for aught I know thy book is as much a chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an as thou.</p>
               <p>I call this meditation ſet and ſolemn, to difference it from that which is occaſional. As there is prayer which is ſolemn, when we ſet ourſelves wholly to the duty; and prayer which is ſudden and ſhort, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called ejaculations, when a man in the midſt of other buſineſs, doth ſend up ſome brief requeſt to GOD: ſo alſo there is meditation ſolemn, when we apply ourſelves only to that work; and there is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation which is ſhort and curſory, when in the midſt of our buſineſs we have ſome good thoughts of GOD in our minds. And as ſolemn prayer is either firſt ſet, when a chriſtian obſerving it as a ſtanding duty, doth reſolvedly practiſe it in a conſtant courſe; or ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, occaſional, when ſome unuſual occaſion doth put us upon it at a ſeaſon extraordinary: ſo alſo medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Now, though I would perſuade you to that medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which is mixed with your common labours, and to that which ſpecial occaſions direct you to; yet theſe are not the main things which I here intend: but that you would make it a conſtant ſtanding duty, as you do hearing, and praying, and reading the ſcripture, and that you would ſolemnly ſet yourſelves about it, and make it for that time your whole work, and intermix other matters no more with it, than you would do with praying, or other duties. Thus you ſee, what kind of meditation it is that we ſpeak of, <hi>wiz.</hi> the ſet and ſolemn acting of all the powers of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the difference is drawn from its object, which is reſt, or the moſt bleſſed eſtate of man in his everlaſting enjoyment of GOD in heaven. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation hath a large field to walk in, and hath as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:022331_0325_0FB7EE1AD4A4B6B8"/>objects to work upon, as there are matters, and lines, and words in the ſcriptures, as there are known creatures in the whole creation, and as there are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſcernable paſſages of Providence in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of perſons and actions through the world: but the meditation that I now direct you in, is only of the end of all theſe, and of theſe as they refer to that end: it is not a walk from mountains to valleys, from ſea to land, from kingdom to kingdom, from planet to planet; but it is a walk from mountains and valleys to the holy mount <hi>Sion;</hi> from ſea and land to the land of the living; from the kingdoms of this world, to the kingdom of ſaints; from earth to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; from time to eternity. It is a walking upon the ſun, and moon, and ſtars; it is a walk in the garden and paradiſe of GOD. It may ſeem far off; but ſpirits are quick: whether in the body, or out of the body, their motion is ſwift; they are not ſo heavy or dull as theſe earthly lumps, nor ſo ſlow of motion as theſe clods of fleſh. I would not have you caſt off your other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations; but ſurely as heaven hath the pre-eminence in perfection, ſo ſhould it have the pre-eminence alſo in our meditation: that which will make us moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py when we poſſeſs it, will make us moſt joyful when we meditate upon it; eſpecially when that meditation is a degree of poſſeſſion, if it be ſuch affecting medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as I here deſcribe.</p>
               <p>You need not here be troubled with fear, leſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying ſo much on theſe high matters ſhould make you mad. If I ſet you to meditate as much on ſin and wrath, and to ſtudy nothing but judgment and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, then you might fear ſuch an iſſue: but it is heaven, and not hell, that I would perſuade you to walk in; it is joy, and not ſorrow, that I perſuade you to exerciſe. I would urge you to look on no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed object, but only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Will it diſtract the miſerable to think of mercy? Or the captive or priſoner, to foreſee deliverance? Neither do I perſuade your thoughts to matters of great difficulty, or to ſtudy knotty controverſies of heaven, or to ſearch out things beyond your reach. If you ſhould thus ſet your wit upon the tenters, you might quickly be diſtracted indeed: but it is your affections more than your inventions that muſt be uſed in this heavenly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment we ſpeak of. They are truths which are commonly known, which your ſouls muſt draw forth and feed upon. The reſurrection of the body, and the life everlaſting, are articles of your creed, and not nicer controverſies. Methinks it ſhould be liker to make a man mad, to think of living in a world of wo, to think of abiding among the rage of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, than to think of living with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in bliſs: methinks, if we be not mad already, it ſhould ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſtract us, to hear the tempeſts and roaring waves, to ſee the billows, and rocks, and ſands, and gulphs, than to think of arriving ſafe at reſt. <hi>But wiſdom is juſtified of all her children.</hi> Knowledge hath no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my but the ignorant.

If GOD gave me ſo much money or wealth, and tell me not how much in ſcripture ſuch a poor man muſt have, nor how much my family, nor how much in clothes, and how much in expences: is it not lawful, yea, and neceſſary, that I make the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion myſelf, and allow to each the due portion? So if GOD doth beſtow on me a day or week of time, and give me ſuch and ſuch work to do in this time, and tell me not how much I ſhall allot to each work; certainly I muſt make the diviſion myſelf, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion it wiſely and carefully too. Though GOD hath not told you at what hour you ſhall riſe in the morning, or at what hours you ſhall eat and drink; yet your own reaſon, and experience will tell you, that ordinarily you ſhould obſerve a ſtated time. Neither let the fear of cuſtomarineſs and formality deter you from this. This argument hath brought the LORD'S ſupper from once a week to once a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or once a year; and it hath brought family du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with too many of late, from twice a day to once a week, or once a month.</p>
               <p>I adviſe thee therefore, if well thou mayſt, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this duty a ſtated time, and be as conſtant in it, as in hearing and praying: yet be cautious in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this. I know this will not prove ever, man's duty: ſome have not themſelves and their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="330" facs="unknown:022331_0329_0FB7EE2CE5FF2858"/>and therefore cannot ſet their hours; ſuch are, moſt ſervants, and many children of poor parents; and many are ſo poor, that the neceſſity of their families will deny them this freedom. I do not think it the duty of ſuch to leave their labours for this work juſt at certain ſet times, no nor for prayer. Of two du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we muſt chooſe the greater, though of two ſins we muſt chooſe neither. I think ſuch perſons were beſt to be watchful, to redeem time as much as they can, and take their vacant opportunities as they fall, and eſpecially to join meditation and prayer, as much as they can, with the labours of their callings. There is no ſuch enmity between labouring, and meditating or praying in the ſpirit, but that both may be done together; yet I ſay, as <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe, <hi>if thou canſt be free, uſe it rather.</hi> Thoſe that have more ſpare time, I ſtill adviſe, that they keep this duty to a ſtated time. And indeed it were no ill huſbandry, nor point of folly, if we did ſo by all other duties; if we conſidered the ordinary works of the day, and ſuited out a fit ſeaſon and proportion of time to every work, and fixed this in our memory and reſolution, or wrote it in a table, and kept it in our cloſets, and never broke it but upon unexpected and extraordinary cauſes: if every work of the day had thus its appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time, we ſhould be better ſkilled, both in redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, and performing duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I adviſe thee alſo, concerning thy time for this duty, that as it be ſtated, ſo it be frequent: juſt how oft it ſhould be, I cannot determine, becauſe men's conditions may vary it: but in general, that it be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, the ſcripture requireth, when it mentioneth meditating continually, and day and night. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of our condition, may much vary the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our duties. It may be one man's duty to hear or pray oftener than another, and ſo it may be in this of meditation: but for thoſe that can conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:022331_0330_0FB7EE304A1C6CB8"/>omit other buſineſs, I adviſe, that it be once a day at leaſt. Though ſcripture tells us not how oft in a day we ſhould eat or drink; yet prudence and experience will direct us twice or thrice a day.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that think they ſhould not tie themſelves to order and number of duties; but ſhould then only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate or pray, when they find the Spirit provoking them to it, go upon uncertain and unchriſtian grounds. I am ſure, the ſcripture provokes us to frequency, and our neceſſity ſecondeth the voice of ſcripture; and if through my own neglect, or reſiſting the Spirit, I do not find it ſo excite me, I dare not therefore diſobey the ſcripture, nor neglect the neceſſities of my own ſoul. I ſhould ſuſpect that ſpirit which would turn my ſoul from conſtancy in duty: if the Spirit in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bid me meditate or pray, I dare not forbear it, becauſe I find not the ſpirit within me to ſecond the command: if I find not incitation to duty before, yet I may find aſſiſtance while I wait in performance. I am afraid of laying my corruptions upon the Spirit, or blaming the want of the Spirit's aſſiſtance, when I ſhould blame the backwardneſs of my own heart; nor dare I make one corruption a plea for another; nor urge the inward rebellion of my nature, as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the outward diſobedience of my life; and for the healing of my nature's backwardneſs, I more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould do it in a way of duty, than in a way of diſobedience and neglect of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Men that fall on duty according to the frame of their ſpirit only, are like our ignorant vulgar, who think their appetite ſhould be the only rule of their eating; when a wiſe man judgeth by reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, leſt when his appetite is depraved, he ſhould either ſurfeit or famiſh. Our appetite is no ſure rule for our times of duty; but the word of GOD in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and our ſpiritual reaſon, experience, neceſſity, and convenience in particular, may truly direct us.</p>

Three reaſons eſpecially ſhould perſuade thee to frequency in this meditation on heaven.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Becauſe ſeldom converſing with him will breed a ſtrangeneſs betwixt thy ſoul and GOD: frequent ſociety breeds familiarity, and familiarity increaſeth love and delight, and maketh us bold and confident in our addreſſes. This is the main end of this duty, that thou mayſt have acquaintance and fellowſhip with GOD therein; therefore if thou come but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to it, thou wilt keep thyſelf a ſtranger ſtill, and ſo miſs of the end of the work.</item>
                  <item>2. Seldomneſs will make thee unſkilful in the work, and ſtrange to the duty, as well as to GOD. How clumſily do men ſet their hands to a work they are ſeldom employed in! whereas frequency will habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate thy heart to the work, and thou wilt better know the way in which thou daily walkeſt, yea, and it will be more eaſy and delightful alſo: the hill which made thee pant and blow at the firſt going up, thou mayſt run up eaſily when thou art once accuſtomed to it.</item>
                  <item>3. And laſtly, Thou wilt loſe that heat and life by long intermiſſions, which with much ado thou didſt obtain in duty. If thou eat but a meal in two or three days, thou wilt loſe thy ſtrength as faſt as thou getteſt it: if in holy meditation thou get near to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and warm thy heart with the fire of love, if thou then turn away, and come but ſeldom, thou wilt ſoon return to thy former coldneſs.</item>
               </list>
               <p>It is true, the intermixed uſe of other duties may do much to the keeping thy heart above, eſpecially ſecret prayer: but meditation is the life of moſt other duties; and the view of heaven is the life of meditation.</p>

3. Concerning the time of this duty, I adviſe thee, that thou chooſe the moſt ſeaſonable time. All things are beautiful in their ſeaſon. Unſeaſonableneſs may loſe thee the fruit of thy labour; it may raiſe diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and difficulties in the work; yea, it may turn a duty to ſin; when the ſeaſonableneſs of a duty doth make it eaſy, doth remove impediments, doth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden us to the undertaking, and ripen its fruit.</p>
               <p>The ſeaſons of this duty are either, <hi>Firſt,</hi> ordinary: or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> extraordinary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ordinary ſeaſon of your daily perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance cannot be particularly determined, otherwiſe GOD would have determined in his word. Men's conditions of employment, and freedom, and bodily temper, are ſo various, that the ſame may be a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable hour to one, which may be unſeaſonable to another. If thou be a ſervant, or an hard labourer, that thou haſt not thy time at command, thou muſt take that ſeaſon which thy buſineſs will beſt afford: either as thou ſitteſt in the ſhop at thy work, or as thou travelleſt on the way, or as thou lieſt waking in the night. Every man beſt knows his own time, even when he hath the leaſt to hinder him in the world: but for thoſe whoſe neceſſities tie them not ſo cloſe, but that they may chooſe what time of the day they will, my advice to ſuch is, that they care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerve the temper of their body and mind, and mark when they find their ſpirits moſt active and fit for contemplation, and pitch upon that as the ſtated time. Some men are freeſt for duties when they are faſting, and ſome are then unfitteſt of all. Every man is the meeteſt judge for himſelf. The time I have always found fitteſt for myſelf, is, the evening, from ſun-ſetting to the twilight; and ſometime in the night when it is warm and clear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="unknown:022331_0333_0FB7EE3D915E2EA8"/>
The LORD'S day is a time exceeding ſeaſonable for this exerciſe. When ſhould we more ſeaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template on reſt, than on that day which doth typify it to us? Neither do I think that typifying uſe is ceaſed, becauſe the antitype is not fully come. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it being a day appropriated to worſhip and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual duties, we ſhould never exclude this duty, which is ſo eminently ſpiritual. I think verily this is the chief work of a chriſtian ſabbath, and moſt agreeable to the intent of its poſitive inſtitution. What fitter time to converſe with our LORD, than on that day which he hath appropriated to ſuch employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore called it the LORD'S day? What fitter day to aſcend to heaven, than that on which our LORD did ariſe from earth, and fully triumph over death and hell, and take poſſeſſion of heaven before us?</p>
               <p>Two ſorts of chriſtians I would entreat to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this eſpecially.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Thoſe that ſpend the LORD'S day only in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip; either through the neglect of medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or elſe by their over-much exerciſe of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, allowing no time to private duty: though there be few that offend in this kind; yet ſome there are, and a hurtful miſtake to the ſoul it is. They will grow but in gifts, if they exerciſe but their gifts in outward performances.</item>
                  <item>2. Thoſe that have time on the LORD'S day for idleneſs and vain diſcourſe, and find the day longer than they know how well to ſpend: were theſe but acquainted with this duty of contemplation, they would need no other recreation; they would think the longeſt day ſhort enough, and be ſorry that the night had ſhortened their pleaſure.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="unknown:022331_0334_0FB7EE41948FEE68"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the extraordinary performance, theſe following are ſeaſonable times.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When GOD doth extraordinarily revive thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. When GOD hath enkindled thy ſpirit with fire from above, it is that it may mount aloft more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It is a choice part of a chriſtian's ſkill, to obſerve the temper of his own ſpirit, and to obſerve the gales of grace, and how the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth move up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his. <hi>Without Chriſt we can do nothing:</hi> therefore let us be doing when he is doing; and be ſure not to be out of the way, nor aſleep when he comes. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle labour will ſet thy heart a going at ſuch a time, when another time thou mayſt take pains to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When thou art caſt into troubles of mind, through ſufferings, or fear, or care, or temptations, then it is ſeaſonable to addreſs thyſelf to this duty. When ſhould we take our cordials, but in our times of faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? When is it more ſeaſonable to walk to heaven, than when we know not in what corner on earth to live with comfort? Or when ſhould our thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe above, but when they have nothing but grief to converſe with below?</p>
               <p>Another fit ſeaſon for this heavenly duty, is, when the meſſengers of GOD ſummon us to die; when either our grey hairs, or our languiſhing bodies, or ſome ſuch fore-runners of death, tell us that our change can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be far off; when ſhould we more frequently ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our ſouls with the believing thoughts of another life, than when we find that this is almoſt ended and when fleſh is raiſing fears and terrors? Surely no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n have greater need of ſupporting joys than dying men; and thoſe joys muſt be fetched from our eternal joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="unknown:022331_0335_0FB7EE47CB42B890"/>
It now follows that I ſpeak a word of the fitteſt place. Though GOD is every where to be found, yet ſome places are more convenient than others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As this is a private and ſpiritual duty, ſo it is moſt convenient that thou retire to ſome private place; our ſpirits had need of every help, and to be freed from every hinderance in the work. For occaſional meditation I give thee not this advice; but for ſet and ſolemn duty, I adviſe, that thou withdraw thyſelf from all ſociety, that thou mayſt awhile enjoy the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as I adviſe thee to a place of retiredneſs; ſo alſo that thou obſerve more particularly, what place or poſture beſt agreeth with thy ſpirit; whether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in door, or without; whether ſitting ſtill, or walking. I believe <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s example in this alſo, will direct us to the place and poſture which will beſt ſuit with moſt, as it doth with me, <hi>viz. His walking forth to meditate in the field at the even-tide.</hi> And <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own example gives us the like direction. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was uſed to a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary garden; and though he took his diſciples thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, yet did he ſeparate himſelf from them for more ſecret devotions.</p>
               <p>I am next to adviſe thee ſomewhat concerning the preparations of thy heart. The ſucceſs of the work doth much depend on the frame of thy heart. When man's heart had nothing in it that might grieve the Spirit, then was it the delightful habitation of his Maker. GOD did not quit his reſidence there, till man did repel him by unworthy provocations. There grew no ſtrangeneſs, till the heart grew ſinful, and too loathſome a dungeon for GOD to delight in. And were this ſoul reſtored to its former innocency, GOD would quickly return to his former habitation: yea, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> far as it is renewed and repaired by the Spirit, the
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:022331_0336_0FB7EE4AF21A2C00"/>LORD will yet acknowledge it his own, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> will manifeſt himſelf unto it, and the Spirit will take it for its temple and reſidence. So far as the ſoul is qualified for converſing with GOD, ſo far it doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually enjoy him. Therefore <hi>keep thy heart with all diligence, for from thence are the iſſues of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More particularly, when thou ſetteſt on this duty, 1. Get thy heart as clear from the world as thou canſt; wholly lay by the thoughts of thy buſineſs, of thy troubles, of thy enjoyments, and of every thing that may take up any room in thy ſoul. Get thy ſoul as empty as poſſibly thou canſt, that ſo it may be the more capable of being filled with GOD. It is a work that will require all the powers of thy ſoul, if they were a thouſand times more capacious and active than they are, and therefore you have need to lay by all other thoughts and affections while you are buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be ſure thou ſet upon this work with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſeriouſneſs that poſſibly thou canſt. Cuſtomarineſs here is a killing ſin. There is no trifling in holy things; GOD will be ſanctified of all that draw near him. Theſe ſpiritual duties are the moſt dangerous, if we miſcarry in them, of all. The more they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the ſoul, being well uſed, the more they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, being uſed unfaithfully; as the beſt meats corrupted are the worſt.</p>
               <p>To help thee therefore to be ſerious when thou ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt on this work; <hi>Firſt,</hi> labour to have the deepeſt apprehenſions of the preſence of GOD, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible greatneſs of the majeſty which thou appreacheſt. Think with what reverence thou ſhouldſt approach thy Maker: think thou art addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thyſelf to him, <hi>that made the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="338" facs="unknown:022331_0337_0FB7EE4C4EF5C9C8"/>word of his mouth; that upholds the earth as in the palm of his hand; that keeps the ſun, and moon, and heaven in their courſes; that bounds the raging ſea with the ſands, and ſaith, Hitherto go, and no further:</hi> thou art going to converſe with him, before whom the earth will quake, and devils tremble; before whoſe bar thou muſt ſhortly ſtand, and all the world with thee, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their doom. O think, I ſhall then have lively apprehenſions of his majeſty: my drowſy ſpirits will then be wakened: why ſhould I not now be rouſed with the ſenſe of his greatneſs, and the dread of his name poſſeſs my ſoul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Labour to apprehend the greatneſs of the work which thou attempteſt, and to be deeply ſenſible both of its weight and height. If thou wert pleading for thy life at the bar of a judge, thou wouldſt be ſerious; and yet that were but a trifle to this: if thou were engaged in ſuch a work as <hi>David</hi> was againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> whereon the kingdom's deliverance depended, in itſeif conſidered, it were nothing to this. Suppoſe thou wert going to ſuch a wreſtling as <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s; ſuppoſe thou wert going to ſee the ſight which the three diſciples ſaw in the mount; how ſeriouſly, how reverently wouldſt thou both approach and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! If ſome angel from heaven ſhould but appoint to meet thee, at the time and place of thy contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, how apprehenſively wouldſt thou go to meet him! Why, conſider then with what a ſpirit thou ſhouldſt meet the LORD, and with what ſeriouſneſs and dread thou ſhouldſt daily converſe with him.</p>
               <p>Conſider alſo the bleſſed iſſue of the work. If it ſucceed, it will be an admiſſion of thee into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of GOD, a beginning of thy eternal glory on earth; a means to make thee live above the rate of other men, and admit thee into the next room to the
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:022331_0338_0FB7EE4DE0ACD288"/>angels themfelves; a means to make thee live and die both joyfully and bleſſedly: ſo that the prize being ſo great, thy preparation ſhould be anſwerable.</p>

2. When you have fetched from your memory the matter of your meditation, your next work is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to your judgment: open there the caſe as fully as thou canſt, ſet forth the ſeveral ornaments of the crown, the ſeveral dignities belonging to the kingdom, as they are partly laid open in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this book: let judgment deliberately view them over, and take as exact a ſurvey as it can; then put the queſtion, and require a determination. Is there happineſs in all this, or not? Is not here enough to make me bleſſed? Can he want any thing, who fully poſſeſſeth GOD? Is there any thing higher for a creature to attain?

               <p>Therefore let this be a chief part of thy buſineſs in meditation. Read over the promiſes: ſtady all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming providences. Call forth thine own experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: remember the ſcriptures already fulfilled both to the church and ſaints in the former ages, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to both in this preſent age, and thoſe that have been fulfilled particularly to thee.</p>
               <p>Set before your faith, the freeneſs and the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of the promiſe: conſider GOD'S offer, and urge it upon all, that he hath accepted from the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal covenant no man in the worl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy alſo the gracious diſpoſition of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to welcome all that will come: ſtudy all the evidences of his love, which appeared in his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in his preaching the goſpel, in his condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſinners, in his eaſy conditions, in his exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing patience, and in his urgent invitations: do not all theſe diſcover his readineſs to ſave? Did he ever manifeſt himſelf unwilling? Remember alſo his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to perform his engagements. Study alſo the evidences of his love in thyſelf; look over the works of his grace in thy ſoul: if thou doſt not find the
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:022331_0341_0FB7EE5CECEDF7E8"/>degree which thou deſireſt, yet deny not that degree which thou findeſt. Remember what diſcoveries of thy ſtate thou haſt made formerly in the work of ſelf-examination. Remember all the former teſtimonies of the Spirit; and all the ſweet feelings of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of GOD: and all the prayers that he hath heard and granted; and all the preſervations and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances; and all the progreſs of his Spirit, in his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on thy ſoul, and the diſpoſals of Providence, conducing to thy good; and vouchſafing of means, the directing thee to them, the directing of miniſters to meet with thy ſtate, the reſtraint of thoſe ſins that thy nature was moſt prone to. Lay theſe all together, and then think with thyſelf, whether all theſe do not teſtify the good will of the LORD concerning thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? And whether thou mayſt not conclude with <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s mother, when her huſband thought they ſhould ſurely die, <hi>If the Lord were pleaſed to kill us, be would not have received an offering at our hands, neither would he have ſhewed us all theſe things; nor would, as at this time, have told us ſuch things as theſe,</hi> Judges xiii. 22, 23.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>Thus do thou expatiate in the praiſes of GOD, and open his excellencies to thine own heart, till thou feel the life begin to ſtir, and the fire in thy breaſt begin to kindle: as gazing upon the duſty beauty of fleſh doth kindle the fire of carnal love; ſo this gazing on the glory and goodneſs of the LORD will kindle ſpiritual love. What though thy heart be rock and flint, this often ſtriking may bring forth the fire; but if yet thou feeleſt not thy love to work, lead thy heart further, and ſhew it yet more; ſhew it the Son of the living GOD, whoſe name is <hi>Wonderful, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace:</hi> ſhew it the King of ſaints on the throne of his glory, <hi>who is, and was, and is to come; who liveth and was dead, and behold, he lives for evermore, who hath made thy peace by the blood of his croſs, and hath prepared thee, with himſelf, an habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peace;</hi> his office is to be the <hi>great peace-maker;</hi> his kingdom is a kingdom of peace; his goſpel is the tidings of peace; his voice to thee now is the voice of peace: draw near and behold him: doſt thou not hear his voice?

Why, it is he

Why, his hands were pierced, his head was pierced, his ſides were pierced, his heart was pierced with the ſting of thy ſins, that by theſe marks thou mayſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways know him: doſt thou not remember when he found thee lying in thy blood, and took pity on thee, and dreſſed thy wounds, and brought thee home, and ſaid unto thee, <hi>live?</hi> Haſt thou forgotten ſince be wounded himſelf to cure thy wounds, and let out his own blood to ſtop thy bleeding?

If thou know him not by the face, the voice, the hands; if thou know him not by the tears and bloody ſweat, yet look nearer, thou mayſt know him by the heart; that broken-healed heart is his, that dead-revived heart is his, that pitying, melting heart is his; doubtleſs it can be none but his. Love and compaſſion are its certain ſignatures; this is he, even this is he, who would rather die than thou ſhouldſt die, who choſe thy life before his own, who pleads his blood before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and makes continual interceſſion for thee. If he had not ſuffered, O! what hadſt thou ſuffered? What hadſt thou been if he had not redeemed thee? Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hadſt thou gone, if he had not recalled thee? There was but one ſtep between thee and hell, when he ſtept in and bore the ſtroke; he ſlew the bear, and reſcued the prey; he delivered thy ſoul from the roaring lion: and is not here fuel enough for love to feed on? Doth not this loadſtone ſnatch thy heart, and almoſt draw it forth from thy breaſt? Canſt thou read the hiſtory of love any further at once?

How long, LORD holy and true, wilt thou ſuffer this ſoul to pant and groan! and wilt not open and let him in, who waits and longs to be with thee!</p>
               <p>Thus, reader, let thy thoughts aſpire: thus whet the deſires of thy ſoul by meditation; till thy ſoul long (as <hi>David</hi>'s for the waters of <hi>Bethlehem</hi>) and ſay, <hi>O that one would give me to drink of the wells of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</hi> and till thou canſt ſay as he, <hi>I have longed for thy ſalvation, O Lord!</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Some Advantages and Helps, for raiſing the Soul by Meditation.</head>
               <p>THE next part of this directory, is to ſhew you what advantages you ſhould take, and what helps you ſhould uſe, to make your meditations of heaven more quickening, and to make you taſte the ſweetneſs that is therein. For this is the main work, that you may not ſtick in a bare thinking, but may have the lively ſenſe of all upon your hearts: and this you will find to be the moſt difficult part of the work. It is eaſier to think of heaven a whole day, than to be lively and affectionate in thoſe thoughts one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour. Therefore let us yet a little further conſider what may be done, to make your thoughts of heaven piercing, affecting thoughts.</p>
               <p>It will be a point of ſpiritual prudence, and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular help to the furthering of faith, to call in our ſenſes to its aſſiſtance: if we can make us friends of thoſe uſual enemies, and make them inſtruments of raiſing us to GOD, which are the uſual means of drawing us from GOD, we ſhall perform a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent work. Sure it is both poſſible and lawful to do ſomething in this kind; for GOD would not have given us either ſenſes themſelves, or their uſual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:022331_0354_0FB7EE879A38EBD0"/>if they might not have been ſerviceable to his own praiſe, and helps to raiſe us to the apprehenſion of higher things: and it is very conſiderable, how the Holy Ghoſt doth condeſcend, in the phraſe of ſcripture, in bringing things down to the reach of ſenſe; how he ſets forth the excellencies of ſpiritual things in words that are borrowed from the objects of ſenſe. Doubtleſs, if ſuch expreſſions had not been beſt, and to us neceſſary, the Holy Ghoſt would not have ſo frequently uſed them: he that will ſpeak to man's underſtanding, muſt ſpeak in man's language, and ſpeak that which he is capable to conceive.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Go to then; when thou ſetteſt thyſelf to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on the joys above, think on them boldly as ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath expreſſed them: bring down thy conceivings to the reach of ſenſe. Excellency withou familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doth more amaze than delight us; but love and joy are promoted by familiar acquaintance: when we go about to think of GOD and glory without theſe ſpectacles, we are loſt, and have nothing to fix our thoughts upon; we ſet GOD and heaven ſo far from us, that our thoughts are ſtrange, and we look at them as things beyond our reach, and are ready to ſay, that which is above is nothing to us: to conceive no more of GOD and glory, but that we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them; and to apprehend no more, but that they are paſt apprehenſion, will produce no more love but this, to acknowledge that they are ſo far above us that we cannot love them, and no more joy but this, that they are above our rejoicing. And therefore put <hi>Chriſt</hi> no further from you, than he hath put himſelf, leſt the divine nature be again inacceſſible. Think of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as in our own nature glorified; think of our follow-ſaints as men there perfected; think of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſtate as the Spirit hath expreſſed it, only with caution. Suppoſe thou wert now beholding this city of GOD, and that thou hadſt been a companion with
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:022331_0355_0FB7EE891B1891B8"/>
                  <hi>John</hi> in his ſurvey of its glory, and hadſt ſeen the thrones, the majeſty, the heavenly hoſts, the ſhining ſplendor which he ſaw: draw as ſtrong ſuppoſitions as may be from thy ſenſe for the helping of thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: it is lawful to ſuppoſe we did ſee for the preſent, that which GOD hath in propheſies revealed, and which, we muſt really ſee in more unſpeakable brightneſs before long. Suppoſe therefore with thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thou hadſt been that apoſtle's fellow-traveller into the celeſtial kingdom, and that thou hadſt ſeen all the ſaints in their white robes, with palms in their hands: ſuppoſe thou had heard thoſe ſongs of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Lamb; or didſt even now hear them praiſing and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the living GOD: if thou hadſt ſeen theſe things indeed, in what a rapture wouldſt thou have been! And the more ſeriouſly thou putteſt this ſuppoſition to thyſelf, the more will the meditation elevate thy heart.</p>
               <p>I would not have thee, as the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> draw them in pictures, nor uſe ſuch ways to repreſent them. This, as it is a courſe forbidden by GOD, ſo it would but ſeduce and draw down thy heart: but get the livelieſt picture of them in thy mind that poſſibly thou canſt; meditate on them, as if thou wert all the while beholding them, and as if thou wert even hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hallelujahs; till thou canſt ſay, methinks I ſee a glimpſe of the glory! Methinks I hear the ſhouts of joy and praiſe! Methinks I even ſtand by <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David, Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and more of theſe triumphing ſouls! Methinks I ſee the Son of GOD appearing in the clouds, and the world ſtanding at his bar to receive their doom! Methinks I hear him ſay, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father;</hi> and ſee <hi>

And thus you ſee how the familiar conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſtate of bleſſedneſs, as the Spirit hath in a condeſcending language expreſſed it, and our ſtrong ſuppoſitions raiſed from our bodily ſenſes, will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our affections in this heavenly work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is yet another way by which we may make our ſenſes ſerviceable to us, and that is, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the objects of ſenſe with the objects of faith; and ſo forcing ſenſe to afford us that medium, from whence we may conclude the tranſcendent worth of glory, by arguing from ſenſitive delights as from the leſs to the greater.

Eſpecially, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſaid, <hi>that which my ſoul loveth.</hi> What delight hath the taſte in ſome pleaſant fruits, in ſome well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed meats!

How plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant is drink in the extremity of thirſt!

               <p n="3">3. Compare alſo the delights above with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights that are found in natural knowledge: This is far beyond the delights of ſenſe, and the delights of heaven are further beyond it. Think then, can an <hi>Archimedes</hi> be ſo taken up with his mathematical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, that the threats of death cannot take him off? Should I not much more be taken up with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of glory, and die with theſe contemplations freſh upon my ſoul; eſpecially when my death will perfect my delights? But thoſe of <hi>Archimedes</hi> die with him. What a pleaſure is it to dive into the ſecrets of nature! to find out the myſteries of arts and ſciences!

4. Compare alſo the delights above, with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of morality, and of the natural affections. What delight had many ſober heathens in the practice of moral duties; ſo that they took him only for an honeſt man who did well through the love of virtue, and not only for fear of puniſhment: yea, ſo highly did they value virtue, that they thought the chief happineſs of man conſiſted in it. Think then what excellency there will be in that rare perfection which we ſhall be raiſed to in heaven; and in that uncreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perfection of GOD which we ſhall behold! What ſweetneſs is there in the exerciſe of natural love; whether to children, to parents, to yoke-fellows or to friends! The delight which ſpecial, faithful friends find in loving and enjoying one another, is a moſt pleaſing, ſweet delight: even <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, as it ſeemeth, had ſome of this kind of love; for he had one diſciple whom he eſpecially loved. Think then, if the delights of cordial friendſhip be ſo great, what delights ſhall we have in the friendſhip of the MOST HIGH? and in our mutual amity with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> and in the deareſt love and comfort with the ſaints? Surely this will be a cloſer and ſtricter friendſhip than ever was betwixt any friends on earth; and theſe will be more lovely and deſirable friends than any that ever the ſun beheld; and both our affections to our Father, and our Saviour, but eſpecially his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to us, will be ſuch as here we never knew; as ſpirits are ſo far more powerful than fleſh, that one angel can deſtroy an hoſt, ſo alſo are their affections more ſtrong and powerful; we ſhall then love a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more ſtrongly and ſweetly than now we can; and as all the attributes and works of GOD are incomprehenſible, ſo is the attribute and work of love: he will love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

5. Compare alſo the excellencies of heaven with thoſe glorious works of the creation which our eyes now behold. What a deal of wiſdom, and power, and goodneſs appeareth in and through them to a wiſe obſerver! What a deal of the majeſty of the great Creator doth ſhine in the face of this fabric of the world! Surely his works are great and admirable, ſought out of them that have pleaſure therein. This makes the ſtudy of natural philoſophy ſo pleaſant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the works of GOD are ſo excellent: what rare workmanſhip is in the body of a man! yea, in the body of every beaſt! which makes the anatomical ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſo delightful. What excellency in every plant we ſee! in the beauty of flowers! in the nature, diverſity and uſe of herbs! in fruits, in roots, in minerals, and what not! But eſpecially if we look to the greater works; if we conſider the whole body of this earth, and its creatures, and inhabitants; the ocean of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with its motions and dimenſions, the variation of the ſeaſons, and of the face of the earth; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of ſpring and fall, of ſummer and winter; what wonderful excellency do theſe contain! Why, then think if theſe things which are but ſervants to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man, are yet ſo full of myſterious worth; what is that place where GOD himſelf doth dwell, prepared for the juſt who are perfected with <hi>Chriſt!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When thou walkeſt forth in the evening, look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtars, in what number they beſpangle the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament: if in the day time, look up to the glorious ſun; view the wide-expanded heavens, and ſay to thyſelf, what glory is in the leaſt of yonder ſtars! What a vaſt, what a reſplendent body hath yonder moon, and every planet! What an inconceivable glory hath the ſun! Why, all this is nothing to the glory of heaven. Yonder ſun muſt there be laid aſide as uſeleſs; for it would not be ſeen for the brightneſs of GOD. I ſhall live above all yonder glory: yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:022331_0360_0FB7EE98180012D0"/>ſun is but darkneſs to the luſtre of my Father's houſe; I ſhall be as glorious as that ſun myſelf.</p>
               <p>So think of the reſt of the creatures. This whole earth is but my Father's footſtool; this thunder is nothing to his dreadful voice; theſe winds are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the breath of his mouth: ſo much wiſdom and power as appear in theſe; ſo much, and far more greatneſs, and goodneſs, and delight, ſhall I enjoy in the actual fruition of GOD. Surely, if the rain which rains, and the ſun which ſhines on the juſt and unjuſt, be ſo wonderful, the ſun then which muſt ſhine on none but ſaints and angels, muſt needs be wonderful and raviſhing in glory.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Compare the things which thou ſhalt enjoy above, with the excellency of thoſe admirable works of Providence, which GOD doth exerciſe in the church, and in the world.

If we had ſeen the rock to guſh forth ſtreams, or manna or quails rained down from heaven, or the earth open and ſwallow up the wicked; would not all theſe have been wonderous, glorious ſights? But we ſhall ſee far greater things than theſe. And as our ſights ſhall be more wonderful, ſo alſo they ſhall be more ſweet: there ſhall be no blood or wrath intermingled; we ſhall not then cry out as <hi>David, who ſhall ſtand before this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord God?</hi> Would it not have been an aſtoniſhing ſight to have ſeen the ſun ſtand ſtill in the firmament? Why, we ſhall ſee when there ſhall be no ſun to ſhine at all; we ſhall behold for-ever a ſun of more incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable brightneſs. Were it not a brave life, if we might ſtill live among wonders and miracles; and
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:022331_0361_0FB7EE9A898489E8"/>all for us, and not againſt us? If we could have drought or rain at our prayers, as <hi>Elias;</hi> or if we could call down fire from heaven, to deſtroy our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; or raiſe the dead to life, as <hi>Eliſha;</hi> or cure the diſeaſed, and ſpeak ſtrange languages, as the apoſtles: alas, theſe are nothing to the wonders which we ſhall ſee and poſſeſs with GOD, and all thoſe wonders of goodneſs and love! We ſhall poſſeſs that pearl and power itſelf, through whoſe virtue all theſe works were done; we ſhall ourſelves be the ſubjects of more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful mercies than any of theſe. <hi>Jonas</hi> was raiſed but from a three day's burial, from the belly of the whale in the deep ocean; but we ſhall be raiſed from many years rotteneſs and duſt, and that duſt exalted to a ſun-like glory, and that glory perpetuated to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. What ſayſt thou? Is not this the greateſt of miracles or wonders? Surely, if we obſerve but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon providences, the motions of the ſun, the tides of the ſea, the ſtanding of the earth, the warming it, the watering it with rain as a garden, the keeping in order a wicked confuſed world, with multitudes of the like; they are all very admirable, but then to think of the <hi>Sion</hi> of GOD, of the viſion of the divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, of the comely order of the heavenly hoſt; what an admirable ſight muſt that needs be! O what rare and mighty works have we ſeen! what clear diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of an almighty arm! what magnifying of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! what caſting down of ſtrength! what wonders wrought by moſt improbable means! what turning of tears and fears into ſafety and joy! ſuch hearing of earneſt prayers, as if GOD could have denied us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing! All theſe were wonderful works; but what are theſe to our full deliverance! to our final conqueſt! to our eternal triumph! and to that great day of great things!</p>

<pb n="363" facs="unknown:022331_0362_0FB7EE9D35152C20"/>haſt enjoyed thyſelf. If thou be a chriſtian indeed, thou haſt, if not in thy book, yet certainly in thy heart, many favours upon record; the very remembrance and rehearſal of them is ſweet; how much more ſweet was the actual enjoyment? But all theſe are nothing to the mercies which are above. Look over the excellent mercies of thy youth, the mercies of thy riper years, the mercies of thy proſperity and of thy adverſity, the mercies of thy ſeveral places and relations: are they not excellent and innumerable? Canſt not thou think on the ſeveral places thou haſt lived in, and remember that they have each had their ſeveral mercies? The mercies of ſuch a place, and ſuch a place; and all of them very rich and engaging mercies? O how ſweet was it to thee, when GOD reſolved thy laſt doubts! when he overcame and ſilenced thy fears and unbelief! when he prevented the inconveniencies of thy life, which thy own counſel would have caſt thee into! when he eaſed thy pains, when he healed thy ſickneſs, and raiſed thee up as from the very grave! Were not all theſe precious mercies? Alas, theſe are but ſmall things for thee in the eyes of GOD; he intendeth thee far greater things than theſe, even ſuch as theſe are ſcarce a taſte of. It was a choice mercy that GOD hath ſo notably anſwered thy prayers, and that thou haſt been ſo oft and evidently a prevailer with him: but O think, are all theſe ſo ſweet and precious, that my life would have been a perpetual miſery without them! Hath his providence lifted me ſo high on earth, and his merciful kindneſs made me great? How ſweet then will the glory of his preſence be! And how high will his eternal love exalt me! And how great ſhall I be made in communion with his greatneſs! If my pilgrimage and warfare have ſuch mercies; what ſhall I find in my home, and in my triumph? If I have had ſo much in this ſtrange country, at ſuch a diſtance from him; what ſhall I have in heaven, in his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate preſence?</p>

8. Compare the joy which thou ſhalt have in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with that which the ſaints of GOD have found in the way to it, and in the foretaſtes of it: when thou ſeeſt a heavenly man rejoice, think what it is that ſo affects him. It is the property of fools to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in toys; but the people of GOD are wiſer, they know what it is that makes them glad. When did GOD reveal himſelf to any of his ſaints, but the joy of their hearts was anſwerable to the revelation? When <hi>Moſes</hi> had been talking with GOD in the mount, it made his viſage ſo ſhining and glorious, that the people could not endure to behold it; but he was ſain to put a veil upon it: no wonder then if the face of GOD muſt be veiled, till we come to that ſtate where we ſhall be capable of beholding him, when <hi>the veil ſhall be taken away, and we all beholding him with open face, ſhall be changed into the ſame image from glory to glory.</hi> Alas, what are the back parts which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw from the elefts of the rock, to that open face which we ſhall behold hereafter! What is that revelation to <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Patmos,</hi> to this revelation which we ſhall have in heaven! How ſhort doth <hi>Paul</hi>'s viſion come of the ſaints' viſion above with GOD! How ſmall a part of the glory which we muſt ſee, was that which ſo tranſported <hi>Peter</hi> in the mount! I confeſs theſe were all extraordinary foretaſtes; but little to the full, beatifical viſion. When <hi>David</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and of himſelf, how did it make him brake forth and ſay. <hi>Therefore my heart was glad, and my glory rejoiceth, my fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in hope.</hi> Think then, if the foreſight can raiſe ſuch raviſhing joy, what will the actual poſſeſſion do? How oft have we read and heard of the dying ſaints, who when they had ſcarce ſtrength and life to expreſs them, have been as full of joy as their hearts could hold? And when their bodies have been under the extremities of their ſickneſs, yea, ready to feel the pangs of death, have yet had ſo much of heaven in
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:022331_0364_0FB7EEA09CE6E530"/>their ſpirits, that their joy hath far ſurpaſſed their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows? And if a ſpark of this fire be ſo glorious, and that in the midſt of the ſea of adverſity; what then is that ſun of glory itſelf?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Compare alſo the glory of the heavenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with the glory of the church on earth, and of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his ſtate of humiliation; and you may eaſily conclude, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtanding in the room of ſinners, was ſo wonderful in excellencies, what is <hi>Chriſt</hi> at the Father's right hand? And if the church, under her ſins and enemies, hath ſo much beauty; ſhe will have much more at the marriage of the Lamb. How wonderful was the Son of GOD in the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant! When he is born, the heavens muſt proclaim him by miracles; a new ſtar muſt appear in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fetch men from remote parts of the world to worſhip him in a manger; the angels and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hoſt muſt declare his nativity, and ſolemnize it with praiſing and glorifying GOD: when he ſets upon his office, his whole life is a wonder; water turned into wine, thouſands fed with five loaves and two fiſhes, the lepers cleanſed, the ſick healed, the lame reſtored, the blind receive their ſight, the dead raiſed: if we had ſeen all this, ſhould we not have thought it wonderful? The moſt deſperate diſeaſes cured with a touch, with a word; the blind eyes with a little clay and ſpittle; the devils departing by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions at command; the winds and the ſeas obeying his word: are not all theſe wonderful? Think then, how wonderful is his celeſtial glory! If there be ſuch cutting down of boughs, and ſpreading of garments, and crying, hoſanna, to one that comes into <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> riding on an aſs; what will there be when he comes with his angels in his glory?

<pb n="366" facs="unknown:022331_0365_0FB7EEA1E3080C50"/>his majeſty in his kingdom, will ſay, <hi>There was never glory like this glory.</hi> If when his enemies come to apprehend him, the word of his mouth doth caſt them all to the ground; if when he is dying, the earth muſt tremble, the veil of the temple rend, the ſun in the firmament hide its face, and the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the ſaints ariſe: O what a day will it be, when he will once more ſhake, not the earth only, but the heavens alſo, and remove the things that are ſhaken! when this ſun ſhall be taken out of the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, and be everlaſtingly darkened with the brightneſs of his glory! when the dead muſt all riſe and ſtand before him; and <hi>all ſhall acknowledge him to be the Son of God, and every tongue confeſs him to be Lord and King!</hi> If when he riſeth again, the grave and death have loſt their power, and the angels of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven muſt roll away the ſtone, and aſtoniſh the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men till they are as dead men, and ſend the tidings to his dejected diſciples; if the bolted doors cannot keep him out; if the ſea be as firm ground for him to walk on; if he can aſcend to heaven in the ſight of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and ſend the angels to forbid them gazing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him: O what power, and dominion, and glory then is he now poſſeſſed of! and muſt we ever poſſeſs with him!</p>
               <p>Yet think further, are his very ſervants enabled to do ſuch miracles when he is gone from them? Can a few poor fiſhermen, and tent-makers, cure the lame and blind, and ſick? open priſons, deſtroy the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and raiſe the dead? O then what a world will that be, where every one can do greater works than theſe! It were much to have the devils ſubject to us; but more to have our names written in the book of life. If the very preaching of the goſpel be accompanied with ſuch power, that it will pierce the heart, and diſcover its ſecrets, bring down the proud, and make the ſtony ſinner tremble; if it can make

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> How to manage and watch over the Heart through the whole Work.</head>
               <p>THE laſt part of this directory, is, to guide you in managing your hearts through this work, and to ſhew you wherein you had need to be exceeding watchful. I have ſhewed before, what muſt be done with your hearts in your preparations to the work, and in your ſetting upon it: I ſhall new ſhew it you, in reſpect of the time of the performance. Our chief work will here be, to diſcover to you the danger, and that will direct you to the remedy. Let me therefore acquaint you before-hand, that whenever you ſet upon this heavenly employment, you ſhall find your own hearts your greateſt hinderer, and they will prove falſe to you in one or all of theſe ſour degrees. <hi>Firſt,</hi> they will hold off, that you will hardly get them to the work; or elſe they will betray you by their idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the work, pretending to do it, when they do it not; or they will interrupt the work, by their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:022331_0369_0FB7EEB2D44E3E00"/>excurſions, and turning aſide to every object; or they will ſpoil the work by cutting it ſhort, and be gone before you have done any good at it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I forewarn you, as you value the invaluable comfort of this work, faithfully reſiſt theſe four dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous evils.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thou ſhalt find thy heart as backward to this, as to any work in the world. O what excuſes it will make! what evaſions it will find out! and what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, when it is never ſo much convinced! Either it will queſtion, whether it be a duty or not; or, if it be ſo to others, yet whether it be ſo to thee? It will take up any thing like reaſon to plead againſt it; or, if thy heart have nothing againſt the work, then it will trifle away the time in delays, and promiſe this day and the next, but ſtill keep off; or laſtly, if thou wilt not be ſo baffled with excuſes or delays, thy heart will give thee a flat denial, and oppoſe its own unwillingneſs to thy reaſon; thou ſhalt find it draw back with all the ſtrength it hath. I ſpeak all this of the heart ſo far as it is carnal; for ſo far as it is ſpiritual, it will judge this work the ſweeteſt in the world.</p>
               <p>But take up the authority which GOD hath given thee, command thy heart; if it rebel, uſe violence with it; if thou be too weak, call in the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to thine aſſiſtance; he is never backward to ſo good a work, nor will deny his help in ſo juſt a cauſe: GOD will be ready to help thee, if thou be not unwilling to help thyſelf. Say unto him, "LORD, thou gaveſt my reaſon the command of my thoughts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the authority I have received over them, is from thee, and now, behold they refuſe to obey thine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; thou commandeſt me to ſet them to the work of heavenly meditation, but they rebel and ſtubbornly refuſe the duty; wilt thou not aſſiſt me to execute
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:022331_0370_0FB7EEB48C8AE060"/>that authority which thou haſt given me? O ſend down thy Spirit and power, that I may enforce thy commands, and effectually compel them to obey thy will."</p>
               <p>And thus doing, thou ſhalt ſee thy heart will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; its reſiſtance will be brought under; and its back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs will be turned to compliance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When thou haſt got thy heart to the work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leſt it delude thee by a loitering formality; leſt it ſay, I go, and go not; leſt it trifle out the time, while it ſhould be effectually meditating. When thou haſt perhaps but an hour's time for meditation, the time will be ſpent before thy heart will be ſerious. This doing of duty, as if we did it not, doth undo as many as the flat omiſſion of it. To rub out the hour in a ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nking of heaven, is but to loſe that hour, and delude thyſelf. What is to be done in this caſe? Why, do here alſo as you do by a loitering ſervant; keep thine eye always upon thy heart; look not ſo much to the time it ſpendeth in the duty, as to the work that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I would not have thee of the judgment of thoſe who think that while they are ſo backward, it is better let it alone; and that if mere love will not bring them to the duty, the ſervice is worſe than the omiſſion: theſe men un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="372" facs="unknown:022331_0371_0FB7EEB72A4ED750"/>natures; nor that their ſinful undiſpoſedneſs will not ſuſpend the commands of God; not one ſin excuſe another; eſpecially they little know the way of GOD to excite their affections; and that the love which ſhould compel them, muſt itſelf be firſt compelled, in the ſame ſenſe as it is ſaid to compel: love I know is a moſt precious grace, and ſhould have the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in all our duties; but there are means appointed by GOD to procure this love; and ſhall I not uſe thoſe means, till I can uſe them from love? that were to neglect the means, till I have the end. Muſt I not ſeek to procure love, till I have it already? There are means alſo for the increaſing of love where it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and means for exciting it where it lieth dull; and muſt I not uſe theſe means, till it is increaſed and excited? Fall upon the work, till thou art conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to love; and then love will conſtrain thee to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As thy heart will be loitering, ſo will it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting. It will be turning aſide like a careleſs ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to talk with every one that paſſeth by: when there ſhould be nothing in thy mind, but the work in hand; it will be thinking of thy calling, or of thy afflictions, or of every bird, or tree, or place thou ſecſt, or of any impertinency, rather than of heaven. The cure here is the ſame with that before; to uſe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and violence with your own imaginations, and as ſoon as they ſtep out, to chide them in. Drive away theſe birds of prey from thy ſacrifice, and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keep thy heart to the work thou art upon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, Be ſure alſo to look to thy heart in this, that it cut not off the work before the time, and run not away through wearineſs, before it have leave. Thou ſhalt find it exceeding prone to this. Thou mayſt eaſily perceive it in other duties: if in ſecret thou ſet thyſelf to pray, is not thy heart urging thee
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:022331_0372_0FB7EEB9DD5B32A0"/>ſtill to cut it ſhort? Doſt thou not frequently find a motion to have done? Art thou not ready to be up, as ſoon almoſt as thou art down on thy knees? So it will be alſo in thy contemplations of heaven; as faſt as thou getteſt up thy heart, it will be down again; it will be weary of the work; it will be minding thee of other buſineſs to be done, and ſtop thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly walk, before thou art well warm. What is to be done in this caſe alſo? Why the ſame authority and reſolution which brought it to the work, and obſerved it in the work, muſt hold it to it, till the work be done. Stick to the work till thy graces be acted, thy affections raiſed, and thy ſoul refreſhed with the delights above; or if thou canſt not obtain theſe ends at once, ply it the cloſer the next time, and let it not go till thou feel the bleſſing. <hi>Bleſſed is that ſervant, whom his Lord, when he comes, ſhall find ſo doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have directed you in this work of heavenly contemplation, and led you into the path where you may walk with GOD. But becauſe I would bring it down to the capacity of the meaneſt, and help their memories who are apt to let ſlip the former particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I ſhall he e contract the whole, and lay it before you in a narrower compaſs. But ſtill I wiſh thee to remember, it is the practice of a duty that I am di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting thee in, and therefore if thou wilt not prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it, do not read it.</p>
               <p>The ſum is this, as thou makeſt conſcience of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily, ſo do thou of meditation; and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the joys of heaven. To this end, ſet apart one hour or half hour every day, wherein thou mayſt lay aſide all worldly thoughts, and with all poſſible ſeriouſneſs and reverence, as if thou wert to ſpeak with GOD himſelf, or to have a ſight of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or of that bleſſed place; ſo withdraw thyſelf into ſome
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:022331_0373_0FB7EEBC1F5024D0"/>ſecret place, and ſet thyſelf wholly to the following work: if thou canſt, take <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s time and place, who <hi>went forth into the field in the evening to meditate:</hi> but if thou be a ſervant or poor man that cannot have that leiſure, take the fitteſt time and place that thou canſt, though it be when thou art private about thy labours.</p>

Compare thy heavenly joys with the choiceſt on earth, and ſo riſe up from ſenſe to faith; if this mere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration prevail not, then plead the caſe with thy hearts preach upon this text of heaven to thyſelf; convince, inform, confute, inſtruct, reprove, examine, admoniſh, encourage, and comfort thy own ſoul from this celeſtial doctrine; draw forth thoſe ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of thy reſt, on which thy ſeveral affections may work, eſpecially that affection or grace which thou intendeſt to act. If it be love which thou wouldſt act, ſhew it the lovelineſs of heaven, and how ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is to thy condition: if it be deſire, conſider thy abſence from this lovely object: if it be hope, conſider the poſſibility and probability of obtaining it: if it be courage, conſider the ſingular aſſiſtance and encouragements which thou mayſt receive from GOD, the weakneſs of the enemy, and the neceſſity of prevailing: if it be joy, conſider its excellent, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing glory, thy intereſt in it, and its certainty, and the nearneſs of the time when thou mayeſt poſſeſs it. Urge theſe conſiderations home to thy heart; whet them with all poſſible ſeriouſneſs upon each af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: if thy heart draw back, force it to the work;
<pb n="375" facs="unknown:022331_0374_0FB7EEBD9E9C97F8"/>if it loiter, ſpur it on; if it ſtep aſide, command it in again; if it would ſlip away, and leave the work, uſe thine authority; keep it cloſe to the buſineſs, till thou haſt obtained thine end; ſtir not away, if it may be, till thy love flame, till thy joy be raiſed, or till thy deſire or other graces be lively. Call in aſſiſtance alſo from GOD, mix ejaculations with thy ſoliloquies; till having ſeriouſly pleaded the caſe with thy heart, and reverently pleaded the caſe with GOD, thou haſt pleaded thyſelf from a clod to a flame, from a forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſinner to a mindful lover: from a lover of the world, to a thirſter after GOD; from a fearful cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, to a reſolved chriſtian. In a word, what will not be done one day, do it the next, till thou haſt pleaded thy heart from earth to heaven; from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing below, to a walking with GOD; and till thou canſt lay thy heart to reſt, as in the boſom of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> in this meditation of thy full and everlaſting reſt.</p>

To my wearied ſenſes and languid ſpirits, it ſeems a quieting, powerful opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate; to my dulled powers, it is ſpirit and life; to my dark eyes, it is both eye-ſalve, and a proſpective; to my taſte, it is ſweetneſs; to mine ears, it is melody; to my hands and feet, it is ſtrength and nimbleneſs:
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:022331_0375_0FB7EEC14CA8E010"/>methinks I feel it digeſt as it proceeds, and increaſe my native heat and moiſture, and lying as a reviving cordial of my heart, from thence doth ſend forth lively ſpirits, which beat through all the pulſes of my ſoul. Reſt! not as the ſtone that reſts on the earth, nor as theſe clods of fleſh ſhall reſt in the grave; ſo our beaſts muſt reſt as well as we; nor is it the ſatisfying of our fleſhly luſts, nor ſuch a reſt as the carnal world deſireth: no, no; we have another kind of reſt than theſe: reſt we ſhall from our labours, which were but the way and means to reſt: but yet that is the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part: O bleſſed reſt, where we ſhall never reſt day nor night, crying, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth!</hi> where we ſhall reſt from ſin, but not from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip! from ſuffering and ſorrow, but not from ſolace!

How near is that moſt bleſſed joyful day? it comes apace; even <hi>he that comes will come, and will not tarry:</hi> though my LORD ſeem to delay his coming, yet a little while and he will be here: what is a few hundred years when they are over?

O ſee how the Judge doth ſmile upon you! there is love in his looks; the titles of redeemer, huſband, head, are written in his amiable face: hark! doth he not call you? he bids you ſtand here on his right hand; fear not, for there he ſets his ſheep: O joyful ſentence pronounced by his mouth! <hi>Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for you from the foundations of the world!</hi> See how your Saviour takes you by the hand; the door is open; the kingdom is his, and therefore yours: there is your place before his throne: the Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth you as the ſpouſe of his Son, he bids you wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to the crown of glory; never ſo unworthy, crowned you muſt be: this was the project of free redeeming grace, the purpoſe of eternal love.

               <p>This is that joy which was procured by ſorrow; this is that crown which was procured by the croſs: my LORD did weep, that now my tears might be wiped away; he did bleed, that I might now rejoice; he was forſaken, that I might not now be forſaken;
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:022331_0377_0FB7EEC52413EA88"/>he did then die, that I might now live. This weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wounded LORD, ſhall I behold; this bleeding Saviour ſhall I ſee, and live in him that died for me. O free mercy that can exalt ſo vile a wretch! free to me, though dear to <hi>Chriſt!</hi> here muſt I live with all theſe ſaints! O comfortable meeting of my old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, with whom I prayed, and wept, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; with whom I ſpeak of this day and place! I ſee the grave could not contain you, the ſea and earth muſt give up their dead; the ſame love hath redeemed and ſaved you alſo: this is not like our cottages of clay, our priſons, or earthly dwellings: this voice of joy is not like our own complainings, our groans, our ſighs, our impatient moans; nor this melodious praiſe like our ſcorns and revilings, nor like the oaths and curſes which we heard on earth: this body is not like the body we had, nor this ſoul like the ſoul we had, nor this life like the life that then we lived; we have changed our place, we have changed our ſtate, our clothes, our thoughts, our looks, our language; we have changed our company for the greater part, and the reſt of our company is changed itſelf; before we were weak and deſpiſed, but now how glorious! Where are now our different judgments, our divided ſpirits? Now we are all of one judgment, of one name, of one heart, of one houſe, and of one glory. O ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement! O happy union! which makes us firſt to be one with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and then one with ourſelves! Now our differences ſhall be daſhed in our teeth no more, nor the goſpel reproached through our folly. O my ſoul, thou ſhalt no more lament the ſufferings of the ſaints; never more condole the church's ruins; never bewail thy ſuffering friends, nor lie wailing over their death-beds, or their graves: thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer thy old temptations from Satan, the world, or thy own fleſh; thy body will no more be ſuch a burden to thee; thy pains and ſickneſſes are all now cured; thou ſhalt be troubled with weakneſs and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs

Ah drowſy, earthly, blockiſh heart, how coolly doſt thou think of this reviving day! Doſt thou ſleep when thou thinkeſt of eternal reſt? art thou hanging earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when heaven is before thee? Hadſt thou rather ſit thee down in dung, than walk in the court of the preſence of GOD? Doſt thou now remember thy world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſineſs? Art thou thinking of thy delights? Wretched heart! is it better to be there, than above with GOD? is the company better? are the pleaſures greater? come away, make no excuſe, make no delay; GOD commands, and I command thee, come away; gird up thy loins; aſcend the mount, and look about thee with ſeriouſneſs and with faith. Look thou not back upon the way of the wilderneſs, except it be when thine eyes are dazzled with the glory, or when thou wouldſt compare the kingdom with that howling deſart, that thou mayeſt more ſenſibly perceive the mighty difference. Fix thine eye upon the ſun itſelf, and look not down to earth as long as thou art able to behold it; except it be to diſcern more eaſily the brightneſs of the one by the darkneſs of the other. Yonder is thy Father's glory: yonder muſt thou dwell when thou leaveſt this earth; yonder muſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, O my ſoul, when thou departeſt from this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and when the power of thy LORD hath raiſed it again, and joined thee to it, yonder muſt thou live with GOD for-ever. There is the glorious <hi>new</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>the gates of pearl, the foundations of pearl, the ſtreets and pavements of tranſparent gold.</hi> Seeſt thou that ſun which lighteth all the world? Why, it muſt be taken down as uſeleſs there, or the glory of heaven will darken it, and put it out; even thyſelf ſhall be as bright as yonder ſhining ſun; <hi>God will be the ſun, and Chriſt the light, and in his light ſhalt thou have light.</hi>

Thine eyes may fail thee, thy ears deceive thee, and all thy ſenſes prove deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſooner than a promiſe of GOD can delude thee. Thou mayſt be ſurer of that which is written in the word, than if thou ſee it with thy eyes, or feel it with thy hands. Art thou ſure thou liveſt? or ſure that this is the earth which thou ſtandeſt on? Art thou ſure thine eyes ſee the ſun? As ſure is all this glory to the ſaints, as ſure ſhall I be higher than yonder ſtars, and live for-ever in the holy city, and joyfully ſound forth the praiſe of my Redeemer, if I be not ſhut out by <hi>the evil heart of unbelief, cauſing me to depart from the living God.</hi>

Ah, poor men! that you would once conſider what you hazard, and then you would ſcorn theſe tempting baits. O bleſſed for-ever be that love, that hath reſcued me from this mad bewitching darkneſs!</p>
               <p>Draw nearer yet, O my ſoul; bring forth thy ſtrongeſt love; here is matter for it to work upon: O ſee what beauty preſents itſelf! Is it not exceeding lovely? Is not all the beauty in the world contracted here? Is not all other beauty deformity to it? Doſt thou need to be perſuaded now to love? Here is a feaſt for thine eves: a feaſt for all the powers of thy ſoul: doſt thou need to be entreated to feed upon it? Canſt thou love a little ſhining earth? Canſt thou love a walking piece of clay? And canſt thou not
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:022331_0381_0FB7EED94C37D2A8"/>love that GOD, that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that glory, which is ſo truly and unmeaſurably lovely? Thou canſt love thy friend becauſe he loves thee: and is the love of friends like the love of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Their weeping or bleeding for thee doth not eaſe thee nor ſtay the courſe of thy tears or blood: but the tears and blood that fell from thy LORD, have all a ſovereign, healing virtue, and are waters of life, and balſam to thy fainting ſores. O my ſoul! if love deſerve, and ſhould procure love, what incomprehenſible love is here before thee! Pour out all the ſtore of thy affections here: and all is too little. O that it were more! Let him be firſt ſerved, that ſerved thee firſt: let him have the ſtrength of thy love, who parted with ſtrength and life in love to thee: if thou haſt any to ſpare when he hath his part, let it be imparted then to ſtanders by. See what a ſea of love is here before thee: eaſt thyſelf into this ocean of his love: fear not though it ſeem a furnace of fire, and the hotteſt that was ever kindled upon earth, yet it is the ſire of love and not of wrath; a fire moſt effectual to extinguiſh fire; never intended to conſume, but to glorify thee: venture into it then in thy believing meditations, and walk in theſe flames with the Son of GOD: when thou art once in, thou wilt be ſorry to come forth again. O my ſoul! what wanteſt thou here to provoke thy love? Doſt thou love for excellency? Why thou ſeeſt nothing below but baſeneſs, except as they relate to thy enjoyments above. Yonder is the <hi>Goſben,</hi> the region of light; this is a land of palpable darkneſ. Yonder ſtars, that ſhining moon, the radiant ſum, are all but as the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorns hanged out at thy Father's houſe to light thee while thou walkeſt in the dark ſtreets of the earth: but little doſt thou know the glory that is within! Doſt thou love for ſuitableneſs? Why what perſon more ſuitable than <hi>Chriſt?</hi> his godhead, his manhood, his fulneſs, his freeneſs, his willingneſs, his conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; do all proclaim him thy moſt ſuitable friend.

What place more ſuitable to thee than heaven? Thou haſt had a ſufficient trial of this world: doſt thou find it agree with thy nature or deſires? Are theſe common abominations, theſe heavy ſufferings, theſe unſatisfying vanities, ſuitable to thee? Or doſt thou love for intereſt and near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Where haſt thou better intereſt than in heaven? or where haſt thou nearer relation than there? Doſt thou love for acquaintance and familiarity? Why though thine eyes have never ſeen the LORD, yet he is never the further from thee. If thy ſon were blind, yet he would love thee his father, though he never ſaw thee. Thou haſt heard the voice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to thy very heart, thou haſt received his benefits: thou haſt lived in his boſom, and art thou not ye acquainted with him? It is he that brought thee ſeaſonably and ſafely into the world: it is he that nurſed thee in thy tender infancy, and helped thee when thou couldſt not help thyſelf: he taught thee to go, to ſpeak, to read, to underſtand: he taught thee to know thyſelf and him: he opened thee that firſt window whereby thou ſaweſt into heaven: haſt thou forgotten ſince thy heart was careleſs, and he did quicken it, and make it yield? When it was at peace, and he did trouble it? And broken, till he did heal it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? Haſt thou forgotten the time, nay, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times when he found thee in ſecret, all in tears; when he heard thy ſighs and groans, and left all to come and comfort thee? When he came in upon thee, and took thee up, as it were in his arms, and aſked thee, poor ſoul, what aileth thee? Doſt thou weep, when I have wept ſo much? Be of good cheer: thy wounds are ſaving, and not deadly. It is I that have made them, who mean thee no hurt: though I let out thy blood, I will not let out thy life.</p>

Methinks I remember yet his voice, and feel thoſe arms that took me up: how gently did he handle me! How carefully did he dreſs my wounds, and bind them up! Methinks I hear him ſtill ſaying, though thou haſt dealt unkindly with me, yet will not I do ſo by thee; though thou haſt ſet light by me and all my mercies; yet both I and all are thine; what wouldeſt thou have, that I cannot give thee? and what doſt thou want, that I cannot give thee! If any thing in heaven and earth will make thee happy, it is all thine own: wouldeſt thou have pardon? thou ſhalt have it, I freely forgive thee all the debt: wouldeſt thou have grace and peace? thou ſhalt have them both: wouldeſt thou have myſelf? behold I am thine, thy friend, thy Lord, thy huſband, and thy head: wouldeſt thou have the Father? I will bring thee to him; and thou ſhalt have him in and by me.—Theſe were my LORD'S reviving words: theſe were the melting, healing, quickening paſſages of love. After all this, when I was doubtful of his love, methinks I yet remember his convincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. —Have I done ſo much to teſtify my love, and yet doſt thou doubt? Have I made thy believing it the condition of enjoying it, and yet doſt thou doubt? Have I offered thee myſelf ſo long, and yet doſt thou queſtion my willingneſs to be thine? <hi>What could I have done more than I have done?</hi> At what dearer rate ſhould I tell thee that I love thee? Read the ſtory of my bitter paſſion, wilt thou not believe that it proceeded from love? Did I ever give thee cauſe to be ſo jealous of me? or to think ſo hardly of me, as thou doſt? Have I made myſelf in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel a lion to thine enemies, and a lamb to thee; and doſt thou ſo overlook my lamb-like nature? Have I ſet mine arms and heart there open to thee, and wilt thou not believe but they are ſhut? If I had been willing to let thee periſh, I could have done it at a cheaper rate: what need I follow thee with ſo long
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:022331_0384_0FB7EEE0E595E708"/>patience, and entreating? What, doſt thou tell me of thy wants; have I not enough for me and thee? and why doſt thou tell me of thy unworthineſs, and thy ſin? I had not died, if man had not ſinned: if thou wert not a ſinner, thou wert not for me; if thou wert worthy thyſelf, what ſhouldſt thou do with my worthineſs? Did I ever invite the worthy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous? or did I ever ſave or juſtify ſuch? or is there any ſuch on earth? Haſt thou nothing? art thou loſt and miſerable? art thou helpleſs and forlorn? doſt thou believe that I am a ſufficient Saviour? and wouldſt thou have me? why then take me. Lo, I am thine; if thou be willing, I am willing, and neither ſin not devils ſhall break the match.</p>
               <p>Theſe, O theſe were the bleſſed words which his Spirit from his goſpel ſpoke unto me, till he made me caſt myſelf at his feet, yea, into his arms, and cry out, "My Saviour and my Lord, thou haſt broke my heart, thou haſt revived my heart, thou haſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, thou haſt won my heart, take it, it is thine: if ſuch an heart can pleaſe thee, take it: if it cannot, make it as thou wouldſt have it."</p>
               <p>Thus, O my ſoul, mayſt thou remember the ſweet familiarity thou haſt had with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> therefore if acquaintance will cauſe affection, O then knit thy heart unto him; it is he that hath ſtood by thy bed of ſickneſs, that hath cooled thy heats, and eaſed thy pains, and refreſhed thy wearineſs, and removed thy fears; he hath been always ready, when thou haſt earneſtly ſought him; he hath given thee the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in public and in private; he hath been found of thee in the congregation, in thy houſe, in thy cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in the field, in the way as thou waſt walking, in thy waking nights, in thy deepeſt dangers. If bounty and compaſſion be an attractive of love, how unmeaſurably then am I bound to love him! All the
<pb n="386" facs="unknown:022331_0385_0FB7EEE811FCEF48"/>mercies that have filled up my life tell me this; all the places that ever I did abide in, every condition of life that I have paſſed through, all my employments, and all my relations, every change that hath befallen me, all tell me, that the fountain is overflowing good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>LORD, what a ſum of love am I indebted to thee, and how doth my debt continually increaſe! How ſhould I love again for ſo much love! But what! ſhall I dare to think of making thee requital, or of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing all thy love with mine? Will my mite requite thee for thy golden mines? or mine, which is nothing, or not mine, for thine which is infinite and thine own? Shall I dare to contend in love with thee? or ſet my borrowed ſpark, againſt the ſun of love? Can I love as high, as deep, as broad, as long as love itſelf; as much as he that made me, and that made me live, that gave me all that little which I have? Both the heart, the fire, the fuel, and all were his: as I cannot match thee in the works of thy power, nor make, nor preſerve, nor guide the world; ſo why ſhould I think any more of matching thee in love? no, LORD, I yield, I am overcome; O bleſſed conqueſt! go on victoriouſly, and ſtill prevail, and triumph in thy love; the captive of love ſhall proclaim thy victory, when thou leadeſt me in triumph from earth to heaven, from death to life, from the tribunal to the throne, myſelf, and all that ſee it, ſhall acknowledge that thou haſt prevailed, and all ſhall ſay, <hi>Behold, how he loved him!</hi>—Yet let me love thee, in ſubjection to thy love as thy redeemed captive, though I cannot reach thy meaſure.</p>
               <p>O, my ſoul, begin it here; be ſick of love now, that thou mayſt be well with love there; <hi>Keep thyſelf now in the love of God,</hi> and let neither life nor death. nor any thing ſeparate thee from it, and thou ſhalt be

                  <hi>The</hi> CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>THUS, reader, I have given thee my beſt advice for the attaining and maintaining an heavenly converſation. The manner is imperfect, and too much my own; but for the main matter, I received it from GOD. From him I deliver it thee, and his charge I lay upon thee, that thou entertain and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it. If thou canſt not do it fully, do it as thou canſt; only be ſure thou do it ſeriouſly and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If thou wilt believe a man that hath made ſome ſmall trial of it, thou ſhalt find it will make thee another man, and elevate thy ſoul, and clear thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and leave a pleaſant ſavour upon thy heart; ſo that thy own experience will make thee confeſs, that one hour thus ſpent will more effectually
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:022331_0394_0FB7EF0468FC5710"/>revive thee, than many in bare external duties; and a day in theſe contemplations will afford thee truer content, than all the glory and riches of the earth. Be acquainted with this work, and thou wilt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with GOD: thy joys will be ſpiritual and laſting; thou wilt have comfort in life, and comfort in death: when thou haſt neither wealth nor health, nor the pleaſures of this world, yet wilt thou have comfort: comfort without the preſence or help of any friend, without a miniſter, without a book, when all means are denied thee, or taken from thee, yet mayſt thou have vigorous, real comfort. Thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will be active and victorious; and the daily joy which is thus fetched from heaven, will be thy ſtrength: thou wilt be as one that ſtandeth on the top of an exceeding high mountain; he looks down on the world as if it were quite below him; how ſmall do the fields, and woods, and countries ſeem to him? cities and towns ſeem but little ſpots. Thus deſpicably wilt thou look on all things here below: the greateſt princes will ſeem but as graſhoppers, and the buſy, contentious, covetous world, but as heaps of ants. Men's threatenings will be no terror to thee; nor the honours of this world any ſtrong en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticement; temptations will be harmleſs, as having loſt their ſtrength; and afflictions leſs grievous, as having loſt their ſting; and every mercy will be better known and reliſhed.</p>
               <p>Reader, it is (under GOD) in thy own choice now, whether thou wilt live this bleſſed life or not; and whether all this pains which I have taken for thee, ſmall proſper or be loſt. If it be loſt through thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs. (which GOD forbid) thou wilt prove the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt loſer thyſelf.</p>
               <p>O man, what haſt thou to mind, but GOD and heaven? art thou not almoſt out of this world alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
<pb n="396" facs="unknown:022331_0395_0FB7EF0633EE7AB8"/>doſt thou not look every day, when one diſeaſe or other will let out thy ſoul? doth not the bier ſtand ready to carry thee to the grave? and the worms wait to feed upon thy face and heart? what if thy pulſe muſt beat a few ſtrokes more? and what if thou haſt a ſew more breaths to fetch, before thou breathe thy laſt? and what if thou haſt a few more nights to ſleep, before thou ſleep in the duſt? Alas, what will this be, when it is gone? and is it not almoſt gone alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? Shortly thou wilt ſee thy glaſs run out, and ſay thyſelf, my life is done! my time is gone! there is nothing now, but heaven or hell: where then ſhould thy heart be now, but in heaven? Didſt thou but know what a dreadful thing it is to have a doubt of heaven, when a man lies dying, it would rouſe thee up.</p>
               <p>O what a life might men live, if they were but willing and diligent! GOD would have our joys to be far more than our ſorrows; yea, he would have us to have no ſorrow, but what tendeth to joy: and no more than our ſins have made neceſſary for our good. How much do thoſe chriſtians wrong GOD and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that either make their thoughts of GOD the inlet of their ſorrows, or let theſe offered joys He by, as neglected or forgotten! Some there be that ſay, it is not worth to much time and trouble, to think of the greatneſs of the joys above. But as theſe men obey not the command of GOD, which requireth them to have their affections on things above; ſo do they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully make their own lives miſerable, by refuſing the delights that GOD hath ſet before them. And yet if this were all, it were a ſmaller matter; if it were but loſs of their comforts, I would not ſay much: but ſee what abundance of other miſchiefs follow the abſence of theſe heavenly delights.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="397" facs="unknown:022331_0321_0FB7EE0D0B78DBF0"/>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It will damp, if not deſtroy, our very love to GOD: ſo deeply as we apprehend his exceeding love to us, and his purpoſe to make us eternally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, ſo much will it raiſe our love: love to GOD and delight in him, are ſtill conjunct. They that conceive of GOD as one that deſireth their blood and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot heartily love him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It will make us have rare and unpleaſing thoughts of GOD; for our thoughts will follow our love and delight. Did we more delight in GOD than in any thing below, our thoughts would as freely run after him, as they now run from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And it will make men have as rare and unpleaſing ſpeech of GOD; for who will care for talking of that which he hath no delight in? What makes men ſtill talking of worldlineſs or wickedneſs, but that theſe are more pleaſant to them than GOD?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Men will have no delight in the ſervice of GOD, when they have no delight in GOD, nor any ſweet thoughts of heaven, which is the end of their ſervices. No wonder if ſuch chriſtians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that they are ſtill backward to duty; that they have no delight in prayer, in ſacraments, or in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture itſelf: if thou couldſt once delight in GOD, thou wouldſt eaſily delight in duty; eſpecially that which bringeth thee into the neareſt converſe with him; but till then, no wonder if thou be weary of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This want of heavenly delight will leave men under the power of every affliction; they will have nothing to comfort them, and eaſe them in their ſufferings, but the empty, ineffectual pleaſures of the fleſh; and when that is gone, where then is their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="398" facs="unknown:022331_0397_0FB7EF13CC812FE8"/>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It will make them fearful and unwilling to die: for who would go to a GOD, or a place that he hath no delight in? Or who would leave his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure here, except it were to go to better? But if men take delight in GOD whilſt they live, they will not tremble at the tidings of death.</p>
               <p>If GOD would perſuade you now to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of this duty, and help you in it by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed influence of his Spirit, you would not change your lives with the greateſt prince on earth. But I am afraid, if I may judge of your hearts by the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of my own, that it will prove a hard thing to perſuade you to the work. Pardon my jealouſy; it is raiſed upon too many and ſad experiments. What ſay you? Do you reſolve on this heavenly courſe or no? Will you let go all your ſinful pleaſures, and daily ſeek theſe higher delights? I pray thee, reader, conſider of it, and reſolve on the work before thou goeſt further. Let thy family perceive, let thy neighbours perceive, let thy conſcience perceive, yea, let GOD perceive it, that thou art a man that haſt thy converſation in heaven. GOD hath now offered to be thy daily delight; thy neglect is thy refuſal. Take heed what thou doſt: refuſe this, and refuſe all: thou muſt have heavenly delights, or none that are laſting. GOD is willing thou ſhouldſt daily walk with him, and fetch in conſolation from the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fountain: if thou be unwilling, bear the loſs; and when thou lieſt dying, then ſeek for comfort where thou canſt. O how is the unſeen GOD neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the unſeen glory forgotten! and all for want of that <hi>faith which is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things that are not ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for you whoſe hearts GOD hath weaned from all things here below, I hope you will fetch one walk daily in the new <hi>Jeruſalem!</hi> GOD is your love, and
<pb n="399" facs="unknown:022331_0398_0FB7EF17156445C8"/>your deſire; and I know you would fain be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your Saviour, and I know it is your grief that your hearts are not more near him; and that they do no more paſſionately love and delight in him. As ever you would enjoy your deſires, try this life of meditation on your everlaſting reſt.</p>
               <p>O thou, the merciful Father of ſpirits, the attractive of love, and ocean of delights, draw up theſe droſſy hearts unto thyſelf, and keep them there till they are ſpiritualized and refined, and ſecond theſe thy ſervant's weak endeavours, and perſuade thoſe that read theſe lines, to the practice of this delightful, heavenly work. O ſuffer not the ſoul of thy moſt unworthy ſervant to be a ſtranger to thoſe joys which he unfoldeth to thy people, or to be ſeldom in that way which he hath mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to others; but O keep me while I tarry on this earth, in daily, ſerious breathings after thee, and in a believing, affectionate walking with thee; and when thou comeſt, O let me be found ſo doing, not hiding my talent, nor ſerving my fleſh, nor yet aſleep with my lamp unfurniſhed, but waiting and longing for my LORD'S return: that thoſe who ſhall read theſe direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may not reap only the fruit of my ſtudies, but the breathings of my active hope and love: that if my heart were open to their view, they might there read the ſame moſt deeply engraven with a beam from the face of the Son of GOD; and not find vanity or luſt, or pride within, where the words of life appear without; that ſo theſe lines may not witneſs againſt me; but proceeding from the heart of the writer, may be effectual through thy grace upon the heart of the reader, and ſo be the ſavour of life to both.</p>
               <p>GLORY <hi>be to</hi> GOD <hi>in the higheſt: on earth peace: good-will towards men.</hi>
