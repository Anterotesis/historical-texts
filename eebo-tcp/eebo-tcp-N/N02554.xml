            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>IT was very pleaſing unto me, to obſerve ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral a Deſire amongſt you, that a Monthly-Lecture might be preached in this Town: I was glad when ye ſaid unto me, let us go into the houſe of the Lord. And your Attendence of ſuch a religious Exerciſe, hath been hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common and exemplary. I hope that you find God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to be profitable for all things, having the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. It is at the Requeſt of many of you, and with an aim at the Good of all your Souls, that theſe Diſcourſes are made ſo public. I am very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that they are far below the dignity of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects treated of; and if they ſhou'd (as moſt probably they will in this critical Age) be cenſured as weak and mean, I ſhall not blame any for being of my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: But I truſt that you, to whom theſe Sermons were acceptable when preached, will read them with Candor, and a ſuitable concern that ye may be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby. I ſend them abroad in a plain Country-Dreſs, it being ſuch as I could afford them, and which will be moſt agreable to thoſe on whom I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend to give them Entertainment. You receive them from the Preſs, in the ſame words that you had them from the Pulpit. — The ſeaſonableneſs of theſe Diſcourſes, cannot (I think) be juſtly excepted againſt. The Contempt of the glorious Goſpel is doubtleſs the moſt provoking Evil of the Times, and is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of all thoſe Sins, for which the righteous GOD hath a Controverſy with our Land: An Eſſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to raiſe in us due Tho'ts of the Excellency of the Goſpel, will not be judged needleſs. While we are contemplating &amp; adoring the Glory of GOD, which he hath diſcover'd in his late remarkable &amp; amazing works of Providence, we ſhou'd not over-look, nor be unaffected with that brighter Diſplay of it, which there is in the Goſpel. GOD's ſaving manifeſtation of himſelf, is not to be expected in his providential
<pb facs="unknown:003029_0003_0FEFAE966AAE48E8"/>
Diſpenſations, ordinary or extraordinary, nor in the Terrors of the Law, but in the Glaſs of his Goſpel. The Lord was not in the wind, nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire, but in the ſtill ſmall voice, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.11, 12.</p>
                  <p>THE Voice of GOD, which is full of majeſty, from the deep places of the Earth, hath awaken'd many to give the more earneſt Heed to his ſweet &amp; gracious Voice, ſpeaking from Heaven in the Goſpel of CHRIST; and by the latter more than the former, is their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion (which we hope is real) effected. There are many excellent Sermons lately publiſh'd, to teach &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us rightly to conſider &amp; improve the terrible Works of GOD: and a Diſcourſe concerning the Glory of the Goſpel, may alſo, by the divine Bleſſing, ſerve to promote the Reformation, which is ſo earneſtly prayed &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd for.—Altho', to our ſhame &amp; ſorrow it muſt be ſaid, there hath not been that noiſe &amp; ſhaking among the dry bones here, which there hath been in other places under the late awful Diſpenſations, yet ſome (I hope) have been awakened to flee from wrath: and that they might continue to run well, and not look back, I have put them in remembrance of <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife.</p>
                  <p>THESE Sermons I dedicate unto you, my beloved People, and wiſh they might be profitable to your Souls, for which I will very gladly ſpend, and be ſpent.</p>
                  <p>I rejoyce in the Lord, that your Care of me hath flouriſhed, in the proviſion ye have made for my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Support, ever ſince I have been in the work of the Miniſtry amongſt you. And I ſpeak it to your praiſe, that I have not been neceſſitated to ask for any mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; but what ye have done towards it, ye have done of your own accord, as ſenſible that a Miniſter is not to live on the Alms of his People, but that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer is worthy of his Hire. —There is one thing I need, and do now ask of you, <hi>to wit,</hi> Your more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayers unto GOD for me, that he would make me an able and faithful Miniſter of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that after I have preached to you in Chriſt's Name, I may not (as there is great danger that I ſhall) periſh eternally in his wrath. — Brethren pray for me, that the Word of the Lord may have free Courſe amongſt us, and be glorified.</p>

                  <p>THE Sovereignty and Power of divine Grace were marvellouſly diſplay'd in the Converſion of <hi>Paul,</hi> who before was a furious Perſecutor of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt. And the Grace of God which was beſtowed on him, was not in vain;</hi> for He <hi>laboured more abundantly than all his Fellow-workers unto the Kingdom.</hi> And GOD highly honoured Him, in propagating &amp; promoting <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in the World, more by his Miniſtry than any other Man's. The ſhining Gifts &amp; extraordinary Succeſs of this great <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> drew upon him the envious Hatred of <hi>falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> who maliciouſly endeavour'd to blaſt his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and obſtruct his Uſefulneſs. This oblig'd him to ſpeak much in his own vindication: which He did,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003029_0005_0FEFAE9A682D89A8"/>
not out of Arrogance and Oſtentation, but a ſincere reſpect to the Glory of GOD, and the Good of the Church. <hi>Do we begin again</hi> (ſaith he in the firſt verſe of this Chapter) <hi>to commend our ſelves? or need we as ſome others, Epiſtles of commendation to you, or Letters of commendation from you.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks in the plural Number, becauſe He wrote not only in his own, but alſo in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Name to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> He had begun again in the preceding Chapter to commend himſelf, by declaring his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as he had done in his <hi>firſt Epiſtle</hi> to them. But here he ſeems to Check himſelf for it; and tells them, that he needed, not as <hi>others</hi> (meaning <hi>falſe Apoſtles</hi> &amp; <hi>Teachers</hi>) commendatory Letters to them or from them: For they themſelves, in regard of the Succeſs of his Miniſtry amongſt them, were a <hi>living Epiſtle,</hi> that might ſufficiently recommend him to them, and to all other Churches. <hi>Ye are our Epiſtle written in our hearts, known and read of all men.</hi> As if he had ſaid, You that have been Converted by my preaching, are a commendatory Epiſtle, which I carry about in my heart, having always a thankful and dear Remembrance of you, and which may ſatisfy all that have heard of your Faith and Obedience, that I am a true Apoſtle and faithful Miniſter of JESUS CHRIST. And he thus ſtrongly proves that they were ſuch an Epiſtle. <hi>Foraſmuch as ye are manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt miniſtred by us, written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the living GOD, not in Tables of ſtone, but in fleſhly Tables of the heart.</hi> Their holy Converſation declar'd them to be the Epiſtle of CHRIST. By them CHRIST ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified his Mind and Will to others, as a Man doth his by a Letter. They were a living Rule, ſhewing by their Actions how all ought to walk. JESUS CHRIST with his Spirit, that accompanied the Apoſtle's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, did make ſaving Impreſſions on their Hearts; wrote his Law, not on Tables of Stone, but fleſhly Tables, the Hearts of Believers. <hi>And ſuch Truſt have we through Chriſt to God-ward.</hi> The Apoſtle was humbly confident, that GOD had thus bleſſed
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003029_0006_0FEFAE9C51F88278"/>
his Miniſtry to them. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves: but our ſufficiency is of God. Paul</hi> acknowledgeth that He was ſo far from being the Author of the good Work in the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Chriſtians, that He could not of himſelf ſo much as <hi>think.</hi> A Man cannot think any thing without the Influence of divine Providence, and he cannot think a good Thought without the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of divine Grace. Every Act is from GOD, as he is the <hi>GOD of Nature,</hi> and the Goodneſs of any Act is from Him, as He is the <hi>GOD of all Grace.</hi> The Apoſtle was very careful not to exalt himſelf, when he was <hi>magnifying his Office. Our ſufficiency</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is of GOD: who alſo hath made us able Miniſters of the New Teſtament.</hi> i. e. The Goſpel, called a Teſtament, becauſe it is a free &amp; firm Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Mediator's good things unto the Heirs of Salvation, to be poſſeſſed by them according to his <hi>Will;</hi> and the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> in regard of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Promiſes of thoſe good things under the <hi>Law.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> having thus aſcribed unto GOD, the Praiſe of all his Ability for and Succeſs in the <hi>Work of the Miniſtry,</hi> He proves the Dignity of his Office by drawing a Compariſon between the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and ſhewing how the latter did exceed the former in <hi>Glory.</hi> By ſeveral Arguments he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates the ſurpaſſing Excellency of the Goſpel; and in our <hi>Text</hi> declares that the Law, altho' glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in it ſelf, and the manner of it's delivery, yet compar'd with the Goſpel, hath no Glory at all: like as the Glory of the Stars diſappears at the riſing of the Sun. <hi>For even that which was made glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, had no glory in this reſpect, by reaſon of the glory that excelleth.</hi>

Prophet: but <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by <hi>whom the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel at firſt began to be ſpoken,</hi> did infinitely excel Him. The <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was promiſed of old, as a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet like unto Moſes,</hi> Deut. 18.15. He did in many reſpects ſignally reſemble <hi>Moſes:</hi> but this don't im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that <hi>he</hi> was not in all ſuperior to him. CHRIST was not only like to <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s chiefeſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, but He alſo infinitely ſurpaſſed him. Heb. 3.3. <hi>This Man was counted worthy of more glory than Moſes. Moſes</hi> was but a <hi>Man, Chriſt</hi> was GOD as well as <hi>Man: Moſes</hi> was not without Sin, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from Sinners: Moſes</hi> was only a Servant, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was alſo <hi>the Son of GOD.</hi> When <hi>Moſes</hi> came down from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> bringing the <hi>two Tables of Teſtimony,</hi> his Face ſhone with a dazling Glory, Exod. 34.30. <hi>When Aaron and all the Children of Iſrael ſaw Moſes, behold, the skin of his Face ſhone, and they were afraid to come nigh him.</hi> This is mention'd in our Context, <hi>v.</hi> 7. as one thing which made the Law glorious; <hi>The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Death written and ingraven in ſtones, was glorious, ſo that the Children of Iſrael could not ſtedfaſtly behold the Face of Moſes, for the Glory of his Countenance.</hi> The Luſtre ſpread on the Face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was an evidence to the Jews, of the <hi>GOD of Glory's</hi> ſending him to publiſh the <hi>Law</hi> unto them. But <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> far excel'd <hi>Moſes</hi> in the viſible Glory wherewith his Face did ſhine, when GOD, by a voice from Heaven, declar'd him to be his Son, by whom he would ſpeak, and unto whom Men ſhou'd hearken. <hi>Moſes</hi> in all his Glory, was not arrayed with ſuch Splendor as <hi>Chriſt</hi> was, at his ſolemn Inveſtiture into his Office. <hi>When Jeſus was baptized, Heaven was opened</hi> to pour down it's Glory on him: <hi>and the holy Ghoſt deſcended in a bodily ſhape, like a Dove upon him,</hi> Luk. 3.21, 22. The holy Ghoſt is incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, but he then aſſumed a bodily viſible Shape, and doubtleſs one that was very bright and glorious. Some think, that it cannot be concluded from what the Scripture ſaith concerning the holy Ghoſt's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he appeared in the form of a Dove:
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003029_0009_0FEFAEA6DC9477A0"/>
But ſuppoſe that he aſſum'd a Body of Light, or Fire, and therein came down, in ſuch like manner as a <hi>Dove,</hi> with it's Wings ſpread forth, and gathering about our SAVIOUR'S Head cover'd and crown'd it with a viſibly Glory. But why may we not, according to the Letter of the Scripture, conceive that the bodily Shape in which the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> deſcended on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was that of a Dove, intimating the Dove-like Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the <hi>harmleſs</hi> JESUS? And yet, we have reaſon to believe that it was in ſome luminous form, ſome extraordinary appearance of Light, that the holy Ghoſt came down on our Saviour. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Baptiſm ſaith, that there was a Fire lighted in the River <hi>Jordan.</hi> "By which it appears, that it was an early Tradition in the Church, that the Water, immediately after <hi>Chriſt</hi> was baptized in it, ſeem'd to be all on Fire by the Reflection of that bright and flaming appearance, in which the holy Ghoſt deſcended upon him". And at his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration on Mount <hi>Tabor, His Face did ſhine as the Sun, and his Raiment was white as the Light,</hi> Mat. 27.2. His Face did ſhine as the Sun in it's meridian Brightneſs, and his Raiment was like the whitneſs of a flaſh of Lightning. The three Diſciples that were with <hi>Chriſt</hi> on the Mount, were afraid and aſtoniſhed at the ſight, as <hi>Aaron</hi> and the Iſraelites were at the ſight of the Glory on <hi>Moſes's</hi> Face. The <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> which <hi>Chriſt received from GOD the Father,</hi> at his Baptiſm and Transfiguration, was too great to be communicated to any but the <hi>Son of GOD;</hi> It was therefore the Sign, by which <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt knew him to be the true <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and upon which he groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Teſtimony concerning him, Joh. 1.33, 34. <hi>I know him not: but he that ſent me to baptize with water; the ſame ſaid unto me, upon whom thou ſhalt ſee he Spirit deſcending and remaining on him, the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

the <hi>Son of GOD:</hi> Such Glory wou'd not be imparted to any other. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, who was an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs of the Glory ſhed on <hi>Chriſt</hi> at his Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and probably of that at his Baptiſm alſo, doth partly with reference thereunto ſay, Joh. 1.14. <hi>We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father.</hi> The Glory was ſuch as became him, who was the only begotten Son of GOD: It was queſtionleſs therefore a Glory far ſurpaſſing that on the Face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he brought down the Law from <hi>Sinai. Jeſus Chriſt</hi> muſt be infinitely more glorious than <hi>Moſes,</hi> being the <hi>Brightneſs of God's glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> Heb. 1.3. <hi>In him dwelt all the fulneſs of the</hi> infinite <hi>Godhead bodily,</hi> and from him did it ſhine forth <hi>in the Days of his Fleſh,</hi> he being the Effulgence of his <hi>Father's Glory. Moſes</hi> was not <hi>more than a Prophet, John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt was, and among them that are born of Women, there aroſe not a greater than <hi>John;</hi> yet he counted himſelf not worthy to do the meanneſt Office for CHRIST, to be the leaſt and loweſt of his Attendants, Luke 3.16. —<hi>One mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whoſe Shoes I am not worthy to unlooſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THUS, in reſpect of the Glory which the Law and Goſpel receive from the ſhining Excellencies of the firſt Publiſhers thereof, the latter doth abundantly exceed the former in Glory.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>THE Goſpel is more glorious than the Law in regard of the</hi> Circumſtances <hi>which attended the Promulgation of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE Law was made glorious by the manner of it's delivery. When the LORD came down on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> holy Angels were the Chariots of his Glory, He rode upon Cherubims, and there was an illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Appearance of Myriads of them, Pſal. 68.17. <hi>The Chariots of God are twenty thouſand, even thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Angels: the Lord is among them as in Sinai, in the holy place.</hi> The Mount was altogether on a ſmoke, becauſe the LORD deſcended upon it in Fire: and the ſmoke thereof aſcended as the ſmoke of a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003029_0011_0FEFAEAAF5F80270"/>
and the whole Mount quaked greatly: <hi>Sinai</hi> was moved at the Preſence of the GOD of Iſrael. There was the ſound of a Trumpet, long and loud; the noiſe of Thunders, and the voice of Words, very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying. The glorious manner in which GOD gave the Law on <hi>Sinai,</hi> is elegantly ſet forth by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Hab. 3.3, 4. <hi>GOD came from Teman, and the holy One from Mount Paran, Selah. His Glory covered the Heavens, and the Earth was full of his Praiſe,</hi> or Splendor. <hi>And his brightneſs was as the light, he had horns,</hi> or bright Beams, <hi>coming out of his hand:</hi> "Rays of Glory were darted forth around Him" With ſuch Tokens of Majeſty was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the Law attended. But, altho' there was leſs Terror, yet there was not leſs Glory in the Circumſtances which accompanied the firſt Publication of the Goſpel. It was uſher'd in, by Angel's decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and celebrating the Birth of JESUS, that Horn of Salvation which GOD promis'd to raiſe up unto his People, in the Houſe of his Servant <hi>David.</hi> The poor <hi>Shepherds</hi> at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> ſaw as great <hi>Glory</hi> there, and as bright an Apparition of Angels, as the Iſraelites did at <hi>Sinai,</hi> and heard more glorious Words, Luke 2.9, 10, 11. <hi>Lo, the Angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord ſhone round about them; and they were ſore afraid. And the Angel ſaid unto them, fear not, for behold, I bring you good tydings of great Joy, which ſhall be to all people, for unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour; which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> ver. 13, 14. <hi>And ſuddenly there was with the Angel, a multitude of the heavenly hoſt, praiſing God, and ſaying, Glory to God in the higheſt, and on Earth peace, good will towards Men.</hi> — A glorious Lamp was lighted in the aetherial Heaven, an extraordinary Star appeared, to give notice to the World of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Matth. 2.1, 2. <hi>Now when Jeſus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king: behold, there came wiſe men from the Eaſt to Jeruſalem, ſaying, where is He that is born king of the Jews? for we have ſeen his Star in the Eaſt, and are come to worſhip

him.</hi> — Was there not more Glory deriv'd on the Goſpel, from what was done and ſaid at <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Baptiſm and Transfiguration, than there was on the Law, from all that Majeſty and awful Pomp that Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was cover'd with? What a glorious Scene was it, for Heaven to open, and the holy Ghoſt viſibly to deſcend on <hi>Chriſt</hi> to array Him with a daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Splendor, and ſuch a voice to come from the <hi>excellent Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye Him?</hi> Was there any Brightneſs at <hi>Sinai,</hi> comparable to that on Mount <hi>Tabor?</hi> or any Voice ſo glorious? — And in order to the more full and extenſive Publication of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, by the Apoſtles of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Deſcent of the holy Ghoſt upon them, at the Feaſt of Pentecoſt (the ſame time of the Year, that the Law was given at <hi>Sinai)</hi> was a thing which equal'd, if not exceeded in glory, any Circumſtance which attended the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the Law. There was indeed no Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, nor terrifying Voice, no Thunder, Darkneſs nor Tempeſt, but <hi>a ſound from Heaven, as of a ruſhing mighty Wind, and it filled all the Houſe where the Apoſtles were ſitting;</hi> and there was the Appearance of bright flames of Fire, cleaving aſunder; and in the form of Tongues reſting on the Heads of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and they ſpake all Languages to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of multitudes who were then preſent, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. So that the publication of the Goſpel was graced with as remarkable and glorious Circumſtances, as that of the Law. It might alſo, under this Head, be ſhown, How the Miracles which attended the publication of the Goſpel, thro' <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s and his Apoſtle's time on Earth, did, both in number and greatneſs, far exceed thoſe which accompanied the Promulgation of the Law. <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> did not, all of them do, ſo many, nor ſuch mighty Works, as <hi>JESUS of Nazareth</hi> did. How <hi>great</hi> muſt that <hi>Salvation</hi> be, how glorious that Goſpel, <hi>which at firſt began to be ſpoken,</hi> and was thus proved by the Lord, <hi>and was</hi> afterwards <hi>confirmed</hi> likewiſe <hi>by them that heard him; GOD bearing them witneſs, both with Signs and Wonders,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003029_0013_0FEFAEB0E7E64778"/>
and with diverſe Miracles, and gifts of the holy Ghoſt, according to his will?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>THE Goſpel is more glorious than the Law, in reſpect of its revealing the Glory of GOD ſo much more clearly and fully, than the Law doth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE Goſpel exceeds the Law, not only in an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental or adventitious, but alſo an intrinſick Glory. The Law was not only made glorious in the Eyes of the Children of Iſrael, by the dignity of the Perſon and luſtre on the face of Moſes, by whom it came, and the manner of its delivery, but it was glorious in it ſelf; being a <hi>Revelation</hi> from GOD of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies to his Creatures, and his Will concerning them: But the Goſpel is more glorious in it ſelf, being a clearer, and more compleat <hi>Revelation</hi> of GOD'S Glory. This is hinted by the Apoſtle in our Context, where he is ſhewing how the Goſpel exceeds the Law in Glory, v. 18. <hi>But we all with open face, beholding as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord. Moſes</hi> put a Vail over his Face, when he came down from the Mount, that ſo all the Glory of his Countenance might not be ſeen, might not this repreſent GOD'S concealing from the Jewiſh People much of his Glory, which was afterwards to be manifeſted? v. 13. <hi>Moſes put a Vail over his face, that the Children of Iſrael could not ſtedfaſtly look to the end of that which is aboliſhed.</hi> They had but an obſcure View of the Myſtery of CHRIST, which was vailed under the Types and Shadows of the Ceremonial Law; like as the Glory on the face of Moſes was vailed. v. 14 <hi>But their Minds were blinded: for until this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth the ſame vail untaken away, in the reading of the Old Teſtament: which vail is done away in Chriſt.</hi> The vail of outward Shadows and Types was removed, by <hi>Chriſt's</hi> coming into the World: for then the Prefigurations, Propheſies and Promiſes of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> were fulfilled, and the Glory of GOD in our Redemption by <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to be clearly ſeen: But the vail of ſpiritual Blindneſs on the Minds and Hearts of the Jews, which was alſo myſtically
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003029_0014_0FEFAEB45FB22E78"/>
ſignified by the Vail upon the face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> remains to this day in their reading the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which hinders them from diſcovering the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to be already come, and that the Types and Propheſies are accompliſhed in him. <hi>But we all with open face,</hi> all we who believe have the Vail removed from us, ſo that <hi>with open face</hi> we <hi>behold the Glory of the Lord as in a Glaſs, i. e.</hi> in the Goſpel, which is as a Glaſs, not a Perſpective thro' which things afar off are darkly ſeen, but a Looking-glaſs fully repreſenting the face as near. <hi>The Glory of the Lord,</hi> which was vail'd and cover'd under the Types and Shadows of the <hi>Law,</hi> is now by the <hi>Goſpel</hi> clearly revealed. And how Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians do in the Goſpel, as it is a Glaſs, ſee the <hi>Glory of GOD,</hi> the Apoſtle telleth us, 2 Cor. 4.6. <hi>For GOD who Commanded the light to ſhine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath ſhined in our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of GOD, in face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> By the face of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in which the Glory of GOD is ſeen, the Apoſtle ſeems to allude to that divine Luſtre with which the Face of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhone, when he came down from Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> So that his meaning may be this, That as the Children of Iſrael with their bodily Eyes ſaw ſomething of GOD'S Glory ſhining in the Face of <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſo they the Diſciples of our Saviour, did more clearly with the Eyes of their enlightned Underſtandings behold the divine Glory in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe Face the Glaſs of the Goſpel repreſented to them. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>brightneſs of God's Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon.</hi> There is no Perfection in GOD, which is not in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> is GOD. And in that Glaſs wherein we ſee the Face of <hi>Chriſt</hi> who is thus the Image of GOD, we behold the Glory of GOD; and in the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt is more clearly revealed. By the Law Men might diſcern, as it were GOD'S <hi>Back-parts.</hi> As He ſaid unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> who beſeeched the LORD to ſhew him his Glory, Exod. 33.23. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee my back-parts: but my Face ſhall not be ſeen:</hi> But in the Goſpel we may ſee the <hi>Face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Face of</hi> GOD;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003029_0015_0FEFAEB71B958218"/>
for CHRIST is the adequate and eſſential <hi>Image</hi> of GOD. The knowledge of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo of GOD'S Glory, which could be obtain'd by the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> was ſmall, compar'd with that which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> affords; and did not the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> expound the <hi>Old,</hi> wou'd not the <hi>Vail on the face of Moſes,</hi> as to us, <hi>remain untaken away.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>THE Glory of divine</hi> Mercy <hi>ſhining in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt, it clearly diſplayed by the Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>GOD'S Goodneſs is his Glory; and this is moſt clearly and fully revealed in the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> the ſum of which is, <hi>that God is in Chriſt, reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes unto them.</hi> The <hi>moral Law</hi> diſcovers nothing of GOD'S Mercy toward ſinful Creatures: and the <hi>ceremonial Law</hi> had only a <hi>ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of the things:</hi> It contain'd a dark and imperfect, not a lively and full Repreſentation of thoſe <hi>good things,</hi> which the <hi>Mercy</hi> of GOD deſigned for miſerable Sinners. The Myſtery of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which the Goſpel reveals, was under the legal Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrapped up in Types, Ceremonies, and obſcure Propheſies and Promiſes. The Goſpel, the <hi>Preaching of Jeſus Chriſt is the revelation of the myſtery, which was kept ſecret ſince the world began,</hi> Rom. 16.25. The Riches of Grace, the unſearchable Riches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were, in a great meaſure hid, before the Goſpel open'd them; ſo that as the Prophet, and after him, the Apoſtle ſaid concerning the ſame, <hi>Eye had not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither had entred into the Heart of Man, the things which God hath prepared for them that Love him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>THE Glory of divine</hi> Wiſdom, <hi>ſhining in the face of Jeſus Chriſt is eminently diſplayed in the Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>WHEN the Bowels of GOD'S Mercy were troubled for us, the Mouth of his Juſtice was opened againſt us miſerable Sinners. Juſtice demanded the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

Deſtruction of Guilty, and therefore defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly accurſed Creatures; and back'd it's Demand with powerful Arguments, taken from the Holineſs of GOD, and his Veracity in his Threatnings: And <hi>Mercy</hi>'s Pleas for the Salvation of the miſerable Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, were ſo importunate, that GOD would not reject them. Therefore he employ'd his infinite <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in the Counſel of Peace between the Father and the Son, to contrive a Method of Redemption, in which theſe Attributes ſhou'd harmonize, Juſtice and Mercy kiſs each other, and be glorified together.

Nations, Pſal. 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto Jacob, his ſtatutes and his Judgments unto Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with any Nation: and as for his Judgments, they have not known them.</hi> The Legal Deſpenſation was reſtrained to that People, whom the LORD Choſe to be a ſpecial People unto himſelf, above all that were upon the face of the Earth. <hi>To the Iſraelites pertained the Adoption, and the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of GOD, and the 'Promiſes,</hi> Rom. 9.4. The Law <hi>of Commandments contained in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> was a <hi>Wall of Partition,</hi> that fenced the Jewiſh Nation, and ſever'd, them from others, making them GOD'S Sacred Incloſure, into which the Gentiles ſhould not come, to partake of the Privileges of the <hi>Church.</hi> The Ceremonial Law is ſtiled the <hi>Enmity,</hi> being the cauſe and ſign of Enmity between <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> keeping them at a diſtance from one another. Thus the <hi>Law</hi> was confined within nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Bounds; was directed and reſtrained to the Uſe of one Nation, and that the <hi>feweſt of all People.</hi> But the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is a Diſpenſation, in it's Nature, and in it's Author's Deſign, general: or ſuch as reſpects Mankind, without any diſtinction of Nation. There is no Monopoly of it's Privileges. It is proportion'd to the need, and ordain'd for the benefit of Men of all Nations and Conditions. The Goſpel is (as the angelical Preacher ſaid) <hi>Good tydings of great Joy, which ſhall be to all people,</hi> Luke 2.10. <hi>The Grace of God,</hi> i.e. The Goſpel <hi>that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all Men,</hi> Tit. 2.11. Chriſt <hi>hath broken down the middle wall of partition between</hi> Jews and Gentiles; <hi>Having aboliſhed in his fleſh the enmity, even the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances: and came and preached Peace,</hi> i. e. The Goſpel of Peace, <hi>to them which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</hi> The Gentiles <hi>therefore are no more Strangers and Foreigners, but fellow Citizens with the Saints and of the houſhold of God,</hi> Eph. 2. Now a general Revelation intended and granted for the benefit of all, is more glorious than that which was particular, or reſtrained to one People.

That Glory excelleth, which is not only in it ſelf brighter, but alſo in it's extent ſpread further, than another Glory; and ſuch is the Glory of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> compar'd with that of the <hi>Law.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> was as a <hi>Lamp</hi> which illuminates one Room: The <hi>Goſpel</hi> is as the <hi>Sun, whoſe going forth is from one end of the Heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it,</hi> diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a univerſal Light. And ſurely the glory of the <hi>Sun,</hi> in this reſpect, far ſurpaſſeth that of a burning Lamp, and as much doth the Glory of the Goſpel that of the Law.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. <hi>THE Goſpel is more glorious than the Law, becauſe it is the</hi> miniſtration of the Spirit.</p>

Becauſe the Spirit of GOD accompanies the Diſpenſation of it, much more than it did that of the Law. By means of the Goſpel Perſons receive the <hi>holy Spirit;</hi> Gal. 3.2. <hi>This only would I learn of you, received ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> By the <hi>works of the Law,</hi> we are here to underſtand the doctrine of Juſtification by the Works of the Law, which the <hi>Judazing Teachers</hi> preached: and by the <hi>hearing</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> is meant the Doctrine of the Goſpel; hearing being put for the thing heard, and Faith for the Doctrine believed: By the hearing of Faith, and not by the Works of the Law is the Spirit received. It is true, that under the Law GOD beſtowed his Spirit on his Servants, Neh. 9.20. <hi>Thou gaveſt alſo thy good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to inſtruct them.</hi> But the holy Spirit is more plentifully granted under the <hi>Evangelical,</hi> than it was under the <hi>Legal</hi> Diſpenſation. The gift of the Spirit, in the largeſt meaſures of it, was reſerv'd for the Glory of Goſpel-times. GOD often promiſed, that in the Day of Goſpel-light he wou'd <hi>pour out his Spirit:</hi> This Phraſe imports his beſtowing of it plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully.

Under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that Promiſe, <hi>I will pour out my Spirit on all Fleſh,</hi> is fulfill'd, Acts 2.16, 17. "There were ſome ſprinklings of it under the law, and confin'd to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Nation, but now ſhowers are poured down upon all Nations, to make them fruitful in good Works". On this account the Goſpel is far more glorious than the Law, as the Apoſtle argueth in our Context, Ver. 7, 8. <hi>If the miniſtration of death</hi> (i. e. the Law) <hi>written and ingraven in ſtones was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous — How ſhall not the miniſtration of the Spirit be rather glorious?</hi>

Idolatry &amp; Superſtition every where prevailed. But by the Preaching of the Goſpel, the <hi>Devil's</hi> Kingdom was ſhaken, and he loſt that great Power which he before had in the World. Luke 10.17, 18. <hi>The ſeventy returned again with joy, ſaying, Lord, even the Devils are ſubject unto us, thro' thy name. And he ſaid unto them, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Satan as Lightning fall from Heaven.</hi> Our Saviour in this Expreſſion, might allude unto Satan's firſt Fall from Heaven; when of an Angel of Light he became a Spirit of Darkneſs, and was in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment caſt down from his glorious Seat in Heaven: So by the Preaching of the Goſpel he ſhou'd be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Throne which he had uſurped on Earth, and fall from his great Power in the World, as Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flaſheth &amp; vaniſheth away ſuddenly &amp; irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.

With that <hi>Rod of his Strength</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſent out of <hi>Zion,</hi> he deſtroyed the <hi>Works of the Devil,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.4. <hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty thro' God, to the pulling down of ſtrong Holds.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Warfare againſt <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> was ſpiritual, the Weapons they uſed were not carnal, yet mighty thro' GOD: They atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved glorious Conqueſts, but not by the edge of the Sword, or ſtratagems of War: The Goſpel was, thro' GOD the mighty and effectual Weapon, with which they batter'd the Devil's Fortreſſes, and over-turn'd his Dominion. The Goſpel prevail'd againſt the Learning of Philoſophers, and Power of Earthly Kings, and gloriouſly triumph'd over all the Oppoſition

The <hi>ſtrong Holds</hi> which he hath erected in the Souls of Men, blindneſs of Mind, hardneſs of Heart, ſtubbornneſs of Will, and the like, are demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Goſpel, as gloriouſly as were the falſe Religions, Idolatries and Superſtitions, which he had ſet up in the World. Luke 11.21, 22. <hi>When a ſtrong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace. But when a ſtronger than he ſhall come upon him, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003029_0022_0FEFAECEB39F2DF0"/>
overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he truſted, and divideth his ſpoil. Satan</hi> is the ſtrong Man armed, the Heart of every uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Sinner is his Garriſon which he keeps ſhut up, and barred again CHRIST, by unreaſonable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, carnal Inclinations and worldly Intereſts; but the <hi>King of Glory,</hi> by his Spirit in the Goſpel, comes upon, and caſts out the ſtrong Man armed, ſtorms and takes his Fort, and converteth it into a <hi>holy Temple.</hi> Upon the <hi>white Horſe</hi> of the pure Word of Truth, the mighty Redeemer ſtill <hi>rideth forth conquering, and to conquer,</hi> Rev. 6.2. By means of the Goſpel Perſons are <hi>turned from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and not the Law, is the Inſtrumental Cauſe of ſaving Converſion, Cont. ver. 8. <hi>The Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.</hi> The moral Law revealing Man's Duty, and denouncing GOD'S Wrath againſt Him for not performing it, <hi>killeth:</hi> It makes Sin to revive in the Conſcience, and the guilty to dye. It only ſheweth Sinners that they are <hi>dead Men,</hi> being condemned already; and diſcovers to them no poſſible way of eſcaping the Curſe, and offers no Grace, no ſupernatural Strength unto them to enable them to get out of the State of Nature. <hi>But the Spirit giveth Life:</hi> The Goſpel which is called the <hi>Spirit quickeneth</hi> thoſe who are <hi>dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.</hi> Spiritual Life is infuſed by means of the Goſpel: The holy Ghoſt uſeth it as his Inſtrument in quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of dead Souls, Converting of ſinful Men, Joh. 5.25. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> CHRIST'S voice in the Goſpel raiſeth the ſpiritually dead. The beginning and progreſs of Converſion is by means of the Goſpel; the whole conformity of the Soul unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> is wrought thereby; as the Apoſtle ſheweth in our Context, Ver. 18. <hi>We all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image; from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> The fight of the

LORD'S Glory in the Glaſs of the Goſpel, is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming; Changeth the Soul into the Image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of CHRIST. The Spirit of GOD worketh a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Change in the Heart of a Sinner, by giving him a clear view of CHRIST'S Glory, as the Goſpel repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it. And the holy Ghoſt carries on the work of Sanctification in Believers, by enabling them to ſee more and more of the LORD'S Glory in that Glaſs: They are changed into his Image, <hi>from Glory to Glory;</hi> that is, from one degree of Grace to another, until they arrive to the perfection of Holineſs. All the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of our conformity to CHRIST are ſtiled Glory; the firſt and loweſt degree of Grace is Glory begun, and the higheſt is Glory perfected. Believers ſee the Glory of the Lord in the Goſpel, and are changed into the ſame Image, <hi>from Glory to Glory;</hi> that is, (as one conceiveth from the alluſion to a Glaſs) "The Glory of the Lord ſhining upon the Goſpel, and from the Goſpel ſhining upon our Hearts, doth Change them into the Image of the ſame Glory; even as the Glory of the Sun ſhining upon a Glaſs, and from that Glaſs reflecting on a Wall, doth therein produce an Image of it's own light." Thus it is by the Goſpel that a ſaving Change is wrought in the Soul. This Glory is peculiar to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. It is ſaid indeed, that <hi>the Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. But by the <hi>Law</hi> here, as in many other Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is meant the whole Word of GOD, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the Promiſes of Salvation by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law</hi> is not the Inſtrumental Cauſe of Converſion. It prepares a Soul for Converſion, inaſmuch as by it is the <hi>knowledge of Sin:</hi> It convinceth the Sinner of Guilt, and deſerved Damnation, but leaves him ſhut up under the fearful Curſe, without the leaſt hope of eſcape. Did not the Goſpel reveal that <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf,</hi> the awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd Sinner wou'd pine away in his Iniquities.

                     <p>BY Peace of Conſcience, I mean that reſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which the believing Soul enjoyeth in the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and perſwaſion of GOD'S Mercy thro' CHRIST, to pardon and ſave it. This is the product of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Peace. The Law is in our Context ſtiled the <hi>miniſtration of Condemnation,</hi> becauſe it paſſeth the Sentence of Death upon the Tranſgreſſor of it, and gives Conſcience it's Authority to condemn the Sinner: But the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is called the <hi>miniſtration of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> becauſe it exhibits and offers a Righteouſneſs ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for our Juſtification: <hi>Therein is the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God revealed from faith to faith,</hi> Rom. 1.17. The Goſpel revealing that perfect Righteouſneſs, which GOD graciouſly imputeth without the Works of the Law, to thoſe who believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is the means of ſetling an happy Peace in the Conſcience. Now, as the Apoſtle ſaith in the verſe immediately preceding our Text, <hi>If the miniſtration of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be glory, much more doth the miniſtration of Righteouſneſs exceed in Glory.</hi> The Goſpel far excels the Law in that it is the miniſtration of Righteouſneſs, and ſo of Peace. It is true, there is ſome mention made of this Righteouſneſs in the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets;</hi> hence it is ſaid, Rom. 3.21, 22. <hi>Now the Righteouſneſs of God without the Law is manifeſted, being witneſſed by the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; even the Righteouſneſs of God which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all, and upon all them that believe.</hi> But by the <hi>Law</hi> here the Apoſtle doth not intend the <hi>moral Law,</hi> for that is wholly ſilent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an imputed Righteouſneſs: But he means the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances, the <hi>ceremonial Law;</hi> and it is certain, that the Sacrifices under the Law did typify the Death of CHRIST, by which we have now received the Atonement; and there were alſo many Propheſies and Promiſes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the <hi>Lord our Righteouſneſs;</hi> and yet the glorious Myſtery of Juſtification by Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was in a great meaſure kept ſecret until the Goſpel mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted

                        <hi>THERE is verily a diſannulling of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment going before, for the weakneſs and unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof,</hi> Heb. 7.18. An end is put to the Legal Diſpenſation, but the Evangelical ſhall continue to the End of the World, Matth. 28.19, 20. <hi>Go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name, of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghoſt: Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the End of the World.</hi> Had there been no defect in the Legal, GOD would not have introduc'd the Evangelical Diſpenſation: The Change is to the better: GOD will not alter or abrogate the preſent Diſpenſation, becauſe there is not a better to ſucceed in the room of it, Heb. 12.26, 27. <hi>Whoſe voice then ſhook the Earth, but now he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, ſaying, yet once more I ſhake not the Earth only, but alſo Heaven.

World. The Goſpel-ſtate is that <hi>Kingdom which cannot be moved.</hi> The Angel which <hi>John</hi> ſaw fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the midſt of Heaven, (which might denote the ſpeed and diligence of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s faithful Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors) <hi>had the everlaſting Goſpel to preach unto them that dwell on the Earth,</hi> Rev. 14.6. This proves the tranſcendent Excellency of the <hi>Goſpel. For</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith in the verſe following our Text) <hi>if that which was done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IN theſe reſpects the <hi>Goſpel</hi> exceedeth the <hi>Law</hi> in Glory, and ſo far that even that which was made glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, had no Glory, in compariſon of the Glory that excelleth.</p>
                     <p>HAVING thus Illuſtrated and Confirmed the Truth, I proceed to Apply it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. IS the Goſpel ſo much more glorious than the Law? We may hence infer <hi>the great Dignity of the Evangelical Miniſtry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IT is conſiſtent with the Humility that ſhou'd cloath the Miniſters of the <hi>lowly JESUS,</hi> to aſſert the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their ſacred Employment. The holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who counted himſelf leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, is, in the Chapter wherein our Text is, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying his Office; and he ſtrongly proves it honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from the tranſcendent Glory of the Goſpel. His genuine Inference from his large Diſcourſe concerning the Excellency of the Goſpel is that in Ver. 12, 13. Cont. <hi>Seeing then that we have ſuch hope, we uſe great plainneſs of ſpeech, and not as Moſes, who put a vail over his face.</hi> As if he had ſaid, The Goſpel being in ſo many reſpects more glorious than the Law, and eſpecially ſince, according to our certain Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ſhall continue to the End of the World, I am not aſhamed of my miniſtration, but do thus boldly vindicate my Apoſtleſhip, and do not, as <hi>Moſes</hi> vail the Glory which the LORD hath put upon me. The more excellent a divine Revelation is, the more noble
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003029_0028_0FEFAEDE49D60160"/>
is their Office, who are ſent with it to the Children of Men. It was glorious to be a Miniſter of the Law, it is much more ſo to be a Miniſter of the <hi>Goſpel. John</hi> the Baptiſt, CHRIST'S Harbinger and Herald, was more than a Miniſter of the <hi>Law, more than a Prophet: The Law and the Prophets were until John:</hi> But in his Time <hi>Chriſt</hi> was actually exhibited, and he declar'd the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to be already come, pointing him out, as it were with the Finger, ſaying, <hi>Behold the Lamb of GOD.</hi> So that <hi>John</hi>'s Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry excel'd any that was before; yet when our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> was ſpeaking of <hi>John</hi>'s greatneſs, he ſhow'd that under the Evangelical Diſpenſation, when the Goſpel ſhou'd be fully preached, the leaſt Miniſter thereof wou'd, in reſpect of his Office, be greater than <hi>John,</hi> be a more honourable Officer than he, Matth. 11.11. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, among them that are born of women, there hath not riſen a greater than John the Baptiſt: notwithſtanding, he that is leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven, is greater than he.</hi> The more glorious a Kingdom is, the more honourable is an Office in it: The Goſpel Kingdom is termed the Kingdom of Heaven; the Glory of it exceeds that of all the Kingdoms of this World: To be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter therefore of CHRIST'S ſpiritual Kingdom on Earth, is no mean Preferment. No <hi>Man taketh this Honour unto himſelf,</hi> without horrid Uſurpation, <hi>but he that is called of GOD</hi> to this high and holy Office, ſhou'd be very humble and thankful; ſaying with the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 3.8. <hi>Unto me, who am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints, is this Grace given, that I ſhould preach among the Gentiles the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt:</hi> And, 1 Tim. 1.12. <hi>I thank Chriſt Jeſus our Lord who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the Miniſtry.</hi>— And they unto whoſe Truſt the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed GOD is committed, ſhould be careful to ſupport the Dignity of their Office, which they can do in no ſuch effectual way, as by diſcharging faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the Duties belonging to it— And let <hi>every Man ſo account of them, as the Miniſters of Chriſt,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003029_0029_0FEFAEE164F34638"/>
and Stewards of the myſteries of God:</hi> and this is to count them <hi>worthy of double honour,</hi> and to <hi>eſteem them very highly in Love for their work's ſake.</hi> That is ſpoken of, and in the New-Teſtament is directly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the Miniſters of the glorious Goſpel, which we read in Iſa. 52.7. <hi>How beautiful upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publiſheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publiſheth ſalvation, that ſaith unto Zion, thy God reigneth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. DOTH the Goſpel exceed the Law in Glory? then <hi>the Sin of Deſpiſing it is very great.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the Goſpel is ſo incomparably glorious, yet there are multitudes that deſpiſe it. When it was firſt publiſhed to the World, the generality of Men look'd upon it as a very mean or ridiculous Doctrine, and not worthy to be regarded by Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Beings: They called the Preaching of it <hi>fooliſhneſs.</hi> And the moſt of Men do not entertain a better Opinion of it, at this Day: Some deſpiſe it ſo as to reject the Knowledge of it; they have no deſire and take no pains to underſtand the glorious Truths contained in it. Some are <hi>aſhamed of the Goſpel of CHRIST,</hi> aſham'd to profeſs it; and how light do Sinners com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make of the Overtures of Grace therein? All who believe not in CHRIST, and walk not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules of the Goſpel, are guilty of deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it. He that breaks the Law deſpiſeth it, 2 Sam. 12.9. <hi>Wherefore haſt thou deſpiſed the Commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his ſight?</hi> So all who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the Goſpel deſpiſe it; and the greatneſs of their Sin and Folly appears from the Glory of the Goſpel. The more excellent any thing is, the more vile is the Contempt of it. As much as the Goſpel exceeds the Law in Glory, ſo much worſe is it for Men to deſpiſe the Goſpel than the Law, and expoſeth them to ſo much heavier Puniſhments. Heb. 10.28, 29. <hi>He that deſpiſed Moſes Law, died without mercy, under two or three witneſſes: of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003029_0030_0FEFAEE4C2131120"/>
trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and unholy thing, and hath done deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace?</hi> Contempt of the Goſpel is treading the Son of GOD underfoot, as if he were really a <hi>Worm</hi> and <hi>no Man,</hi> much leſs GOD: It is <hi>ſetting of him at nought,</hi> as truly as <hi>Herod</hi> with his Men of War did, when they made a mock-King of him: It is trampling the Redeemer's Grace, as if it were nothing worth: And it is counting his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood, which is <hi>the Blood of the Covenant,</hi> an unholy, a common thing; ſuch as pollutes rather than purifies the Soul. Deſpiſing the Goſpel is <hi>doing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite unto the Spirit of Grace,</hi> the holy Ghoſt, which accompanies the Goſpel to perſwade Men of the Truth and Excellency of it, and to make it of ſaving Efficacy to them. So great is the Sin of Goſpel-Contempt that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid concerning thoſe who were guilty of deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Law and the Prophets, Joh. 16.22 — 24. <hi>If I had not come, and ſpoken unto them, they had not had Sin: but now they have no cloke for their Sin — If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had Sin: but now they have both ſeen, and hated both me and my father.</hi> The righteous GOD puniſheth this Sin with the greateſt Judgments, temporal, ſpiritual and eternal. Wrath came not upon the Jews <hi>to the uttermoſt,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they deſpiſed and perſecuted the Goſpel, Mat. 22.7. <hi>When the King heard thereof, he was wroth: and he ſent forth his Armies,</hi> (the Romans) <hi>and deſtroyed thoſe murderers, and burnt up their City.</hi> The ſoreſt outward Calamities are brought on a People, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Goſpel, for their Contempt of it. GOD is provoked by Men's deſpiſing the Goſpel, to ſmite them with Judicial Blindneſs, ſo that they never ſhall ſee the Glory of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.40, 41. They who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly ſhut their Eyes againſt the light of the Goſpel, GOD often Judicially cloſeth their Eyes, and delivers them to the Power of Satan to blind them, 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003029_0031_0FEFAEE739014EB8"/>
that are loſt: In whom the God of this world hath blinded the eyes of thoſe that believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi> The Deſpiſers of the Goſpel ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction: And it will be <hi>more tolerable,</hi> not only for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> but alſo for the Deſpiſers of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law in the Day of Judgment, than for them, 2 Theſ. 1.7, 8. <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> — Now conſider this, ye that contemn the glorious Goſpel, and <hi>beware leſt that come upon you which is ſpoken of in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: Behold, ye deſpiſers, and wonder, and periſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. LET what hath been ſaid, <hi>raiſe our Eſteem of the Goſpel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THAT which is glorious ought to be valu'd by us, and according to the degree of it's Excellence. The Diſplay of the tranſcendent Glory of the Goſpel ſhou'd excite and confirm in us a due Eſteem of it. — What hath been ſaid concerning the Glory of the Goſpel, diſparageth not the Law, and will not juſtify the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of it. The Law is glorious, and deſerveth eſteem. It was a moſt ſuitable Revelation for the People to whom, and the Time wherein it was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Infinite Wiſdom judg'd it fit that the diſcovery of GOD'S Mind &amp; Will concerning the Salvation of fallen Man, ſhou'd be like the dawning <hi>Light, which ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day.</hi> A meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Brightneſs was not proper for the Morning of the Church Times. Under the Law the Church was, as it were, in her non-age; and the Inſtructions GOD gave were ſuited to her Capacity. Believers were then Children, and the Law was their School-maſter, to teach them the Elements, the Rudiments, the firſt Principles of divine Knowledge: Gal. 3.24. <hi>The Law was our School-maſter to bring us unto Chriſt:</hi> It was to prepare the Church for the <hi>Univerſity</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003029_0032_0FEFAEE8DF64BE40"/>
in which the Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is more fully taught. GOD vouchſafed further light to his People by extraordinary Prophets which he ſent unto them: He at <hi>ſundry Times, and in diverſe manners, ſpake unto the Fathers by the Prophets,</hi> who predicted what the Law prefigur'd, and gave many Promiſes of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Yet it was not perfect day-light until the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> aroſe; then the ſhadows fled away, "and the whole Horizon of heavenly Truth was diſclos'd." So that altho' the Law was glorious the divine Revelation before the fulneſs of Time came was excellent, and to be greatly eſteemed, yet the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is far more glorious, and to be more highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued. The Inſtructions of the Law were <hi>beggarly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> mean Rudiments, in compariſon of the deeper and more full Inſtructions of the Goſpel. That is a notable Prophecy concerning the Evangelical Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, Jer. 3.14, 15, 16. <hi>I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion. And I will give you Paſtors according to mine heart, which ſhall feed you with knowledge &amp; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And it ſhall come to paſs when ye be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied and increaſed in the Land; In thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, they ſhall ſay no more, The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord: neither ſhall it come to mind, neither ſhall they remember it, neither ſhall they viſit it, neither ſhall that be done any more.</hi> The days of the Meſſiah are here intended, in which GOD'S People ſhould be fed with Wiſdom and Underſtanding, by faithful evangelical Paſtors, in a way different from the Jewiſh Inſtitution. And their prizing the Goſpel Diſpenſation above the former, is expreſs'd by their not remembring, mentioning, nor viſiting the <hi>Ark of the Covenant.</hi> The Ark was called, <hi>The Glory;</hi> it was very much the Glory of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> It was an eminent Type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (the Glory of his People;) and a Symbol of GOD'S Preſence with his ancient Church. The Old-Teſtament Saints had it in high account; nothing was more precious unto them: yet it is here foretold, that when <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Antitype of the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003029_0033_0FEFAEEA98E5B7E0"/>
Ark, ſhould he come, and a more ſpiritual Worſhip erected, then there ſhould be no mention made of the <hi>Ark,</hi> it ſhould not be remembred, nor come into mind, <hi>neither ſhall that be done any more in it,</hi> or, as the Margin renders this, <hi>It ſhall not be magnified any more,</hi> It ſhall not be had in honour or reſpect, or be made much of. The whole <hi>ceremonial Law</hi> is not to be valued in compariſon of the glorious <hi>Goſpel;</hi> nor the <hi>carnal</hi> Ordinances of the former, to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the ſame day with the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Ordinances of the latter. The <hi>moral Law</hi> is to be highly eſteem'd. GOD will <hi>magnify this Law, and make it honourable.</hi> It is truly excellent and honourable in it ſelf; and the things of it are <hi>great things,</hi> and ſhou'd be ſo in our account. But the moral Law is only a Revelation of GOD'S Will concerning Man's Duty, not of his Good-Will concerning Man's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. It ſheweth us what we ought to do, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns us for not doing it, and leaves us without hope of eſcaping it's dreadful Curſe. It is a perfect Rule of Obedience, but affords no ſtrength unto impotent Man to walk according to it. Now the Goſpel doth not make void the Law, as it is a perfect Rule of Life and Manners, but re-inforceth it, and farther ſhews how the Sinner may be freed from the Curſe, revealing a Righteouſneſs that anſwers the Demands of the Law, and offers Strength to enable us ſincerely &amp; acceptably to keep the divine Precepts. All the intrinſic Glory which the <hi>moral Law</hi> hath, the <hi>Goſpel</hi> hath, and much more: We ſhould therefore give the <hi>Goſpel</hi> the preference to the <hi>Law</hi> in our eſteem. GOD'S Law was more deſired by his Saints than <hi>Gold, yea than much fine Gold,</hi> It was better to them than <hi>Thouſands of Gold &amp; Silver.</hi> How then ought we to prize the glorious Goſpel? It is an ineſtirnable Pearl we ſhou'd be willing to part with all things rather than to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, Matth. 13.4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

to ſtudy their own Prophecies concerning it, 1 Pet. 1.10, 11, 12. <hi>Of which Salvation the Prophets have enquired, and ſearched diligently, who propheſied of the Grace that ſhould come unto you: ſearching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Chriſt which was in them did ſignify, when it teſtified before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the Glory that ſhould follow: Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themſelves, but unto us they did miniſter the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the Goſpel, with the holy Ghoſt coming down from Heaven, which things the Angels deſire to look into.</hi> The holy Prophets with great diligence and delight ſearched into thoſe unfathomable Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Grace, that were in dark Expreſſions ſpoken of by themſelves, as moved by the Spirit of GOD, and which are more fully and clearly declared in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: <hi>Which Things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the Angels deſire to look into.</hi> This Expreſſion is alluſive to the <hi>Cherubims</hi> which were over the Ark, a Type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> looking down earneſtly upon it, as if they would pry into it. The bleſſed <hi>Angels, who behold the Face of GOD in Heaven,</hi> do as it were turn their Eyes from viewing his Glory in the upper World, and bend down their ſacred Heads to look into the glorious Myſteries of the Goſpel. The manifold Wiſdom of GOD made known to the Principalities and Powers in heavenly Places, by the Diſpenſation of his Grace toward the Church, is wonderful and raviſhing to them. And ſhall not we ſtudy thoſe things, which the glorious Angels think ſo worthy their Contemplations? Let us faithfully improve all Means, that are proper and appointed for our Information in the great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Truths of the Goſpel. Let us, with the very learned Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Count all things but loſs for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus, our Lord.</hi> — And as <hi>David</hi> prayed unto GOD, ſaying, <hi>Open thou mine Eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy Law;</hi> ſo let us pray that GOD
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003029_0037_0FEFAEF54E086458"/>
would open our Eyes, that we may behold more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous things out of his Goſpel.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. LET Chriſtians be Exhorted to <hi>adorn the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Goſpel, the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</hi>

                     <p>WE cannot add to the intrinſick Glory of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but we ſhould teſtify and declare it's Excellency by having our Converſation in the World <hi>as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> It is a Reproach to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Goſpel, and brings it into Contempt, when thoſe who profeſs it walk not according to the holy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Rules of it, Rom. 2.23, 24. <hi>Thou that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thy boaſt of the Law, thro' breaking the Law diſhonoureſt thou God? For the name of God is blaſphemed among the Gentiles thro' you.</hi> So when Profeſſors of Chriſtianity diſobey the Precepts of it, they darken the Glory of the Goſpel, and diſhonour the Name of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> We <hi>receive the Grace of GOD</hi> the Goſpel <hi>in vain,</hi> as to our own Souls, unleſs we conform our Lives to it: as it is ſhown they had as good have been without the Law, who did not keep it, Jer. 8.8. <hi>How do ye ſay, we are wiſe, and the Law of the Lord is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it, the Pen of the Scribes is in vain.</hi> And we render the Goſpel unprofitable to others alſo by our unſuitable Lives: We increaſe and confirm their Prejudices, which hinder their ſeeing the Glory of the Goſpel.— But the Luſtre of a godly Converſation is an Ornament to the glorious Goſpel, which we profeſs. The regular Practice of all the duties which the Goſpel requires, ſets forth the Glory of the Goſpel to beſt Advantage, and recommends it to thoſe, before whom our Light ſhineth, and may convince even Infidels that the Goſpel came from the <hi>GOD of Glory.</hi> Chriſtians of the loweſt Rank are obliged thus to adorn the Goſpel, Tit. 2.9, 10 <hi>Let our Converſation</hi> therefore <hi>be as it becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.27. 1 Theſ. 2.11, 12. <hi>As ye know how we exhorted, and comforted, and

                     <p>WHAT hath been ſaid concerning the Glory of the Goſpel (tho' <hi>one half hath not been told</hi>) may well excite our thankful Praiſes unto GOD for it. <hi>What Advantage had the Jews</hi> above the Gentiles? <hi>Much every way, chiefly becauſe that unto them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi> And Chriſtians have a vaſt advantage above the Jews, in that the <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Goſpel of the Bleſſed GOD</hi> is committed unto them. <hi>GOD hath provided ſome better thing for us, that they without us ſhould not be made perfect.</hi> The Goſpel is a greater Glory unto a People, among whom it is diſpenſed in the Power &amp; Purity of it, than the Ark was to Iſrael; and more Glory is due therefor unto GOD from thoſe who enjoy it. How glad would the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> of old have been, to have ſeen and heard what we do under the Evangelical Diſpenſation? Matth. 13.16, 17. <hi>But bleſſed are your Eyes, for they ſee; and your Ears, for they hear: for verily I ſay unto you, that many Prophets and righteous Men have deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them: and to hear thoſe things, which ye hear; and have not heard them.</hi> They indeed by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective of Faith ſaw the promiſed Bleſſings; but they ſaw them <hi>afar off,</hi> had but an obſcure View of them to what is now granted. With the Eagle-Eye of Faith <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw the Day of Goſpel-light at a great diſtance, and the remote Proſpect which he had of it, made him to rejoice greatly, Joh. 8.56. <hi>Your Father Abraham rejoyced to ſee my day: and he ſaw it, and was glad.</hi> Should not thoſe who live in that day, much more rejoyce in, and be thankful for the Light and Glory of it?

                  <p>OUR Bleſſed SAVIOUR ſpeaking to his Diſciples of the calamitous Deſtruction which ſhou'd be brought on <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> warn'd them to flee out of it, when they ſhou'd ſee the <hi>Abomination of Deſolation ſtanding in the holy Place: i. e.</hi> The Roman Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my beſieging the City.

                  </p>
                  <p>THIS is recorded, Gen. 19.26. <hi>His Wife looked back from behind him.</hi> In her flight from <hi>Sodom</hi> ſhe looked back. But how was this a Sin? Wherein conſiſted the ſinfulneſs of her ſo doing? What fault was it for a poor diſtreſſed Woman to look back upon the City where ſhe had dwelt, and where her Friends &amp; Acquaintance were, and from whence ſhe was taking her final Departure? Might ſhe not without offence turn her Eyes upon <hi>Sodom</hi> as ſhe was eſcaping from it? Might ſhe not ſee it once more before it was utterly conſumed? Might ſhe not caſt an Eye of Pity towards, and Weep for her miſerable Neighbours in flames of Brimſtone?</p>
                  <p>HER looking back was ſinful,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. BECAUSE it was contrary to a <hi>divine Prohibition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>SIN is a Tranſgreſſion of the Law. Lot's</hi> Wive's looking back on <hi>Sodom</hi> was the Tranſgreſſion of a particular Law, the breach of an expreſs Order given them, Gen. 19.17. <hi>It came to paſs when they had brought them forth abroad, that he ſaid, Eſcape for thy Life, look not behind thee. Lot</hi>'s Wife, as well as he, was ſolemnly Charged not to <hi>look behind;</hi> ſo that ſhe did that which was expreſly and plainly forbidden her. And to act contrary to the leaſt Commandment, or Prohibition of the great GOD, is no ſmall offence, no petty fault. <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wive's Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience may be illuſtrated by that of <hi>Saul</hi>'s, in ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the beſt of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> Sheep and Oxen for Sacrifice; This was very offenſive to GOD, becauſe contrary to an expreſs Order given him to ſlay them all: The Prophet thus ſet his Sin before him, 1 Sam. 15, 22, 23. <hi>Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings and ſacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than ſacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of Rams. For rebellion is as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of witchcraft, and ſtubbornneſs it is as iniquity and idolatry. Saul</hi>'s rebellion in that matter, which was in it ſelf ſmall, was as really a Sin, &amp; Provocation
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003029_0043_0FEFAF04A9D96100"/>
of GOD'S Wrath as Witchcraft or Idolatry. It was a Contempt of the great Lawgiver's Authority. And ſo was <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wive's looking back. <hi>Abraham</hi> the ſame Morning looked toward <hi>Sodom,</hi> and ſaw the ſmoke of it's Torments aſcending, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.27, 28. This was no Sin in <hi>Abraham,</hi> for he was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to look toward <hi>Sodom:</hi> But it was a great Sin in <hi>Lot's Wife</hi> to look back upon it, for the Lord had ſaid to her, <hi>Look not behind thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS teacheth us, to meaſure Sin by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo it will appear <hi>exceeding ſinful.</hi> Perſons are ready to make light of many evil Actions, and to ſtroke them with a gentle Cenſure, becauſe they are not ſo groſs &amp; crying as others. But the matter in which we Sin is not ſo much to be regarded, as the Authority which is thereby deſpiſed. What is in it ſelf ſmall &amp; inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable is a great offence, if the Lord hath forbidden it. The firſt Woman took of the fruit of a certain Tree in <hi>Eden,</hi> and eat it. Could ſo ſmall a thing as the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Apple be very offenſive to GOD? Yet <hi>the Lord God ſaid unto the Woman, What is this thou haſt done?</hi> Gen. 3.13. What an heinous Crime haſt thou committed? Becauſe GOD had expreſly ſaid, <hi>Of that Tree thou ſhalt not eat.</hi> GOD'S Authority is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, his Will reſiſted by our doing the leaſt thing which he hath forbidden; therefore no ſuch Act muſt be accounted by us a ſmall offence. We ſhould not ſay of it, as <hi>Lot</hi> did of <hi>Zoar,</hi> which he deſir'd might be ſpared to be the City of his Refuge, <hi>Is it not a little One?</hi> Sometimes the ſmaller the matter is in which we tranſgreſs, the greater is the Offence; as when the Prohibition of it is very plain &amp; peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, the Temptation unto it ſlight, and it be a thing which might eaſily be left undone. Whatſoever we do contrary to the declared Will of GOD, is a horrid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity offer'd to his Majeſty &amp; Authority: It is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, which in every caſe is as the Sin of Witchcraft and Idolatry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. IN <hi>Lot's Wive's</hi> looking back upon <hi>Sodom</hi> there was a <hi>Contempt of GOD's Omniſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SHE not only deſpis'd the Authority &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003029_0044_0FEFAF07E1BAA4C0"/>
of GOD, but alſo practically deny'd his Omniſcience: for it is ſaid, that ſhe <hi>locked back from behind Lot.</hi> She committed this Sin ſecretly. She was behind her Husband; and ſince his Eye was not upon her, ſhe ventur'd to look back; thereby expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Contempt of GOD'S all-ſeeing Eye. She was afraid that if <hi>righteous Lot</hi> ſaw her he wou'd be angry with her for diſobeying the Lord; but not afraid that a <hi>Righteous GOD</hi> would ſee her, and be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at her Sin. This is an aggravation of ſecret Sins, that the Omniſcience of GOD is eſpecially contemned thereby; as if the Eye of GOD was not to be ſo much regarded &amp; reverenc'd as the Eye of Man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>LOT</hi>'s <hi>Wive's</hi> looking back on <hi>Sodom</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from an <hi>evil Heart of Unbelief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Angels</hi> which came to <hi>Lot</hi>'s Houſe, told him, and his Wife, that ſwift Deſtruction was coming upon <hi>Sodom: Lot</hi> inform'd his Sons in-law of it, and ſaid unto them, <hi>Up, get ye out of this place, for the Lord will deſtroy this city: but he ſeemed unto them as one that mocked.</hi> Altho' his <hi>Wife</hi> did not reject the Warning with ſuch ſcorn, as they did, yet it ſeems, that ſhe queſtion'd the Truth of the Threatning, and therefore look'd back to ſee whether it would be Executed or not. It was ſaid to her, <hi>Look not behind thee, leſt thou be conſumed.</hi> But ſhe did not believe ſhe ſhou'd be conſumed for looking back. It is ſaid in the Book of the <hi>Wiſdom of Solomon,</hi> chap. 10. v. 7. <hi>That a ſtanding Pillar of Salt, is a Monument of an unbelieving Soul.</hi>—Not to believe GOD, is to make him a Liar: It is a great Sin, to doubt of his Veracity in his Menaces, as well as Promiſes. Such Unbelief is the Root of Diſobedience. Men deſpiſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of GOD, becauſe they do not believe his Threatnings, Heb. 3.12. <hi>Take heed, Brethren, leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the living God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. THERE was the <hi>Luſt of the Eye</hi> in <hi>Lot's Wive's</hi> looking back upon <hi>Sodom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>"IT was a look of Covetouſneſs". <hi>Sodom</hi> was a rich and pleaſant place: It was even <hi>as the Garden of

the Lord,</hi> Gen. 13.10. <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife was very loth to go out of it; ſhe lingered in it, (as indeed <hi>Lot</hi> himſelf did) after ſhe was warned to flee; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels laid hold on her hand, and brought her forth, and ſet her without the City, <hi>plucking her as a Brand out of the Fire:</hi> and ſhe went not far from <hi>Sodom</hi> before her Love to her worldly accommodations there, made her look back, with uneaſy Deſires to return to it, there to enjoy the Wealth, Pleaſures &amp; Friends which ſhe had left. So that her Sin was great: her Rebellion was as the Sin of Idolatry, for <hi>Covetouſneſs is Idolatry:</hi> It is loving and ſerving the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more than the Creator. We cannot obey GOD, ſo long as this Luſt remains unmortified: We may ſeem to hearken to his Call for a time, and to flee from Wrath; but if we love the World, and the things of it, we ſhall look, and draw back unto Perdition, 2 Tim. 4.10. <hi>Demas hath forſaken me, having lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this preſent World.</hi> We ſhould remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, that we may <hi>take heed and beware of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs.</hi>

                  <p>WHEN the <hi>Lord</hi> was about to rain "Hell out of Heaven" upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the Neighbouring Cities, he ſent his Angels (and one of them was the bleſſed Angel of the Covenant, for he is ſtiled <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Gen. 19.24.) GOD ſent them to bring out <hi>Lot,</hi> and his Wife and Children, that they might not be conſumed in the Iniquity &amp; Overthrow of <hi>Sodom.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> being <hi>merciful</hi> did this: <hi>Lot</hi> ſpake of it with Admiration, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Behold now, thy Servant hath found Grace in thy ſight, and thou haſt magnified thy mercy which thou haſt ſhewed unto me in ſaving my Life.</hi> But his Wife deſpiſed ſo great a Mercy; ſhe had low Thot's of it: ſhe did not accept the miraculous Deliverance with Thankfulneſs: ſhe was ſo unſuitably affected with the Kindneſs GOD had ſhown her in ſaving her Life, that ſhe look'd back on <hi>Sodom</hi> with a diſcontented Eye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

This vile Ingratitude made her Sin ſo heinous in GOD'S ſight. When Mercy is deſpiſed, Wrath is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated: Sins committed after ſignal Deliverances, are exceedingly aggravated. Ezra 9.13, 14.— <hi>Seeing that thou our God haſt given us ſuch Deliverance as this, ſhould we again break thy Commandments?</hi> The gracious GOD hath ſent the chief of thoſe Angels which he ſent to <hi>Sodom,</hi> the glorious increated Angel, the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> into the World, to deliver us from the everlaſting Burnings of Hell: Let us not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife in deſpiſing this great Mercy.</p>
                  <p>THUS we ſhould remember and improve the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>WE ſhou'd remember the</hi> PUNISHMENT <hi>of</hi> Lot's <hi>Wife:</hi> the terrible Judgment which GOD inflicted upon her.</p>
                  <p>THIS is recorded for our Admonition, Gen. 19.26. <hi>She became a Pillar of Salt.</hi> When ſhe looked back, ſhe was ſtruck dead upon the ſpot, and was turned into a <hi>Pillar of Salt.</hi> By her becoming a Pillar of Salt, ſome I think, underſtand no more than her being made a laſting Monument of GOD'S ſevere Juſtice; as a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Covenant is ſtiled a <hi>Covenant of Salt,</hi> Num. 18.19. But why the literal Senſe of the words ſhould be rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I can ſee no Reaſon; but do believe that ſhe was really turned into a <hi>Pillar,</hi> a Statue <hi>of Salt,</hi> a kind of rocky, mineral Salt, which will endure all Weathers and not waſte away. <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> write of Salt which is hard enough for Buildings.— <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who lived ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi> was on Earth, ſaith that the Pillar of Salt was ſtanding in his Time, and that He himſelf had ſeen it. And the like is affirmed by others ſince his time. — We are now call'd to look upon it with the Eyes of our Minds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. WE ſhou'd remember the Puniſhment of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, becauſe it repreſents to us the <hi>evil Nature,</hi> and <hi>infinite Demerit</hi> of Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>LOT</hi>'s Wives Puniſhment was ſevere &amp; dreadful, yet it did not exceed the deſert of her Crime, for look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſhe was turned into a <hi>Pillar of Salt.</hi>—By this we may learn, That there is more Evil
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:003029_0047_0FEFAF106F400220"/>
in every Sin, than Men are aware of: It is more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to the <hi>holy GOD</hi> than we can imagine it to be: GOD'S Thot's of Sin are not as Man's; his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it and Man's are very different. The Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Being againſt whom Sin is committed, and who only knows the Malignity &amp; Demerit of it, does not make light of the ſmalleſt Sin. <hi>The Wages of</hi> every <hi>Sin is Death.</hi> And the righteous GOD, to ſhew his Hatred of Sin, and what a heavy Puniſhment it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, ſometimes in this World remarkably executes Vengeance upon Men, for thoſe Faults, which to a common Eye appear ſmall &amp; inconſiderable. He that turned <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife into a Pillar of Salt, for looking back on <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſtruck <hi>Uzzah</hi> dead, for touching the Ark; and ſmote the Men of <hi>Bethſhemeſh</hi> Fifty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, threeſcore and ten, for looking into it. <hi>Behold therefore the ſeverity of God: on them which fell ſeverity,</hi> Rom. 11.22.— Jer. 2.19. <hi>Know therefore and ſee, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, ſaith the Lord God of hoſts.</hi>— On the <hi>Pillar of Salt</hi> is engraven the Deſert &amp; Doom of every Sinner amongſt us, and <hi>He that runs may read it. Lot</hi>'s Wife is thus ſet forth for an Example, ſhewing to us what we deſerve for our Rebellion, Atheiſm, Unbelief, Covetouſneſs, and Contempt of GOD'S Mercy. Was <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife a greater Sinner than You, or I? They are not always the greateſt offenders, on whom GOD inflicts the moſt viſible Judgments in this World, See <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſhou'd look upon the Pillar of Salt, that our Fleſh may tremble for fear of GOD, and that we may be afraid of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Deſert of Sin is ſtill the ſame, and GOD is immutably and impartially Juſt; what he hath done to others, he may do to us. It is certain, that unleſs our Repentance prevent, GOD'S Wrath will fall upon us, if not in ſuch a manner, yet as terribly as it did upon <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife: and as it will be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> &amp; <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> ſo it will for <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife in the Day of Judgment, than for us, if we continue to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect &amp; deſpiſe the great Mercy of GOD in ſending his

Angel, the Lord JESUS, to deliver us from the Lake that burns with Fire &amp; Brimſtone.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. WE ſhou'd remember the Puniſhment of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, and be convinced of the <hi>Folly and Danger of ſinning in Secret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SHE looked back from behind <hi>Lot,</hi> ſo that he could not obſerve and reprove her; but ſhe was before GOD, did that Evil in His ſight, and He rebuk'd her in His Anger. GOD'S Judgments will ſooner or later find Men out in their moſt ſecret Sins, Zeph. 1.12. <hi>I will ſearch Jeruſalem with candles, and puniſh the men that are ſettled on their lees; that ſay in their heart, the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.</hi> There is no darkneſs, nor ſhadow of Death, in which the workers of Iniquity can hide themſelves from his Eyes, which are as a flame of Fire. If we are Religious &amp; Pray in Secret, our gracious Father in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will reward us openly: But if we are Wicked, and Sin in Secret, our righteous Judge will puniſh us openly; if not in this World, yet ſadly in that which is to come. Wo unto their Soul, who declare their Sin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and hide it not: Wo alſo unto theirs, who conceal their Sin as <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, for GOD will reveal it, and reckon with them for it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. WE ſhou'd remember <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wive's Puniſhment, and not deſire, nor delight in the <hi>forbidden Society of vicious Perſons, leſt we be involved in their Ruin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>LOT</hi>'s Wife lingered in, and look'd back upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> wiſhing (moſt probably) that ſhe might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Company of her Friends &amp; Acquaintance there; and therefore ſhe ſuffer'd with them. GOD's exemplary Vengeance was poured down on her at the ſame time, that it was on them; and it is probable in the ſame manner. Fire &amp; Brimſtone might be rained on her, as well as on them. A judicious Divine thus expounds that Text, Gen. 19.24. <hi>The Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah, brimſtone &amp; fire;</hi> that is, He conſumed them by Thunder &amp; Lightning. Which (ſaith he) ſome of the Pagans had notice of, for <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> tells us, that thoſe Cities were ſet on fire and burnt up by the ſtroke of Thunder. <hi>He adds,</hi> The
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:003029_0049_0FEFAF163392E180"/>
Saline Pillar which <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife was turned into, was probably the Effect of this wonderful Meteor; for from ſeveral Examples it appears, that Perſons ſtruck with Thunder have continued in the ſame Poſture wherein they were when they were alive, and their dead Bodies are ſtiffned by the ſulphurious Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours penetrating them. But whether <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife was ſtruck dead with a flaſh of that Fire which burned <hi>Sodom</hi> or not, yet ſhe was deſtroyed with that wicked People; and as <hi>Sodom</hi> was turned into a Lake, Heaps and Pits of Salt <note n="‖" place="bottom">

This is a Warning to us, not to hanker after the forbidden Society of lewd &amp; wicked Perſons, leſt we be deſtroyed with them. If we have fellowſhip with the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs, we ſhall be led forth with the Workers of Iniquity. If our Life be now among the Unclean, we may expect ſoon to have our part with them in the Lake which burneth with Fire &amp; Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, Rev. 18.4. <hi>I heard another voice from Heaven, ſaying, Come out of her, my People, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. WE ſhou'd remember the Puniſhment of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, that ſudden Deſtruction from <hi>GOD</hi> may be a <hi>Terror</hi> to us.</p>
                  <p>WHEN <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife looked back, ſhe immediately became a <hi>Pillar of Salt:</hi> She was ſtruck dead in a moment. This inſtance of GOD'S Wrath ſhou'd make us ſenſible how obnoxious we are to ſudden Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Long-ſuffering of GOD waited upon <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, while ſhe lingred in <hi>Sodom;</hi> but when ſhe looked back, his Wrath made quick work. GOD hath exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd great Patience toward us, yet he may bring ſwift Deſtruction upon us, Iſa. 42.13, 14. <hi>The Lord ſhall go forth as a mighty man, he ſhall ſtir up jealouſy like a man of war: he ſhall cry, yea, roar; he ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt his Enemies.

If we proceed a ſtep further in an evil Courſe, our feet may ſtumble, and we fall head-long into Perdition.

                  <p>THIS was a ſtrange Puniſhment, a Woman turned into a <hi>Pillar of Salt.</hi> Not only the ſuddenneſs, but alſo the ſtrangeneſs of a Puniſhment is to be dreaded. The common Calamities of Mankind are apt to be look'd upon by too many, as the Effects of natural Cauſes only, or to be aſcrib'd to <hi>Fortune:</hi> GOD there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſometimes goes out of the beaten Road of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Diſpenſations, and inflicts ſome rare, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Judgment, to awaken the drowſy World to take notice of his Hand. Numb. 16.29, 30, 31. <hi>If theſe men die the common death of all men, or if they be viſited after the viſitation of all men, then the Lord hath not ſent me. But if the Lord make a new thing, and the Earth open her mouth, and ſwallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the Pit: then ye ſhall underſtand that theſe men have provoked the Lord. And it came to paſs as he had made an end of ſpeaking all theſe words, that the ground clave aſunder that was under them: and the Earth opened her mouth &amp; ſwallowed them up.</hi> We ſhould fear and tremble, leſt GOD ſhould viſit us with ſome ſuch unuſual Judgment, Job 31.3. <hi>Is not deſtruction to the wicked? and a ſtrange puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the workers of iniquity?</hi> Deſtruction will certainly be their Portion, unleſs they Repent, and it may be brought upon them in ſome extraordinary and dreadful manner, Iſa. 28.21. <hi>The Lord ſhall riſe up as in mount Perazim, he ſhall be wroth as in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his ſtrange work; and bring to paſs his act his ſtrange act.</hi>

                  <p>IT was a <hi>diſgraceful</hi> Puniſhment that <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife ſuffered.

them in this World he ſets a mark of peculiar Infamy upon them, and cauſeth their Sins to be remembred to their Diſgrace in after-Ages. His Judgments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon them are <hi>monumental Pillars,</hi> on which their Sins are written to their great reproach and perpetual ſhame. Some Puniſhments are like <hi>Pillars of Salt,</hi> not to keep Sinners Names from ſtinking in the noſtrils of Poſterity, but to preſerve the Memory of them to their everlaſting Diſgrace. In ſome Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of divine Juſtice, GOD doth, as it were hang up Malefactors in Chains, and make them "Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of public Shame". Ezek. 5.14, 15. <hi>I will make thee a reproach among the Nations that are round about thee, in the ſight of all that paſs by. So it ſhall be a reproach and a taunt, an inſtruction and an aſtoniſhment unto the Nations that are round about thee, when I ſhall execute Judgments in thee in anger, and in fury, and in furious rebukes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THUS in the Judgment inflicted on <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, there is much Inſtruction &amp; Warning given unto us. It may therefore be very profitable for us to remember her <hi>Puniſhment.</hi>

                  <p>THIS is the chief &amp; comprehenſive Benefit deſign'd us by the great Lover of our Souls, in calling upon us to <hi>remember Lot's Wife,</hi> namely, That we might be deter'd from looking back, when we are flying from Wrath.

                  <p>THEY are in ſuch a Condition as <hi>Sodom</hi> was an Emblem of.

                  <p>
                     <hi>SODOM</hi> was a <hi>Sink</hi> of moral Pollution, in which the People like Swine did wallow: and ſo it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Corrupt State of Nature, in which the Children of Men are altogether filthy.</p>
                  <p>IT is ſaid, Gen. 13.13. That <hi>the Men of</hi> Sodom <hi>were wicked, and ſinners before the Lord exceedingly.</hi> And this may be truly ſaid of all that are in the State of Nature: Tho' they are not all in reſpect of actual Sins, ſo wicked as the Men of <hi>Sodom</hi> were, yet they are in reſpect of the habitual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and Perverſeneſs of their Nature. Original Sin is greater than all the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:003029_0054_0FEFAF2227AB3660"/>
actual Abominations that were committed in <hi>Sodom. Sodom</hi> was a <hi>Sink,</hi> but corrupt Nature is a <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of moral Defilements: And there is more filthy Water in this Fountain, than ever iſſued forth in the impure ſtreams of <hi>Sodom.</hi> The Fountain did not caſt out all it's dirty Waters, even in that ſo defiled Land. Altho' that People did <hi>draw iniquity with cords of vanity and ſin as it were with a rope,</hi> yet they did not draw the Fountain dry. But as the Streams diſcover what the Fountain is, ſo the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Wickedneſs in <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſheweth to us what the Corruption of our fallen Nature is. And thoſe who are in the State of Polluted Nature, are in reſpect thereof more filthy &amp; deſperately wicked, than the People of <hi>Sodom,</hi> were in reſpect of the actual Abominations which prevailed in it. They dwell amidſt greater Impurities, than thoſe which were viſible, and did openly abound in <hi>Sodom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THERE is this remarkable difference between <hi>Sodom</hi> and a State of Nature; It was poſſible for a Man to be Righteous in the former, but it is not ſo in the latter. Indeed, there were not ten righteous Perſons to be found in <hi>Sodom,</hi> when the LORD came down to ſee whether the People had done altogether according to the Cry that went up to him; yet there was One good Man that lived in it at that time; <hi>Juſt Lot, vexed,</hi> and ſo not corrupted, <hi>with the filthy converſation of the wicked there: For that righteous man dwelling among them, in ſeeing and hearing, vexed his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul from day to day with their unlawful deeds,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.7, 8.

                     <hi>LOT's</hi> Wife, and others in <hi>Sodom,</hi> were fore-warned of the burning Tempeſt which GOD would rain upon it, and were compaſſionately advis'd &amp; urg'd to get out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that they might not be involv'd in it's overthrow. GOD ſent Angels from Heaven, to give them notice of the approaching Ruin: yea, the <hi>Meſſenger of the Covenant</hi> was ſent on this Errand. Thoſe Miniſters of GOD called upon <hi>Lot,</hi> his Wife and Daughters, to make haſte, and get out of the accurſed City; And while they lingered in <hi>Sodom,</hi> being; loth to leave their commodious Dwelling, rich Eſtate, and worldly Conveniencies, the Angels laid hold on their hands, and brought them forth, and ſet them without the City and charged them to eſcape for their Lives, and not to ſtay in all the Plain, but to eſcape to the Mountain, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. In like manner the gracious GOD deals with the Children of Men, who are in <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Sodom. He warns them to get out of the polluted, dangerous Eſtate of Nature: He ſends his Miniſters, the <hi>Angels of the Churches,</hi> who cry aloud, and ſhew unto Sinners their Danger, Duty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; calling earneſtly upon them to forſake their Sins, and part with all which is inconſiſtent with the Safety and Salvation of their Souls: yea, the glorious increated Angel doth by the Miniſtry of the Word come, and warn Sinners to eſcape out of <hi>myſtical Sodom.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20. <hi>Now then we are Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us: we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, Be ye reconciled to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and pull them out of <hi>Sodom;</hi> making them leave off the practice of their groſs Abominations, and to uſe ſome Endeavours to reform their Lives, and ſave their Soul.— Thus graciouſly is the Long-ſuffering GOD pleas'd to warn thoſe who are in <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Sodom, to haſten out of it, and flee to the City of Refuge, which he hath appointed and prepared for them, leſt they be conſumed with his fiery Indignation, which he will pour out on all who remain in the corrupt and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed State of Nature.

                  <p>
                     <hi>LOT's</hi> Wife was brought without the City, and ſhe fled with him and her Daughters a while toward <hi>Zoar,</hi> and was in a fair way to eſcape the Ruin, which was then coming on the People of <hi>Sodom;</hi> But ſhe ſlacken'd her Pace, linger'd behind, and looked back. This Sin of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife is imitated by many in their flight from <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Sodom: They are ſo far awaken'd and wro't upon, that they abandon their vicious Practices, and ſeem to be brought out of the State of polluted Nature; they turn their backs upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> and ſet their faces towards <hi>Zion,</hi> and are in a fair way to eſcape the wrath of GOD: they run well for a time; take conſiderable Pains in Religion, ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate of Repentance &amp; Faith, labour to get
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:003029_0061_0FEF96F8714BDB98"/>
into CHRIST: perform holy Duties with much ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and apply themſelves to the Work of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with fear and trembling; and they are <hi>not far from the Kingdom of GOD:</hi> But they do not <hi>hold on,</hi> their Heat is ſoon ſpent, and they flag: Their dread of GOD'S Wrath, and concern for their Souls abate; good Impreſſions wear off; and they meeting with Difficulties in the way of Salvation, grow weary of the Chriſtian Race, ſtand ſtill, and <hi>look back</hi> —. They are tempted to think, there is no need of ſo much Care about their Souls, that they were in no ſuch Danger as they apprehended them to be; that the Fire &amp; Brimſtone which they were told of, and affrighted with, will not be rained upon them: The Love of the World and the things of it, revives in them; and they fancy it was never better with them, than when they were quiet and undiſturb'd in the Enjoyment of their outward Comforts, and ſenſual Delights; and ſo thro' Unbelief, and Love of this World, they (as <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife did) <hi>look back</hi> with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of returning to their former Pleaſures. The State of ſpiritual Pollution and Bondage appears not ſo bad to them, as when they were firſt awaken'd to get out of it; nay, better than that of Holineſs, which they have been ſtriving to get into: As the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in their Journey to <hi>Canaan,</hi> thought that it was better with them in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>ſaid one to another; let us make us a captain, and let us return into Egypt,</hi> Numb. 14.4. — They who ſeem to have eſcaped out of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Sodom, and to have made conſiderable Progreſs toward <hi>Zion,</hi> do not ordinarily go back at once, but by degrees.

Having thus <hi>looked back,</hi> they

commonly (unleſs prevented by ſudden Deſtruction) go back to <hi>Sodom;</hi> revert to their old Abominations. Prov. 26.11. <hi>As a Dog returneth to his vomit, ſo a Fool returneth to his folly.</hi> This is cited by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and apply'd to the Apoſtates in his time, [O that it were not verified in many of us!] 2 Pet. 2.22. <hi>It is happened unto them according to the true Proverb, The Dog is turned to his own vomit, and the Sow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire.</hi>

                  <p>PERSONS may imitate the Sin, and incur the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, tho' they do not attempt an Eſcape out of myſtical <hi>Sodom:</hi> may be guilty of Diſobedience, Contempt of GOD'S All-ſeeing Eye, of Unbelief, Covetouſneſs and Ingratitude for the Mercy of GOD in offering to ſave them from the flames of Hell; and thereby may expoſe themſelves to ſudden and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deſtruction: But ſuch as have begun their flight from <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Sodom, (as I hope, ſome here preſent have,) if they look back, they eſpecially do imitate <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wives Sin, and may expect as terrible a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as Her's: It is therefore peculiarly ſeaſonable, and may be very profitable for thoſe who are endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to get out of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Sodom, are ſollicitouſly <hi>asking the way to Zion, with their faces thitherwards,</hi> and are flying from Wrath to come, to <hi>remember Lot's Wife.

upon you in the next. <hi>Theophilact</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife remain'd obſtinate and impenitent, and her Heatt was hardned, and that this is the meaning of her being turned into a Pillar of Salt: Altho' his Interpretation of the Text is not to be embrac'd, yet it may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by thoſe who are in their flight from <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Sodom, to deter them from looking back, leſt in his ſenſe they become Pillars of hardned Salt.</p>
                  <p>Zeph. 1.6. <hi>I will ſtretch out my hand, and cut off them that are turned back.</hi> In the days of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> wherein this Threatning was denounced, the ſinful People of <hi>Judah</hi> were greatly awaken'd, &amp; outwardly Reformed: But they ſoon revolted: Many that began well, ſet out with Zeal in the good ways of the Lord, <hi>turned and looked back:</hi> GOD threatned them parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, that he would ſtretch out his hand, and cut them off, wou'd be quick and ſevere upon them. — Remember the words of CHRIST, Luk. 9.62. <hi>No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.</hi> Go through with the work that ye have begun, or ye ſhall never enter into the <hi>Kingdom of God.</hi> Oh! Conſider the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Miſchief of <hi>looking back.</hi> If ye return to your former Abominations, the unclean Spirit will have a ſtronger Poſſeſſion of you, than he had before, Matth. 12.43, 44, 45. <hi>When the unclean Spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh thro' dry places, ſeeking reſt, and findeth none. Then he ſaith, I will return into my houſe from whence I came out, and when he is come, he findeth it empty, ſwept, and garniſhed. Then goeth he, and taketh with himſelf ſeven other Spirits more wicked than himſelf, and they enter in and dwell there: and the laſt State of that man is worſe than the firſt.</hi> This is well Expounded by the Apoſtle, 2 Pet. 2.20, 21. <hi>For if after they have eſcaped the pollutions of the world, thro' the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled therein, and overcome; the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning. For it had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them not to have known the way of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

than after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IF ye ſhould be intangled again in your Luſts, and return to the Mire of your Sinful Pollutions, your Eſcape, if ever it be attempted by you, will be far more difficult than it was at firſt; your Deliverance out of Spiritual <hi>Sodom,</hi> will be almoſt deſpaired of.— Ye having begun in the Spirit, be not ſo fooliſh as to end in the fleſh. — If any of you have ſlacken'd your pace, and are turning and drawing back, be convinc'd of your folly and danger, and quickned in your flight to CHRIST, by what ye now hear, — Gal. 5.7. <hi>Ye did run well, who did hinder you, that you ſhould not obey the truth?</hi> — Renew your Reſolutions againſt Sin, and for Holineſs and Heaven: Lay aſide every weight, and the Sin that doth ſo eaſily beſet you, and run with patience and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Race ſet before you: — and as ye run, <hi>Remember Lot's Wife.</hi>

look back on ſpiritual Sodom with any Regret for their leaving it, nor deſire of returning to it. — They are not, it's true, of <hi>them who draw back unto Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> Heb. 10.39. GOD'S electing Love, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-faithfulneſs, almighty Power, and CHRIST'S continual Interceſſion ſhall prevent the total Defection of the Saints.

They frequently ſlacken their Pace in the good ways of the LORD; grow Cold in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, remiſs in holy Duties, do abate much of their Zeal for GOD, and back-ſlide into many Sins. Altho' they ſhall not draw back unto eternal Perdition; yet they may to their ſpiritual Loſs, and temporal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: They may provoke GOD to inflict ſuch Judgments on them, as to make them Monuments of his righteous diſpleaſure againſt the Sin of <hi>looking back.</hi> Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ſaith, <note n="*" place="bottom">Theol. ref. v. <hi>1.</hi> p. <hi>257.</hi>
                     </note> That it is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife, who was turn'd into a Pillar of Salt, was ſaved notwithſtanding this Judgment ſent upon her by GOD. We have (ſaith he) no ill Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of this Woman in the Scripture: [he might as truly have ſaid, that we have no good one:] we cannot (ſaith he) gather from any thing that is ſaid in the ſacred Hiſtory that ſhe had been a wicked Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: [neither can we that ſhe had been a righteous Perſon:] But this we know, ſaith he, that ſhe was the Conſort of a pious Saint, and beloved of GOD: [we alſo know that a wicked Woman is ſometimes the Wife of a godly Man:] And we know, ſaith he, that ſhe was mercifully deliver'd out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as well as her Husband: [ſo might <hi>Lot's</hi> Sons in Law have been, had they not laugh'd at the warning gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them.] Tho' I perceive not the ſtrength of thoſe Reaſons which the <hi>Doctor</hi> gives, why it is not improbable that <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife was a good Woman, yet I am diſpos'd to be of the moſt Charitable Opinion, if there are as probable Grounds to ſupport it as the

contrary. And if ſhe was a good Woman, the Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment inflicted on her may the more deter the Saints from looking back: for it ſheweth how the Jealous GOD reſents this Sin in his own Children.— Let them remember <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife, and not imitate her Sin, but <hi>Paul's</hi> Example; Phil. 3.13, 14. <hi>Brethren, I count not my ſelf to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; I preſs toward the mark, for the Prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> — Let them remember <hi>Lot's</hi> Wife, that ſo they may reſiſt and vanquiſh all Temptations to Apoſtacy: and if they do ſo, they ſhall become glorious <hi>Pillars</hi> in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Temple, bearing the moſt honourable Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Rev. 3.12, 13. <hi>Him that overcometh, will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God, and he ſhall go no more out: and I will write upon him the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God, which is new Jeruſalem, which cometh down out of Heaven from my God; and I will write upon him my new Name.</hi>
