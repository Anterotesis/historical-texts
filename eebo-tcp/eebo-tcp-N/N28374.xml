            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>FUNERAL ORATION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN obedience to your<note n="*" place="bottom">The two Houſes of Congreſs.</note> will, I riſe your humble organ, with the hope of executing a part of the ſyſtem of public mourning which you have been pleaſed to adopt, commemorative of the death of the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious and moſt beloved perſonage this country has ever produced; and which, while it tranſmits to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity your ſenſe of the awful event, faintly repreſents your knowledge of the conſummate excellence you ſo cordially honor.</p>
            <p>Deſperate indeed is any attempt on earth to meet correſpondently this diſpenſation of Heaven: for, while with pious reſignation we ſubmit to the will of an all-gracious Providence, we can never ceaſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting in our finite view of Omnipotent Wiſdom, the heart-rending privation for which our nation weeps. When the civilized world ſhakes to its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre; when every moment gives birth to ſtrange and momentous changes; when our peaceful quarter of the globe, exempt as it happily has been from any ſhare in the ſlaughter of the human race, may yet be compelled to abandon her pacific policy, and to riſk
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037807_0005_100F548AD2ED61F8"/>the doleful caſualties of war: What limit is there to the extent of our loſs?—None within the reach of my words to expreſs; none which your feelings will not diſavow.</p>
            <p>The founder of our foederate republic—our bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark in war, our guide in peace, is no more. Oh that this was but queſtionable! Hope, the comforter of the wretched, would pour into our agonized hearts its balmy dew. But, alas! there is no hope for us: our Waſhington is removed forever. Poſſeſſing the ſtouteſt frame, and pureſt mind, he had paſſed nearly to his ſixty-eighth year, in the enjoyment of high health, when, habituated by his care of us to neglect himſelf, a ſlight cold, diſregarded, became inconvenient on Friday, oppreſſive on Saturday, and defying every medical interpoſition, before the morning of Sunday, put an end to the beſt of men. An end did I ſay—his fame ſurvives! bounded only by the limits of the earth, and by the extent of the human mind. He ſurvives in our hearts, in the growing knowledge of our children, in the affection of the good throughout the world; and when our monuments ſhall be done away; when nations now exiſting ſhall be no more; when even our young and far-ſpreading empire ſhall have periſhed, ſtill will our Waſhington's glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faded ſhine, and die not, until love of virtue ceaſe on earth, or earth itſelf ſinks into chaos.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:037807_0006_100F547CD9C434E8"/>
How, my fellow-citizens, ſhall I ſingle to your grateful hearts his pre-eminent worth! Where ſhall I begin in opening to your view a character through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſublime. Shall I ſpeak of his warlike atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all ſpringing from obedience to his country's will—all directed to his country's good?</p>
            <p>Will you go with me to the Banks of the Monon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gahela, to ſee your youthful Waſhington, ſupporting, in the diſmal hour of Indian victory, the ill-fated Braddock, and ſaving, by his judgment and by his valour, the remains of a defeated army, preſſed by the conquering ſavage ſoe? Or, when oppreſſed Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, nobly reſolving to riſk her all in defence of her violated rights, he was elevated by the unanimous voice of Congreſs to the command of her armies: Will you follow him to the high-grounds of Boſton, where to an undiſciplined, courageous and virtuous yeomanry, his preſence gave the ſtability of ſyſtem, and infuſed the invincibility of love of country: Or ſhall I carry you to the painful ſcenes of Long-Iſland, York-Iſland and New-Jerſey, when combating ſuperior and gallant armies, aided by powerful fleets, and led by chiefs high in the roll of fame, he ſtood the bulwark of our ſafety; undiſmayed by diſaſter; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed by change of fortune. Or will you view him in the precarious fields of Trenton, where deep gloom unnerving every arm, reigned triumphant through our thinned, worn down unaided ranks:
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037807_0007_100F548DEEDFF830"/>himſelf unmoved.—Dreadful was the night; it was about this time of winter—The ſtorm raged—the Delaware rolling furiouſly with floating ice forbad the approach of man. Waſhington, ſelf collected, viewed the tremendous ſcene—his country called; unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall'd by ſurrounding dangers, he paſſed to the hoſtile ſhore: he fought; he conquered. The morning ſun cheered the American world. Our country roſe on the event; and her dauntleſs Chief purſuing his blow, completed in the lawns of Princeton, what his vaſt ſoul had conceived on the ſhores of Delaware.</p>
            <p>Thence to the ſtrong grounds of Morris-Town he led his ſmall but gallant band; and through an eventful winter, by the high efforts of his genius, whoſe matchleſs force was meaſurable only by the growth of difficulties, he held in check formidable hoſtile legions, conducted by a Chief experienced in the art of war, and famed for his valour on the ever-memorable heighths of Abraham, where fell Wolfe, Montcalm, and ſince our much lamented Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery; all covered with glory. In this fortunate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval, produced by his maſterly conduct, our fathers, ourſelves, animated by his reſiſtleſs example, rallied around our country's ſtandard, and continued to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her beloved Chief, through the various and trying ſcenes to which the deſtinies of our union led.</p>
            <p>Who is there that has forgotten the vales of Brandywine—the fields of Germantown, or the plains
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037807_0008_100F547E633E1840"/>of Monmouth; every where preſent, wants of every kind obſtructing, numerous and valiant armies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countering, himſelf a hoſt, he aſſuaged our ſufferings, limited our privations, and upheld our tottering re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public. Shall I diſplay to you the ſpread of the fire of his ſoul, by rehearſing the praiſes of the hero of Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toga, and his much lov'd compeer of the Carolina's? No; our Waſhington wears not borrowed glory: To Gates—to Green, he gave without reſerve the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe due to their eminent merit; and long may the Chiefs of Saratoga, and of Eutaws, receive the grateful reſpect of a grateful people.</p>
            <p>Moving in his own orbit, he imparted heat and light to his moſt diſtant ſatellites; and combining the phyſical and moral force of all within his ſphere, with irreſiſtable weight he took his courſe, commiſerating folly, diſdaining vice, diſmaying treaſon and invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating deſpondency, until the auſpicious hour arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when, united with the intrepid forces of a potent and magnanimous ally, he brought to ſubmiſſion the ſince conqueror of India; thus finiſhing his long career of military glory with a luſtre correſponding to his great name, and in this his laſt act of war affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeal of fate to our nation's birth.</p>
            <p>To the horrid din of battle ſweet peace ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and our virtuous chief, mindful only of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, in a moment tempting perſonal aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizement, huſhed the diſcontents of growing ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037807_0009_100F548F74B03090"/>and ſurrendering his power into the hands from which he had received it, converted his ſword into a ploughſhare, teaching an admiring world that to be truly great, you muſt be truly good.</p>
            <p>Was I to ſtop here, the picture would be incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, and the taſk impoſed unfiniſhed—Great as was our Waſhington in war, and much as did that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs contribute to produce the American Republic, it is not in war alone his pre-eminence ſtands conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; his various talents combining all the capacities of a ſtateſman with thoſe of the ſoldier, fitted him alike to guide the councils and the armies of our nation. Scarcely had he reſted from his martial toils, while his invaluable parental advice was ſtill ſounding in our ears. when he who had been our ſhield and our ſword, was called forth to act a leſs ſplendid but a more important part.</p>
            <p>Poſſeſſing a clear and a penetrating mind, a ſtrong and a ſound judgment, calmneſs and temper for delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, with invincible firmneſs and perſeverance in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions maturely formed, drawing information from all, acting from himſelf, with incorruptible integrity and unvarying patriotiſm: his own ſuperiority and the public confidence alike marked him as the man deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by heaven to lead in the great political as well as military events which have diſtinguiſhed the aera of his life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:037807_0010_100F54827172BCB8"/>
The finger of an overruling Providence, pointing at Waſhington, was neither miſtaken nor unobſerved; when to realize the vaſt hopes to which our revolution had given birth, a change of political ſyſtem became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible.</p>
            <p>How novel, how grand the ſpectacle, independent ſtates ſtretched over an immenſe territory, and known only by common difficulty, clinging to their union as the rock of their ſafety, deciding by frank compariſon of their relative condition, to rear on that rock, under the guidance of reaſon, a common government thro' whoſe commanding protection, liberty and order, with their long train of bleſſings ſhould be ſafe to themſelves, and the ſure inheritance of their poſterity.</p>
            <p>This arduous taſk devolved on citizens ſelected by the people, from knowledge of their wiſdom and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in their virtue. In this auguſt aſſembly of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and of patriots, Waſhington of courſe was found—and, as if acknowledged to be moſt wife, where all were wiſe, with one voice he was declared their chief. How well he merited this rare diſtinction, how faithful were the labours of himſelf and his compatriots, the work of their hands and our union, ſtrength and proſperity, the fruits of that work, beſt atteſt.</p>
            <p>But to have eſſentially aided in preſenting to his country this conſummation of her hopes, neither ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the claims of his fellow-citizens on his talents, nor
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037807_0011_100F5491B3266410"/>thoſe duties which the poſſeſſion of thoſe talents impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Heaven had not infuſed into his mind ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common ſhare of its aetherial ſpirit to remain unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, nor beſtowed on him his genius unaccompanied with the correſponding duty of devoting it to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good. To have framed a conſtitution, was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only, without realizing the general happineſs. This great work remained to be done, and America, ſtedfaſt in her preference, with one voice ſummoned her beloved Waſhington, unpractiſed as he was in the duties of civil adminiſtration, to execute his laſt act in the completion of the national felicity. Obedient to her call, he aſſumed the high office with that ſelf-diſtruſt peculiar to his innate modeſty, the conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of pre-eminent virtue. What was the burſt of joy thro's our anxious land on this exhilerating event is known to us all. The aged, the young, the brave, the fair, rivalled each other in demonſtrations of their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; and this high wrought delightful ſcene was heightened in its effect, by the ſingular conteſt between the zeal of the beſtowers and the avoidance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver of the honors beſtowed. Commencing his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, what heart is not charmed with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of the pure and wiſe principles announced by himſelf, as the baſis of his political life. He beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the indiſſoluble union between virtue and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, between duty and advantage, between the genuine maxims of an honeſt and magnanimous policy, and the ſolid rewards of public proſperity and individual felicity:
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037807_0012_100F5484B4CF2A40"/>watching with an equal and comprehenſive eye over this great aſſemblage of communities and intereſts, he laid the foundations of our national policy in the unerring immutable principles of morality, baſed on religion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifying the pre-eminence of free government, by all the attributes which win the affections of its citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens or command the reſpect of the world.</p>
            <q>"O fortunatos nimium, ſua ſi bona norint!"</q>
            <p>Leading thro' the complicated difficulties produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by previous obligations and conflicting intereſts, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by ſucceeding houſes of Congreſs, enlightened and patriotic, he ſurmounted all original obſtructions, and brightened the path of our national felicity.</p>
            <p>The Preſidential term expiring, his ſolicitude to exchange exaltation for humility returned, with a force encreaſed with increaſe of age, and he had prepared his farewell addreſs to his countrymen, proclaiming his intention, when the united interpoſition of all around him, enforced by the eventful proſpects of the epoch, produced a further ſacrifice of inclination to duty. The election of Preſident followed, and Waſhington, by the unanimous vote of the nation, was called to reſume the chief magiſtracy: what a wonderful fixure of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence! Which attracts moſt our admiration, a people ſo correct, or a citizen combining an aſſemblage of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents forbidding rivalry, and ſtifling even envy itſelf? Such a nation aught to be happy, ſuch a chief muſt be forever revered.</p>
            <p>

War, long menaced by the Indian tribes, now broke out; and the terrible conflict deluging Europe with blood, began to ſhed its baneful influence over our happy land. To the firſt, outſtretching his invincible arm, under the orders of the gallant Wayne, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Eagle ſoared triumphant thro' diſtant foreſts. Peace followed victory, and the melioration of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the enemy followed peace. Godlike virtue which uplifts even the ſubdued ſavage.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond he oppoſed himſelf. New and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate was the conjuncture, and great was the ſtake.—Soon did his penetrating mind diſcern and ſeize the only courſe, continuing to us all, the felicity enjoyed. He iſſued his proclamation of neutrality. This index to his whole ſubſequent conduct, was ſanctioned by the approbation of both houſes of Congreſs, and by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving voice of the people.</p>
            <p>To this ſublime policy he inviolably adhered, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by foreign intruſion, unſhaken by domeſtic turbulence.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Juſtum et tenacem propofiti virum</l>
               <l>"Non civium ardor prava jubentium,</l>
               <l>"Non vultus inſtantis tyranni</l>
               <l>"Mente quatit ſolida."</l>
            </q>
            <p>Maintaining his pacific ſyſtem at the expence of no duty, America faithful to herſelf and unſtained in her honour, continued to enjoy the delights of peace,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037807_0014_100F54864098C178"/>while afflicted Europe mourns in every quarter, under the accumulated miſeries of an unexampled war; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries in which our happy country muſt have ſhared, had not our pre-eminent Waſhington been as firm in council as he was brave in the field.</p>
            <p>Purſuing ſtedfaſtly his courſe, he held ſafe the public happineſs, preventing foreign war, and quelling internal diſcord, till the revolving period of a third election approached, when he executed his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted but inextinguiſhable deſire of returning to the humble walks of private life.</p>
            <p>The promulgation of his fixed reſolution, ſtopped the anxious wiſhes of an affectionate people, from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a third unanimous teſtimonial of their unabated confidence in the man ſo long enthroned in their hearts. When, before, was affection like this exhibited on earth?—Turn over the records of antient Greece—Review the annals of mighty Rome,—examine the volumes of modern Europe; you ſearch in vain. America and her Waſhington only afford the dignified exemplification.</p>
            <p>The illuſtrious perſonage called by the national voice in ſucceſſion to the arduous office of guiding a free people, had new difficulties to encounter: the amicable effort of ſettling our difficulties with France, begun by Waſhington, and purſued by his ſucceſſor in virtue as in ſtation, proving abortive, America took
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037807_0015_100F54976C5A9188"/>meaſures of ſelf-defence. No ſooner was the public mind rouſed by proſpect of danger, than every eye was turned to the friend of all, though ſecluded from public view, and grey in public ſervice: the virtuous veteran, following his plough<note n="*" place="bottom">General Waſhington, though opulent, gave much of his time and attention to practical agriculture.</note>, received the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſummons with mingled emotions of indignation at the unmerited ill-treatment of his country, and of a determination once more to riſk his all in her defence.</p>
            <p>The annunciation of theſe feelings, in his affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing letter to the Preſident accepting the command of the army, concludes his official conduct.</p>
            <p>Firſt in war—firſt in peace—and firſt in the hearts of his countrymen, he was ſecond to none in the humble and endearing ſcenes of private life; pious, juſt, humane, temperate and ſincere; uniform, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and commanding, his example was as edifying to all around him, as were the effects of that example laſting.</p>
            <p>To his equals he was condeſcending, to his infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors kind, and to the dear object of his affections exemplarily tender: correct throughout, vice ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his preſence, and virtue always felt his foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering hand; the purity of his private character gave effulgence to his public virtues.</p>
            <p>His laſt ſcene comported with the whole tenor of his life.—Although in extreme pain, not a ſigh,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037807_0016_100F5498F2048CD8"/>not a groan eſcaped him; and with undiſturbed ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity he cloſed his well ſpent life.—Such was the man America has oſt—Such was the man for whom our nation mourns.</p>
            <p>Methinks I ſee his auguſt image, and hear fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his venerable lips theſe deep ſinking words:</p>
            <p>"CEASE, Sons of America, lamenting our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration: go on, and confirm by your wiſdom the fruits of our joint councils, joint efforts, and common dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: Reverence religion, diffuſe knowledge through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your land, patronize the arts and ſciences; let Liberty and Order be inſeparable companions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul party ſpirit, the bane of free governments; obſerve good faith to, and cultivate peace with all nations, ſhut up every avenue to foreign influence, contract rather than extend national connexion, rely on yourſelves only: Be American in thought, word, and deed—Thus will you give immortality to that union, which was the conſtant object of my terreſtrial labours; thus will you preſerve undiſturbed to the lateſt poſterity, the felicity of a people to me moſt dear, and thus will you ſupply (if my happineſs is now aught to you) the only vacancy in the round of pure bliſs high Heaven beſtows."</p>
