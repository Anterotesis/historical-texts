            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is to be lamented, that in this country, few pens have been devoted to the cauſe of Chriſtianity. In remarking this, I do not conſider the numerous pamphlets and ſermons, which have appeared, ſo far as the deſign of them was, to extend the character of the writers, or to ſupport ſome ſide of a theological diſpute. Whatever is not addreſſed to the heart-will never reach the ſeat of Religion.</p>
            <p>The following is deſigned to explore the arts of infidels; to trace the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations of the Spirit of God; to open the leading doctrines of Chriſtianity, and to extend the Redeemer's kingdom. It may be read by the learned and the ignorant; may be uſeful to the gay and the ſerious, and equally pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the young and old.</p>
            <p>As the time and place of <hi>Clio's</hi> death, are among the unintereſting parts of his hiſtory, I have not noticed them; and in my connexion, have thrown in only thoſe facts, which his own manuſcript left untold.</p>
            <p>The printing is calculated for the eye, the language for the ear, and the ſentiments for the heart. That all may take effect, and that this may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the valuable objects of its publication, is the ſincere wiſh of</p>

            <head>MARTIN<hi>'s HISTORY OF</hi> CLIO.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>LIO was indebted to Nature, for feelings, exquiſitely ſenſible to all the occurrences of life. His pulſe beat high with joy, when he ſaw his friends in proſperity, and tears flowed in ſtreams from his eyes, when he attended ſcenes of diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>To education, he owed a cultivated mind, and to a knowledge of the world, an accurate acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the hearts of men. Though he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhed the ſecret tear; though he preferred the houſe of mourning to the houſe of feaſting; though he indulged rather in that ſorrow, which makes the heart better, than in the laughter of fools; yet he was more often found among the gay, than the gloomy.</p>
            <p>This proceeded, not from levity, but from a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain refinement of ſoul, which taught him to avoid ſcenes of woe, where he might betray a feeling heart, and expoſe a flowing eye to ſenſeleſs ſneers and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule. With me, his only boſom friend, has he ſpent many hours; and has often, from motives of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, waved ſubjects moſt near to his heart, fearing to give me pain: but he was as ignorant of my heart,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023207_0005_0FBE7FC4C7A03D70"/>as the world was of his; for how often would I gladly have mingled my tears with his tears, and have paid an united tribute to the dignity of human nature; but thoſe intereſting ſcenes are paſt; never to return.</p>
            <p>To an excellent family education Clio was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for an early acquaintance with the Chriſtian religion. His parents were the faithful ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, and taught their children <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their Creator in the days of their youth,</hi> and to believe the great truths of the ſacred ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>No pains nor expenſe were ſpared to give Clio the beſt education, which his country could afford. He was deſigned for the ſacred work of the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and his father was reſolved not to add to the number of blind guides, who, ignorant themſelves, preſume to inſtruct the world.</p>
            <p>Though Clio's heart was uncorrupted, though <hi>within</hi> he was penſive and ſerious; yet <hi>without</hi> he had a certain air of gaiety and volatility, which, however innocent, had almoſt proved his ruin: So neceſſary is it, that the manners and the heart be congenial. Though idlers, triflers and fools were always Clio's abhorrence; yet there was a kind of company, with whom he aſſociated, more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than them all. Theſe were ſubtle reaſoners, whoſe heads are warm; but whoſe hearts are cold; full of ſentiment; but void of ſenſibility. OF SUCH CHARACTERS, MY YOUNG FRIENDS, BEWARE!</p>
            <p>Theſe ſubtle aſſociates would often ridicule the duties of Chriſtianity; would call the religion of the New Teſtament, a ſcheme, juſt calculated for people of weak minds; would ſay, that revelation had no ſupport but fanaticiſm; and that if the clergy were not intereſted in its promotion, it would fall to the ground. The train was artfully laid;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023207_0006_0FBE7FC5EA998098"/>for Clio, jealous of his character as a ſcholar, was unwilling to be ranked among fools and fanatics.</p>
            <p>He began to hear with apparent pleaſure, of cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebrated deiſts, and was once perſuaded to toaſt the names of Hume, Voltaire, Bolingbroke and Chubb.</p>
            <p>He was young, therefore we are not to wonder, that with him, reaſonings, <hi>of which men would have been aſhamed,</hi> had an influence. He was perſuaded to read the writings of unbelievers, to the neglect of his ſtudies, and even of his bible, which, till this, he had never omitted, morning nor evening.</p>
            <p>His heart often reproved him, conſcience beat frequent alarms; but, the PRIDE OF SCIENCE pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and he began to diſtinguiſh himſelf, with his borrowed arguments, as a moſt penetrating caſuiſt.</p>
            <p>To my readers, it is not neceſſary to remark on the delicate and minute ſprings of the mind. None was more eaſily put into operation, than Clio's. He was on the verge of deiſm, at the opening of this firſt viſion, which I give in his own words.</p>

                     <hi>CLIO'S</hi> Father on a Death Bed.</head>
                  <p>IT was evening: the moon ſhone bright. The ſtars glittered in the heavens, ſo diſtinctly that I could call them by name. I admired the wonders of God in the firmament, and adored the Author of exiſtence. This recalled to my mind the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of creation, and the records of that book, which I had for ſome time neglected. For the moment,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023207_0007_0FBE7FC8AE7D42A8"/>remorſe took poſſeſſion of my ſoul. I retired to my ſtudy and took my Bible; but, on opening it, much of its grandeur was loſt, and no part ſeemed to invite my attention. I laid it down, and took up a book, entitled "THE RELIGION OF NATURE," in which the author attempts to prove himſelf more capable than his Maker, of propoſing a ſyſtem of faith and morals. However abſurd his attempt, the title then promiſed juſt what ſuited my turn of mind. I ſoon ran over the contents, and caſting my eye upon the chapters, caught, with a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory pleaſure, the following words: "This proves, that the writings of Moſes are farcical, that the ſtory of Ruth and Eſther is ridiculous; that the account of a theocracy is whimſical; and as to the Pſalms of David and the Prophecies, (as they are called) any man of tolerable genius, might write better. The Proverbs of Solomon are old ſentences, which were current in his day; and as to the New Teſtament, there is ſcarcely a page, but what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſomething incredible and impoſſible." He went on to ridicule the doctrine of miracles, and to ſhew, that no man of ſenſe would believe any thing, unleſs he knew the reaſon of it. I did not examine how he attempted to prove all this, nor what ſyſtem he propoſed in the room of it; but he ſaid enough to balance all the impreſſions, with which I ſat down, and I retired to reſt in a ſtate of abſolute ſuſpenſe.</p>
                  <p>My ſleep was confuſed, and towards morning, methought I was tranſported to the bedſide of my father who appeared to be in his laſt moments. It was a ſcene, which touched me to the heart. How diſtreſſed did I feel, at ſeeing my parent, the guide of my youth, ſo near the grave. To me the world had begun to propoſe its allurements; all
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023207_0008_0FBE7FC9C0341020"/>the objects of time and ſenſe ſeemed to be gilded. I had not then conceived a thought, that the colouring was all imparted from my own eye, nor had ſuſpected that when theſe eyes ſhould, like my father's, loſe their luſtre, the world would loſe its charms.</p>
                  <p>How fondly, and oſt how fatally, are youth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived! They purſue the ſhadow of a moment, and loſe the eternal ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems at this moment a reality, that my fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, feeble and almoſt breathleſs, took my hand, and ſaid, <hi>"Weep not, my ſon, I go to a better world. Truſting in my Saviour, 'to die will be everlaſting gain.' I expect you to preach the goſpel, and in a few years to ſee you following me, bringing with you the ſeals of your miniſtry and the crown of your rejoicing. The time will come, when like me, you muſt be ſurrounded by weeping friends, breathing your laſt. Keep that hour ever in mind, and you will be faithful to the ſouls of men. Avoid ſubtle reaſonings. Preach in its power and extent the doctrines of the croſs, and ever be found bearing about you the bleſſings of the goſpel of peace. Imitate your divine Saviour, go about doing good, viſit the ſick, comfort mourners, pour balm into wounds, and point out the Lamb of God, to all who are enquiring the way to Zion; and, my ſon, conſider that I ſhall expect ſoon to embrace you in a world, where we ſhall never part."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My father knew the tenderneſs of my heart, and forebore ſaying many things, which he might have added, and ſoon after appeared calmly to breathe his laſt, ſaying, 'INTO THY HANDS, MY SAVIOUR, I COMMIT MY SPIRIT!' Such was the impreſſion of the moment, that I would have gladly followed, and left the world to its vanities, and my deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive books to be cankered by their poiſons. At
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023207_0009_0FBE7FCB409B7CB0"/>waking, the impreſſion was freſh in my mind, and my pillow was moiſtened with tears. Though I found it but a dream of the night, it ſeemed like a warning from heaven. The ſolemn ſound of my father's voice ſtill rung in my ears, as if an angel ſpoke. I roſe and opened my Bible, and with what rapture did I turn over the leaves of that inſpired volume. Then with what contempt did I regard the feeble reaſonings of man, when oppoſed to the wiſdom of God. How could men leave ſuch foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of love for ſtreams of pride! How could they prefer the trifles of a moment, the rattles of an hour, to everlaſting riches! Is it poſſible that I was ever blind to theſe ſacred truths? And can I now think of cloſing theſe records of redeeming love? No. this ſhall be the man of my counſels. Of this goſpel I will be the herald. By this ſhall I be enabled to become an humble inſtrument of the Spirit, to lead enquiring ſouls into the way of all truth; to adminiſter the bleſſed comforts of our moſt holy religion to the mourners in Zion, and to lead the thirſty ſoul to the wells of ſalvation.</p>

                  <p>As well might Atheiſts talk of heaven, as Deiſts hope for future happineſs. Can their ſyſtems ſtand the conflagration?

                  <p>NOTHING could be more pleaſing, at this time, than to ſee Clio firm to his reſolution; but his conviction of the truth reſulted from feelings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by a viſion. I viſited him, while under all theſe impreſſions, which he has deſcribed. He ſhed abundance of tears at his former folly, and aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that he was now reſolved to be a chriſtian indeed. Knowing the quickneſs of his feelings, and convinced, that he relied upon his own ſtrength, I propoſed to him theſe words, which he has ſince told me, that he had afterwards occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider as peculiarly prophetic. <hi>"The youths ſhall faint and be weary, and the young men ſhall utterly fall."</hi> Had he then waited upon the Lord, his ſtrength would have been renewed, and he might have mounted, on the wings of the goſpel, as an eagle; but he fell, and great indeed was his fall. It is eaſy to deſcend, but hard to retrack our ſteps. Youth are eaſily charmed into the paths of vice. To them virtue ſeems a rugged way. Aſk the aged Chriſtian, and he will tell you, from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that THE WAYS OF VIRTUE ARE WAYS OF PLEASANTNESS. Aſk the aged ſinner, and he will tell you, <hi>"I was allured into the paths of vice. In the ſpring of life I ſet out on flowers, and for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023207_0011_0FBE7FCEE9C4FA58"/>time the path was delightful. I purſued it with the ardor of youth, farther than I can ever retrack, for lo! the winter of age is come, and the flowers are no more."</hi> Let youth be warned, that beneath the roſes of pleaſure are the briars of pain.</p>
                  <p>Clio had received much excellent advice, had heard the leſſons of experience; his impreſſions were ſtrong; but his heart was unguarded. His former aſſociates ſoon found admiſſion to his room. Wiſhing to perſuade them, he communicated the ſuſpenſe of his mind, his viſion, and conſequent reſolution.</p>
                  <p>They were too artful to ridicule him at once; but began to hint at the prejudice of education, on which they at length ſo much refined, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, that nothing ought to be believed, which we learnt of our parents; that all the experience to which the aged pretend, was only to make youth revere them, and imbibe their principles, without examination; that when people began to be old and gloomy, they ſaw every thing through a wrong medium. One proceeded ſo far as to ſay, that he deſpiſed all old muſty leſſons of his father; that he would think for himſelf, and that he did not want a ſtronger argument againſt any propoſition, than that it was maintained by our forefathers.</p>
                  <p>Clio propoſed the following anſwer: "Do we not grow wiſer as we grow older? and why ſhould not our parents be ſuppoſed to do the ſame. They have paſſed through this very time of life, and the ſun ſhone then as bright as now. We are not to ſuppoſe, becauſe many nights have interfered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their youth and ours, that their days were darker, or their minds leſs improved than ours. They have experience, and my father has often told me, that THE EXPERIENCE OF THE AGED, WAS
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023207_0012_0FBE7FD06AFE5518"/>BETTER THAN SILVER AND GOLD TO THE YOUNG. Can they have any motive to adopt wrong princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or to inſtruct their children in what they do not believe?"</p>
                  <p>His ſeducers had been accuſtomed to ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, and anſwered them partly with appearance of argument, and partly with ſneers and ridicule: "Solomon," they ſaid, "was for pronouncing vanity upon this world, when he was too old to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it." And they added—"No ſubject or object can make a juſt impreſſion, except at the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of obſerving it. Our parents may as well judge of the proportions of a building, at a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miles diſtance, as of our pleaſures, or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or religion, at their diſtance of age."</p>
                  <p>Clio gave ſome heed to this remark, not reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the infinite difference between mere ſubjects and objects of ſenſe, and thoſe moral principles and practices, the juſt conception of which, ever depend upon mature judgment and experience. SOPHISTRY HAS RUINED ITS THOUSANDS! 'Tis the engine, which the enemy of man moſt ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully employs againſt the minds of youth.</p>
                  <p>But theſe ſophiſts underſtood Clio's unguarded part, and there plied with ſucceſs. "How," ſaid they, "can a young man, of genius and talents, be dependent for his religion on his nurſe, and quote for argument, the prattle of a fire-ſide? Do not all ſubjects ſtand on their own baſis? If a religion be unreaſonable, it ought to be rejected; and if there be reaſons enough, by them let it be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; for MERE HEREDITARY RELIGION IS GOOD FOR NOTHING." This laſt remark being <hi>perfectly true,</hi> gave an air of truth to the preceding ones.</p>
                  <p>Clio's pride, as a ſcholar, was now called into exerciſe, and he conſidered himſelf to have renounced
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023207_0013_0FBE7FD305596280"/>nothing, when he conſented to try the truth of the book by argument. He reſolved to defend it againſt their attacks, and vainly hoped that theſe would be among his firſt converts.</p>
                  <p>Alas! little did he know his own ſtrength; for as yet he had never proved the armour of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, nor known the power of the Spirit of God. But this intereſting ſcene we have in his own words, which introduce the ſecond viſion.</p>

                  <p>FOR ever gloomy will appear to me that night, when, with my ſeducing aſſociates, I opened the ſacred volume, and vainly preſumed to eſtabliſh the eternal truth of God, upon the feeble reaſon of man. We had not even attained maturity of mind; mere youths, juſt ſtarted into being, and indebted for all our little knowledge to our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and inſtructors! yet we preſumptuouſly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned theſe our beſt friends, before the very tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of knowledge, which they had erected in our minds, and there ungratefully condemned them as old, as prejudiced, and unworthy to guide us. ALAS! HOW MANY YOUTHS HAVE BEEN RUINED BY AN AFFECTED INDEPENDENCE OF THOUGHT! HOW INDEPENDENT ARE SUCH OF REASON, OF GRATITUDE, OF SENSE AND REFLECTION!—But the word of God was opened, and mere children, who ought to have been under a father's rod, were ſitting with mock majeſty, to decide upon the truth of revelation. When David was champion of the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023207_0014_0FBE7FD61510BEF8"/>armies of Iſrael, he relied not o<hi rend="sup">ll</hi> his ſtone and ſling, but in the name of the Lord, and in the ſtrength of the mighty God of Jacob. But I, alas! had not even a ſtone nor a ſling; yet might have made ſome defence againſt my aſſociates, feeble as myſelf, had not they produced againſt me the mighty Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liahs, the champions of infidelity, who have long defied the experienced ſoldiers in the armies of Jeſus. To their helmets of braſs and mighty ſpears, what could I oppoſe? The conteſt was ſhort; I reſigned the Bible, renounced the doctrines of the croſs, which I was to have preached, and became more fatally than before, a victim to ſubtlety and ſophiſtry.</p>
                  <p>The event was ſuch as an experienced parent could have foretold. We triumphed together up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a reunion of ſentiment, and I retired to reſt.</p>
                  <p>Not long had my eyes been cloſed, when the well-known face of my father preſented itſelf to me. The natural benignity of his countenance was heightened by celeſtial ſmiles. He was apparelled in white, which I have ſince learned, were the robes of the Redeemer's righteouſneſs. He had in his right hand a branch of palm-tree, which he told me, was an emblem of victory; not gained by himſelf, but preſented by the mighty Conqueror. Says he, <hi>"I am permitted to leave yonder world, to viſit the ſon of my hopes: You are deſigned by the great Head of the Church, to be a miniſter of the goſpel, and to be inſtrumental in turning many from the error of their ways, to the wiſdom of the juſt.

                  <p>
                     <hi>"I appear to you, that you may never be led to doubt the truth of God. Behold, I have been tranſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to immortal life, and you ſhall live for ever: But I have left you in a world full of error and temptation, and am fearful that you will, in ſome unguarded mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be allured from the new and living way, which is opened through the veil, into the holy of holies."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How was my heart melted to ſee the love of my father ſurvive the grave! How overwhelmed with grief and ſhame to ſee him leave the world of glory, and the hallelujahs of heaven, to viſit a poor wretch, who, but a few hours before, had renounced his Saviour and his Bible!</p>
                  <p>With what ſweet ſerenity, and irreſiſtible elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, did he teach me the character of a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian preacher, and open to me the doctrines of the New Teſtament? With what earneſtneſs did he inſtruct me how to conduct the thunders of Sinai to the ſouls of men? THE LAW WAS THE MASTER WHICH LED ME TO CHRIST. How did he warn me againſt that religion, which is ſeated in the head, and which has no influence upon the hearts and lives of men? I wave the remarks which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued: they were full of tenderneſs, infinitely full of inſtruction. To them am I indebted for a knowledge of my duty.</p>
                  <p>I dared not to tell him, that I had renounced the goſpel, and trampled on the croſs; but he had been my guardian angel, and knew my conduct: yea, he knew the infirmity of human nature, too well to addreſs me with reproofs.</p>
                  <p>"I ſaw," ſays he, "my ſon, attempt to defend the word of God, upon principles of human rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

The truth of God was never ſubmitted to the reaſon of man. God is a Spirit; his ways are far above our ways: we ſee the effect, but in tracing the cauſe, get loſt in a labyrinth, and cannot ſee where the windings run. Alas! what is external or internal evidence <hi>without the power of God?</hi> The ſcholar may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the reaſonings and the eloquence of Paul. The philoſopher may trace the effects of Chriſtianity upon the nations, on which has ariſen the ſun of righteouſneſs. Miracles and prophecies may have weight with men, whoſe minds are not captious; but, my ſon, of all theſe outward evidences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware; they are the ſubtle contrivances of Satan. RELIGION SEATED IN THE HEAD IS NOT THE RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGION OF JESUS; yet ſuch may amuſe the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unſuſpecting. It is true, that ſome good chriſtians have been led to defend their Saviour, as Peter did, by a human weapon; but ſuch have been counſelled to return the ſword into the ſheath. The greater part of thoſe who have introduced evidences, are Deiſts, ſubtle enſnarers of the ſouls of men. OF SUCH, MY SON, BEWARE!</p>

If infidelity abounds; yet you are not commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to attack it. Sorely has the cauſe of religion been wounded by its beſt friends. They, from a motive of promoting its intereſts, have expoſed it to ridicule. Chriſtianity is not a ſcheme of human reaſon; it is the wiſdom of God. It cannot be ſupported on principles of reaſon.

The viſion was no more; but in the morning, the laſt word reſted in my memory, and by it I recalled the whole ſcene. The impreſſion was ſtrong. It produced a change in my ſentiments on the ſubject of religion, and I reſolved no more to enter the liſts againſt thoſe, who fought with human armour. Theſe were my reflections. <hi>"If Chriſtianity has influenced the lives of men, ſo has every other religion. If martyrs have died in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſo have they upon all ſubjects. If ſcripture language be ſublime, other writings are not infinitely inferior: And in ſhort, I can find no argument, which Chriſtians have adduced in favor of their ſyſtem, more powerful, than the arguments of infidels and Mahometans. If we ridicule the ſenſual paradiſe of this laſt claſs, they, in return, ridicule our ſenſual Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. They challenge as much right to derive their ideas of futurity from earthly pleaſures, as we have to derive them from ſilver, gold, and precious ſtones, the objects of ſenſe and avarice."</hi> In the event, my father's advice appeared juſt, that THE REAL TRUTH OF REVELATION DEPENDS UPON THE SPIRIT OF GOD.</p>
                  <p>I roſe, and having a large library at my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, employed ſeveral weeks in examining the writings of Leland, Tillotſon, Beattie, Lardner, Jennings, Butler, &amp;c. In the whole, no argument appeared, which was not eaſily anſwered; for none had adduced in proof the Spirit of God; <hi>too modeſt</hi> to challenge it themſelves, and <hi>too delicate</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude it upon the world. At that time, I lamented their manifeſt weakneſs and preſumption; but ſince have had reaſon to adore that wiſdom, which has denied to the reaſon of man, the power of God.</p>

My reſolutions were again formed; my plans were laid for ſpreading the goſpel. My Bible was much in my hands. I ſtudied cloſely its contents, but ſaw not its truths by the eye of faith. Human wiſdom was ſtill my foundation, and the pride of ſcience remained; yet, how deceitful is the heart of man!

                  <p>He found that moſt of the writings, for and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the authenticity of revelation, were artful efforts of deiſm: that a few only were written by <hi>profeſſing</hi> Chriſtians, and that theſe had rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed than defended the cauſe.

He ſaw that a PRIDE OF SCIENCE had ruined thouſands, and little ſuſpected this root of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his own heart. He began to prepare for preaching, like many thouſands, who have never drank from the ſpiritual rock.

But I could not fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the millions of men, who are exceedingly vicious and debaſed, abandoned to the meaneſt vices, to the profoundeſt ignorance, or the moſt horrid crimes.</p>

Men once ſyſtem-mad are not eaſily checked. My new doctrine would prove or diſprove any thing. I made it change the whole face of the natural and moral world. The earth was culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and all the bloom of Eden ſmiling in the midſt of winter. Men of all claſſes became moral and induſtrious. Hills lay low, and vallies roſe at my command; and here I ſaw clearly, that this principle was finally to prepare the way for a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennial ſtate. The influence of it began to be viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible in the abolition of ſlavery, in the increaſe of inſtitutions of learning, and in the revolutions of empire.</p>
                  <p>With ſhame I reflect on thoſe vagaries of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered brain, thoſe whims of an ungoverned fancy; yet this ſyſtem of dignity was then in all my diſcourſe; it regulated my choice of diet; was applicable to all profeſſions, to every body, and to every buſineſs under the ſun.</p>
                  <p>With confidence I intruded it into every body's affairs, and left my own eternal buſineſs undone. While I thought the doctrine my ſlave, which would go and come at my command; it was in fact my God. I worſhipped it, and paid to it the homage of all my faculties.</p>
                  <p>To crown all, Shafteſbury's ſyſtem (if only his name was omitted) proved the truth of revelation and elucidated all its doctrines. Once after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired walk, having wrought myſelf into a frenzy of dignity and moral ſenſe, I burſt forth into the following exclamation, <hi>"Franklin may boaſt of ſnatching lightning from the clouds, it ſhall be mine to ſhine in the moral world with more diſtinguiſhed fame. I'll teach men, that though the thunders of the mount, and the wrath of God muſt fall, I can render them
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023207_0023_0FBE7FEF2AAB2820"/>perfectly harmleſs. This ſyſtem ſhall be the conductor, and thus all the families of the earth ſhall be ſafe."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I had wrought up the figure to its higheſt pitch; but was more ſolicitous to preſerve a parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Franklin's glory and mine, than between the thunder of our clouds, and THE THUNDER OF THE ALMIGHTY GOD.</p>
                  <p>On returning, I opened my Bible, and between the original and tranſlation, new modelled the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the fall, proving that it was an actual <hi>riſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the firſt chapter of Iſaiah I found, that (oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe tranſlated) man was from the crown of his head to the ſoals of his feet <hi>all</hi> ſoundneſs.</p>
                  <p>In the New Teſtament much was wrong; but when I found, that in ſo many paſſages, we were aſſured, that the wrath of God ſhould be revealed upon all unrighteouſneſs of man, I concluded not to alter them, but to do better for God and men, ſaving the honor of the firſt, and the ſouls of the laſt. I contrived that when the wrath muſt come, it ſhould light upon the <hi>ſins;</hi> but leave the ſinner unhurt; and that in the laſt great day, when ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were ſummoned to appear before the bar of God, the <hi>ſins</hi> ſhould appear, and anſwer for the deeds, which they had done in the <hi>pure</hi> bodies of men; but—how could ſins appear alone, and where would the man be, in whom thoſe ſins were committed? All this was eaſily contrived, at that inventive time of life. The ſoul was to be ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the paſſions; theſe paſſions were to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the ſins; and the man, who had been an actual ſufferer by theſe paſſions and their ſins, would ſee the righteous ſentence of God executed upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="unknown:023207_0024_0FBE7FF3B3E1D470"/>
All theſe things were proved and illuſtrated by many texts of ſcripture. Every thing bent kindly to my purpoſe, and I little ſuſpected, that by puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the theory a little further, it would, by a like proceſs, prove that there was no need of a God, a Saviour, or a Bible.</p>
                  <p>At that time my mind was not ſtrong enough to advance thus far, though ſince I have done it. Upon this part of my hiſtory, I am led to remark the danger of indulging in theories upon religion, without recourſe to the Bible. I was at that time actually a deiſt, though I did not ſuſpect it; for I had impiouſly made the word of God conform to my ſyſtem, inſtead of conforming myſelf to the inſallible ſtandard of truth.</p>
                  <p>My Bible was open more than ever; but it was no longer GOD'S BIBLE. I admired revelation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but it was only thoſe parts of it, which were an exact tranſcript of <hi>my</hi> mind and will, not of God's; and when any doubts aroſe, I huſhed them by the words INTERNAL EVIDENCE, MORAL SENSE. Theſe were univerſal opiates.</p>
                  <p>My ſleeping viſions were full of truth, but this waking viſion I ſhall ever have reaſon to conſider, as a contrivance of Satan, to effect the ruin of my ſoul. Shall I add, that ſo ſtrong was my deluſion, that with a new goſpel, thus made by myſelf, I had the confidence to propoſe to be recognized, in the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al form of the country, as a miniſter of the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>"I was prompt and confident in my anſwers, and upon leaving the room, was perſuaded, that in a few minutes I ſhould be recalled, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with a licenſe, accompanied with many compliments.</p>
                  <p>"Alas! how little of the Chriſtian did I then feel, expecting that a written paper would make me a preacher of righteouſneſs; and with what earthly rhapſody did I look forward to the next Sabbath, when an admiring audience would be charmed with the eloquence of my tongue, and aſtoniſhed at my diſplay of claſſical knowledge. O! that that hour, which has long ſince flown with intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of my pride to the recording angel, had been then dark as it now is; but alas! the time is coming, when all our yeſterdays ſhall advance, in ſolemn ſtate, from the ſhades of time, and riſe up in judgment againſt us. Though to us they are for ever gone, yet they are ever preſent to the Ancient of Days. How often have I wiſhed to ſeize an hour, which had been witneſs of my ſins, and prevent its going to appear againſt me: but all our paſt hours are gone, and ſoon we muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them.</p>

"Theſe are my preſent reflections; but then I was looking forward to a long train of years, each hour of which was to witneſs my glory, and the triumph of my genius. But ſoon was my pride checked, and this oil of gladneſs turned into the gall of bitterneſs. Soon was I made to ſee my folly, and to feel like my kindred duſt and aſhes; for O! when recalled, can I record the ſcene? My youthful levity was ſoon repreſſed, by the ſight of thoſe aged fathers of the church, who were ſitting with ſolemn dignity and chriſtian meekneſs wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my return. Not to commiſſion me to preach! not to flatter my pride! but to reprove my folly and preſumption. Each look went to my heart, and there remains. At length, after a ſhort ſilence, the moſt aged roſe up; tears fell from his eyes, which I ſhall ever think, were ſacred to the cauſe of Jeſus; and addreſſed me in ſuch language, as never before came from the lips of man. Each word was like the point of a diamond to my ſoul; at this moment I feel the depth of the engraving, and there it will remain through eternity. Even angels will ſee it with pleaſure, and men cannot read it without inſtruction."</p>

                  <p>MY young friend, our aged hearts leap for joy, when we ſee the ſons of the prophets riſing up to fill our places. We rejoice to ſee genius and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, devoted to the cauſe of Chriſtianity; but we grieve to ſee you ſeduced by principles, which are
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:023207_0027_0FBE7FF79D6C3A00"/>poiſonous to our profeſſion. If you imagined, that your ſentiments and diſcoveries were new, you are much deceived. If you expected that mere human learning would procure our approbation, you miſtake our characters. We challenge no right to <hi>commiſſion</hi> men to preach. <hi>That</hi> can be derived only from the great Captain of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Men may licenſe you to preach; but they only give you a human power, and can you in your ſoul think that of any avail? We could only examine, whether you could teſtify to us a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from above; for remember, that THOUGH BISHOPS CAN MAKE PRIESTS, AND COLLEGES CRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATE DOCTORS, GOD ALONE CAN MAKE A CHRIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIAN. From the great Head of the church alone do we derive a right to ſpeak in the name of God.</p>
                  <p>Have you the witneſs within your own heart? Has Jeſus called you to preach? Did you ever hear the voice of the great Shepherd? Has the heavenly Dove ever deſcended and abode with you? Or did you vainly imagine that the grace of God arrived through the medium of a diploma?</p>
                  <p>My ſon, we reproach you not; from our hearts we wiſh you grace and bleſſing; but we have to render an account, and cannot, without daring impiety, recommend one to preach a Saviour, whom he has not known?</p>
                  <p>We judge your ſentiments dangerous and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and though we might propoſe you to the world, as a ſcholar, we cannot recommend you as a miniſter of the New Teſtament. Though we are pleaſed with the promptneſs of your genius, and with the amiableneſs of your manners, yet you ſeem far from the kingdom of heaven.

                     <hi>MARTIN</hi>'s CONNEXION.</head>
                  <p>CLIO retired with a mixture of confuſion and reſentment. A deadly ſtroke had been aimed at his pride; yet there was a ſerious plainneſs in the addreſs, which filled him with awe. For ſeveral days, he was penſive and irreſolute. At times he would burſt out into the bittereſt reproaches againſt his examiners. He could not bear to renounce his favorite ſcheme of MORAL SENSE. In its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to every new ſubject, ſomething occurred which gratified his pride of ſcience. He reſolved, however, to believe the Bible, and to <hi>bring down</hi> its truths to a level with the underſtandings of men. In this proceſs, he pared off one incredible after another; till at length the whole Bible was gone. I wave many things, which now occured; they were too painful to his own mind, when I laſt ſaw him; but one incident cannot be omitted.</p>
                  <p>One day, ſitting and converſing with him, I took occaſion to recal the viſions which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to me, and the manifeſt means of Providence in bringing him to a knowledge of the truth. He
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023207_0029_0FBE7FFCA4EE6C08"/>ſeemed much agitated for the moment, then took up his Bible, claſped it, and threw it upon his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with ſome vehemence, then burſt into tears. ſaying, "My friend, I wiſh never again to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with you on this ſubject. I am now reſolved, and neither arguments nor viſions ſhall move me. THAT BOOK I GIVE TO FOOLS AND FANATICKS."</p>
                  <p>After this, he became a man of the world, was totally careleſs of religion; yet he profeſſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the being of a God, and in the immortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the ſoul. Virgil's account of a future ſtate, he would often ſay, was far more rational, than the Bible account; and that if he was honeſt and tolerably moral, he ſhould get ſafe enough to Elyſium.</p>
                  <p>He found, in a converſe with the world, that his favorite ſyſtem often betrayed him; but could not yet perſuade himſelf to renounce it.—He was ready to diſpute with Chriſtians, Deiſts, or Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, and could perſonate either of thoſe characters. He had ſtudied accurately the philoſophy of the ſchools of Athens, and by an happy talent, had ſo moderniſed it, that all the wiſdom of enlightened Greece appeared his own.</p>
                  <p>He underſtood the ſyſtem of Berkley, and could reduce to decimal fractions, infinitely, the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of matter; could even ſubdivide atoms ſo ſmall, that they were inviſible to the human eye, and inconceivable by the human mind; or at pleaſure he could prove that the whole earth was one conjoint, indiviſible, immenſe atom. He could place the earth on a tortoiſe, or ſuſpend it in the air; could make it whirl millions of miles in a ſecond, or be totally at reſt. He had diſcovered the weak ſide of human nature, and was ſure of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023207_0030_0FBE7FFE276D8180"/>being <hi>thought learned, when he converſed, ſo that no one underſtood him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His pride of ſcience was now in its zenith, and by all the ignorant, he was eſteemed a prodigy. He did not care to converſe with the learned, who practiſed, as he did, the magic power. No credit was to be gained from thoſe who were in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. He well knew the jealouſy, and enmity, which generally ſubſiſts between your great met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphyſical and unfathomable ſcholars.</p>
                  <p>He diſcovered that the loudeſt talker, and the boldeſt aſſerter was generally moſt applauded; and that the laurels of genius were never to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from learned competitors. He reduced theſe obſervations to a general principle, which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to all arts and profeſſions, forming a complete "SYSTEM OF HUMAN NATURE," which I have in manuſcript.</p>
                  <p>I have no occaſion to notice his travels, his books, or his company, only ſo far, that the reader may trace his <hi>pride of ſcience, and the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of infidelity;</hi> nor muſt we forget, that even now were perceivable, in ſome meaſure, the effects of a GOOD EARLY EDUCATION. This had an unſeen influence, and was finally improved, by the Spirit of God, for his recovery.</p>
                  <p>His guardian parent ſeemed to have forſaken him; his viſions were no more; all his partial convictions and reſolutions forgotten, and he was left to himſelf. "This earth," he ſaid, "was his preſent reſidence, and this life, the only one which he was abſolutely ſure of: that he was reſolved to <hi>live,</hi> while he did live, and if after he died, another life ſhould be given him, he would make the moſt of it."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="unknown:023207_0031_0FBE8000E96F9310"/>
Such converſation often purſued by his friends, at length led him to doubt the immortality of the ſoul. This alarmed him. He began the enquiry; but as he went <hi>from</hi> the word of God, he ſoon got involved in total darkneſs. He could ſee no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in this reſpect between men and birds, beaſts, fiſhes and inſects. All ſeemed to be rational for all their purpoſes of life. No one had return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from any other world. In fact, having no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the nature of the ſoul, he was ſoon in want of premiſes: this reduced him to a dearth of argument, and at length he reſolved, that the common ideas of immortality were abſurd.</p>
                  <p>His manuſcript treatiſe upon this is long and full of laboured ſophiſtry. He had exerted all the powers of his ſoul to prove, that he had no ſoul; but a doubt occurring, how this principle of life could be annihilated, he fell into the doctrine of <hi>tranſmigration.</hi> This was long a favorite ſcheme. He illuſtrated it clearly (as he thought) by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between the powers and paſſions of men, and thoſe of other animals, and fully concluded, that at death, the innocent and good would be changed into doves; the vicious and bad into venomous ſerpents; the idle and uſeleſs into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant infects. He purſued the ſyſtem in this whimſical manner, and for himſelf reſolved to be an eagle.</p>
                  <p>He was pleaſed with this change of being, and delighted with this creature of his fancy; he even ſpent whole nights in drawing concluſions in fav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of it, from various experiments in anatomy.</p>
                  <p>I make this ſhort extract, from this part of his manuſcript, to ſhew how wild and diſtracted men will be in their reaſonings, when once they have left the records of truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:023207_0032_0FBE800362EB6848"/>
But ſteep is the deſcent to the ſhades of error. Clio was not to reſt here. He caught by accident a book in an old library, entitled, "MAN A MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHINE," written by La Metrie. This was the very ſubject which lay next to tranſmigration. He took it up, merely to gratify curioſity; but the old philoſopher underſtood very well the machinery of man; too well for Clio. From the firſt page, he was led to the ſecond, and ſo on through the book. He made no pauſe, and no concluſions; but half convinced, gave it a ſecond reading, again a third. THE PRIDE OF SCIENCE was touched; he longed to be maſter of the ſyſtem; though he was ſtill unreſolved to admit it.</p>
                  <p>But we often reaſon ourſelves into blindneſs. He reaſoned upon the ſtructure of the human bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of which he had obtained a moſt accurate knowledge; upon the neceſſary ſeat of the living principle; ſhewed how the nerves conducted mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic to the ſoul, and how all objects of ſenſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed their impreſſions. He then reaſoned upon the compartments of the brain, and their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate uſes; of the effect, which a diſordered ſtate of body has upon the ſoul; of the operations of diet; of the circulation of the blood, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe he would throw out to his adverſaries, as mere trials of their ſkill; then when their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were exhauſted, he would come out with his main body.</p>
                  <p>This was fortified on every ſide, by the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt innate ideas. He would ſay, if we come into the world without one idea, and if this pretended ſoul never receives any, except through the ſenſes, have we any argument that the ſoul is capable of receiving ideas without ſuch a medium? Again, if reflection be deſtroyed, when a man is
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:023207_0033_0FBE800D774D8FF0"/>ſtunned, or when one is drowned for a ſhort time, what is this ſoul but a part of the body? How can it exiſt ſeparate from it? What is it ſeparately? It is nothing and vanity: it has not half the properties of fixed air. His antagoniſts being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to define their terms againſt him, were foiled as he was at firſt, for want of premiſes.</p>
                  <p>He would purſue the triumph by remarking how far the oppoſite doctrine muſt carry: that it muſt prove the perpetual exiſtence of the living princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, both in brute animals and vegetables; and he would add with emphaſis, if we renounce La Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie's principle, <hi>even the ſtones of the ſtreet would be immortal, and we might expect to ſee rocks in a courſe of ages, riſing into rational life, and haranguing an audience of rivers and foreſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he was rallied upon theſe flights, he would coolly lead his antagoniſts into the old doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the ſchools, OF AN UNIVERSAL ATTRACT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING PRINCIPLE OF LIFE, IN THE CENTRE OF THE MORAL WORLD; would aſſert that all living nature was drawn by it from lower to higher grades, thro' eternity; here he would lead them from the loweſt vegetable up to the higheſt exiſtence; and as they could ſeldom follow him, through all the mazes of natural hiſtory, they were ſoon loſt and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the triumph was completely his own.</p>
                  <p>Clio longed to make <hi>this</hi> laſt theory his own; but it would lead him too far back, and his bent was forward; he was for ANNIHILATION. Long had he left his favorite ſyſtem of <hi>moral ſenſe,</hi> and was too proud to look back.</p>
                  <p>The ground was now his own, and he could walk through regions of fancy, before untrod by man.</p>
                  <p>

Alas! how many thouſands have left the fair ſurface of truth and evidence, to explore mines and caverns! How many have forſaken the culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated grounds of knowledge, and the abodes of rational ſociety, to explore deſarts, or foreſts, in which was never heard the voice of man.</p>
                  <p>I have recorded theſe things of Clio ſo minutely, as this was a moſt intereſting part of his life; and as it opens a ſcene, perhaps unparalleled on our records, of the intricate wiſdom of God.</p>
                  <p>Whatever affords new proofs of an over-ruling Providence, and ſhews his influence upon the minuteſt actions of men, in operating his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of grace, has a tendency to inſpire us with chriſtian gratitude and admiration.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe, who have not read the ancient ſyſtems of philoſophy, may here have noticed ſome of their leading traits.

                  <p>—SHOULD my hiſtory ever reach the light, may it be a leſſon to the youths who ſhall follow me!</p>
                  <p>In early life, I was a victim to the pride of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The knowledge, which I derived from my parents, was exerted to prove, that no reſpect was to be paid to their parental inſtruction. My know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, derived from the Bible, was exerted to prove that Bible falſe. Then all theſe acquirements were employed as rebels to my God, my Saviour, and my Bible, in ſupporting the cauſe of their bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enemy.</p>
                  <p>I even endeavored to gain the influence of the officers of heaven, that I might be a ſecure ſpy in the camp of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>At length I impiouſly renounced my Bible to fools and fanatics. I even improved the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal faculties of my ſoul, to prove that my ſoul was formed of duſt and aſhes, and gloried in the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of eternal ſleep. I made ſtocks and ſtones my brethren and ſiſters, and improved the breath which God had breathed into my noſtrils, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world, that my breath was my own. Worſe than all, I improved not only the light of my mind, but even the ſeven golden candleſticks, to light me into the glooms of heatheniſh igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſuperſtition.</p>
                  <p>THIS WAS AT A TIME, WHEN I LOVED DARK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS RATHER THAN LIGHT. WHEN MY EYES COULD NOT ENDURE THE CELESTIAL GLORY OF THE BRIGHT AND THE MORNING STAR.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:023207_0036_0FBE8014D7FF2870"/>
Why ſhould I then retain God in my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when I had denied his wiſdom, his word, his providence and his works? Without theſe there is no God. I did not do it. I was a <hi>conſiſtent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel,</hi> and purſued my principles to the very gates of hell. On my principles there was no need of a God; for I then could as well have conceived of matter ſelf-exiſtent, ſelf-created and eternal, as of a being with all theſe attributes, capable of creating it, with all its forms and modifications. I will not proceed; it is enough that I denied the God who made me, that I erected atheiſm upon the foundation of infidelity. I boaſt not that I underſtood the economy of Satan's kingdom, and that I was his maſter-builder; perhaps the only one, who ever made uſe of all his materials, in erecting to the pinnacle, a temple of his worſhip. The time is come, when I lie low and feel humble for theſe diſtractions. Pity, O! my friends, the weakneſs of my youth; but rejoice with me now, ſince the Spirit of the Lord hath touched me.</p>

                     <hi>MARTIN</hi>'s CONNEXION.</head>
                  <p>CLIO has ſo frequently interwoven the early and latter ſcenes of his life, that I am often oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to interrupt his own narration, to preſerve a clear connexion in the mind of the reader.</p>
                  <p>We are now to contemplate Clio in the depth of infidelity. He could get no farther from moral light. But this was to be his tropic, from which
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:023207_0037_0FBE801638D96FB0"/>we ſhall ſee him gradually advancing back. With what heart-rending eloquence has Clio often deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to me the ſtate of his mind, at this gloomy period. I muſt reluctantly omit to record it, and leave the reader to purſue the thought.</p>
                  <p>Clio, by a fortunate accident, took up the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of old Python, maſter of the ſceptical ſchool in Athens; this he read with pleaſure, and became perſuaded to doubt of every thing. He had never reflected, that upon moral ſubjects, the world have agreed to adopt certain firſt principles, which no man can diſpute more fairly, than he can the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the alphabet. Old Python had propoſed a great number of the plaineſt firſt principles, and challenged all the other ſchools, to ſupport any one of them, by abſtract reaſoning. Knowing, that this could never be done, he had proceeded to ſhew, <hi>that the great truths in all the ſciences were only arbitrary axioms, which owed their ſupport to the credulity of man; that truth itſelf was but a relative term, and that any man of tolerable acuteneſs might confound any ſubject, or any reaſoner, by denying his firſt principle, and obliging him to attempt the proof of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here Python proceeded to record his victories over the logicians of his day. Clio was convinced, not reflecting that a true diſciple of Python muſt <hi>doubt</hi> the truth of what he wrote. He became a Sceptic, which is one grade <hi>better</hi> than an Atheiſt, for IT IS BETTEK TO DOUBT, WHETHER THERE BE A GOD, THAN TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO GOD. Clio had ſome ſecret wiſh to live beyond this ſtate of being, and endeavored to refine ſo far upon ſcepticiſm, that when he actually died, he might always be in doubt, whether he was or was not dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:023207_0038_0FBE8017CF151968"/>
He was ſtruck with the abſurdity of this, and turning about to purſue the principle, among the different doctrines of religion, and ſyſtems of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy in the world, he reſolved to ſap their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and to make them totter. He ought to have <hi>doubted</hi> his ſtrength; but here we ſhall ſee the Spirit of God, beginning to operate upon him. We ſhall ſee it improving, for his recovery, thoſe very faculties, which Satan had before employed for his ruin. Even this pride of ſcience was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as a leading inſtrument. Here let us pauſe a moment, that we may notice, with all due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the wiſdom of God; for we ſhall ſoon ſee, in Clio's converſion, how <hi>he improves not only good early education, but even pride and other perverſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to accompliſh his purpoſes.</hi> "Even the wrath of man ſhall praiſe God."</p>
                  <p>Clio was now zealouſly engaged to attack the ſyſtems which he had formerly advocated, when a <hi>doubt</hi> aroſe in his mind, whether his former deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon them had been juſt. This led him back through all the different ſubjects, which we have noticed; recalled to him his viſions; doubts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; he ſeemed to ſee truth on both ſides; his mind was perplexed; he retired to reſt, and had the following viſion, which is recorded in his own words.<note n="*" place="bottom">"Let mortal tongues attempt to ſing."

                  <p>—THOUGH my eyes were cloſed upon every earthly object, yet I ſeemed ſitting by my deſk, wrapt in thought, and holding in my hand "THE ANALYSIS OF HEATHEN PHILOSOPHY." At
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:023207_0039_0FBE801C30BFCC20"/>once my father ſeemed to ſtand by me and to ſay, <hi>"My ſon, have you drank of the waters of oblivion? Is your memory dead to all your paſt life?"</hi> He pauſed. I endeavored to conceal the book. Says he, <hi>"Is that your Bible?"</hi> My face was like crimſon. He continued, <hi>"My child, how many ſons and daughters have you made converts to the truth of the goſpel?"</hi> Great drops of ſweat rolled from my face, and I fainted—On opening my eyes, my fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's countenance was ſoftened. On my deſk lay an open Bible, from which ſeemed to proceed rays, filling the room with a blaze of light. I caſt my eye upon the book, and ſaw St. John's hiſtory of the crucifixion. There was a ſolemn pauſe for a few minutes! My father then pointed to the book, ſaying, <hi>"Think you, my ſon, that to no purpoſe the vail of the temple was rent in twain? that the rocks burſt aſunder, and that the groans of Jeſus were heard from the top of Calvary?"</hi> He then recalled to my mind, the innocence of my early life, the purity of my thoughts, and indeed every ſcene, which could have a tendency to reſtore me to my duty. He plead with heart-melting eloquence, the tears of a mother, the fate of infidels, and the joy of angels at the return of a ſinner. He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured me, that he had watched me every moment, ſince his firſt appearance; though he had not been permitted to diſcover himſelf till this; that my errors were to be a leſſon to the youths of after times, and that the wiſdom and goodneſs of God, now to be exhibited, would give joy and triumph to the aged, who relied on the promiſes.</p>
                  <p>He added, <hi>"My ſon, I ſhall now depart, and you will not ſee me again, while you live; but remember that your days are numbered. You have a ſteep aſcent to climb, but you will have aſſiſtance infinitely better
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:023207_0040_0FBE801DB6C623F8"/>than mine.

Your feet will be finally taken from ſlippery places and ſet upon the rock; but firſt, my ſon, you will ſee much diſtreſs and affliction. Your hard heart will be ſoftened; your ſenſibility reſtored and improved. You will often deſpond, and your eyes will become as fountains of tears.

Into whatever employment you may be led, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſcene of trial, be honeſt and diligent, for if you endure, you will yet be a miniſter of the goſpel, able to divide rightly the word of truth.

                  <p>—IT pleaſed the divine Spirit, by a moſt ſingular method, to give me light on the ſubject of future rewards and puniſhments. I was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an inſtructor of youth. Warm in my imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I thought that moral ſuaſion alone was to be uſed; that ſchools were nurſeries for heaven, and that as puniſhments would not be inflicted in the laſt, they ought not to be in the firſt.</p>
                  <p>I undertook the taſk, as promiſing me an honeſt competence: was faithful to my employers; the children ſeemed as my own, and hours were not counted. My heart was in my buſineſs, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:023207_0042_0FBE80235D731000"/>in the proſpect of preſenting to my country, a long liſt of uſeful men, who ſhould riſe up to fill the places of the aged and dying. In my profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was neither brilliancy nor honor; but I fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hoped, that thoſe on whom I expended my life and health, would, after I was cold, riſe up and call me bleſſed. I wiſhed, that on the ſtone which ſhould cover my remains, might be inſcribed, <hi>"Here lies a man, who ſacrificed his life to the infant intereſts of his country, and found an early grave; but he was full of days, if we count them by his ſorrows, his pains, his miſeries, and the viciſſitudes of his life. Here he lies low in death; let the tears of a grateful public moiſten his grave."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I then thought, as I now do, that "HE DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SERVES NO STONE TO RECORD HIS NAME, WHO LEAVES NO ACTION TO ENDEAR HIS MEMORY."—With a heart warm as the world is cold, and having ever in view the end of life, I purſued the thought, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated the ſerious time, when followed by thoſe who were mine in the ſtricteſt bonds of nature, duty and affection, I ſhould be carried to the houſe appointed for all living. Then a long train of parents would follow, leading the children of my care, all in ſolemn ſilence, paying a tribute to my memory, more durable and precious than mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uments of marble.</p>
                  <p>Theſe I have found vain illuſions, mere waking "viſions of a baſeleſs fabric;" yet for the time, they gave joy to my heart, ſtrengthened my hands, and led me to exertions beyond the powers of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In my days, I had not leiſure for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon recreations of liſe; my nights were ſleepleſsly ſpent in preparations for the morning; yet my
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:023207_0043_0FBE80246D9C6C10"/>mind was active, my imagination bright, and my ſoul feelingly alive to all my duties.</p>
                  <p>At this criſis, I imprudently denied to nature, the repoſe which ſhe required, my health failed, and I became a ſubject of pain and gloom. All the feſtivities of life were courted. I reſorted to brilliancy and gaiety, and indulged in ſcenes of humor for relief. All was in vain. If I ſmiled! it was like the lightning of the heavens, which leaves the eye in more "intimate darkneſs." It was a tranſient gleam of brightneſs on the face, which brings no warmth to the heart. How oft, that I might not give pain to a friend, have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, where no eye could ſee me, to commune with my own heart, and to aſk from it that relief which the world could not give.</p>
                  <p>In moments of gloom, all the painful images which through life have been ſeen, all the ghoſts of departed actions, appear at once, ſhewing their hideous ſpectres to the eye of the ſoul. All the malicious demons, who had aimed cruel ſtabs at the reputation, now preſent anew their poinards, and "grin horribly a ghaſtly ſmile," inſulting the wretch's woe.</p>
                  <p>The whole ſcene is beyond deſcription; even the half cannot be told you; yet the whole was mine. They only know the pangs of death, who have felt its ſting.</p>
                  <p>At ſcenes like theſe, we aſk no tears from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eyes—no blood to flow with quick emotion in marble veins—no heart of ſtone to beat—no iron breaſt to heave with ſighs, nor tongue of ſteel to ſpeak; but they who <hi>can</hi> feel, <hi>will</hi> feel, and the tears of ſenſibility will flow; they will moiſten the manly cheek, and ſtream from the gliſtening eye, when the hand which holds this pen ſhall be no more.</p>

                  <p>Clio had tried the experiment of <hi>mild</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till he was fully convinced that it was <hi>ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> but he had ſaid ſo much in favor of it, that many had been perſuaded to believe as he had done.

                  <p>I RETIRED late to reſt, haraſſed with care: my limbs were indeed repoſed; but my mind was never more wakeful. It was winter, and the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:023207_0045_0FBE80282EF4F730"/>peculiarly ſevere; but I ſeemed inſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into a beautiful garden, where fruits and flowers were in perfection. The heat ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe, and I reſorted to an arbour for ſhade. My ears were ſoon ſaluted by a concert of the moſt muſical voices, ſeemingly of children. My curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity led me to follow the ſound, which appeared to retire as I advanced. They were ſweet notes, and I was deſirous to know what celeſtial choirs had reſorted to this retirement. I walked on haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily through a vale enamelled with flowers: if I trod upon a roſe, it drooped for the moment, but ſoon raiſed its bluſhing head with improved beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fragrance. I muſt pauſe a moment to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the kindneſs of Providence, in giving us ſuch active fancies, capable of enjoying the beauties of nature in idea, when in truth the ſeaſon had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted, with froſt and ſnow, the whole face of the earth. TO FANCY, TO WHIM, AND OFTEN TO FALLACY, ARE WE INDEBTED FOR HAPPINESS.</p>
                  <p>I reached the place, from which the ſound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and found a large ſchool of boys and girls, chanting a morning hymn to the praiſe of their Creator. There was an elegance in their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and a ſerene ſmile upon their faces, ſuch as I had never ſeen among my own children. I entered without heſitation. The maſter, who ſeemed, at firſt ſight, created to take ſuch a charming ſchool, beckoned me to take a ſeat by him.</p>
                  <p>The muſic ceaſed, and all fell upon their knees, raiſing their eyes, in the act of fervent devotion. The maſter then addreſſed the throne of grace, in a few words, moſt pertinent and ſtriking. All roſe; there was a perfect ſilence; all commenced their employments, which they purſued with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. If the maſter ſpoke, every ear was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:023207_0046_0FBE802A69F0FBF8"/>and every thing proceeded with perfect eaſe and harmony. This, I thought, proves that my former ideas were juſt; but I will enquire how this effect is produced.</p>
                  <p>I propoſed my queſtions, and ſuggeſted the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſments, which I had experienced in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to form ſuch a ſchool, and added, I ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in future, conclude the fault to have been in myſelf, "Who could even frown on ſuch inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents? What monſters are they who cruelly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict puniſhment on children?" I am aſhamed <hi>now</hi> to repeat all which I <hi>then</hi> ſaid; but as I was cloſing a laboured panegyric on my own ſagacity, and knowledge of the effect of moral truth upon the young mind, every thing ſeemed changed in an inſtant. The maſter aſſumed the appearance of an angel, and the children looked like cherubs and ſeraphs. The angel then addreſſed me. To ſuch alone can your principles apply with truth. Theſe are pure ſpirits, and this ſcene is all deſigned for your inſtruction. He then opened to me in clear and explicit terms, the doctrine of rewards and puniſhments, and taught me the wiſdom of God in ordaining them, and their fitneſs to the nature of man. <hi>How many poor wretches,</hi> ſays he, <hi>have been diſgracefully ſent out of this world, into a worſe, from the mere neglect of early diſcipline and control. Youth is the ſeaſon, when the rough and boiſterous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may be ſubdued, and if this ſeaſon be neglected, the life will be like a garden, where the growth of every uſeful thing is prevented by a multitude of weeds and brambles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He then added, "GO AND CONDUCT LIKE A FAITHFUL GARDENER." I waked, fully impreſſed with the viſion, and for ſeveral days revolved over the actual government of the King of the univerſe,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:023207_0047_0FBE802DEA0BD310"/>as it is diſcovered in his Providence, and in revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At length I eſtabliſhed a conviction, that pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments as well as threats were neceſſary for man, and that it was vain to expect the reaſon to aſſiſt my former theory, till this reaſon ſhould control the paſſions.

                  <head>IMMORTALITY <hi>of the</hi> SOUL.</head>
                  <p>HOW little do I value this emaciated body? It is welcome to return home, if my ſoul can have the ſame privilege. Surely ſome guardian angel watches my ſlumbers, and ſeizes the moment, when all my paſſions are aſleep, to teach my reaſon the moſt ſacred truths. O that my prejudice, error and pride would never wake!</p>
                  <p>If this be ſickneſs, let me be ſick, till death, for ſcarcely do I ſink into the arms of ſleep, when ſome unſeen power preſents to me the ſublimeſt viſions.</p>
                  <p>The laſt I cannot deſcribe; it ſurpaſſes my ſtrength and the powers of my pen.</p>
                  <p>Could I have written at the inſtant of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, my lines had been full of fire, they would have warmed every heart, not with poetic fire! No! for the genuine feelings of the ſoul, at ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trancing ſeaſons, ſcorn the aids of art, and the priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of meaſured lines. They burſt forth with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and delight to be arrayed in the ſlowing robes and charming dignity of proſe.</p>
                  <p>Can that ſoul be mortal, which is compoſed of ſuch heaven-wrought materials? Shall that ſoul die, which can for a ſeaſon bid adieu to the ſenſes and the clay, and ſoar to ſcenes immeaſurably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant? No! <hi>"The duſt ſhall return to its kindred duſt; but the ſpirit ſhall return to God who gave it."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At ſuch moments would I have waſted a wiſh to be ſure of immortality? No! I felt myſelf already
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:023207_0049_0FBE8032A2EEB408"/>in actual poſſeſſion of eternal being, full of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of life, which death can never deſtroy, nor the grave diminiſh.</p>
                  <p>Such was my confidence, that had the choice been my own, I would never have been reunited to the forſaken maſs. As ſoon would angels leave their ſeats of bliſs, their golden harps unſtrung, their bleſt ſociety forgot, and aſk for human bodies to inhabit this vile earth again. But to them how little is this world! its pomps, it pleaſures and its nonſenſe all! The crowns of monarchs, and the wealth of worlds, how trifling in their view!</p>
                  <p>But heaven is their bleſt abode, and there will they rejoice to dwell for ever. That world will never want for ſongs, nor God for praiſe. There ſhall daily arrive, from theſe lower courts, after a triumphant flight from ſenſe and pain, the ſpirits of the juſt. There ſhall cherubs ever ſmile, and ſeraphs ever burn before the throne of God.</p>
                  <p>Shall flimſy argument, ſhall ſubtle ſophiſtry, and nice-wrought ſcepticiſm <hi>unſoul</hi> the man, and reduce to a level with the lower creation, the image of God? Shall not the ſoul of the mother meet the ſoul of the child in the world of glory? Shall not the ſon, who in youth was ſunk into a watry grave, ſee his father again? Yes! The graves ſhall give up their dead, and friends, who parted with aching hearts, ſhall meet in a world, where tears ſhall be wiped from every eye.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt return to the body! muſt ſtay yet a little longer; but in prayer will I watch each riſing ſun, and ſwift in duty hail it to its ſetting.</p>
                  <p>Days, months and years ſhall roll on without regret. Fain would I ſeize the minutes of my to-morrows, and draw myſelf to heaven; but I
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:023207_0050_0FBE8036F7896C28"/>muſt wait till my change come. Death will never appal me; for I know, that even in the dark val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of its ſhadow, I ſhall ſee beams of light from the ſun of righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>In ſickneſs I will rejoice; even with preſent pains will be glad. Each pang will I regard as the beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of an angel; for as the body retires, the ſoul advances, and with one effort more I ſhall be gone.</p>
                  <p>With a moſt ardent exertion I ſprang; but the body had enchained me. I was ſtill its priſoner, and could not burſt the bands of life. I reached not the celeſtial goal. I ſprung not into heaven, but back to earth, and found myſelf awake, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with prodigious energy "LET OTHERS BOAST THAT THEY ARE BRUTES, I GLORY THAT I'M A MAN. LET OTHERS WISH FOR ETERNAL SLEEP, I SHALL BE FOR EVER AWAKE. LET OTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERS WASTE THEIR GOLDEN HOURS IN PROVING THAT GOD IS FALSE, I FEEL SOMETHING WITH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IN, WHICH PROVES THAT HIS WORD IS TRUE. THOUGH OTHERS CONSIGN SOUL AND BODY TO THE DUST, THE CLODS OF THE VALLEY CANNOT COVER MY SOUL. NO! LEGIONS OF ANGELS CAN'T CONFINE ME TO THE GRAVE. MY BODY WAS DESIGNED FOR THE DUST; BUT MY SOUL WILL INHERIT THE WORLD OF SOULS! ALAS! WHAT IS LIFE, IF WE LIVE NOT FOR EVER!"</p>

                     <hi>The</hi> TEMPLE <hi>of</hi> RELIGION.</head>
                  <p>IN the viſions of the night, when deep ſleep falleth upon man, methought I was tranſported in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a region beyond mortal view, and there beheld wonders, which no tongue can relate and no pen deſcribe.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps a faint deſcription may entertain the inquiſitive, may warm the cold, and lead the minds of the young and the aged, to that moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting ſubject, which excited my thoughts.</p>
                  <p>I found myſelf on an extenſive plain, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by multitudes of people, all crowding forward. The throng was prodigious, and each neglectful of his neighbour, was only ſolicitous to advance himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were of all ages, ſexes, colours, nations and languages on earth. Aſtoniſhed at ſuch a mingled group, and wondering at the object of their zealous purſuit, being unable to retire, and curious to be ſatisfied, I preſſed forward with the reſt.</p>
                  <p>When, lo! at once my eyes were ſtruck with the ſight of a magnificent building: It was large enough to contain all the families of the earth, and my firſt thought was, that the Father of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe had erected it, that he might aſſemble in one place all his children. I was tranſported with joy at being ſo near the door of my father's houſe. I had paſſed no valley of the ſhadow of death, and imagined that the time was come, when from all
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:023207_0053_0FBE8040EC533E88"/>the winds of heaven, were collecting the ſons and daughters of the Lord Jehovah.</p>
                  <p>Elevated with the thought, I contemplated all the promiſes and prophecies of our religion; and was, for the time convinced, that this was no other than a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</p>
                  <p>On our arrival, I perceived that this building was ſurrounded by numberleſs little chapels, into which the multitude crowded with eagerneſs. They ſoon diſperſed, and I was left alone to examine the place. I found over each an inſcription. Some were ſacred to Mahomet; ſome to Paul, Apollos and Cephas; and among the reſt, was aſtoniſhed to find one to the unknown God; but more to ſee it crowded by innumerable votaries. While I was muſing upon theſe things, one, in the likeneſs of a man, approached me, and ſaid, "Know that this is the temple of religion. The chapel by which you ſtand is frequented by thoſe, who have not God in their knowledge. The others are zealous partizans; their doors are ever thrown wide open, and there are ſome always at the entrance, to bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon in ſtrangers, and to increaſe their numbers. He then pointed me to ſeveral, who conſtantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſome of their number, compaſſing ſea and land, to make proſelytes." As we paſſed along, I was ſolicited at every door to enter: perſuaſive motives were uſed to no purpoſe; for I was anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to get within the great temple. As we came round to the door, I perceived it locked, and over it, in plain letters—</p>
                  <p>TO GOD AND TO THE LAMB.</p>
                  <p>I propoſed to my guide, why the doors were ſhut. He replied, "This is a faint, earthly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:023207_0054_0FBE80426DAAC7D8"/>of the things which ſhall be hereafter; for in the city which is to come, there is no material temple, for the Lord God almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it; but here ſhall, in no wiſe, enter any thing that defileth: for holineſs becomes God's houſe for ever.</p>
                  <p>Thouſands of thoſe, whom you have ſeen, are daily applying for admiſſion; but few obtain it. The many plead their zeal in the ſervice of God; but this zeal is not according to knowledge. They plead their works; but theſe have been done to pleaſe men, and not with a ſingle eye to the glory of the Giver of life. They plead their prayers and alms; but theſe have never come up in memorial before God; they have not fed the hungry, nor clothed the naked, nor viſited the ſick, nor the priſoner. They have not ſold their goods, and given to the poor; they have not comforted the mourner, nor afforded relief to the dying; but they have lived in luxury and vanity; they have hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the mammon of this world; they have pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered their luſts and lived deceitfully. They have harboured malice, envy, hatred, bitterneſs, and ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery evil thing: yea, ſome have ſaid there is no God, and have denied the Lord that bought them; yet with all theſe abominations, they wiſh to enter this holy temple. But how gladly would they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their parties and their luſts, rather than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the ſociety of the happy beings within, for here, the high praiſes of God employ every tongue and gratitude to the Redeemer fills every heart. Their chapels are filled with men pleaſers, who ſay, Lord, Lord, merely to be heard of men, and lift up their eyes to heaven, that they may ſeem to pray; but he, whoſe eyes are as a flame of fire,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:023207_0055_0FBE8044F44D05D8"/>ſees their hypocriſy, and will cauſe them to fear and tremble in the day of his wrath.</p>
                  <p>While he was ſpeaking, the clouds had been gathering, and at this moment, the war of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments began, and I was almoſt petrified with fear. Never was a ſcene ſo full of terror; yet my guide was calm and ſerene, unruffled at the impending ſtorm. I noticed, as a flaſh of lightning gleamed acroſs his face, if ſeemed to remain, and he ſhone with the brightneſs of the ſun, and appeared like a burning ſeraph. Till this time of life, I had never known ſuch an exceſs of fear. The rolling of a diſtant thunder had always filled me with a ſolemn ſerenity; but now in awful terror, the lightning flaſhed upon my aſtoniſhed eyes, and the thunder, peal on peal, ſeemed rending heaven and earth, ready to burſt upon my devoted head. I had juſt breath to cry for mercy. I fainted, fell, and ſeemed to be no more—But I recovered, and at the moment of ſtanding on my feet, was haſting for ſhelter, to one of thoſe chapels. All, ſo far as I could ſee, were beckoning me to enter. As I was running towards them, on a ſudden the thunder craſhed them to atoms, and ſent to inſtant death all their votaries! But the great temple was unhurt, and appeared much more auguſt and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, than when ſurrounded by thoſe chapels. All was viſion, but to me ſeemed reality. My guide, ſeeing the agitation of my ſoul, by the ſcenes which had paſſed, took me by the hand, and ſaid, "Know that I am the angel of charity, who am entruſted with the keys of this temple," They, who were in thoſe chapels, thought themſelves ſafe, and were triumphing over their neighbours, in the vain imagination, that their own houſe ſtood ſtrong,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:023207_0056_0FBE804639763868"/>at the very moment when the thunder burſt upon them. They would all have offered you ſhelter; but had you believed them, ſee where you would have been. Adore then that goodneſs which ſtruck you to the earth; for had your own ſtrength per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, you would have been lying among yon ruins; he, who heareth prayer, heard your feeble cry for mercy, as you fell, and you are now alive, never to fear again; for behold! here he waved his hand towards the heavens, I caſt up mine eyes, and lo! the clouds were diſperſing, the rainbow of the covenant appeared, and in the midſt one like unto the Son of man, "having on his head a crown of gold, and in his right hand ſeven ſtars, and his countenance was as the ſun ſhined in his ſtrength," and he ſaid with a voice of infinite mildneſs, and a look of ineffable tenderneſs, "In my father's houſe are many manſions."</p>
                  <p>At this moment the angel opened the door of the temple, and beckoned me to enter, ſaying, Lo! here are they whom no thunders appal. They could look unmoved at the wreck of nature. They have all paſſed the ſcene which you have endured, and are now perpetually ſerene. Without you will be expoſed to frequent ſtorms; for thoſe chapels, lo! they are already rebuilt, and will be again demoliſhed. To me they appeared indeed rebuilt on the old ruins, and the dead bodies. They ſeemed larger than before, and all again filled.</p>
                  <p>The angel again beckoned me to enter. I fell upon my knees, with unſpeakable humility, and conſciouſneſs of my demerit, ſaying, "My heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, thou knoweſt that I am not worthy to enter under this roof; but I will for ever remain thus at the ſteps of thine houſe." The angel took
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:023207_0057_0FBE8047AA4FD538"/>me by the hand, and ſaid, "Thy Saviour is worthy: thou haſt given a cup of cold water to a diſciple in his name; he is a faithful Saviour, and thou ſhalt not loſe thy reward. Then he led me into THE TEMPLE OF RELIGION, WHERE, WITH FILIAL REVERENCE AND HEART<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FELT AWE, I JOINED THE BLESSED SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIETY OF THOSE, WHOSE DAYS WERE DEVOTED, AND WHOSE HEARTS <hi>WERE DEDICATED TO THE SERVICE</hi> OF GOD AND THE LAMB.</p>

                  <p>I WAS ſtanding by his bed, when he awoke from this viſion: his health was at this time wholly departed, and while awake, he was often the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of acute pain. The firſt words which he pronounced, ſhewed that he had a confuſed idea of being ſtill in a ſchool, as he repeated</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>My children round this temple throng</l>

                  </q>
                  <p>Upon recovering he ſeemed inſenſible to pain; his ſoul was healed, and he was calm. There was a divine mildneſs, and a placid ſmile on his face. A celeſtial luſtre ſeemed to ſparkle from his eyes, and he ceaſed to have a mortal look. I feared, for the moment, that his breath was about to leave
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:023207_0058_0FBE804C5CD51698"/>him, and was much affected with the thought; for our ſouls had been knit together. He recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, but the viſion had nearly overpowered him. To him, it has had all the effect of reality, and he afterwards aſſured me, that had I known all, there was no occaſion for alarm; for if he appeared to be dying, it was but a few moments before, that he received the <hi>new breath,</hi> which can never leave him: that he then juſt commenced to live the life of angels, and to anticipate the innocence, the knowledge, the holineſs and employments of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. With his new breath, he received new lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, to record which, is beyond my power. He talked with ecſtacy of the work of redemption, and ever reflected with Chriſtian gratitude, on the means of the Spirit, in bringing him to a <hi>ſaving</hi> knowledge of the truth.</p>
                  <p>But when he ſpoke of the joy, which his arrival in heaven would afford his father, and how all the aſcended heirs of glory would rejoice at the return of a repenting ſinner: When he converſed of thoſe with whom he ſhould ſpend an eternity, how would his eyes ſtream with tears of rapture, <hi>Ye, who have experienced what Clio felt; ye, who are in Chriſt, his brethren and ſiſters, can beſt conceive his feelings and language.</hi>

               <l>YE nymphs of Solyma! begin the ſong:</l>
               <l>To heavenly themes ſublimer ſtrains belong</l>
               <l>The moſſy fountains, and the ſylvan ſhades,</l>
               <l>The dreams of Pindus and th' Aonian maids,</l>
               <l>Delight no more—O Thou my voice inſpire,</l>
               <l>Who touch'd Iſaiah's hallow'd lips with fire!</l>
            </lg>

               <l>From Jeſſe's root behold a branch ariſe,</l>
               <l>Whoſe ſacred flow'r with fragrance fills the ſkies</l>
               <l>Th' etherial ſpirit o'er its leaves ſhall move,</l>
               <l>And on its top deſcends the myſtic Dove.</l>
               <l>Ye heavens! from high the dewy nectar pour,</l>
               <l>And in ſoft ſilence ſhed the kindly ſhow'r</l>
               <l>The ſick and weak the healing plant ſhall aid,</l>
               <l>From ſtorms a ſhelter, and from heat a ſhade;</l>
               <l>All crimes ſhall ceaſe, and ancient fraud ſhall fail,</l>
               <l>Returning juſtice lift aloft her ſcale,</l>
               <l>Peace o'er the world her olive wand extend,</l>
               <l>And white-rob'd Innocence from heav'n deſcend.</l>

Swift fly the years, and riſe th' expected morn;</l>
               <l>Oh ſpring to light, auſpicious Babe, be born!</l>
               <l>See Nature haſtes her earlieſt wreaths to bring,</l>
               <l>With all the incenſe of the breathing ſpring:</l>
               <l>See lofty Lebanon his head advance,</l>
               <l>See nodding foreſts on the mountains dance,</l>
               <l>See ſpicy clouds from lowly Sharon riſe,</l>
               <l>And Carmel's flow'ry top perfumes the ſkies!</l>
               <l>Hark! a glad voice the lonely deſart cheers;</l>
               <l>Prepare the way! a God, a God appears:</l>
               <l>A God, a God! the vocal hills reply,</l>
               <l>The rocks proclaim th' approaching Deity.</l>
               <l>Lo, earth receives him from the bending ſkies!</l>
               <l>Sink down, ye mountains, and, ye vallies, riſe!</l>
               <l>With heads declin'd, ye cedars, homage pay:</l>
               <l>Be ſmooth, ye rocks; ye rapid floods, give way!</l>
               <l>The Saviour comes! by ancient bards foretold;</l>
               <l>Hear him, ye deaf! and, all ye blind, behold!</l>
               <l>He from thick films ſhall purge the viſual ray,</l>

               <l>The dumb ſhall ſing, the lame his crutch forego,</l>
               <l>And leap exulting like the bounding roe.</l>
               <l>No ſigh, no murmur, the wide world ſhall hear;</l>
               <l>From ev'ry face he wipes off ev'ry tear.</l>
               <l>In adamantine chains ſhall death be bound,</l>
               <l>And hell's grim tyrant feel th' eternal wound.</l>
               <l>As the good ſhepherd tends his fleecy care,</l>
               <l>Seeks freſheſt paſture and the pureſt air,</l>
               <l>Explores the loſt, the wand'ring ſheep directs,</l>
               <l>By day o'erſees them, and by night protects,</l>
               <l>The tender lambs he raiſes in his arms,</l>
               <l>Feeds from his hand, and in his boſom warms;</l>
               <l>Thus ſhall mankind his guardian care engage,</l>
               <l>The promis'd father of the future age.</l>
               <l>No more ſhall nation againſt nation riſe,</l>
               <l>Nor ardent warriors meet with hateful eyes;</l>
               <l>Nor fields with gleaming ſteel be cover'd o'er,</l>
               <l>The brazen trumpets kindle rage no more;</l>
               <l>But uſeleſs lances into ſcythes ſhall bend,</l>
               <l>And the broad faulchion in a plow-ſhare end.</l>
               <l>Then palaces ſhall riſe: the joyful Son</l>
               <l>Shall finiſh what his ſhort-liv'd Sire begun;</l>
               <l>Their vines a ſhadow to their race ſhall yield,</l>
               <l>And the ſame hand that ſow'd ſhall reap the field.</l>
