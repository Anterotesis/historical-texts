            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>'TIS the right and the duty of a free people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to watch attentively the movements of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry department of public truſt. Whether thoſe whom they employ, fill executive, judicial, or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative ſtations, ſtill they are equally the ſervants of the people, and amenable to them, for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. This great political truth, is now rapidly ſpreading itſelf throughout the other regions of the earth, and liberating mankind from the tyranny which has long oppreſſed them. In America, it was never doubted.</p>
            <p>'Tis particularly their duty to watch attentively the conduct of the legiſlature. Whilſt that branch preſerves its independence and integrity, they are ſafe. They have nothing to apprehend either from the noxious quality of the laws, or their invaſion by the other departments of the government. It forms a bulwark of ſufficient ſtrength, to baffle eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry danger, that may aſſail them from without. But whenever it loſes theſe indiſpenſible qualifications, their ſecurity is gone, unleſs they can immediately repair the breaches that are made.</p>
            <p>Unhappily, this branch from which alone real danger may be apprehended, is beſt fortified againſt the ſuſpicion of it. 'Tis the nature of an executive truſt, where the operations are directed by a ſingle hand, eſpecially if they are extenſive and important, to inſpire jealouſy and diſtruſt; to warn every ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026245_0003_0FCFAB24F7E68FE8"/>
to ſtand on his guard, and obſerve its courſe. But with the repreſentative, the caſe is different: Many conſiderations ariſing from the mode of his appointment, and his duty, tend to connect him, in more intimate confidence, with his conſtituents. This propenſity ſhould therefore be reſiſted with deciſive force, for otherwiſe it will open a door, through which the public rights may be invaded with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe obſervations apply in a greater or leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to every free government; but they apply with peculiar force to the government of theſe States. Many circumſtances exiſt in our ſyſtem which tend in a certain degree, to weaken the checks of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral departments upon each other, and to leſſen the reſponſibility of the repreſentative to his conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent. Of theſe ſome perhaps will be eternal, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from cauſes beyond the reach of human re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Others of the adventitious kind have been added. That we may however perfectly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend our true ſituation, and the ruling policy of our councils, from the adoption of the government to the preſent time, it may be proper to notice a few of theſe in both reſpects. They will enable us to decide with greater propriety, on the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which I mean more particularly to lay bare, to the public inſpection.</p>
            <p>'Tis inſeparably incident to a federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for reaſons too well underſtood to require illuſtration, that the repreſentation ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively thin. Hence it follows, that as each mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber muſt repreſent a great extent of territory, and conſiderable number of inhabitants, he can in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral be but little known to his conſtituents in the commencement. They muſt of courſe take his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and vote for him, in a great meaſure, in the firſt inſtance, upon truſt. And the extent of the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026245_0004_0FCFAB1FF6175210"/>
over which our government in particular is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized, will prevent their ever being well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him afterwards. 'Tis ſcarcely poſſible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate that regular and thorough information, of all tranſactions, from the ſeat of government to the extremities, ſo indiſpenſibly neceſſary to enable the conſtituent to judge with propriety of the conduct of his repreſentative. This, in equal degree leſſens the reſponſibility; for a repreſentative acting on a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant theatre, never ſeen, and ſeldom heard of, by his conſtituent, except through the medium of his own correſpondence, has little to fear from his cenſure.</p>
            <p>In a ſingle well organized government, the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and purity of its adminiſtration, are eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promoted by the jealouſy which takes place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſeveral branches of each other, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially between the legiſlative and the executive. This juſtifies the policy of the diſtribution, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in full force the check intended by it. But the obvious tendency of the federal principle is to diſſipate this jealouſy, and enfeeble the check be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſeveral departments of the national go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. A coalition with the State ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, naturally unites them together, to reſiſt a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign preſſure. And this proportionably contributes to deſtroy the independence of the legiſlature, and diminiſh the reſponſibility of its members.</p>
            <p>Theſe infirmities, and eſpecially the latter, are in a great meaſure without cure; it were however rational to expect, that the moſt wholeſome remedies would have been applied, ſo as to fortify the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem againſt any malign effects which could poſſibly be avoided. But the contrary has been the courſe of our adminiſtration. Active and ſucceſsful efforts have been made to increaſe the evil where it was a natural one, and to accumulate others of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial kind. The beſt expedient which policy could
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026245_0005_0FCF8BB925050148"/>
dictate, to remedy thoſe inconveniencies reſulting from the extent of territory, was by opening their doors, to ſubject their legiſlative diſcuſſions to the free and common audience of every citizen, and to promote the free and rapid circulation of the newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers. But has this been done? On the contrary, have we not ſeen with amazement, one branch of the legiſlature, withdraw itſelf into a ſequeſtered chamber, and ſhut its doors upon its conſtituents, ſtill guarding them with obſtinate perſeverance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though more than one half the union have required that they be opened? Have we not likewiſe ſeen the free circulation of the news-papers, clogged with taxes which amount almoſt to a prohibition? Are theſe things the mere effect of accident, or are they the reſult of cool deliberation? contemplating ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects dreadful to this country.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations demonſtrate, that it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to preſerve in the members of the national legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, that degree of reſponſibility to their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, which the principle under other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces admits of; and that thoſe who have been called to that ſtation, ſince the organization of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, have ſhewn an earneſt deſire to rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that portion of which it is capable. They likewiſe demonſtrate that from cauſes which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, the ſeveral branches, inſtead of forming a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect check upon each other, and thereby ſecuring to the people a purity in the adminiſtration of each, are to a certain degree impelled in a contrary direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and forced together, into a conſtrained and politic harmony, for common defence.</p>
            <p>But this propenſity, however ſtrong it may be, has been powerfully aided by ſome inſtitutions of great force and efficacy. A charm has been formed of ſufficient ſtrength to draw them together, if the repulſive power had been naturally ten times greater
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026245_0006_0FCFAB1E6F842F40"/>
than the attractive one really is. An immenſe debt has been accumulated, from every region of the union, and of every poſſible deſcription, conſtituted into funds of almoſt perpetual duration, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from its nature upon the ſlighteſt incidents, to conſtant fluctuation, with a power in the Secretary of the Treaſury, through the medium of the ſinking fund, to raiſe it at pleaſure<note n="*" place="bottom">It has depended on the Secretary to ſay when money could or could not be furniſhed for the ſinking fund, out of the funds appropriated for the purpoſe, and even out of monies borrowed for and legally applicable to no other purpoſe. And under his direction has ultimately fallen the execution of the purchaſes.</note>. And upon the baſis of this debt, a bank of diſcount has been formed, allied by its charter to the government itſelf, and in a great meaſure ſubjected to the direction of the ſame officer.</p>
            <p>The experience of other countries has ſhewn that the dealers in the public funds, and eſpecially thoſe whoſe fortunes conſiſt principally in that line, have no intereſt and of courſe feel but little concern, in all thoſe queſtions of fiſcal policy which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly affect the land-holder, the merchant, and the artiſt. Although theſe claſſes ſhould groan, under the burdens of the government, yet the public cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor will be no otherwiſe affected by the preſſure, than as he receives what has been gleaned from their induſtry. The tax never reaches him, till the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is counted out quarterly from the public coffers, in diſcharge of his claim. They are the tenants of the farm, he the landlord and the man of revenue. The diſparity of their intereſts, and the difference of their ſenſations, reſpecting the objects to which they point, in a great meaſure ſeparate them in ſociety. Knowing that they live upon the labour of the other claſſes, the public creditors behold them with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, ſuſpect a thouſand viſionary ſchemes againſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026245_0007_0FCFAB1C8F154C30"/>
their welfare, and are always alarmed and agitated with every the moſt trifling incident which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens. And having one common intereſt which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>mply in the impoſition of high taxes and their rigid collection, they form a compact body and move always in concert. Whilſt the adminiſtration finds the means to ſatisfy their claims, they are always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to it, and ſupport all its meaſures. They therefore may be conſidered in every country, where ſubſtantial funds are eſtabliſhed, and their demands punctually paid, as a miniſterial corps, leagued to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon principles to a certain degree hoſtile to the reſt of the community.</p>
            <p>But this dread of the other claſſes, and ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to fiſcal policy, have been increaſed here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what was ever experienced before, and by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes extremely natural. The trifling conſideration given for the debt, by the preſent holders, with the comparative merit of their characters, with that of the officers and ſoldiery of the late army, and the well known ſenſe which the community entertain on that ſubject, muſt inſpire a diſtruſt that will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet their peace for a time. The claims of juſtice although from motives of policy, they may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, yet the cries which they raiſe, are terrible to thoſe who live on the uſurpation. Nor can the gay feſtivity, nor the pomp and ſplendour it ſupports, ſhield them from the admonition. This throws them blindly into the hands of thoſe who patronize their intereſts. In addition to which, the policy and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſinking fund, by which the riſe of ſtocks is in a great meaſure regulated, muſt contribute greatly to ſubject the party intereſted to the controul of thoſe who direct its application.</p>
            <p>If then the certificate-holders or dealers in the funds in general, are ſubſervient to the views of a department faithful to their intereſts, is it reaſonable
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026245_0008_0FCFAB1B286118E0"/>
to expect that ſuch as have, or may hereafter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come members of Congreſs, will prove leſs ſo? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the great theatre of ſpeculation and gain, and poſſeſſed of more correct information, with the means of turning it to better account, will they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon their occupation and ſlight the opportunity offered, of becoming thrifty? In what condition would the land-holder, the merchant, and the artiſt, find themſelves, if they ſhould be repreſented in the national legiſlature by perſons of this deſcription on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? might they not count at leaſt upon high taxes and their rigid collection? 'Tis the firſt principle of a free government, that thoſe who impoſe the tax ſhould feel the effect, but here it would be not only violated, but reverſed. What ſecurity would the people have in any of the departments of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſe checks were deſtroyed by an intereſt which ſupervened every conſideration of public good?</p>
            <p>But the proprietors of bank ſtock, are ſtill more ſubſervient to this policy, than any other claſs of public creditors. The inſtitution itſelf being found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſame paper ſyſtem, muſt communicate the ſame intereſts to thoſe within its ſphere. And in other reſpects, it poſſeſſes a ſtrength and energy, to which the common members of the fiſcal corps, are ſtrangers. The ſuperiority of its gains invigorates the principle common to all; but the conſtitutional ſubordination to the head of that department, ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies under the cloak of authority, that degree of ſubſervience which a ſenſe of ſhame, among inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent men, might occaſionally forbid.</p>
            <p>The bank however ſhould not be conſidered ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in the light of an inſtitution, uniting together with greater force, the members of the fiſcal corps. As an engine of influence, capable under the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement authorized by its principles, of polluting every operation of the government, it is entitled to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026245_0009_0FCFAB19A11BFF78"/>
particular attention. In this view a conciſe illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may not be deemed improper. The ſtocks are low, and the command of money for a ſhort term only, would enable the holder to clear with certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſuch a ſum. A queſtion of moment is depending, and a member of Congreſs may obtain a diſcount with the bank for that ſum. He makes the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. The party aiding this operation with the bank, has likewiſe the direction of the ſinking fund: its monies are <hi>ſeaſonably</hi> and <hi>publicly</hi> exhibited at the market, and the ſtocks riſe. The gain has been made, and the demands of the bank may likewiſe be anſwered. Or perhaps he is indigent, preſſed by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and ſeeks to be thus relieved: or his note has been already depoſited in the bank, and to ſome amount, and the day for repayment approaches, has he the means? and if he has not, how ſhall he be reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this painful dilemma? Shall the indulgence be extended again and again, and by the interceſſion of this perſon? Have the members of the legiſlature ſufficient independence, virtue, and firmneſs, to withſtand theſe temptations? And are there not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions in the operations of every government, when thoſe poſſeſſed of ſuch means of influence, will find it their intereſt to avail themſelves of it, to quiet the opponents to their meaſures? Have not ſuch ariſen in the courſe of our government, which commenced, as it were, but yeſterday?</p>
            <p>The contamination would however have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and the practicable means of influence abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if the alliance of the bank had been confined to an executive department only. With a miniſter in that branch, a negociation with the members of the legiſlature, would have been difficult, as certain forms ſubſiſting between the departments of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, put them at a diſtance from each other. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction does not operate by means direct or overt.

If not abandoned and at auction, the integrity of a member muſt be aſſailed more gently, and without the appearance of a bribe. It muſt be forced on him, under the maſk of friendſhip. It became there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary, to bring the legiſlature into more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate contact with this monied machine, and for this purpoſe to appoint ſeveral of its members bank directors. In England, the miniſter of finance is a member of parliament; by him negociations may be carried on in perſon; but here the conſtitution forbade it; this then was the next beſt alternative. Thus organiſed, the game becomes more eaſy. In all operations upon the legiſlature, whether for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular emolument of the bank, the fiſcal corps in general, or any other purpoſe, in which the views of the party are intereſted, the proſpect of ſucceſs is greatly improved. And in all inquiries relative to the conduct of the officer, in the management of the public monies, theſe members of Congreſs, <hi>bank directors,</hi> and the bank itſelf, give him their firm and uniform ſupport. In <hi>their eyes</hi> his conduct will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <hi>immaculate, angelic,</hi> and partaking perhaps of ſomething ſtill more divine<note n="*" place="bottom">See the ſpeech of William Smith, of South Carolina, on the late proceedings, where he ſays, "That the Secretary would in the iſſue riſe above every calumny, as fair as the pureſt angel in heaven."—Mr. S—, <hi>it is well known,</hi> holds between three and four hundred ſhares in the bank of the United States, and has obtained diſcounts, <hi>ad libitum.</hi>

            <p>If we take an impartial review of the meaſures of the government, from its adoption to the preſent time, we ſhall find its practice has correſponded, in every reſpect, with this theory. The demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration ſtrikes us in every page of the law, that a faction of monarchic ſpeculators, ſeized upon its legiſlative functions in the commencement, and have directed all its operations ſince. We ſhall find,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026245_0011_0FCFAB13F621C9C0"/>
that to the views of this faction, an apt inſtrument has been obtained in the Secretary of the Treaſury, and to whoſe emolument and advancement, all his meaſures have been made ſubſervient. If the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic debt has been accumulated by every poſſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, buoyed up by means of the ſinking fund, made in a great meaſure perpetual, and formed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a powerful monied machine, dependent on the fiſcal adminiſtration, to this combination it is due. If by means of this ſudden elevation of fortune, a dangerous inequality of rank has been created a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the citizens of theſe States, thereby laying the foundation for the ſubverſion of the government itſelf, by undermining its true principles, to this combination it is due. If thoſe ſound and genuine principles of reſponſibility, which belong to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative government, and conſtitute its bulwark, and preſerve its harmony, have been annulled or weakened; if a practicable means of influence, whereby the members of the legiſlature may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched from the duty they owe their conſtituents, has been formed; if, by implication and conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the obvious ſenſe of the conſtitution has been perverted, and its powers enlarged, ſo as to pave the way for the converſion of the government from a limited into an unlimited one, to this combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are due. The catalogue of enormities is a lengthy one, but its truth is well known to thoſe who have marked the courſe of public proceedings, or examined the acts.</p>
            <p>A more thorough developement of theſe meaſures with their pernicious tendency, may perhaps be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in a future eſſay; the object of the preſent one is more particularly to demonſtrate, that by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this combination, all regard for their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents has been abandoned by the parties to it, and that the public can neither count upon the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

or integrity of the legiſlature, or the reſponſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the other departments, whilſt it laſts.</p>
            <p>That the Secretary of the Treaſury has been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to this corps, and performed his part of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is well known. Every report from his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment furniſhes the proof. Through him propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions for aſſumption, after aſſumption, with all the properties of the debt, for the eſtabliſhment of the bank, and for loans from the bank, for the latitude of conſtruction contended for in the powers of the government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been uſhered into Congreſs. By them firm ſupport has been given to theſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. But it remained for an experiment ſtill more intereſting to the parties, and alarming to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, to try the ſtrength of this combination, and evince its turpitude; the particulars of which I will now detail.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of theſe tranſactions and for the term of four years, the real ſtate of the public finances was never ſearched into by the legiſlature. It was however manifeſt to the more obſervant, that the affairs of that department had gradually aſſumed a complexity and obſcurity, which rendered them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impenetrable. To every ſucceeding ſeſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports had been made that there was a ſurplus of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and yet reaſons were urged for an increaſe of the public burdens, and with which the legiſlature had complied. Foreign loans were likewiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, but no intimation given, how far the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign debt had been diſcharged, or in fact how theſe loans had been applied. In this ſituation, early in the late ſeſſion, a well known partizan and member of the fiſcal corps<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. S—k, of Maſſachuſetts.</note>, introduced a bill into the houſe of repreſentatives, for applying a ſum ſaid to be on hand, to the amount of two millions of dollars, in diſcharge of the debt due the bank, on account of the ſhares taken by the United States. It ſeemed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026245_0013_0FCFAB0E8B2B0628"/>
ſtrange how there could be lying idle ſuch a ſum, and in the courſe of diſcuſſion only it appeared, that it conſiſted of the foreign loans, which had been drawn into this country by the Secretary of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury.</p>
            <p>It became immediately an object worthy enquiry, why this money had been drawn here. If it was idle, the demonſtration muſt be deemed ſatisfactory, there had been no occaſion for it: Of courſe that the domeſtic reſources had been amply adequate to their objects, and in particular thoſe of the ſinking fund, to which alone any foreign money was appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.</p>
            <p>The ſubject aſſumed a ſtill more extraordinary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from the conſideration that a propoſition was then depending, and forming a part of the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation bill for the current year, for a loan from the bank of 800.000 dollars. The motive to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in themſelves ſo oppoſite and contradictory, the one founded on the idea of a large ſurplus lying idle, and the other of a poverty in the treaſury, was inexplicable. Nor could it be accounted for upon any rational principle, why the bank ſhould allow a payment to extinguiſh a loan at 6 <hi>per</hi> cent. one tenth of which only it was bound to receive, and make one immediately after at five. It could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed that the individual adventurers in the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would ſacrifice their intereſts to the public; it is well known that ſuch ſacrifices are ſeldom made, nor ought they indeed to be expected. It was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to infer that inducements of a different kind led to this arrangement between the bank directors and the Secretary of the Treaſury, and which no public documents exhibited.</p>
            <p>The draft however of the money from Holland, eſpecially if not called for by indiſpenſable and legal obligations, was an intereſting fact, and which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

explanation. Had our engagements been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and punctually fulfilled to France? and if they had, would they not have accepted and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us for the ſervice, of a reimburſement of all we owed them? The parallel in their preſent ſituation, with our own when the money was advanced, called upon us for the offer; and America muſt feel mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and humbled if it was not made, at leaſt ſo far as we had it in our power to comply with it. In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry view an explanation became neceſſary, and as ſo much had been already confeſſed, in the courſe of diſcuſſion, a propoſition for it could not now be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, with even the appearance of decency.

            <p>To this order the Secretary reported on the 3d of January following that 18.678.000 florins, equal to 7.471.200 dollars, had been borrowed. That of this ſum 4.029.217 dollars had been paid to France, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 3.000.000 dols. drawn into America, 2.304.369 of which by bills upon our bankers, and between 6 and 700.000 dollars by a diverſion of that amount to the payment of the intereſt of the foreign debt, and that the reſidue of the ſum borrowed (except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 160.000 dollars ſtill on hand) had been, <hi>or were to be</hi> applied to different purpoſes abroad<note n="†" place="bottom">It would be highly ſatisfactory to know with certainty that this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is really on hand; the prevailing and probable opinion is, that it has been turned to the actual ſervice of the bank, and of thoſe who have ſpeculated on its diſcounts.—The ſuſpicions on this ſubject are ſtrongeſt with thoſe who are beſt acquainted with the late tranſactions and preſent condition of that inſtitution: And when large ſums have been taken without neceſſity, and put in a ſituation which admits of abuſes with ſcarce a poſſibility of detection, it affords ſufficient ground for the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſuſpicion, that every thing is not as it ought to be.</note>.</p>

But the queſtion ſtill remained to be anſwered, Why had this money been drawn here? where was it, if on hand, or how diſburſed? The report threw no light on theſe important points, but rather increaſed the obſcurity with which it had been inveloped. There was therefore an obvious impropriety in proceeding further upon either of the bills, which were depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this time, one before each houſe, until the real ſtate of the public finances ſhould be thoroughly underſtood. To vote the foreign money improperly drawn here to the bank, thereby preventing its poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble application to any object for which it was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally intended, or to complicate our affairs further by another loan from that inſtitution, were by no means deſireable objects, at leaſt with thoſe who had commenced the inquiry. Correſpondent efforts were therefore made in each houſe to diſpel the clouds which covered theſe tranſactions, and orders were accordingly iſſued from each, for more correct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in every neceſſary particular<note n="*" place="bottom">

To theſe orders the Secretary reported, not a plain ſtatement of the public finances, but a free criticiſm
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026245_0017_0FCFAB08A1DB1958"/>
upon the conduct of one of the members of the Houſe of Repreſentatives, highly diſreſpectful to the Houſe, and a ſeries of elaborate eſſays illuſtrative principally of the policy of our inſtitutions, relative to which no information had been required, and of which certainly no panegyric from him was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. They contained likewiſe a vindication of his conduct in certain particulars, relative to which no charge had been brought forward. Theſe reports too were protracted, and detailed, in ſuch manner, as to occupy the whole of the ſeſſion, except a few days before its cloſe.</p>
            <p>It is ſcarcely neceſſary in this ſtage, and after the ſubject has been, ſo fully and ably, diſcuſſed before the public, to mention the nature, extent, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of thoſe funds which the Secretary had to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe, with the extent of his authority over them. A brief ſtatement may, however, make it more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026245_0018_0FCFAB048BF0A018"/>
and intelligible. The following then is the outline: Upon the domeſtic revenues conſiſting of impoſt, tonnage, and exciſe, the current expences of the government, with the intereſt upon the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and domeſtic debt, were ſolely chargeable. Two foreign loans were authorized by law, the firſt of 12,000,000 of dollars of the 4th of Auguſt 1790, and the ſecond of 2,000,000 of the 12th enſuing of the ſame month, deſtined for different purpoſes, and eſtabliſhed on different funds. The firſt was deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed commenſurate with the whole foreign debt, and was ſuggeſted as well from the neceſſity of providing for the inſtalments as they became due, and which it was concluded could not otherwiſe be ſatisfied, as by the conſideration that as the debt itſelf was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in the courſe of the late war, under very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auſpicious circumſtances, and whilſt the fate of thoſe ſtrenuous and manly exertions, then making for our independence, was uncertain, it were poſſible in the preſent more proſperous ſtate of our affairs, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a remodification of it to advantage. The ſecond was intended in aid of the ſum of 1,374,656 dollars, being the ſurplus of revenue at the end of 1790, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated for the ſinking fund; and for this latter purpoſe only, if required, could any foreign money be drawn here. The power over theſe loans, was given in every reſpect, excluſively to the Preſident. In regard to them, the Secretary acted by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and under his authority, only.</p>
            <p>In the diſcharge of the ordinary duties of the Secretary of the Treaſury, and which I never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as being very difficult or important, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as the care and application of great ſums of public money make it ſo, the courſe appears to me to be both ſimple and obvious. If the revenue ſhould at any time prove inadequate, the deficiency could not be attributed to him, nor the executive,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026245_0019_0FCFAB0338DD24E8"/>
unleſs indeed fallacious ſtatements had been given as the ground for additional charges, aſſumptions, increaſe of the military eſtabliſhment, and the like. In ſuch event it became his duty to ſtate the fact ſimply and correctly to the legiſlature, that they might in time ſupply ſuch additional funds, as ſhould be neceſſary; and if the domeſtic reſources of the ſinking fund were exhauſted, to ſtate the fact to the Preſident, that he might determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would avail himſelf of a foreign loan.</p>
            <p>In the foreign tranſaction, and which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Preſident, two conſiderations were to be principally regarded—the firſt, not to borrow at all, unleſs, in relation to the object for which the money was deſigned, it might be done with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage—and the ſecond, ſo to arrange the buſineſs, that the money borrowed ſhould, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was received, be paid over to thoſe for whom it was procured, otherwiſe we would be ſubjected to the payment of double intereſt. For this latter purpoſe, an accurate arrangement became neceſſary with France, and the money lenders in Holland, that the amount neceſſary to be borrowed, might be aſcertained with preciſion.</p>
            <p>It appeared, however, by theſe reports that he had violated the inſtructions of the Preſident, in the firſt inſtance, by borrowing upon the two million loan, though expreſsly confined by them to the other, and for the purpoſe of foreign debt only, precluding all idea of drawing any part of the monies borrowed into this country<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>That he had violated the law by blending the two loans together, whereby a door was opened for a free uſe of the whole amount of the foreign money in domeſtic expenditures, except ſo much as ſhould be paid to France, under this ſingle reſtraint, that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026245_0020_0FCFAB01A79E2A88"/>
upon the final adjuſtment of the accounts of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, two millions only ſhould be credited to the ſinking fund, in caſe they were uſed<note n="*" place="bottom">See the acts of the 4th and 12th of Auguſt, 1790; and a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his report on foreign loans, page 4th.</note>.—</p>
            <p>That by virtue of this arrangement, and upon the pretence of the ſinking fund, or, to uſe his own words, by way of <hi>inſtrumentality</hi> to it, although in fact, by his own ſhewing, not a ſingle farthing ſtands thus accounted for, (the domeſtic reſources having been adequate, except occaſionally and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der particular preſſures, and which it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed any of the banks would have accommodated) he had drawn into this country directly and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, as above mentioned, about 3,000,000 of dollars, of the foreign money, near 1,000,000 more than was authoriſed for the ſinking fund, in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent<note n="†" place="bottom">No notice is here taken of the payments to St. Domingo, becauſe a part only of the money has been even yet paid, and becauſe the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary himſelf does not ſeem willing to reſt much upon this contingent item in his ſtatements.</note>.—</p>
            <p>That he had expoſed the United States to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable loſs, ariſing from the loſs of intereſt for the time theſe monies have been thus afloat, and which muſt have produced, from the period the drafts were furniſhed the bank, a correſpondent benefit to thoſe inſtitutions<note n="‡" place="bottom">This remark needs no particular proof. The degree of loſs to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic may be calculated, by any one who will conſult the dates and ſums in the tranſaction neceſſary. It may however further be remarked, that the ſums depoſited in the bank of the United States remain yet to be accounted for, amounting to between 12 and 1300.000 dollars.</note>.—</p>
            <p>That he had borrowed money from the bank when there was no occaſion for ſuch loans, except upon the idea that there ought to be, beyond the preſſure of current demands, to guard againſt the contingencies of war, and other fanciful dangers, at
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026245_0021_0FCFAB0022EE5260"/>
leaſt five or ſix hundred thouſand dollars always on hand<note n="*" place="bottom">See pages 12 and 13 of ſaid report.</note>.—</p>
            <p>That he had occaſioned a violation of our faith with France, in not paying the money borrowed in the amount, and at the times ſtipulated.—</p>
            <p>And laſtly, that the whole of theſe tranſactions had been carried on without the knowledge of the legiſlature or the Preſident.</p>
            <p>That all theſe facts are literally and ſtrictly true, will appear by his own reports, and to which I have referred, except that reſpecting the failure in our payments to France, and this I have taken from a view of the debt in poſſeſſion of every one, in any degree converſant with public affairs. We owed to that nation up to the end of 1792, 5, 498, 697 dollars; the actual payments amounted to 4, 473, 480 dollars only, leaving due on the 1ſt of January laſt, the ſum of 1, 025, 216 dollars<note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p>Theſe charges are of a high and ſerious import; and which require the ſevereſt reprehenſion. Nor has any ſatisfactory explanation been given, to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify even the motive, in any one reſpect.

of appropriations, eſpecially in the extent and manner herein ſhewn? Shall the Preſident himſelf? Does an invading enemy approach your coaſt and threaten the public ſafety? And if in caſe of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary emergencies, he had authoriſed it, would he not have announced it to the legiſlature at their next meeting? Thoſe who are acquainted with the reſpect always entertained and ſhewn, to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and the laws, by the preſent chief magiſtrate, in every ſtation he has filled, will give the anſwer. But not only to violate the law, but likewiſe the Preſident's inſtructions, pointing out the mode of its execution, and on the day they were given, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the money from France, in derogation of our national faith, and at a time ſhe moſt required our aid, with the other circumſtances of miſconduct al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, are not to be palliated whilſt they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to exiſt.</p>
            <p>When none are furniſhed, the mind naturally ranges at large, to ſeek for motives to account for a conduct ſo ſubverſive of all legal and other obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of public duty. The character of the man, and his known political principles, muſt lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for conjecture, if indeed, when the facts are apparent, there can exiſt any doubt of the motive. Would this money have aided the republican cauſe in France, and contributed to enable that gallant and generous people, to repel the invaſion under the Duke of Brunſwick? 'Tis well known that the pulſe of the whole party beat in uniſon with him, as he advanced towards Paris, and that with him they were covered with ſhame and mortification as he retreated<note n="*" place="bottom">It is an important and well known fact, that the ſucceſs of the Duke of Brunſwick, was moſt earneſtly wiſhed for by the principal agents of this ariſtocratic and fiſcal party, who had not even the decency to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their ſentiments upon the ſubject. Is it poſſible that men of ſuch principles can be friends to republican government any where, and that their influence ſhould not be exerted to give a contrary tendency to the adminiſtration of our own?</note>. Or was it intended ſolely to aid the

bank here, and thoſe ſpeculators his political aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, preſſed it is true by difficulties, and which were ſufficient to excite his ſympathy! Was it one or both of theſe objects which influenced his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, for both were anſwered? Let facts ſpeak to an impartial and diſcerning public!</p>
            <p>The very reſpectable and independent member, who had been moſt active in preſſing this enquiry, conſidered it his duty to make known his ſentiments of theſe tranſactions. Although the laſt of the long ſeries of reports furniſhed, was not preſented more than four or five days before the cloſe of the ſeſſion, yet he deemed it incumbent on him, and conſiſtent with that candour which has always marked his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, to ſhew in that ſtage, the extent of his objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to this gentleman's official conduct. With this view he laid on the table, and ſubject to the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the houſe, ſeveral reſolutions ſpecifying theſe objections. It was to be inferred, that on account of the ſhort time intervening before the adjournment, and of courſe, the impoſſibility of examining, and thoroughly comprehending, all the various docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments relating to the ſubject, and of giving it that full and free diſcuſſion its importance required, it was his wiſh the conſideration ſhould be poſtponed to the next ſeſſion. Upon this point, however, he appeared to be indifferent, becauſe he well knew the ſubject was now before another tribunal, who would do juſtice to it. But the conduct of the houſe which I deem important in the ſcale of theſe obſervations, ſhall now be noticed.</p>
            <p>The fiſcal corps appeared to conſider themſelves more critically circumſtanced than this member. They were obviouſly ſtruck with conſternation. To
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:026245_0024_0FCFAAF71AE262A0"/>
get rid of it altogether, they could not hope. To poſtpone it to the next ſeſſion, was what of all things they dreaded. It was before the public, who were intereſted in the reſult, and who would force a trial at one time or other. They therefore laid hold of it with avidity, and a ſtrong hand. If we now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide upon it, perhaps it may be deemed ſatisfactory, and with us who are his friends, no danger need be apprehended. They ſat day and night upon the reſolutions, until they got through them; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they complained there was not ſufficient time for the inveſtigation, yet they hurried the deciſion, in half the time remaining. The free latitude of diſcuſſion, practiſed upon other occaſions was refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the ſmalleſt departure was cenſured; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in particular, an approach was made toward the bank, the whole party tumultuouſly crying to order, and, with the directors at their head, roſe in arms to defend it.</p>
            <p>The character of the vote itſelf, which conſtituted this majority, is eaſily given, by every perſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that of the Houſe, or with public tranſactions in general. Of the thirty five, twenty one were ſtock-holders, or dealers in the funds, and three of theſe latter bank directors, and whoſe degree of zeal was obviouſly in the ratio above ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as their relative profits; the bank directors, being conſiderably more active and zealous than the other members of the corps. That the fact, of this number being bank directors, is true, can it is be believed, be ſatisfactorily ſhewn.

For the motive of their vote, ſufficient cauſe has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been aſſigned. But for that of the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, candour furniſhes an apology. The ſhort ſpace of time allowed for the diſcuſſion, to thoſe who had not previouſly examined the ſubject, rendered it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to underſtand it: and in that ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it became their duty to vote on the favourable ſide. Beſides, this was an affirmative propoſition of cenſure; had one of approbation been propoſed to ſanctify theſe proceedings, it would have been reſiſted by thoſe thus circumſtanced, with equal force,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026245_0026_0FCFAAF421AFE2D8"/>
and moſt probably have turned the majority, in like degree, the other way.</p>
            <p>I have given a ſummary of the above proceedings, to evince the ſolidity of theſe obſervations, and to demonſtrate that a combination has been formed of a powerful faction, in two departments of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and upon principles dangerous to the rights and intereſts of the community. That being founded on the baſis of private intereſt, embracing a very extenſive circle of ſociety, and which muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire additional ſtrength, in proportion as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic debt ſhall be accumulated, its activity and force are the more to be dreaded. That its progreſs in undermining the great pillars of the government, by the eſtabliſhment of an inſtitution, in expreſs violation of its powers, and capable, as an engine of corruption, of ſapping the foundation of public virtue, and polluting all its meaſures, has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready great. And that the conſequences to be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehended, unleſs a ſpeedy and efficacious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy ſhall be applied, are really of the moſt alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kind. In contemplation of the pernicious ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of theſe meaſures, with the aſtoniſhing ſucceſs which had attended them, and their probable future extent, there was a period not far back, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the cauſe of liberty itſelf in danger, and trembled for the public ſafety. I feared that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fruits of the revolution, had been thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, by the blind confidence and temerity, of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and unſuſpicious people. But I truſt that our day of trial has paſſed, and that we may yet be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. To the manly efforts and diſintereſted patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, of thoſe who maintained the conflict, againſt ſuch a combination of intereſts, and checked its ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid career, much praiſe is due. America is ſenſible of their ſervices, and will remember their virtues. Thanks, illuſtrious patriots, your country greets you
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026245_0027_0FCFAAF2984B3530"/>
well, and will enrol your names upon the immortal records of fame!</p>
            <p>By marking the extent of the evil, the cure is in a great meaſure deſignated. With the legiſlature ſhould the correction commence, for <q>whilſt that branch preſerves its independence and integrity, we are ſafe.</q> Let us caſt from it then, whatever impurities, tend to impair theſe qualities, or leſſen its reſponſibility to the people. Let the public creditors ſtand apart, not as a claſs of men to be branded with reproach and infamy, but as conſtituting an intereſt, which, without due reſtraint, may endanger the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral welfare; and if admiſſible at all into that branch, let them be inhibited under the ſevereſt penalties, from a profanation of its functions afterwards, by any traffic in the public funds. Let the law eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bank, as a violation of the principles of the conſtitution, be declared null and void, or at leaſt let the eſtabliſhment be repudiated from its preſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure connection with the government. Let the whole ſyſtem of the treaſury department undergo a thorough reform, and the moſt effectual guards be provided againſt thoſe liberties and abuſes, which have been charged, upon its preſent adminiſtration. Let it be completely ſubjected to the ſupreme head of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive, againſt which it ſeems to have revolted, and let its communication with the legiſlature be put on a footing, more conſiſtent with the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the dignity and independence of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the people. Renovations of this kind, will not violate public credit, but eſtabliſh it in the public confidence; will not impair the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy of the conſtitution, but reſtore it to its priſtine health, and proper functions; will not ſtain our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional character, but exhibit it, in its legitimate fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of a dignified ſimplicity, and genuine repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaniſm.</p>
