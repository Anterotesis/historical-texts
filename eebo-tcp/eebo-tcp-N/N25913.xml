            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is a true obſervation, that no man knoweth the ſtrength of his own powers, until put to that trial which cannot be withſtood. The experiences of the man whoſe narrative we have now publiſhed, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable teſtimony of its truth.</p>
            <p>A work of this kind muſt certainly prove entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if not beneficial, to the philanthropiſt; as he will find here recorded facts that diſplays the cuſtoms, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and qualifications of this uncivilized race of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in a far more correct ſtate than can be expected from tranſient authors, that build only upon unſtable reports, or vague conjectures. In moſt publicati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> that allots a few pages as an hiſtorical relation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian manners, laws, or cuſtoms, there is no material variation recorded, otherwiſe than in their ornament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or decorating themſelves, and ſometimes in their colours: but not a word ſaid of their different methods of living, feaſting, ſhooting, dancing, and other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities that almoſt every tribe has peculiar to itſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the diverſity of game they kill; the humanity of ſome, the barbarity of others, and a multitude <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that would be worth the time ſpent in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, if adopted by civilized nations.</p>
            <p>The groundleſs and ignorant opinion, that nothin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worthy of adoption can be attained by chriſtians from ſavage and untamed Indians, is a doctrine ſo ſtupid, as 'tis void of truth.</p>
            <p>It is evidently manifeſt by years of experience, that here the ſtately and wiſe phyſician may improve in his
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:034461_0003_0FFF0C2C5A7ED640"/>
ſcience, and accumulate additional experience in his profeſſion;—the tender parent may learn to inure her offspring to the viciſſitudes of revolving ſeaſons, and ſecure to it (through God's bleſſing) health of body and vigour of ſpirits; without the application of ill-timed gallenicals, chymicals and drugs;—the ſage philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher may be inſtructed in his deep reſearches into the wiſdom of creation, and over-ruling power of a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;—the ſcholar may be convinced, that excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies far above the inſtitutions of man, may be attained by a cloſe application and inveſtigation of rude nature; and every claſs of people may be taught how to value health, liberty, religion, ſociety, and all other graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpenſations of heaven, that come under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of mercies and bleſſings.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Indians in their rude ſtate are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the moral precepts of united ſociety, or impulſive obedience, proceeding from ſelf-created diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions ariſing from opulence, accumulated often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by means of fraud, deceit, oppreſſion, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by murdering one another; ſo that honor is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on us according to our poſſeſſions (without any regard to the means) and not according to our merit; but this is not the caſe with the poor deſpiſed Indians; there eſteem and reſpect is conferred upon wiſdom and virtue; but the poſſeſſions of each tribe is all alike; like the apoſtles of old, they have <hi>"all things in common;"</hi> and without our ſuperfluities, they have ſufficiency for all their neceſſities, and live and die, entire ſtrangers to moſt all our calamities.</p>

               <p>Thus did I ſupport my drooping ſpirits, with thoſe phantoms of deluſive expectations, inwardly rejoicing on my approaching happineſs—all nature ſeemed to be combined in its attracting ſmiles, and the whole face of creation had the reſemblance of Paradiſe, not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contraſt between an almoſt barren wilderneſs, and a well cultivated land; for <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>eaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

every object a charming, and almoſt enchanting aſpect; and the refreſhment being the promiſcuous produce of rude nature, was palitable and nouriſhing to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: nothing but the cravings of nature did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to ſtop to pluck the fruit; not nothing but overcome nature tempt me to lay down to take the needful repoſe; and twice in the night I aroſe and purſued my unknown courſe; but the ſecond time it was nearly proving fatal to my life; for it being dark, I unfortunately in my erring walk, approached near enough to the nightly retreat of ſome large beaſt of prey, as to diſturb his repoſe by the motion of the buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es:—I conclude I was not more than <hi>ten yards</hi> diſtance when I heard the horrible howl—terror ſunk into my ſoul, and almoſt deprived me of ſenſe—to eſcape by flight I ſaw no diſtant proſpect, and the critical ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not admit of heſitation:—I immediately aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the neareſt tree, and ſcarce was I out of reach but I perceived a huge animal paſs it roaring; but what beaſt it was, the darkneſs of the night prevented my diſcerning.</p>
               <p>This ſudden and dangerous ſurprize, compelled me to remain in the tree till the approach of morning, and deſcending, I in a few minutes came to the ſpot from whence I had rouzed the terrible enemy of my peace.—It was an encloſure of thick buſhes, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of decayed leaves of two large trees ſtanding cloſe by, and plenty of long graſs; with a few frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of carcaſſes devoured for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The nightly retreat of this animal was much more comfortable and better ſecured from the inclemency of the weather, than I had experienced for the <hi>two years</hi> I inhabited the ſame forreſt; and without doubt if I had happened to have come when the proprietor was not at home, I ſhould have taken poſſeſſion of his <hi>dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> for the night; if I did not firſt diſcover the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered emblems of ſavage ſerocity laying without the door; but what would have been the owner's ſurprize, or my ſituation, for to perceive a ſtranger had taken poſſeſſion of his premiſes, 'tis not eaſy to picture—I might have found him the hoſpitable friend or the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el monſter; but at any rate I could willingly diſpenſe with the former, to be certain of eſcaping the latter.</p>
               <p>I made all the haſte poſſible from this ſpot, fearing the hoſt might return and make too free with his gueſt.</p>

               <p>This tribe are endued with a degree of foreſight or cautious prudence, in a ſuperior meaſure to the others; for they begin early to train their children to the uſe of the bow and arrow; as ſoon as they are able to walk, they are ſupplied with them for amuſement, and by degrees as they grow in years, they become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally capable of managing them; and boys, not <hi>five years old,</hi> I have known to equal aged people in dexterity; but notwithſtanding this early practice, it is ſomething remarkable they are in general the moſt aukward, or at leaſt the moſt unſucceſsful in the daily excurſions of either tribe I was in bondage with:—I know but one cauſe to attribute it unto, which is this—I never ſaw one of the elder men attempt to inſtruct the youth, or the youth the children, how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This tribe ſcarce ever put the bow and arrow into the hands of children, by way of uſing them, until they were <hi>ten or twelve</hi> years of age, and then took great pains to perfect them in a little time; and it was ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom they required more than <hi>two weeks</hi> training, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were ſupplied with the cuſtomary morning compliment of arrows—in general, <hi>five or ſeven,</hi> and from that time enjoyed every privilege, and partook of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Next morning we aroſe to reſume the daily exploits, and having no breakfaſt to provide, it required no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time; and accordingly we ſet out on our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulation, and the greateſt part of the women and children accompanying us, and the day proved very ſucceſsful; ſo that the women was obliged, before the cloſe of the day, to retire towards the ſpot where we was to rendezvous that night; and for our parts, the men ſeemed to be very indifferent about killing any game towards the cloſe of the day, but conducted themſelves with a degree of pleaſantry and frolickſome mirth; and the youth and girls exhibited a degree of gamboling jolity and playfulneſs far exceeding any thing of the kind I had before been witneſs unto, and at the ſame time conducted with a ſimplicity of uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated manners, that excluded all indecency on one hand, and need of modeſty on the other; for they ſeemed to be directed by the mere inſtinct of untainted nature; and before this time I could never perceive any particular marks of reſpect or notice whereby the youth of either ſex did manifeſt any diſtinguiſhing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of mutual friendſhip towards each other peculiarly—but this afternoon I thought there was an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of civilized tenderneſs of the ſofteſt nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a couple of young Indians—the man about twenty, the girl I judged to be about fifteen—they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeparated from the company and withdrew to ſome more private recluſe, and altho' this created <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now whether this merriment was obſerved as a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of marriage between the young man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, I cannot tell, for from that time I never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned any diſtinguiſhable inſtances of peculiar notice between them, nor no tranſaction of the kind ever after with either tribe I was amongſt; it is evident that no peculiar forms of matrimony is generally obſerved, and what confirms me in this opinion is, that altho' many children were born during my being amongſt them, there was but few inſtances that enabled me to form any probable conjecture who the father was; notwithſtanding, there is every reaſon to believe, that they unite in pairs, and I believe obſerve a ſtrict chaſtity and virtue for their adopted partner.</p>

               <p>After this terrible fray between the two tribes, I was always very careful to be with the party that had the <hi>Chief</hi> with them, which I could eaſily do, as there was no exactneſs or partial appointments, but nearly an equal number promiſcuouſly without any exceptions, ſet out together; and ſometimes one, two, or three or more parties return to the ſame umbrage at night, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon circumſtances of the day; but they always endeavor to meet as many as poſſibly can, at one place in the evening, to be the better enabled to encounter any danger that may befal them from the attack of beaſts of prey, or any other tribe of Indians with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

There are very few plants or herbs but what are bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial for ſome ailments, but no one particularly uſeful to every one:—they take but very few inward medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, for as their lives are very regular in diet, and their bodies kept in due exerciſe, free from pampering luxuries and lazineſs, they ſcarce ever complain of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſorders; but when they do, it alarms the whole tribe; as witneſs, the <hi>Chief</hi> before related; if he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>There is no herb that I found to be much in favor with every tribe, and applied to the ſame purpoſe, and always adminiſtered with ſucceſs: I never knew it once fail in I ſuppoſe <hi>thouſands</hi> of inſtances, that is, in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of their morning ſickneſs, after drinking to exceſs over night of the juice of the plantane, after being become ſtrong and ſour from the powerful virtue of the trooly leaves—this intoxicating beverage is made after the following manner:</p>
               <p>The women gather a quantity of plantanes, and ſpread them on the ground two or three days in the ſun, and twice a day ſprinkle them with water; by which time they begin to get rotten or decayed, for the
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:034461_0085_0FFF0CBE9D3C8EE0"/>
ſprinkling hinders their getting dry; but it helps their moiſture and the acid taſte; they are next tied up in trooly leaves, after the manner of cabbage in a net, with holes pricked in the leaves to admit the ſun's rays, but not powerful enough to dry them; in this manner they hang two or three weeks; then being taken down, they very much reſemble rotten garden vegetables, and being bruiſed between two ſtones, a naſty green juice runs from them into a veſſel made of clay, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened by the fire; in this veſſel it ſtands for twelve hours, till it is clear on the top, and the ſediment all at the bottom; then it is poured out into ſome other veſſel and drank at leiſure: this is very ſtrong and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable, and not often made, for want of co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There are but few herbs they gather to preſerve for winter uſe; one of which is for the purpoſe of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to bruiſes and ſtopping blood, proceeding from briars and other noxious ſhrubs, by boiling it well and mixing the water with ſome greaſe as an ointment, and rubbing it all over; and this ſtops any blood that proceeds from wounds in a few minutes: this herb is what is called by Europeans, <hi>ground joy,</hi> and by ſome <hi>creep weed,</hi> becauſe it runs on the ground near the roots of trees and among ſtones: they ſometimes make a beverage of it for ſuckling women, mixed with the juice of bramble berries or vines; it increaſes the milk.—Another herb they preſerve, grows moſtly by the ſides of riverſ—'tis the leaves only of this they gather; they are nearly as large as ſmall cabbage leaves, and ſomething like colts foot: from four of theſe leaves may be extracted a half a pint of j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The laſt day I was with them happened to be very ſtormy, which proved very ſucceſsful for us in birds, for we always killed more birds in wet weather than dry, becauſe they ſat perched on the trees quieter: this day we killed ſeventeen quams, and nine curaſſoes; altho' the Indians give them different names, I am inclined to think it is the ſame bird, but differing in gender, as I could not deſcry any other difference between them than the plumage; this bird is as large as a gooſe and eat as good, altho' the forreſt and woods abounds with a variety of fowl, this is the only one the Indians deem worthy notice; we did this day alſo kill a large fiſh which they call the mannady; it very much reſembles a cow, but has no fins like other fiſh, but two large protuberances like paps, and frequently creep on them to the ſhore, and ſleep and graze; it being a kind of an amphibious animal, and it is when they are on ſhore or the water edge the Indians ſhoot them; they kill ſeveral other large fiſh, from which they extract the oil, but ſeldom eat much of the fleſh, unleſs neceſſitated through ſcarcity of animal food.</p>

It was our miſhap on a certain time to meet at a river's ſide, where there was but one convenient place to waſh and clean game—they were there, and had taken poſſeſſion of the ſpot when we came; we as well as them wanting to clean and dreſs what we had killed, drew towards them, and our <hi>Chief</hi> putting on an auſtere brow and grimace countenance (who at no time had a pleaſant one) this rouzed the indignation of their's, and ſeeing us make preparations for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, they immediately began to do the ſame for the defenſive; the number on each ſide being nearly equal, about forty, excepting they had no women, and our's was neutral ſpectators.</p>

There was but one perſon killed, and that was on our ſide; that aged man that was my interpoſing and liberating friend, when I was faſtened to the tree for martyrdom, as before related: I regretted the death of my benefactor, in remembrance of his former kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but from that time to the preſent, had never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced one ſingular act of peculiar lenity from him.</p>
               <p>After theſe things were properly adjuſted, by the wounded being taken care of, we buried our corpſe in which they aſſiſted: the number of wounded on our ſide was ſeven, and on their's I think about twelve; two or three ſo badly as to be carried away it a kind of litter they make of graſs, leaves, and ſmall ſticks.

About two months after the battle before related, there was an Indian banquet took place between our tribe and the friendly one, which for its originality and ſingularity, I thought proper to relate.</p>
               <p>I perceived one day that our <hi>Chief</hi> was more than common earneſt in his commands, and the people ſeemed to be particularly attentive and pleaſed, and during the whole day, every one ſeemed to be extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily alert and diligent; and the ſucceſs was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable, for we had conſiderable more than could be poſſibly conſumed by us while it was good; but when evening came, I was not a little ſurpriſed to ſee them preparing a portion of it for preſervation, by warming it before the fire, and hanging it up in the ſmoak to the limb of a tree, under which a fire was made on purpoſe: the next day the ſame diligence was obſerved, and produced ſimilar ſucceſs, and in the evening cured after the ſame manner, with this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; we had now two large birds, which was roaſted and wrapped up in trooly leaves: the two following days was much the ſame, ſo that we now had a ſtore of proviſion in reſerve; I put many different conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon this proceeding, but the moſt probable in my mind was, that we were going to remove for a long journey further up into the country; but neither of my ſpeculations bore any affinity to the true cauſe; as it was what I could not ſurmiſe, ever did take place amongſt ſuch a herd of ſavages: it was the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="5 letters">

The women had been excuſed for the laſt four days from accompanying us; this alſo excited in me a little aſtoniſhment: the fifth or ſixth day we very much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded our cuſtomary circuitous bounds, and kept one invariable direct courſe, and in the evening was near ten miles from home; and after eating very ſparingly both ſupper and breakfaſt, we proceeded that day in the ſame direct courſe, and towards evening we came to a large open ſhade, about half a mile in length, and in ſome places forty yards in breadth, conſtructed by trees na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, and boughs, leaves and graſs artfully worked together in many places, ſo as to produce very agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pleaſant retreats.</p>

               <p>The whole company being ordered into ranks, they were then ſeparated into eight diviſions, which was alſo placed in two ſquares, each diviſion being about ſix yards aſunder; in this manner they ſtood while the two <hi>Chiefs</hi> went to each corner and harangued them by way of inſtruction as well as command; this being done, they now made a conjunction, and formed but one ſquare; and now commences a very ſtrange kind of diverſion, which terrified me very much, as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to partake of the amuſement.</p>

but the harder the blow, the greater the pleaſure to the ſufferer; but I never paid any regard who it was I did ſtrike; for being all devils alike, it was no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which: but by my ingenuity I eſcaped myſelf. This continued without any conſiderable intermiſſion, till ſupper time, when they eat a hearty ſupper, and drank plentifully:—between this and bed-time, the women was dancing and friſking about merrily; when they had done, the men began, and continued jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſinging, whiſtling, ſhouting, hallowing, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all the night; and great part of the women fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their example; even the two <hi>Chiefs</hi> was on their legs at intervals, the principal part of the night; and in reality it was the moſt agreeable night I had ever ſpent amongſt them, becauſe my mind wa<hi>s</hi> at eaſe: towards morning every one began to grow drowſy, and one after another dropped aſleep; ſo that at one time I thought every man, woman and child, was napping together.</p>
               <p>I now had ſome little impulſe on my mind to give them the ſlip; but at the ſame time there was many weighty objections ſtarted up to diſcouragement: they would not ſleep long; it was day inſtead of night; too many would be in purſuit of me, and when taken, this ſecond crime would be an aggravation that would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly exaſperate them, and admit of no mercy.

In the morning they breakfaſted, and then began to renew the former diverſion of the knuckles, and in the ſame diſordered and irregular manner:—I began to grow doubtful of the further good effects of my deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtratagem to evade their knuckles, for though I could eſcape their notice by ſkipping about, my back could not eſcape their eyes; for as there was viſible mark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

as I predicted, ſo it happened; they ſhewed a kind of ſympatiſing ſorrow that I had been hitherto ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and altogether began to knuckle me ſo forcibly that the blows almoſt brought me to the ground. I imagine I had at this one time twenty blows, and in all probability ſhould have been favored with twenty more if I had not marched off; but ſo far was I from being inclined to oblige, or be obliged; to confer, or receive any future favors of this nature, that I remained a neutral ſpectator the reſt of the day. At the return of evening, after ſupper, they renewed their laſt evening's ceremony, by ſhouting, ſcreaming, whooping and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating ſo naturally ſeveral beaſts of the forreſt, it was as great an uproar as if the whole tribe of ſavage beaſts of prey had met together and were fighting a battle of royal.</p>
               <p>I did not partake with them much in the jollity of this night: the diſtinguiſhed marks of their friendſhip was too freſh in my memory; too effectual on my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and too viſible on my back, for me to have much appetite for running and ſkipping about all night. When the anguiſh would permit it, I was glad to doſe and ſlumber a little; for ſleeping I did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that, for putting the pains of my back out of the queſtion, the noiſe and trumbling about, ſome drunk, others ſtupid, and others dancing and hallowing, would hinder any perſon from ſound ſleep, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſo in my circumſtances, that even at this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>I endeavoured to cheer my ſpirits as well as theſe gloomy apprehenſions, and deſponding ſurmiſes would ſuffer, and paſſed away the night in a manner as eaſy for the reader to gueſs, as for me to deſcribe; if he only makes an exchange in his mind, and place himſelf in my ſituation.</p>
               <p>When morning made its appearance, I obſerved the two <hi>Chiefs</hi> was the firſt that was ſtiring, and was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and fro, ſeemingly big with ſome new enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; their frequently ſtopping and making obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, confirmed me in the opinion that ſomething new was on the carpet; but ſtill I endeavoured to ſtifle all fears and anticipations relating to my own ſafety, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' it was at intervals much like the troubled ſea; a difficult matter to keep the agitations of the ſoul within the limits of ſilent ſadneſs.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the men aroſe, they was ſummoned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Chiefs,</hi> and after a little muſic, our <hi>Chief</hi> gave

               <p>The whole company now divided themſelves into four parties, and each procured a large bundle of graſs, and laid it in four different places; then the four com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies formed themſelves into regular lines; each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany having their bundle of graſs, and each man hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſtick before ſpoken of in his hand: the foremoſt man now laid down with his breaſt on the bundle of graſs, and all the reſt paſſed him one after the other, each ſtriking him acroſs the back with all his ſtrength, where the knuckles had ſo bruiſed before, and as they paſſed they fell into a rank, and when the laſt man paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, then he aroſe and went to the rear of the rank, and the next foremaſt man laid down on the graſs, and experienced the ſame treatment, and ſo on until every man in the four companies had felt the feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive blow:—in this caſe there was no alternative, and I underwent the painful ceremony of Indian friendſhip.</p>

At the concluſion of this ſavage diverſion, the ground was clotted with blood, and ſome of the poor filly creature's backs was battered in ſuch a manner, that they was diſabled for ſome weeks after; and three ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually died belonging to our tribe within a fortnight, and four of the others died on the ſpot; and for my part, I was obliged to uſe all my cunning again for many weeks after, pretending to a diſorder in my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and weakneſs, becauſe I would not ſo ſoon reſume my former occupation of foraging in the woods.</p>

of ſtrife or anger happened during the whole feſtivals an example worthy of chriſtian imitation.</p>
               <p>Being now all aſſembled together, the firſt thing was for every man to break his ſtick in two, and put one piece under one of his feet, and the other under the foot of a companion, and he doing the ſame, the whole company was now ſtanding upon two pieces of ſtick. The two <hi>Chiefs</hi> then went round, and taking the two ſticks from each man's feet, delivered them into his hands, who immediately ſtruck his oppoſite with both of his hands acroſs his two arms, and then threw the ſticks down on the ground; and after this manner the whole aſſembly proceeded. The ſticks being now all in one heap, a fire was kindled, and while they was burning, there was the moſt general ſhouting and antic geſtures throughout the whole body, that I had ever witneſſed: not even the <hi>Chiefs,</hi> women, children, nor ſick was exempted, but every one ſeemed equally alike concerned and engaged with ſuch a portion of joy, mirth and pleaſantry, that convinced me that the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was going to take place on the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

This being over, the muſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="150" facs="unknown:034461_0148_0FFF1A5BCBA8F858"/>
threw them on the ground and trampled them in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: then all joining in a loud whoop, with jumping and dancing for a few minutes, every one made mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with his hands towards the ſky and ground: then ſilence enſued for a few minutes: now one of the <hi>Chiefs</hi> harangued them for a quarter of an hour, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uſual motions: when he had finiſhed, the other done the ſame, then the whole company gave a ſhout, and ſmacking their hands together a few times, cloſed this terrible banquet; and to me it was a rejoicing ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>The next thing was to provide litters to convey away the ſick, which was performed after this manner:</p>
               <p>Two long poles, about four yards each, and ſtrong enough to ſupport the weight of a man, was provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; now theſe two poles was brought within three quarters of a yard together, with ſtrong twiſted and plaited graſs, like the bottom of a chair, ſo ſtrong and firm as to bear the ſick man, and as many of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences was prepared as needful.</p>
               <p>The next thing was to tie up the proviſions allotted to each company's ſhare, and this was ſoon done—for liquor there was none left.</p>
               <p>All things being now adjuſted, we divided without any further ceremony, and left the banquetting ſpot all at the ſame time, and taking different routes, we did
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:034461_0149_0FFF1A5E6C9A0B88"/>
not accompany each other no way: our tribe had not proceeded two hours, before we halted under the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy of ſome large ſpreading trees, and repoſed our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a comfortable and refreſhing ſleep. We had but two ſick men to carry on litters, but from the number of the weak and fainty, we travelled very ſlow, as it took us up ſix days before we reached to our near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place of rendezvous; and the laſt two days provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was very ſparing; but as our ſtomachs was not ſo craving as when we went forward, we did not much mind it: beſides, thoſe whoſe appetites could reliſh it, had the advantage of fruit, and thus lengthened out the animal food for the more delicate and weak ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs. All trials ſeemed to be borne with heroic pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; no murmuring or complaints was heard, and at laſt we got home.</p>

               <p>Of all the tribes, or parts of tribes, that was at this ſcene of barbarous jocundity, no two did ſpeak the ſame language; from this I imagined there muſt be five different tribes; but not one captive beſides my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: they had ſome dogs with them, but little notice was taken of them.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of us remained at home for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days, and ſome for as many weeks, without being ſummoned to the duties of the day; but as faſt as we was found able to encounter its fatigue, it was at our peril to beſitate, for the indulgence was deemed a great favor: but excepting myſelf, there was not one but what was anxious for the opportunity to diſplay his ſkill in the woods.</p>
               <p>I dallied with them as long as poſſible with ſafety; and the firſt day of going out on the foraging ſcout, I was preſented with a bow and arrows, for it was full time I ſhould render them ſome ſervice. As I was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of my incapacity, it troubled me much, and the more ſo as the weapons were delivered into my hands with an imperious auſterity, bordering upon a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and expected ſucceſs.

               <p>More arrows were now delivered to me, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to be more ſucceſsful: I trembled for fear, but follow them I muſt, and fortunately was more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, and of courſe experienced better evening treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>The <hi>Chief</hi> of this tribe ſeemed to be endued with wonderful ſagacity, peculiar to the others: he was the youngeſt I had been captive unto; he did not appear to be forty years of age: he goes to a little diſtance from his companions, ſnuffs the air all round, and then tells them where the game may be found, and in theſe predictions he is but ſeldom deceived; this is an art never practiſed by any other part of the crew, but they all ſeem to have the eyes of vultures in eſpying out the game, and marking their footſteps, which is a common rule for them to go by; and when they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the track of any large animal, they all keep cloſe on the purſuit, through briers, thorns, or any other obſtruction that impedes their progreſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>My ſituation with this tribe was very fluctuating, ſometimes eaſy, and at others ſorrowful and dreadful; I did kill for them my ſhare of game, but very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently felt the weight of their blows ſeverely, but I endeavoured to reconcile myſelf to my deplorabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This tribe was very particular in their manner of painting themſelves; it was done ſo effectually that it would not come off with the ſun or water for ſeveral months; but it was a dirty colour, very much of an olive.</p>
               <p>They made their paint after this manner: they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the green bark of a tree they call porpai, about the ſize of a beach tree; this bark they dry in the ſmoke as they do meat, then pound it fine between two ſtones, afterwards mix it with oil, and grind it between the ſtones; then mix a quantity of greaſe with it, and keep grinding it until 'tis fine enough for the purpoſe; then they put it into calabaſhes and keep it for uſe: their bruſhes they make by procuring a bundle of very coarſe graſs, and beat it well, and then pick out ſome fit for their uſe, ſuch as is ſtringy, reſembling hemp, and by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

This tribe had ſome knives and other European ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of manufacture amongſt them, for the Indian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that inhabits near the ſea ſhore, carry on a traffic with the Spaniards, and when the ſeaſon of banquetting ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives, they ſometimes make preſents, or exchange with each other; and by this means, there are few of the Indians but have more or leſs or European commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
               <p>This tribe is called Barlawys, and ſeem to me to be a more reſerved company than any of them. I heard nothing of any preparation for a banquet while amongſt them, but they had a cuſtom of preſerving proviſions, and ſtaying at home ſometimes two or three days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which was on ſome occaſions extraordinary: while being with them there was an aged man died, and the whole crew refrained from hunting for twenty-four hours, feeding entirely on berries and other fruit, which at this time was plenty, ſuch as bramble berries, vines, grabs, kind of plumbs, ſloes, and black cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; the ſloes they gather and preſerve for dyeing their feathers; for they decorate themſelves a little, but not as much as ſome others.</p>
               <p>They have greater opportunities for killing game than many tribes, being further inland, and diſtant from the ſea: the forreſt and woods abounding more with large animals that ſhuns mankind, beſides plenty of materials for making arrows; and having ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

of inhumanity, but from fear of loſing ſo valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a ſervant; for as they was not the beſt markſmen, neither was they the moſt active, for it was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common for them to lay down in the middle of the day for an hour or two, and ſometimes longer; and the boys and me would be at the ſame time hunting; and when the boys was ſucceſsful, they gave them the fruits of their labour as a reward for their ingenuity: but for my part, I done it with a view to keep as much in their good graces as poſſible, or I ſhould have been as proud of the mid-day reſt as themſelves; and at ſuch times it has happened, that I have been the moſt ſucceſsful in the company that day:—but all this could not procure my liberty for the night, for the more uſeful they ſound me, with the more hardſhips they conducted themſelves towards me, by cloſe watching and reſtraint.</p>
               <p>The women ſeveral times interfered in my behalf to procure my releaſement; but it only brought on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſpleaſure, and on me additional watchfulneſs; ſo that it was totally out of their power to alleviate my calamity; excepting providing me food at ſuch times of ſcarcity, as the callous hearted wretches was ſparing.</p>

When they ſet out in the morning, they uſually have about forty arrows each, ſlung to their ſide in a piece of deer's ſkin:—they are made of unjointed cane; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſmaller end they drive a piece of hard wood, and ſplitting the end of this bit of wood, they drive in a ſmall piece of flint, two inches in length, which they ſecure in by wrapping the wood with ſilk graſs; the extremity of the flint being made very ſharp, for the better penetrating into the game.</p>
               <p>As we was once in purſuit of ſome large animal by the tracks of his feet through the thickets, the <hi>Chief</hi> and front of the company, were ſuddenly ſurpriſed with an uncommon ruſtling of the leaves, and looking round, beheld two furious tygers, one of which made a leap at one of the people, and catching hold of his leg, tore him terribly, but was ſoon forced to relinquiſh his hold, and turning tail followed his companion; but the party would not quit their purſuit, until they had again come in ſight of them and killed one; but it was too late in the day to proſecute the chaſe after the other; and even now we could not arrive to any frequented place of rendezvous that evening, but obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ourſelves with lodging under ſome trees in the woods, and next morning conducted the wounded man to our neareſt accuſtomed place of repoſe and reſt, and left him under the care of ſome women.

of us very ſucceſsful, which induced the <hi>Chief</hi> to call a council; which being done, the reſult was, for us to remove further up into the country, which is very common amongſt them. Now the next thing to be concluded upon, was what courſe to ſteer, and in this caſe the <hi>Chief</hi> had no more authority than another, and every one gave his own opinion; and when all had done, it was decided by the majority of voices, and this majority was taken in a very odd manner: every one got a bit of ſtick, and put down on the ground with the largeſt end pointing that courſe he would wiſh to take, and when every one had done, the ſticks was numbered, and that point that had the greateſt, had what might be called one vote: the ſticks was again delivered to the company, and laid down again, and the largeſt number being again towards the ſame point, this was the track concluded upon for the journey. A fire being kindled, theſe ſticks was all burnt on that ſpot where the largeſt number laid, and the aſhes taken up, and carried about a mile on that route, and then ſeattered in the air.</p>
               <p>We now proceeded in a direct line for five days, killing ſuch game as did fall in our way, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at night on the moſt convenient ſpot that preſented to us.

and directly began to clean and make preparations for ſupper; but while we was buſy in this affair, a party of another tribe, to whom it did originally belong (and who like ourſelves was benighted) made their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and this cauſed a conſternation, and confuſion took place, which of courſe ſoon amounted to a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; but our number being ſo far ſuperior, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict was ſoon terminated without any further ill effects than a few bruiſes and bloody noſes; but as the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal poſſeſſors was not willing to forſake their own ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, nor us diſpoſed to quit our new fortunate diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; there was a parley held between the oldeſt man of them and our <hi>Chief,</hi> which continued about half an hour, and terminated amicably; ſo that we all ſat down together, and divided our proviſion in common, and next, morning very peaceably ſeparated; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to forage the wood without any intention of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing forward, and return again in the evening; we had good ſucceſs, and returned and found the ſame party there before us: I expected another fracas would take place; but on the contrary, all was amity and friendſhip.

the precaution, and I gave them every reaſon to believe that my ſituation amongſt them was agreeable, but it was only an opportunity for an eſcape that I meditated, which ſoon after happened; for having wandered further than uſual, we came to one of the moſt delightful ſpots of herbage, purling brook, and ſhady grove of trees around as could be ſeen; with ſo much plantane and trooly growing, that in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes the women had enough gathered and hung up, to ſupply the company for ſeveral nights, when it was preſſed: we directly fixed upon this ſpot as another rendezvous; ſo now we had two on our new acquired dominions.

               <p>The chief employ of the women was to prepare plantane liquor, for we had been ſome time without, and what was eagerly wiſhed for.

               <p>This humiliating poſture did not much attract their notice, in the ſenſe I could wiſh it; but like the former crews they ſeized me, and led me away, and in an hour we came to their place of reſidence; where to my agreeable ſurpriſe, I ſaw near twenty wigwhams, and women and children around them. When we was come near enough for the women to diſtinguiſh me, they ſet up a loud cry, but the men ſoon pacified them: they tied me to a ſtake with a ſtrong hempen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>They now began to unload their horſes, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of many European toys, ſome ſpirits, and a large quantity of Indian corn—they had been upwards of two hundred miles for it; and purchaſed it of ſome Indians that live near the ſea, and trade with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards by exchanging furs, ſkins and wood, for knives, daggers, tools and ſundry things; but this tribe was the moſt remote that carry furs ſo far in exchange; and being but ſeldom they went, the reſidue of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

of cultivating land, and raiſing Indian corn, for there was a great deal of open land, and they knew the value and ſervice of Indian corn, becauſe they did eat it, and any kind of tools needful for digging and hoeing the land, they could get on their journey; but they appeared to me a very lazy people.</p>
               <p>The encloſed ſpot of ground that I ſaw in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, belonged to them;—they had ſix horſes, and did let them run in the woods till within a few days of their ſetting out on a journey, when they was put there for readineſs: they did commonly go twice a year.</p>

to me. In the morning we ſet out again, but ſo dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory was theſe fellows, they did permit game to paſs them without getting ready, or ſtep one ſtep after them; and it was my diligence that again crowned the day; but every day manifeſting more and more their indolent diſpoſitions, and depending almoſt upon me, was diſheartening, and in proceſs of time, when winter approached, I was ſent out by myſelf, and, though it was opportunities for eſcaping, and even with one of the horſes, if I thought proper; it did not appear to me prudent, for I was in hopes ſome more favorable ſeaſon would offer, when I might do it with little or no hazard; and beſides, I was uſed as civil as one of themſelves, but ſuffered very much by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for when there was a ſcarcity, which was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the caſe, I had but the meaſure of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

the reſt; the face is ſtriped, and their bodies in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, and the arms round ſpots, but laid on very thick.</p>
               <p>There is ſomething very ſingular in this tribe in their behaviour, which I apprehend they muſt have learnt from their little acquaintance with the Spaniards, and from thoſe diſtant tribes that they occaſionally trade with, who it is probable has very much of the habits and cuſtoms of the Spaniards amongſt them. During the time I was with this tribe, I never ſaw an inſtance of levity and ridiculous geſtures, or an exceſs of eating, drinking, or ludicrous wantonneſs:—there is but little diſcourſe amongſt them, but a kind of lazy reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and very frequently have not a mouthfull to eat in the morning, and muſt ſtop until the evening, till ſome of the archers has been a hunting; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this faſting, there is not the leaſt ſign of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, or diſſatisfaction, amongſt the women towards the men, but all is borne with ſilent, unconcerned pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; for in their turn, the women are as bad as the men. It is not uncommon to ſee them take the horſes and ride about the woods for pleaſure, altho' they do not ſeem to take any; and at the ſame time nothing in their wigwhams to eat.</p>
               <p>They were in general a clean people—every thing had the appearance of decency (making allowance for their race) and reſembled much the civilized <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

If they had not been accuſtomed to ſuch a degree of lazineſs, my being with them would have been benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial; for if every man amongſt them did kill half the quantity of game that I did three days in the week, I ſhould myſelf have made up the reſt; for they had plenty of game, many men, and but few woman and children in compariſon.</p>

I could have ſpent my time, I could almoſt have ſaid my days, amongſt them contentedly, had it not been for this one predominant evil; for health, eaſe, and civility, was now ſo tranſcendently exulting and comfortable to me, that I had almoſt forgot the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior advantages of civilization, and cannot tell if ever I ſhould have left them; even in the preſent caſe, the deſires for further human enjoyments did ſeldom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs my notice, and for liberty, I had no occaſion to wiſh for it, becauſe I was not in captivity; but if I had left them, it was probable I ſhould ſoon be.</p>

After this, every one returned to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary occupations of the day; and leaving them all to their own engagements, I went to the wood, and in the evening early brought home a fine fat buck; on which we feaſted deliciouſly; the children playing around me with the greateſt pleaſure and infantite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence; but the reſt of the men had been lurking about all the day. I got more and more in favor eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and was as happy as an Indian in all his ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour could be; and during the whole time the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was gone, which was ſix weeks, I never let them want for proviſions; and when ſome of the reſt would accompany me, we was often provided for two or three days plentifully, during which I did walk about, or repair the wigwhams, or procure fire-wood; and thus the time paſſed till the company's return, which was a day of mirth and feſtivity; and by my means plenty of food was ready for them, for they generally come home hungry and poor in fleſh, as time will not admit of hunting much, and the dried meat they take with them, is gone before they ſet out on their return.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="unknown:034461_0187_0FFF0C0DBA5A4350"/>
I was very glad to ſee them, and was embraced in their manner of patting the right cheek with their right hand very cordially; and the good ſupper that was in readineſs for them exulted them highly: the women and even the men making known that it was my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and how uſeful I had been all the time they was abſent; this made them give a ſhout, and ſque<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The produce of the journey was left untouched till the morning: it was wrapped up in very coarſe Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh bags, like wool bags, ſuch as the Spaniards pack their wool in. Next morning when we came to open the parcels they conſiſted of the following articles:</p>
               <p>Hatchets, knives, wine, corn, ſpirits, wooden and glaſs bottles, leather, hats, toys, ſome carpenter's tools, and many other articles: the generality of which were uſeful things if they had been in the poſſeſſion of ſuch as knew how to uſe them; but as the articles they did exchange coſt nothing, neither was what they did bring back in return of much ſervice, excepting the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor and corn; leather and hats; the leather they did cut out into things ſomething like ſhoes, and the hats they wore.</p>

During all the time I was with them, we never ſlept from home ten nights, not going far enough in the day; for if they did not meet with ſucceſs enough in time to return, they went back without, and this was the cauſe of our being ſo often ſhort of proviſion; and even when we did fall in with a herd of deer, that by purſuing them we might have killed probably twenty in the courſe of day, which might be preſerved by drying, their dilatory natures would not permit them to embrace the opportunity.</p>
               <p>This tribe was worthy of pity, for they had every advantage, and improved none: their ſituation was ſuch that they was never moleſted by other troubleſome tribes:—they had a large tract of land, with a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of it almoſt free from every incumbrance; fine ſtreams of water; plenty of game; ſix or ſeven good horſes, and opportunity to procure of the other tribes that trade with the Spaniards every neceſſary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle they wanted; and yet ſurrounded with all theſe advantages, they fared harder and lived more uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable than any tribe I was with; 'tis true they had better covering, and warmer lodging, but too lazy to provide for their bellies, and as craving for food when 'twas on the ſpot as the reſt.</p>
               <p>I believe this was the moſt diſtant tribe, in-land, that did ever have any European commodities in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular courſe of dealing, for I never ſaw one man that belonged to another tribe whilſt I was with them.</p>

I was really deſirous to render them all the ſervice I could, and if it could not be done one way, to do it in another; for which purpoſe, I propoſed to them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of wigwhams, and repair thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready erected: I explained to them the purpoſe of the tools, and how to uſe them; we had a ſaw and other ſerviceable tools, as hammer and nails: I very ſoon brought them to approve of my plan for increaſing our dwellings; which we ſet about upon an improved plan, conſidering the abilities of the architect; and ſoon had a frame of wood conſtructed, ſo that when it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into partitions, would conſtitute ſix comfortable cabins; or a houſe with ſix rooms. The carpenter's work was left to me, and though a workman would ſee nothing to merit his notice, it was an ingenious, maſterly piece of building here: we had no boards, nor wanted none: the frame was the principal; and for rafters, joices, and upright pieces, they was ſo thick, it was eaſy for us to make all cloſe with pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I became very anxious to leave them, and the ſecond week after the company's departure, I done it; the principal cauſe for it at that exact time was as follows:</p>
               <p>The men remaining behind, was ſo indolent that 'twas almoſt impoſſible for me with the little aſſiſtance I received from them, to kill game ſufficient to render the women comfortable; for their own wolfiſh appetites would gorge in ſuch an amazing quantity, when put before them, tho' too lazy to hunt for it, that with all my induſtry the women ſuffered much; but I had a ſincere good will for them, and hunted with pleaſure for their comfortable ſuſtenance. Being exaſperated at their uncommon idleneſs, I came to a determination to quit them, and try to trace the tracks of the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; but it being through woods, and acroſs rivers, I knew it would be attended with great difficulties, and many hazards; but I concluded if I was taken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="193" facs="unknown:034461_0191_0FFF0C16ADDA6B28"/>
accordingly taking my bow and arrows as uſual, I roſe early in the morning and ſet out, but had not gone more than four miles, before a large deer ſtarted up before me; not willing to let ſuch an opportunity eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, I levelled and brought him to the ground; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in poſſeſſion of him, I could not tell what to do with him on the journey, and of courſe turned round with him towards my companions that I had left, which as ſoon as they ſaw ſo early in the day, they all began to ſhew tokens of gratitude, and joyfulneſs; their extacies and fondneſs attached me to them again too powerfully to leave them again that day, and next morning an incident happened that prevented it: the men all aroſe cheerful and in high ſpirits, to go a hunting, and after breakfaſt, taking bow and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, went forth; appointing me their leader; and from my frequent traverſing the woods, no one at that time was better qualified to know where the game moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſorted. We kept ſo cloſe together as to be within ſound of a whiſtle; this was by my deſire, becauſe I had a few days before ſeen two pair of deer feeding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, and was in hopes amongſt us all we ſhould fall in with them, which accordingly happened, and we killed three, beſides a good ſtock of game we had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſo that we returned home loaded with ſpoil. I earneſtly preſſed them to cure it, and for us to renew our chaſe next morning, but all in vain; they eat eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bit before one of them attempted to ſtir, and the women are as bad as the men in this caſe: they eat

very luxuriouſly till all is gone, and never urge the men in the leaſt to activity.</p>
               <p>This waſteful extravagance gave me a diſguſt even to the women, and made me renew my reſolutions of leaving them; accordingly, next morning I took my leave as before, and marched forward all the day; I was not under any fear of being purſued; for I fancy the terror was now on their ſide for my ſafety. As I had nothing to impede my progreſs, I imagine my journey that day was about fifty miles; and altho' I had traced their horſes by the dung upwards of thirty miles, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now a river to croſs, I was at a ſtand, nor could ſee any ſigns where they paſſed it, and following the ſtream near a mile one way in vain, and going the ſame road back for near a mile on the other to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I gave over the ſearch for the night, and dearly repented the attempt. In the morning very early I aroſe and went forward by the ſide of the ſtream, and thus travelled till near mid-day, when being quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed and dejected, I ſat down and eat the laſt bit of meat I brought away: thus deſpairing of croſſing the water, I was almoſt upon turning back, but being thus f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>With all the ſpeed poſſible I made towards it, and ſoon came near enough to diſcern a well cultivated farm, with horſes, cows, corn, and hay in plenty: I now thanked my fortunate ſtars that had led my wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering footſteps to the deſirable ſpot, after one year and nine months reſidence amongſt the laſt Indians: I cannot call it a captivity, becauſe I was always at large and at liberty.</p>

               <p>WITH a timorous aſſurance, between hope and fear, I approached the houſe; and knocking at the door, there came out a well dreſſed Indian, who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at me for ſome time with a mild and ſymathiſing countenance; but by the form of his head I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he was one of the Woolaways, from whom I firſt made my eſcape, and this filled me with ſome terror, but conſidering the diſtance I was from them, it ſoon ſubſided.</p>
               <p>The venerable ſtranger now addreſſed me in the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh language; but I did not underſtand him, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed him in turn in my own native tongue, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and to my great ſurpriſe and joy, he anſwered me in the ſame language:—how did my heart leap

After I had done ſupper, my aged hoſt took me into his parlour, and began in a very polite and reſpectful manner to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogate me; as who I was? how I came there? and many other ſimilar queſtions: all which I anſwered in the moſt reſpectful manner; and ſhould have accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it with humiliating manners, but he had not enough of the European in him, to diſplay his own dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by humbling in body, the already diſtreſſed in ſpirit: he wiſhed to alleviate the ſufferings, and not increaſe the painful ſenſations of an unfortunate fellow-creature, by manifeſting his own feelings; judging I muſt be fatigued in body, he adviſed me to go to reſt, aſſuring me I might ſleep compoſed and calm in mind.</p>
               <p>Thus cloſed the firſt night's interrogation, and I had no reaſon to be under any dread for the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

My bed being ready, I made him a thankful obeiſance, and went to reſt. I now candidly aſſure my readers, that it was the middle of the might before I could go to ſleep; owing to the pleaſing reflections on my mind, when contraſted with what was paſt:—the ſoftneſs of a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>After breakfaſt, we renewed our evening ſubject; and I gave him a circumſtantial detail of the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of my life, from firſt going to ſea, till this hour. He ſeemed to give credit to all my relation, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that which concerned the different tribes of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans I had been with; for my deſcribing their particular marks and cuſtoms, he told me their names, which I did not know before, and expreſſed a happy ſurpriſe that I eſcaped them; for there was very few did ever eſcape alive from the Woolaways. He ſaid it was not often that they did retain any captive as a ſlave, but
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:034461_0197_0FFF1AB8D5AF4CD0"/>
kill him immediately; but the other tribes did keep a captive a great while, but it was not often they had one, being too far from the ſea. And for the Bucke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raws, he was aſtoniſhed how I got amongſt them, as they are at a farther diſtance from the Woolaways, than the third tribe I fell in with. The Woolaways are the moſt ſavage race in all that part of the country—The diſtance I was now from whence they firſt took me, he ſaid was about four hundred miles; and their neareſt place of rendezvous to this ſpot, about three hundred; between them and us was the two laſt tribes, but the ſecond and third tribe laid off at a conſiderable diſtance; ſo that if I had taken the right courſe when I firſt eſcaped from the Woolaways, it is probable I might have been at his houſe five or ſix years ago; for if I had eſcaped the Aſſenwaſſes, the third tribe, I ſould have been at once with this laſt tribe, and could have left them when I pleaſed:—he called them Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poos, and ſaid they was the moſt inoffenſive Indians in all South America; that they did generally go twice a year up the country to trade with ſome other Indians, who carried on a correſpondence with the Spaniards:—their journey was ſometimes longer and further than at others:—when they did ſet out for a diſtant trade, near two hundred miles from their own home, they did go in a large company, becauſe they had a tedious wood to paſs that was much peſtered with a band of Indian miſcreants, that made a practice of plundering all that they fell in with that was not too powerful for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="unknown:034461_0198_0FFF1ABBC6DB2C38"/>
The road my laſt tribe did travel, was about forty miles one ſide this houſe:—he told me where I loſt their track, and how far I had got on my unknown journey at that time:—if I had continued in their route, I ſhould, in ſix or ſeven hours more, arrived at another Indian village, larger than that I left, who did alſo go the ſame journey yearly to trade; but they had graſs, corn, and tame cattle around them, and very induſtrious, and proportionally luxurious and waſteful; beſides being exceſſive drinkers. The chief commodity they did bring home was ſpirits, and this did frequently create broils and ſtrife between them, which made both them and their neighbourhood very diſagreeable; they was about forty miles from this place: the next inhabited ſpot was about a hundred miles forward, conſiſting of above two hundred ſouls, divided into about eighty families, each having their own wigwham, or hut; the next was about twenty miles forward, and theſe was near enough to the ſea to ſail up the river in their canoes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               <p>He ſaid it was in one reſpect fortunate for me that I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

of their hands, they would have ſold me to the ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, who would have ſentenced me to the gallows, or committed me to the mines for my life. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards gave them a good price for an Engliſhman, and he ſuppoſed there might be now many hundreds of my countrymen condemned to the mines, that have been reported as dead by the hands of Indians, or wild beaſts; but it is ſeldom any tribe kill a captive that is near enough to diſpoſe of him, as they frequently do from one tribe to another; perhaps the firſt will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change him for a few dead animals, if their diſtance is too far from the ſea; and the next for a little more, and ſo on till he falls into the hands of chriſtian barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, more inhuman than Indian ſavages.</p>
               <p>He told me of four Engliſhmen that had about four years ago been taken by the Woolaways, who had made their eſcape after nearly two years bondage; their calamities and ſufferings not enabling them to do it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

My truſty guides brought me to the Indian town, but durſt not be ſeen with me, for fear ſome Spaniards ſhould be in the place.

I was remanded to priſon, until the pleaſure of the Spaniſh preſident, which reſided at Guatamala, ſhould be known; but who at this time was in Old Spain, and of courſe would not return to resume the reigns of government for many months there was no alternative but patience, and I was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered back to my dungeon, but with orders from the magiſtrates that my future allowance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>This weekly indulgence was very beneficial to me in many reſpects, for I had plenty of good proviſions, and liquor brought me weekly from the tables of the generous and feeling citizens; and as a proof of their zeal for my alleviation, they did ſend me ſuch preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meats, liquors and fruit, as would keep good in my unwholeſome cell all the week; ſo that I wanted none of the priſon allowance, and at the week's end did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute my remains amongſt my unfortunate ſufferers.

In this manner did I ſpend a whole year, before any tidings came of the return of the Preſident to Guatama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la from Old Spain; when a ſpecial meſſenger was ſent upon the buſineſs to know his pleaſure, and in about eight weeks, an order came for me to be conducted to Guatamala to be examined by him: I was according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loaded with heavier irons on my legs than ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and eight privates, beſides two non-commiſſioned officers appointed to conduct me: this diſtance was upwards of two hundred miles.

               <p>After my irons was off, he took me into another apartment, and ordered a ſervant to place before me proviſions: when I was comfortably refreſhed, I was ordered into another room, where was water to waſh, and apparel to put on:—when I was both clean and cloathed, he took me into the parlour, and renewed the converſation: I gave him the particulars of my life, in a very comprehenſive manner, which he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his clerk to take down in writing, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At length we arrived at the deſtined place; the town of Guatamala, which was the capital of the province, and the Governor, or Preſident of the ſouthern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces did reſide there.

The firſt door he opened preſented a gloomy paſſage, about one yard under ground: we deſcended the ſteps, and walked on about twenty ſteps; here we halted till a candle was brought (two of the ſoldiers with their bayonets being with us) another door was now opened, and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended five or ſix ſteps more, and walked about ten yards, when another door was opened, and cloſe to that again another; when I was ordered to take off my trowſers that my laſt good friend gave me; and the cruel gaoler began to equip me with irons.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place he put ſtrong manacles on my hands; heavy iron bars on my legs, that kept them about twelve inches aſunder; chains about my waiſt and neck; and during the night, my feet ſecured in a pair of ſtocks, and proviſion ſcarcely ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port life.</p>

The number of theſe, my ſequeſtered companions, I cannot tell, but by the different voices, I imagined there muſt be fifty or more.</p>
               <p>About three weeks after my confinement, I was conducted by a very ſtrong guard (upwards of twenty men) before the preſident: I then related to him a full and particular detail of all my ſufferings, in the moſt affecting, petitioning, and ſupplicating ſtyle, my feeble abilities would permit, and flattered myſelf with the faint hopes of procuring my liberty; but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling wretch was inflexible to all my prayers, tears, ſubmiſſion, and intreaties.

               <p>I was now in the moſt deplorable ſituation that ever had befallen me; for I thought that my next removal from this temporary darkneſs would be to the mines, to experience eternal darkneſs, as far as eternity relates to this life. Being remanded to my dungeon, all the comfort to be enjoyed was the rattling of chains, oaths and blaſphemies, of thoſe devil hardened wretches that was doomed to ſpend their days in this horrible habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; where there was nothing to attract the notice of the eye, but one continued ſcene of woeful darkneſs.</p>

In a few weeks I found that a good and merciful God had not forſaken me, and he who had led me through ſuch a number of difficulties and dangers, would at laſt ſtretch forth a kind hand of deliverance, and ſet my feet at liberty.</p>
               <p>One morning, when the keeper came to ſupply the priſoners with their daily allowance, a beautiful lady was conducted into the dungeon, ſurrounded by the guard that always accompanied the keeper, for it muſt not be ſuppoſed that one man could entruſt himſelf alone, amongſt a ſet of abandoned wretches of that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription. As ſoon as the lady entered, ſhe called out, <hi>"where is the Engliſhman?"</hi>—How my heart leaped for joy at the ſound:—I immediately anſwered, <hi>"here"</hi>—no perſon but myſelf underſtood what ſhe ſaid. I was then led out to an apartment ſuitable to the dignity of my viſitor, who deſired to hear he particulars of my adventures and ſufferings, with which I readily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and gave her a minute detail of the remarkable viciſſitudes of my checkered fortune.</p>
               <p>Her ſympathiſing heart ſeemed to be pathetically af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected at my paſt, as well as <hi>preſent</hi> ſufferings particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.—She ſaid that her parents was from England, and left it when ſhe was about ten years of age, and conſequently, ſhe ſtill entertained an affection and eſteem for her country people; and ſeeing me carried before the preſident, ſhe procured all the information concerning me that poſſibly ſhe could, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced

of my innocency, as to the charges alledged againſt me, ſhe had waited on the governor and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded for me to the utmoſt of her abilities and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but was ſorry to ſay, that all her exertions prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abortive towards procuring my liberty; and as ſhe was unfortunate in her endeavours to do as ſhe would, ſhe would do as much as ſhe could towards rendering my unhappy ſituation as comfortable as poſſible; and indeed her generoſity and exertions in my behalf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded my moſt ſanguine expectations; for being a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of rank and fortune, ſhe prevailed upon the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor at her next interview, to free me from the greateſt part of my heavy irons, and daily ſent me from her own table plenty of proviſions, but could not procure me a more comfortable ſituation in priſon; and the dungeon where I was confined was damp, cold, naſty, and infectious;—the criminals die very ſoon in general after this perpetual ſentence is paſſed upon them;—the ſooner they are dead, the more profitable it is to the contractor, who have a yearly ſtipend for to provide for thoſe thus condemned, without any regard to the number conſined.</p>
               <p>I never had the happineſs to ſee the face of my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der benefactreſs after the firſt time, until I was taken from the dungeon to be ſent away; which was at the expiration of ſeven months from my firſt commitment; and during that ſpace I ſuffered ſo much by cold, filth, and unwholeſomeneſs of the diſagreeable ſtench, iſſuing

continually from every part of the cavern, that when I came out to be conveyed forward, I found ſuch an alteration in my left ſide, that I could not be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly accountable for; a kind of a ſtiffneſs, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a chill and weakneſs; but free from pain.</p>
               <p>When the day came for my removal, the warrant of my imperious judge was read to me by an interpreter; altho' I had by this time attained a tolerable fluency in the Spaniſh tongue. I was to be eſcorted from town to town till I arrived at port Omoa, and from thence to be ſent by the firſt veſſel to Old Spain. Nothing particular occurred on the journey—it took us ſix days, and one day we reſted on account of my debilitated ſtate of body, for I found my left ſide growing worſe and worſe. In our journey we paſſed through ſeveral ſmall towns, and on the laſt day I was ſo weak, we did not ride more than eight miles. Being introduced to the chief officer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was ordered up into the country, about nine or ten miles by the ſeaſide, to await the ſailing of a veſſel: here I was ſtrongly ironed, and barely ſupported with food—had the advantage of light and air, but confined in a room. I remained here but a few weeks, before a ſmall fleet was ready to ſail for Europe; but through ſome neglect, after every neceſſary preparation was made, and I had as I thought, bid adieu to priſons and impriſonment on theſe coaſts, when we arrived at the town, to my great mortification, the fleet had ſailed the day before: I was now remanded to priſon until another opportunity offered, which was not more than ſeven or eight days.</p>

During the ſhort time I was in this priſon, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſeveral tremendous earthquakes, one ſhock of which was ſo powerful, that notwithſtanding the amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrength of the fort, it was made to reel from its very foundation, and its ſtupendous ſides were rend from top to bottom: but theſe circumſtances did not make that dreadful impreſſion upon my mind as they proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly would ſome years paſt, for being for ſo many years inured to unparallelled ſufferings and cruelties, the ſear of death was baniſhed, and all its hideous forms was pleaſant, as it long had been, and ſtill would be, a welcome gueſt, for there was no proſpect of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing health, peace, or happineſs for me in this world.</p>
               <p>Here I learnt for the firſt time that the young man of whom my hoſpitable Indian had informed me of (when I eſcaped from the woods) had been confined in the ſame priſons, and ſailed ſome time before from this port for Old Spain, to be baniſhed to the mines for life, and where we probably might be fellow-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers together for our lives.</p>
               <p>A veſſel being now ready for ſea, I was put on board, and weighing anchor, we went before a briſk gale all the day. There was two men ſent with me as a guard, but I was entirely free from all reſtraint, it being need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs where I could not eſcape.</p>

               <p>The veſſel was to call at the Havannah, and when we arrived there, an exchange of priſoners between Spain and England was taking place. In a few days five hundred Engliſh priſoners was called over to be ſent home, and in the hurry, I ſlipt in amongſt them, and was put on board, and came home to London, and from thence to my native place, after upwards of thirteen years abſence.</p>
