            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Preface.</head>
            <p>ABout six and twenty years ago, a <hi>Design for the Recording of illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Providences,</hi> was under serious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration among some eminent Ministers in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Ireland.</hi> That mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was principally set on foot by the Learned Mr. <hi>Matthew Pool,</hi> whose <hi>Synop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis Criticorum,</hi> and other Books by him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, have made him famous in the World. But before any thing was brought to effect, the Persons to have been imployed, had their thoughts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted another way. Nevertheless, there was a M. SS. (the Composer whereof is to me unknown) then written, wherein
<pb facs="unknown:000373_0003_0FA55A84815F1EB8"/>
the Subjects proper for this <hi>Record,</hi> and some Rules for the better managing a design of this nature, are described. In that <hi>M. SS.</hi> I find notable Stories related and attested, which elsewhere I never met with. Particularly, the Sory of Mr. <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Colchester,</hi> and another mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our <hi>subsequent Essay.</hi> And besides those, there are some very memorable Passages written, which have not as yet been published, so far as I understand. There are in that <hi>M. SS.</hi> several <hi>Remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bless</hi> about <hi>Apparitions,</hi> e. g. It is there said, that Dr. <hi>Frith,</hi> (who was one of the Prebends belonging to <hi>Windsor</hi>) lying on his Bed, the Chamber Doors were thrown open, and a Corps with attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Torches brought to his Bed-side upon a Bier; The Corps representing one of his own Family: After some pause, there was such another shew, till he, the said Dr. his Wife and all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were brought in on the Bier in such order as they all soon after died. The Dr. was not then sick, but quickly
<pb facs="unknown:000373_0004_0FA55A854AC69F08"/>
Melancholly, and would rising at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night repair to the Graves and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at <hi>Eaton Colledge;</hi> saying, that he and his must shortly take up their nabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation among the Dead. The Relater of this Story (a Person of great inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity) had it from Dr. <hi>Frith's</hi> Son, who also added, <hi>My Fathers Vision is already Executed upon all the Family but my self, my time is next, and near at hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mentioned <hi>M. SS.</hi> there is also a marvelous Relation concerning a young Scholar in <hi>France:</hi> For, it is there affirmed, that this prophane Student, having by extravagant courses outrun his means; in his discontent walking soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, a Man came to him, and enquired the cause of his sadness. Which he own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be want of Money, had presently a supply given him by the other. That being quickly consumed upon his Lusts; as soon as his Money was gone his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content returned; and in his former Walk, he met with his former Reliever, who again offered to supply him; but
<pb facs="unknown:000373_0005_0FA55A85F98CFC88"/>
askt him to contract with him to be his, and to sign the contract with his Blood. The woful wretch consented: but not long after, considering that this contract was made with the Devil; the terrors of his Conscience became insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable; so as that he endeavoured to kill himself to get out of them. Some Ministers, and other Christians being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed how matters were circumstanced, kept dayes of Prayer for him and with him: and he was carefully watched that so he might be kept from Self-Murder. Still he continued under Terror, and said he should do so, as long as the Covenant which he had signed, remained in the hands of the Devil. Hereupon, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters resolve to keep a day of Fasting and Prayer in that very place of the Field where the distressed creature had made the woful Bargain, setting him in the midst of them. Thus they did, and being with special actings of Faith much enlarged to pray earnestly to the Lord to make known his power over Satan,
<pb facs="unknown:000373_0006_0FA55A86EE050950"/>
in constraining him, to give up that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, after some hours continuance in Prayer, a Cloud was seen to spread it self over them, and out of it the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract signed with the poor crearures Blood was dropped down amongst them; which being taken up and viewed, the party concerned took it, and tore it in pieces. The Relator had this from the mouth of <hi>Mr. Beaumond,</hi> a Minister of Note at <hi>Caon</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> who assured him that he had it from one of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters that did assist in carrying on the Day of prayer when this memorable providence hapned. Nor is the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion impossible to be true, for <hi>Luther</hi> speaks of a providence not unlike unto this, which hapned in his Congregation.</p>
            <p>This <hi>M. SS.</hi> doth also mention some most <hi>Remarkable Judgments</hi> of God upon Sinners, as worthy to be Recorded for Posterity to take notice of. It is there said, that when Mr. <hi>Richard Juxon</hi> was a Fellow of <hi>Kings Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he led a most vicious life: and whereas
<pb facs="unknown:000373_0007_0FA55A8784381018"/>
such of the Students as were serious in matters of Religion, did endeavour by solemn Fasting and Prayer to prepare themselves for the Communion which was then (this was about the year 1636) on <hi>Easter-Day.</hi> This <hi>Juxon</hi> spent all the time of preparation in Drunken wild Meetings, and was up late and Drunk on the Saturday night. Nevertheless, on the Lords day, he came with others to the Communion, and sat next to the Relator, who knowing his Disorder the night before, was much troubled: but had no remedy; Church-Discipline not being then so practised as ought to have been. The Communion being ended, such of the Scholars as had the fear of God in their hearts, repaired to their Closets. But this <hi>Juxon</hi> went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to a Drunken-meeting, and there to a Cockfight, where he fell to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed madness, and pouring out a volley of Oaths and Curses; while these were between his Lips, God smote him dead in the twinkle of an eye. And though
<pb facs="unknown:000373_0008_0FA55A888AB09E38"/>
               <hi>Juxon</hi> were but young, and of a comely person, his Carcase was immediately so corrupted as that the stench of it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable, insomuch that no house would receive it; and his Friends were forced to hire some base Fellows to watch the Carcase till night; and then with Pitch and such like Gums covered him in a Coffin, and so made a shift to endure his Interment. There stood by a Scholar, whose name was <hi>George Hall,</hi> and who acted his part with <hi>Juxon</hi> in his prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: but he was so astonished with this amazing Providence of God, as that he fell down upon his knees, begging par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy from Heaven, and vowing a Reformation; which vow the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled him to keep, so as that afterwards he became an able and famous Minister of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>One strange passage more I shall here relate out of the <hi>M. SS.</hi> which we have thus far made mention of. Therein I find part of a Letter transcribed; which is as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:000373_0009_0FA55A898644D008"/>
               <q>
                  <hi>Lismore,</hi> Octob. 2. 1658. In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of this Countrey, a poor man being suspected to have stollen a Sheep was questioned for it; he forswore the thing, and wished that if he had stollen it, God would cause the Horns of the Sheep to grow upon him. This man was seen within these few dayes by a Minister of great repute for Piety, who saith, that the Man has an Horn growing out of one corner of his Mouth, just like that of a sheep: from which he hath cut seventeen In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and is forced to keep it tyed by a string to his Ear, to prevent its grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to his eye: This Minister not only saw but sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this Horn, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it in this Family this week, as also a Gentleman formerly did, who was himself an eye-witness thereof. Surely such passages are a Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive evidence that there is a God, who judgeth in the Earth, and who though he stay long, will not be mocked al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:000373_0010_0FA55A8EC43E5978"/>
I shall say no more concerning the <hi>M. SS.</hi> only that it was sent over to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> by (as I suppose) Mr. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rtlib.</hi> How it came to lie dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mient in his hands I know not: though I had the happiness of special Intimacy with that worthy Man, I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that ever I heard him speak any thing of it. But since his Death, looking o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his <hi>M. SS's</hi> I met with this, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated it to other Ministers, who highly approved of the noble design aimed at therein. Soon after which, some Proposals in order to the reviving of this work were drawn up, and presented at a general Meeting of the Ministers in this Colony. <hi>May</hi> 12. 1681. which it may not be unsuitable here to recite.</p>

               <p>VIII. <hi>When any thing of this Nature shall be ready for the Presse, it appears on sundry Grounds very expedient, that it should be read, and approved of at some Meeting of the Elders, before Publication.</hi>

               <p>These things being Read and Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; the Author of this <hi>Essay,</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to begin the work which is here done; and I am Engaged to many for the Materials, and Informations which the following Collections do consist <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

attend what shall be related. Nor dare I averr, that there are none such in what follows. Only I have been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to prevent them; and as to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of each passage, I am well assured it is according to Truth. That rare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident about the Lightning which: cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a wonderful change in the Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of a Vessel then at Sea, was as is in the Book expressed <hi>Page</hi> 91.92. Only it is uncertain whether they were then exactly in the Latitude of 38. For they had not taken an Observation for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dayes, but the Master of the Vessel affirms that to be the Latitude so near as they could conjecture. Since the Needle was changed by the Lightning, if a lesser Compass be set over it, the Needle therein (or any other touched with the Load-stone) will alter its polari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; turn about to the South, as I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times to my great admiration expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented. There is near the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a dark spot, like as if it were burnt with a drop of Brimstone, supposed to
<pb facs="unknown:000373_0015_0FA55A944DC07648"/>
be caused by the Lightning. Whether the <hi>Magnetic</hi> impressions on that part of the Needle being dissipated by the heat of the Lightning, and the <hi>effluvia</hi> on the South end of the Needle only remaining untouched thereby, be the true natural reason of the marvelous alteration; or whither it ought to be ascribed to some other cause, the Ingenious may consider.</p>
               <p>There is another Remarkable Passage about Lightning which hapned at <hi>Dux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> concerning which I have lately received this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Account.</p>

Set fire in the Thatch of a Leanto which was on the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of a Room adjoyning to the former, in which the five persons abovementioned were. It melted some Pewter, so that it ran into drops on the out-side, as is often seen on Tin ware; melted round holes in the top of a Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shovel proportionable in quantity to a small Goose-shot; struck Mrs. <hi>Southworths</hi> Arm so that it was for a time benummed; smote the young Child <hi>Benjamin</hi> in his Mothers Arms, deprived it of Breath for a space, and to the Mothers apprehension squcased it as flat as a Planck; smote a Dog stone-dead which lay within two foot of <hi>Philip Delano,</hi> the Dog never moved out of his place or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tsture, in which he was when smitteh, but giving a small yelp, and quivering with his

It smote the said <hi>Philip,</hi> made his right Arm senseless for a time, together with the middle finger in special (of his right hand) which was benummed, and turned as white as Chalk or Lime, yet attended with little pain. After some few hours that finger began to recover its proper colour at the Knuckle, and so did gradually whiten unto its extremity; And although the said <hi>Delano</hi> felt a most vioilent heat upon his Body, as if he had been scorched in the midst of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent burning fire, yet his Clothes were not singed, neither had the smell of fire passed thereon.</p>
               <p>I could not insert this Story in its proper place, because I received it after that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter about Thunder and Lightning was Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Some credible, persons who have been Eye-witnesses of it, inform me, that the Lightning in that House at <hi>Duxborough,</hi> did with the vehemency of its flame, cause the Bricks in the Chimney to melt like molten lead: which particular was as Remarkable as any of the other mentioned in the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and therefore I thought good here to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Some <hi>Digressions</hi> I have made in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Chapters, handling several consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable <hi>Cases of Conscience,</hi> supposing it not unprofitable, or improper so to do; since the things related gave the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: both Leisure and Exercise of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are required in the due perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of a Service of this Nature: There are some that have more leisure, and many that have greater Abilities than I have: I expect not that they should make my <hi>Method</hi> their Standard; but they may follow a better of their own, as they shall see cause.

               <p>I could have mentioned some very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Passages of Divine Providence, wherein the Countrey in general hath been concerned. Some <hi>Remarkables</hi> of that kind are to be seen in my former Relations of the Troubles occasioned by the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi> There are other particulars no less worthy to be Recorded, but in my judgement, this is not so proper a season for us to divulge them. It has been in my thoughts to publish a Discourse of <hi>Miscellaneous obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, concerning things rare and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; both as to the works of Creation and Providence;</hi> which in my small Readings I have met with in many Authors: But this must suffice for the present. I have often wished, that the <hi>Natural History</hi> of <hi>New-England,</hi> might be written and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished to the World; the Rules and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod described by that Learned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent person <hi>Robert Boyle</hi>

THe Royal Pen of the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> hath most truly affirmed, that they who go down to the Sea in Ships, that do business in great waters, see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep. And in special, they see wonders of Divine goodness in respect of eminent Deliverances wrought by the hand of the most High, who stills the noise of the Seas, the noise of their waves. It is meet that such Providences should be ever had in remembrance, as most of all by the persons concerned in them, so by others, that the God of Salvation, who is the confidence of them that are afar off upon the Sea, may have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal praise. Many remarkable Stories of this kind, are to be seen in Books already publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. <hi>E.G.</hi> in <hi>Mandelslo's</hi> Travels <hi>Hackluit,</hi> and <hi>Linshoten's</hi> Voyages; <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <q>I must turn my drowned Pen and shaking Hand to Indite the Story of such sad News as never before this hapned in <hi>New-England.</hi> There was a League of perpetual Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship between my Cousin <hi>Avery</hi> (note that this Mr. <hi>Avery</hi> was a precious holy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister who came out of <hi>England</hi> with Mr. <hi>Anthony Thacher</hi>) and my self never to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake each other to the Death, but to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of each others misery or welfare, as also of habitation in the same place. Now upon our Arrival in <hi>New-England,</hi> there was an offer made unto us. My cousin <hi>Avery</hi> was invited to <hi>Marble-head</hi> to be their Pastor in due time; there being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o Church planted there as yet, but a Town appointed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000373_0024_0FA55A9C741655D8"/>
to set up the Trade of Fishing. Because many there (the most being Fishermen) were something loose and remiss in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour; my Cousin <hi>Avery</hi> was unwilling to go thither, and so refusing we went to <hi>Newbery,</hi> intending thereto sit down. But being solicited so often both by the Men of the place, and by the Magistrates, and by Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and most of the Ministers, who alledged what a benefit we might be to the People there, and also to the Countrey and Common-wealth; at length we embraced it, and thither consented to go. They of <hi>Marble-head</hi> forthwith sent a Pinnace for us and our Goods. We Embarqued at <hi>Ipswich, August</hi> 11. 1635. with our Families and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, bound for <hi>Marble-head,</hi> we being in all twenty three Souls, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> eleven in my Cousin's Family, seven in mine, and one Mr. <hi>William Eliot</hi> sometimes of <hi>New Sarum,</hi> and four Mariners. The next morning ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving commended our selves to God, with chearful hearts, we hoised Sail; but the Lord suddenly turned our chearfulness into mourning and lamentations. For on the fourteenth of this <hi>August 1635.</hi> about ten at night, having a fresh Gale of wind, our Sails being old and done were split. The Mariners because that it was night, would
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000373_0025_0FA55A9F1CA71158"/>
not put to new Sails, but resolved to cast Anchor till the Morning. But before day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, it pleased the Lord to send so mighty a Storm, as the like was never known in <hi>New-England</hi> since the <hi>English</hi> came, nor in the memory of any of the <hi>Indians.</hi> It was so furious that our Anchor came home. Whereupon the Mariners let out more Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which at last slipt away. Then our Sailers knew not what to do, but we were driven before the wind and waves. My Cousin and I perceived our danger, solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended our selves to God the Lord both of Earth and Seas, expecting with every wave to be swallowed up and drenched in the Deeps. And as my Cousin, his Wife, and my tender Babes sat comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and chearing one the other in the Lord against ghastly Death, which every moment stared us in the face, and sat triumphing upon each ones Forehead, we were by the violence of the Waves and fury of the winds, (by the Lords permission) lifted up upon a Rock between two high Rocks, yet all was one Rock, but it raged with the stroke which came into the Pinnace, so as we were presently up to our middles in water as we sat. The Waves came furiously and violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over us, and against us, but by reason of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000373_0026_0FA55AA0A1DB05D0"/>
the Rocks proportion could not lift us off, but beat her all to pieces. Now look with me upon our distress, and consider of my misery, who beheld the Ship broken, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in her, and violently overwhelming us, my Goods, and Provisions swimming in the Seas, my Friends almost drowned, and mine own poor Children so untimely (if I may so term it without offence) before mine eyes drowned, and ready to be swallowed up and dashed to pieces against the Rocks by the merciless waves, and my self ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them. But I must go on to an end of this woful Relation. In the same room whereas he sat, the Master of the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace not knowing what to do, our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mast was cut down, our main-Mast broken in three pieces, thefore part of the Pinnace beat away, our Goods swimming about the Seas, my Children bewailing me, as not pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying themselves, and my self bemoaning them; poor Souls, whom I had occasioned to such an end in their tender years, whenas they could scarce be sensible of death. And so likewise my Cousin, his Wife, and his Children, and both of us bewailing each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in our Lord and only Saviour Jesus Christ, in whom only we had comfort and cheerfulness, insomuch that from the greatest
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000373_0027_0FA55AA1D01C2540"/>
to the least of us, there was not one scriech or out-cry made, but all as silent sheep were contentedly resolved to die together loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as since our acquaintance we had lived together friendly. Now as I was sitting in the Cabbin room-door with my body in the room, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o one of the Sailers by a wave being washed out of the Pinnace was got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in again, and coming into the Cabbin room over my back, cried out, we are all cast away, the Lord have mercy upon us, I have been washed over-board into the Sea, and am gotten in again. His speeches made me look forth. And looking towards the Sea, and seeing how we were, I turned my self to my Cousin and the rest, and spake these words, Oh Cousin, it hath pleased God to cast us here between two Rocks, the shoar not far off from us, for I saw the tops of Trees when I looked forth. Whereupon, the Master of the Pinnace looking up at the Scuttle hole of the quarter Deck, went out at it, but I never saw him afterwards. Then he that had been in the Sea, went out again by me, and leapt overboard towards the Rocks, whom afterwards also I could not see. Now none were left in the Barque that I knew or saw, but my Cousin, his Wife and Children, my self and mine, and his
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000373_0028_0FA55AA27446B890"/>
maid-servant. But my Cousin thought I would have fled from him, and said unto me, Oh Cousin leave us not, let us die to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, and reached forth his hand unto me. Then I letting go my Son <hi>Peter's</hi> hand took him by the hand, and said, Cousin, I purpose it not, whither shall I go? I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ready here to die with you and my poor Children. God be merciful to us, and receive us to himself, adding these words, the Lord is able to help and deliver us. He replied, saying, truth Cousin, but what his pleasure is we know not: I fear we have been too unthankful for former deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but he hath promised to deliver us from sin and condemnation, and to bring us safe to heaven through the alsufficient satisfaction of Jesus Christ, <hi>this therefore we may challenge of him.</hi> To which I replying said, that is all the deliverance I now desire and expect. Which words I had no sooner spoken, but by a mighty wave I was with the piece of the Barque washed out upon part of the Rock, where the wave left me almost drowned, but recovering my feet I saw above me on the Rock my Daughter <hi>Mary,</hi> to whom I had no sooner gotten, but my Cousin <hi>Avery,</hi> and his eldest Son came to us, being all four of us washed out by one and the same Wave, we

went all into a small hole on the top of the Rock, whence we called to those in the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace to come unto us, supposing we had been in more safety than they were in. My Wife seeing us there was crept up into the scuttle of the Quarter Deck to come unto us, but presently came another wave and dashing the Pinnace all to pieces, carried my Wife away in the Scuttle, as she was, with the greater part of the quarter Deck unto the Shoar; where she was cast safely, but her Legs were something bruised, and much Timber of the Vessel being there also cast, she was sometime before she could get away being washed by the Waves. All the rest that were in the Barque were drowned in the merciless Seas. We four by that wave were clean swept away from off the Rock also, into the Sea; the Lord in one instant of time disposing of fifteen Souls of us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his good pleasure and will, His pleasure and wonderful great mercy to me was thus. Standing on the Rock as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you heard, with my eldest Daughter, my Cousin and his eldest Son, looking upon, and talking to them in the Barque, whenas we were by that merciless wave washed off the Rock, as before you heard. God in his mercy caused me to fall by the stroke of the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000373_0030_0FA55AA3F5A48758"/>
wave flat on my face, for my face was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Sea, insomuch that as I was sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding off the Rock into the Sea, the Lord directed my toes into a joynt in the Rocks side, as also the tops of some of my fingers with my right hand, by means whereof, the wave leaving me, I remained so, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the Rock only my head above the water. When on the left hand I espied a Board or Plank of the Pinnace. And as I was reaching out my left hand to lay hold on it, by another coming over the top of the Rock, I was washed away from the Rock, and by the violence of the waves was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hither and thither in the Seas a great while, and had many dashes against the Rocks. At length past hopes of Life, and wearied in body and spirits, I even gave over to nature, and being ready to receive in the waters of Death, I lifted up both my heart and hands to the God of Heaven. For note, I had my senses remaining per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with me all the time that I was under and in water, who at that instant lifted my head above the top of the water, that so I might breathe without any hindrance by the waters. I stood bolt upright as if I had stood upon my feet, but I felt no bottom, nor had any footing for to stand upon, but
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000373_0031_0FA55AA4E4905618"/>
the waters. While I was thus above the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I saw by me a piece of the Mast, as I suppose about three foot long, which I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to catch into my arms. But sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I was overwhelmed with water, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to and fro again, and at last I felt the ground with my right foot. When imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately whilest I was thus groveling on my face, I presently recovering my feet, was in the water up to my Breast, and through Gods great mercy had my face unto the shoar, and not to the Sea. I made hast to get out, but was thrown down on my hands with the waves, and so with safety crept to the dry shoar. Where blessing God, I turned about to look for my Children and Friends, but saw neither, nor any part of the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, where I left them as I supposed. But I saw my Wife about a Butt length from me getting her self forth from amongst the Timber of the broken Barque: but before I could get unto her, she was gotten to the shoar: I was in the water after I was wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Rock, before I came to the shoar a quarter of an hour at least. When we were come each to other, we went and sat under the Bank. But fear of the Seas roaring and our coldness would not suffer us there to remain. But we went up into
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000373_0032_0FA55AA58423B910"/>
the Land and sat us down under a Cedar Tree which the wind had thrown down, where we sat about an hour almost dead with cold. But now the Storm was broken up, and the wind was calm, but the Sea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained rough and fearful to us. My Legs were much bruised, and so was my head, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurt had I none, neither had I taken in much quantity of water: but my heart would not let me sit still any longer, but I would go to see if any more were gotten to the Land in safety, especially hoping to have met with some of my own poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but I could find none, neither dead nor yet living. You condole with me my miseries, who now began to consider of my losses. Now came to my remembrance the time and manner, how and when I last saw and left my Children and Friends. One was severed from me sitting on the Rock at my feet, the other three in the Pinnace: my little Babe (Ah poor <hi>Peter</hi>) sitting in his Sister <hi>Ediths</hi> arms, who to the uttermost of her power shelt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed him from the waters, my poor <hi>William</hi> standing close unto them, all three of them looking ruefully on me on the Rock; their very Countenances calling unto me to help them, whom I could not go unto, neither could they come at me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000373_0033_0FA55AA6E24EF198"/>
would the merciless waves afford me space or time to use any means at all, either to help them or my self. Oh I yet see their cheeks, poor silent Lambs, pleading pity and help at my hands. Then on the other side to consider the loss of my dear Friends, with the spoiling and loss of all our Goods and Provisions, my self cast upon an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Land, in a Wilderness, I knew not where, nor how to get thence. Then it came to my mind how I had occasioned the Death of my Children, who caused them to leave their native Land, who might have left them there, yea, and might have sent some of them back again and cost me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: these and such like thoughts do press down my heavy heart very much. But I must let this pass, and will proceed on in the Relation of Gods goodness unto me in that desolate Island, on which I was cast. I and my Wife were almost naked both of us, and wet and cold even unto death,. I found a Snapsack cast on the shoar, in which I had a Steel and Flint and Powder-horn. Going further I found a drowned Goat, then I found a Hat, and my Son <hi>William's</hi> Coat, both which I put on. My Wife found one of her Petticoats which she put on. I found also two Cheese and some Butter driven
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000373_0034_0FA55AA8481A47A0"/>
ashoar. Thus the Lord sent us some clothes to put on, and food to sustain our new lives which we had lately given unto us; and means also to make fire, for in an Horn I had some Gun-powder, which to mine own (and since to other mens) admiration was dry. So taking a piece of my Wives Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, which I dried in the Sun, I struck fire, and so dried and warmed our wet Bodies, and then skinned the Goat, and having found a small Brass-pot, we boyled some of her. Our Drink was brackish water; Bread we had none. There we remained until the Monday following, When about three of the Clock in the afternoon, in a Boat that came that way, we went off that deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Island; which I named after my name, <hi>Thachers Woe,</hi> and the Rock <hi>Avery his fall:</hi> to the end that their fall and loss, and mine own might be had in perpetual remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. In the Isle lieth buried the body of my Cousins eldest Daughter, whom I found dead on the shoar. On the Tuesday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the afternoon we arrived at <hi>Marble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Head.</hi>
                  </q> Thus far is Mr. <hi>Thachers</hi> Relation of this memorable Providence.</p>
               <p>We proceed to some other:</p>
               <p>Remarkable was that deliverance menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000373_0035_0FA55AA8C19672C8"/>
both by Mr. <hi>Janeway,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> wherein that gallant Commander Major <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Gibbons</hi> of <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> and others were concerned. The substance of the Story is this. A <hi>New-England</hi> Vessel go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Boston</hi> to some other parts of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> was through the continuance of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry winds, kept long at Sea, so that they were in very great straits for want of Provision, and seeing they could not hope for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from Earth or Sea, they apply themselves to Heaven in humble and hearty Prayers, but no Calm ensuing, one of them made this sorrowful motion, that they should cast Lots, which of them should die first, to satisfie the ravenous Hunger of the rest. After many a sad Debate, they come to a result, the Lot is cast, and one of the company is taken, but where is the Executioner to be found to act this Office upon a poor Innocent? It is death new to think who shall act this bloody part in the Tragedy: But before they fall upon this in-voluntary Execution, they once more went unto their Prayers, and while they were calling upon God, he answered them, for there leapt a mighty Fish into the Boat, which was a double joy to them, not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving their miserable hunger, which no doubt made them quick Cooks, but because
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000373_0036_0FA55AAB4D379B20"/>
they looked upon it to be sent from God, and to be a token of their Deliverance. But Alas! the Fish is soon caten, and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Exigencies come upon them, which sink their spirits into despair; for they know not of another Morsel. To Lot they go again the second time, which falleth upon another person; but still none can be found to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice him; they again send their Prayers to Heaven with all manner of fervency, when behold a second Answer from above! a great Bird lights, and fixes it self upon the Mast: which one of the Company espies, and he goes, and there she stands, till he took her with his hand by the wing. This was life from the dead the second time, and they feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves herewith, as hoping that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Providence was fore-runner of their compleat Deliverance. But they have still the same Disappointments, they can see no Land, they know not where they are. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger encreaseth again upon them, and they have no hopes to be saved but by a third Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. They are reduced to the former course of casting Lots, when they were going to the heart-breaking work, to put him to death whom the Lot fell upon, they go to God, their former Friend in adversity, by humble and hearty Prayers; and now they look and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000373_0037_0FA55AAC649065B8"/>
look again; but there is nothing: Their prayers are concluded, and nothing appears, yet still they hoped and stayed; till at last one of them espies a Ship, which put new life into all their spirits. They bear up with their Vessel, they Man their Boat, and desire and beg like perishing, humble Supplicants to Board them, which they are admitted. The Vessel proves a <hi>French</hi> Vessel, yea, a <hi>French Pirate.</hi> Major <hi>Gibbons</hi> petitions them for a little Bread, and offers Ship and Cargo for it. But the Commander knows the Major, (from whom he had received some signal kindnesses formerly at <hi>Boston</hi>) and replied readily, and chearfully, Major <hi>Gibbons,</hi> not a hair of you or your Company shall perish, if it ly in my power to preserve you. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he relieveth them, and sets them safe on shoar.</p>
               <p>Memorable also is that which Mr. <hi>Jane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> in his Remarkable Sea-Deliverances, <hi>P.35.</hi> hath published. He there relates that in the Year 1668. a Ketch whereof <hi>Thomas Woodbery</hi> was Master, Sailing from <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> for <hi>Barbadoes;</hi> when they came in the Latitude of <hi>35.gr.</hi> because there was some appearance of foul-weather, they lowred their Sails, sending up one to the top of the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000373_0038_0FA55AACF6CD3490"/>
Mast, he thought he saw something like a Boat floating upon the Sea, and calling to the Men below, they made towards it, and when they came near, it appeared to be a Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Boat with eleven Men in it, who had been bound for <hi>Virginia;</hi> but their Ship proved leaky, and Foundred in the Sea; so that they were forced suddenly to betake themselves to their Long-Boat; in the which they had a Capstone Bar, which they made use of for a Mast, and a piece of Canvas for a Sail, so did they Sail before the Wind. But they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Victuals with them, were soon in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable distress. Thus they continued five dayes, so that all despaired of Life. Upon the sixth day they concluded to cast Lots for their lives, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> who should die that the rest might eat him, and have their lives preserved. He that the Lot fell upon, begged for his Life a little longer; and being in their ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, the wonder-working Providence of God was seen: for they meet with this <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England</hi> Vessel, which took them in, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their lives. And hour after this a terrible Storm arose, continuing forty hours, so that if they had not met the Vessel that saved them in the nick of opportunity, they had all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished: and if the <hi>New-England</hi> Men had not taken down some of their Sails, or had
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000373_0039_0FA55AADB49C23C0"/>
not chanced to send one up to Tallow the Mast, this Boat and Men had never been seen by them. Thus admirable are the workings of divine providence in the World.</p>
               <p>Yet further;</p>
               <p>That Worthy and now blessed Minister of God Mr. <hi>James Janeway,</hi> hath published se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Remarkable Sea-Deliverances; of which some belonging to <hi>New-England.</hi> were the Subjects. He relates (and I am informed that it was really so) that a small Vessel (the Masters Name <hi>Philip Hung are</hi>) coming upon the Coast of <hi>New-England</hi> suddenly sprang a Leak, and so Foundered. In the Vessel there were eighteen Souls, twelve of which got into the Long Boat. They threw into the Boat some small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Provision, but were wholly without fire. These twelve Men sailed five hundred Leagues in this small Boat, being by almost miraculous Providences preserved therein for five weeks together. God sent relief to them by causing some flying Fish to fall into the Boat, which they eat raw, and were well pleased therewith. They also caught a Shar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and opening his belly, sucked his blood for drink. At the last the divine providence brought them to the <hi>West-Indies.</hi> Some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> them were so weak as that they soon died;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000373_0040_0FA55AAE824661D8"/>
but most of them lived to declare the Works of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Again he Relates that Mr. <hi>Jonas Clark</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> going for <hi>Virginia,</hi> the Vessel was cast ashoar in the night. They hoped to get their Ship off again; to which end the Master with some others going in the Boat, when they were about sixty Fathom from the Shoar, there arose a great Sea which broke in upon them, and at last turned the Boat over. Four Men were drowned. Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> was held under water till his Breath was gone, yet (through the good hand of a gracious God) he was set at liberty, and was enabled to swim to the shoar, where the providence of God did so over-rule the hearts of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> as that they did them no hurt, until at last they were brought safe unto the <hi>English Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> These things have (as was said) been related by Mr. <hi>Janeway.</hi> I proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to mention some other Sea-Deliverances. And that notable preservation deserves to be here Inserted and Recorded; Wherein Mr. <hi>John Grafton</hi> and some others of his Ships Company were concerned; who as they were bound in a Voyage from <hi>Salem</hi> in <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> for the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> in a Ketch called the <hi>Providence;</hi> (on <hi>September 16. 1669.</hi>)
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000373_0041_0FA55AB037DB4548"/>
their Vessel suddenly struck upon a Rock; at the which they were amazed, it being then a dark and rainy night; the force of the wind and Sea broke their Vessel in a moment. Their Company was ten Men in number, whereof six were drowned. The Master, and the Mate were left upon the Rock. As they sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> there, the Sea came up to their wasts. There did they embrace each other, looking for Death every moment; and if the Tide had risen higher it would have carried them off. By the same Rock was one of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, being much wounded and grievously groaning. In the Morning they saw an Island about half a mile off from them. The Rocks were so sharp and cragged that they could not tread upon them with their bare feet nor had they Shoes or Stockins. But they found a piece of Tarpoling, which they wrapped about their feet, making it fast with Rope-yarns; so getting each of them a stick, they sometimes went on their feet, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times crept, until at last they came to the Island, where they found another of their Company ashoar, being carried thither by a piece of the Vessel. Upon the Island they continued eight dayes, four of which they had no fire. Their Provision was salt Fish and Rain Water, which they found in the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000373_0042_0FA55AB0F30CCD48"/>
holes of the Rocks. After four dayes they found a piece of Touch-wood, which the Mate had formerly in his Chest, and a piece of Flint, with which having a small Knife they struck fire. A Barrel of Flower being cast on shoar they made Cakes thereof. Now their care was how to get off from the Island, there being no Inhabitants there. Finding a piece of the Main-sail, and some hoops of Cask they framed a Boat therewith. Yet had they no Tools to build it with. But pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence so ordered, that they found a Board twelve foot long, and Some Nails; also a Box was cast ashoar wherein was a Bolt-rope Needle; they likewise found a Tar-Barrel, wherewith they Tarred their Canvas. Thus did they patch up a Boat in fashion like a Birchen Canno; and meeting with some thin Boards of Sieling which came out of the Cabbin, they made Paddles therewith, so did they venture in this dangerous Vessel ten Leagues, until they came to <hi>Angu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lla,</hi> and St. <hi>Martins,</hi> where they were courteously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, the People admiring how they could come so many Leagues in such a strange kind of Boat. Besides all these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which have been declared, Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is brought to me concerning some Sea preservations which have hapned more lately.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:000373_0043_0FA55AB19C955E18"/>
There was a small Vessel set Sail from <hi>Bristol</hi> to <hi>New-England,</hi> Sept.22. 1681. The Masters Name <hi>William Dutten.</hi> There were seven Men in the Vessel, having on Board Provision for three Moneths, but by reason of contrary Winds, they were twenty Weeks before they could make any Land; and some unhappy Accidents fell out which occasioned their being put to miserable straits for victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, but most of all for Drink. The Winds were fair and prosperous until <hi>October</hi> 28. when they supposed themselves to be gotten 600 Leagues Westward. But after that the Norwest Winds blew so fiercely, that they were driven off from the Coast of <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> so that <hi>December</hi> 12. they concluded to bear away for <hi>Barbadoes.</hi> But before this, one of their Barrels of Beer had the head broken out, and the Liquor in it lost. They had but seven barrels of Water, three of which proved leaky, so that the Water in them was lost. When their Victuals failed, the Providence of God sent them a supply by causing <hi>Dolphins</hi> to come near to the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and that still as their wants were greatest, nor could they catch more than would serve their present turn. But still their misery upon them was great, through their want of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Sometimes they would expose their Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000373_0044_0FA55AB2FA1B2328"/>
to take the Rain-water, but oft when it Rained the Winds were so furious, that they could save little or no Rain, yet so it fell out that when they came near to the Latitude of <hi>Barmudas</hi> they saved two Barrels of Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Water, which caused no little joy amongst them. But the Rats did unexpectedly eat holes through the Barrels, so that their water was lost again. Once when a shower of Rain fell they could save but a pint, which though it was made bitter by the Tar, it seemed very sweet to them. They divided this pint of Rain-Water amongst seven, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thimble full at a time, which went five times about and was a great refreshing to them. On <hi>January</hi> 27. a good shower of Rain fell; that so they might be sure to save some Water, and not be again deprived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the Rats; they layed their Shirts open to the Rain, and wringing them dry, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained seven Gallons of Water, which they put into Bottles, and were for a time much refreshed thereby. But new straits come upon them. They endeavoured to catch the Rats in the Vessel, and could take but three or four, which they did eat, and it seemed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate meat to their hungry Souls. But the Torment of their Drought was insufferable. Sometimes for a Week together they had not
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000373_0045_0FA55AB3B220CF38"/>
one drop of fresh water. When they killed a <hi>Dolphin</hi> they would open his Belly and suck his blood a little to relieve their thirst. Yea, their thirst was so great that they fell to drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of salt-water. Some drank several Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, but they found that it did not allay their thirst. They greedily drank their own Urine when they could make any. They would go over-board with a Rope fastned to their bodies, and put themselves into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hoping to find some refreshment thereby. When any of them stood to steer the Vessel, he would think a little to refresh himself by having his feet in a pail of Sea-Water. In this misery some of the Sea-men confessed that it was just with God thus to afflict them, in that they had been guilty of wasting good drink, and of abusing themselves therewith before they came to Sea. The divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence so ordered, that on <hi>February 7,</hi> they met with a Vessel at Sea, which hapned to be a <hi>Guiny</hi> Man (<hi>Samuel Richard</hi> Master) their Boat was become leaky, that they could not go aboard, if it had been to save their lives. But the Master of the other Vessel under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing how it was with them, very courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously sent his own Boat to them, with ten pieces of <hi>Guiny</hi> Beef, two ankors of fresh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and four bushels of <hi>Guiny</hi> Corn, whereby
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000373_0046_0FA55AB550700DB8"/>
they were sustained until they arrived at <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes;</hi> being weak and spent with their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, but within a fortnight they were all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>Remarkable also, is the preservation of which some belonging to <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> had Experience; whom a <hi>New-England</hi> Vessel providentially met, in an open Boat, in the wide Sea, and saved them from perishing. Concerning which memorable Providence, I have received the following Narrative: A Ship of <hi>Dublin</hi> burdened about seventy Tuns <hi>Andrew Bennet</hi> Master, being bound from <hi>Dublin</hi> to <hi>Virginia;</hi> this Vessel having been some Weeks at Sea, onward of their Voyage, and being in the Latitude of 39. about 150 Leagues distant from Cape God in <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> on <hi>April 18. 1681.</hi> a day of very stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Weather, and a great Sea, suddenly there sprang a Plank in the fore part of the Ship, about six a Clock in the morning: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Water increased so fast in the Ship, that all their endeavours could not keep her from sinking above half an hour: so when the Ship was just sinking, some of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

resolved to lanch out the Boat, which was a small one. They did accordingly, and the Master, the Mate, the Boat-swain, the Cook, two Fore-mast-men and a Boy, kept such hold of it, when a Cast of the Sea sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly helped tem off with it, that they got into it. The heaving of the Sea now sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrust them from the Ship, in which there were left nineteen Souls, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> 16 Men and three Women; who all perished in the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Waters, while they were trying to make Rafters by cutting down the Masts, for the preservation of their lives, as long as might be. The seven in the Boat apprehended themselves to be in a condition little better then that of them in the Ship, having neither Sails nor Oars, neither Bread nor Water, and no Instrument of any sort, except a Knife and a piece of Deal-board, with which they made sticks, and set them up in the sides of the Boat, and covered them with some <hi>Irise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Cloth</hi> of their own Garments, to keep off the spray of the Sea, as much as could be by so poor a matter. In this condition they drave with an hard Wind and high Sea all that day, and the night following. But in the next morning about six a Clock, they saw a Ketch (the Master whereof was Mr. <hi>Edmund Hen, field</hi> of <hi>Salem</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi>) under Sail,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000373_0048_0FA55AB65FD133E0"/>
which Ketch coming right with them, too<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> them up and brought them safe to <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> And it is yet further remarkable, that when the Ship Foundred, the Ketch which saved these persons was many Leagues to the Westward of her, but was by a contrary Wind caused to stand back again to the East, ward where these distressed persons were (as hath been said) met with, and relieved.</p>
               <p>Another Remarkable Sea-Deliverance, like unto this last mentioned, hapned this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent year; the Relation whereof take as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. A Ship Called the <hi>Swallow, Thomas Welden</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Master; on their Voyage from St. <hi>Christophers</hi> towards <hi>London,</hi> did on <hi>March 23.</hi> last (being then about the Latitude of 42.) meet with a violent Storm. That Storm somewhat allayed, the Ship lying in the trough of the Sea, her Rudder broke away. Whereupon the Mariners veered out a Cable, and part of a Mast to steer by; but that not answering their expectation, they took an Hogs-head of Water, and fastned it to the Cable to steer the Ship; that also failing, they laid the Ship by: (as the Sea-mens phrase is) And on <hi>March</hi> 25. an exceeding great Storm arose, which made the Vessel ly down with her Hatches under Water, in which conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000373_0049_0FA55AB7C30D1120"/>
on the continued about two hours, and having much Water in the Hold, they found no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to make her rise again, but by cutting down her Masts, and accordingly her Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mast and her Mizen-mast being cut down, the Ship righted again. The Storm continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on <hi>March</hi> 28. the Ship made very bad Steeridge, by reason of the loss of her Rudder and Masts, The Sea had continual passage over her, and one Sea did then carry away the Larbord quarter of the Ship, and brake the side from the Deck, so that there was an open passage for the Sea to come in at that Breach; and notwithstanding their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to stop it with their Bedding, Cloathes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so much Water ran in by the sides of the Ship, that it was ready to sink. Now all hopes of saving their lives being gone; the Divine Providence so ordered, that there appeared a Vessel within sight, which hapned to be a <hi>French</hi> Ship bound from St. <hi>John de luce</hi> to Grand <hi>Placentia</hi> in <hi>New-found Land;</hi> this Vessel took in the distressed <hi>English-men,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them to Grand <hi>Placentia,</hi> from whence the Master and sundry of the Mariners pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured passage in a Ketch bound for <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi> There did they arrive <hi>June</hi> 21. 1683. declaring how they had seen the wonders of God in the deep, as hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>

There was another memorable Sea-Del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance like unto these two last. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons concerned in it being now gone out of the World, I have not met with any who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly remember the particular year wherein that remarkable Providence hapned; only that it was about twenty two years ago: when a Ship <hi>(William Laiton</hi> Master) bound from <hi>Pascataqua</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 250 Leagues off from the Coast, spran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a leak. They endeavoured what they could to clear her with their Pump for fourteen hours. But the Vessel filling with Water, they were forced (being eight persons) to be take themselves to their Boat, taking with them a good supply of Bread, and a pot of Butter. The Master declaring that he was perswaded they should meet with a Ship a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> little Water, so that their allowance was at last a spoonful in a Day to each man. In this Boat did they continue thus distressed for 19 dayes together. After they had been twelve dayes from the Vessel, they met with a Storm which did very much endanger their lives, yet God preserved them. At the end of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen dayes a flying Fish fell into their Boat, and having with them an Hook and Line, they made use of that Fish for Bait, whereby
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000373_0051_0FA55AB8F6E64A70"/>
they caught two Dolphins. A Ship then at Sea, whereof Mr. <hi>Samuel Scarlet</hi> was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, apprehending a Storm to be near, that so they might fit their Rigging in order to entertain the approaching Storm, suffered their Vessel to drive right before the Wind; and by that means they hapned to meet with this Boat full of distressed Sea-men. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam <hi>Scarlet's</hi> Vessel was then destitute of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision; only they had on board Water e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough and to spare. When the Mariners first saw the Boat, they desired the Master not to take the Men in, because they had no Bread nor other Victuals for them; so that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving eight more into their Company, they should all die with Famine. Captain <hi>Scarlet</hi> who as after he left using the Sea, he gave ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny demonstrations both living and dying of his designing the good of others, and not his own particular Advantage only, did at this time manifest the same Spirit to be in him; and therefore would by no means hearken to the selfish suggestions of his Men, but replied to them, (as yet not knowing who they were) It may be these distressed Creatures are our own Countrey-men, or if not, they are Men in misery, and therefore whatever come of it, I am resolved to take them in, and to trust in God who is able to deliver us all. Nor did
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000373_0052_0FA55AB9CCB41EF8"/>
God suffer him to lose any thing by this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Resolution. For as in Captain <hi>Scarlet's</hi> Ship there was Water which the Men in the Boat wanted, so they in the Boat had Bread and the two <hi>Dolphins</hi> lately caught, whereby all the Ships Company were refreshed. And within few dayes they all arrived safe in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England.</hi>

A multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Instances to this purpose are now lost in the Grave of Oblivion, because they were <hi>not Recorded</hi> in the season of them. But
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000373_0053_0FA55ABA848AE338"/>
such Observables as I have been by good hands acquainted with, I shall here further Relate.</p>
               <p>Remarkable was the Preservation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation which the gracious providence of God vouchsafed to <hi>Abigail Eliot,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Elder <hi>Eliot</hi> of <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New-England;</hi> concerning whom a near and precious Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hers, informs me, that when she was a Child about five years old, playing with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Children under a Cart an iron hinge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sharp at the lower end hapned to strike her head between the right Ear and the Crown of her Head, and pierced into the skull and Brain. The Child making an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry, the Mother came; and immediately drew out the Iron, and thereupon some of the Brains of her Child which stuck to the Iron, and other bits were scattered on her Forehead. Able Chyrurgeons were sent for; in special Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prat.</hi> The Head being uncovered, there appeared just upon the place where the Iron pierced the Skull, a bunch as big as a small Egg. A que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion arose, whether the skin should not be cut and dilated from the Orifice of the Wound to the Swelling, and so take it away. This Mr. <hi>Prat</hi> inclined unto, but Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, pleading that then the Air would get to the Brain, and the Child would presently
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000373_0054_0FA55ABB819B6850"/>
die. Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi> was desired to undertake the Cure. And thus was his operation. He gently drove the soft matter of the bunch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wound, and pressed so much out as well he could; there came forth about a spoonful, the matter which came forth was Brains and Blood (some curdles of Brain were white and not stained with Blood) so did he apply a Plaister. The Skull wasted where it was pierced to the bigness of an half Crown piece of Silver or more. The skin was exceeding tender, so that a Silver Plate like the skull was alwayes kept in the place to defend it from any touch or injury. The Brains of the Child did swell and swage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Tides. When it was Spring Tide, her Brain would heave up the tender skin, and fill the place sometimes. When it it was Nip Tide, they would be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the next place, we shall take notice of some Remarkable Preservations which sundry in <hi>Windsor</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> have experienced; the Persons concerned therein being desirous
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000373_0055_0FA55ABD05541ED8"/>
that the Lords goodness towards them may be ever had in Remembrance: wherefore a faithful hand has given me the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. <hi>January</hi> 13. 1670, Three Women, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> the Wives of Lieut. <hi>Filer,</hi> and of <hi>John Drake,</hi> and of <hi>Nathaniel Lomas,</hi> having cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Connecticut</hi> River upon a necessary and neighbourly account, and having done the work they went for, were desirous to return to their own Families; the River being at that time partly shut up with Ice old and new, and partly open. There being some pains taken aforehand to cut a way through the Ice, the three Women abovesaid got into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Canoo, with whom also there was <hi>Nathaniel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bissel,</hi> and an <hi>Indian.</hi> There was likewise another Canoo with two men in it, that went before them to help them in case they should meet with any distress, which indeed quickly came upon them; for just as they were get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the narrow passage between the Ice, being near the middle of the River, a great part of the upper Ice came down upon them, and struck the end of their Canoo, and broke it to pieces; so that it quickly sunk under them: the <hi>Indian</hi> speedily got upon the Ice, but <hi>Nathaniel Bissel,</hi> and the abovesaid Women were left floating in the Middle of the River, being cut off from all manner of 
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000373_0056_0FA55ABD708F9848"/>
humane help besides what did arise from themselves, and the two men in the little Canoo, which was so small that three persons durst seldom, if ever, venture in it, they were indeed discerned from one shore, but the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Ice would not admit from either shore, one to come near them. All things thus circumstanced, the suddenness of the stroke and distress (which is apt to amaze men, especially when no less then life is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned) the extream coldness of the weather, it being a sharp season, that persons out of the water were in danger of freezing, the unapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the persons to help themselves, being mostly Women, one big with Child, and near the time of her Travel (who was also carried away under the Ice) the other as unskill'd and unactive to do any thing for self-preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as almost any could be, the Waters deep, that there was no hope of footing, no passage to either shore, in any eye of reason, neither with their little Canoo, by reason of the Ice, nor without it, the Ice being thin and rotten, and full of holes. Now, that all should be brought off safely without the loss of life, or wrong to health, was counted in the day of it a <hi>Remarkable Providence.</hi> To say, how it was done, is difficult, yet something of the manner of the Deliverance may be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000373_0057_0FA55ABF8ED1CED8"/>
the abovesaid <hi>Nathaniel Bissel</hi> perceiving their danger, and being active in swimming, endeavoured what might be, the preservation of himself, and some others, he strove to have swum to the upper Ice, but the Stream being too hard, he was forced downwards to the lower Ice, where by reason of the slippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness of the Ice, and disadvantage of the Stream, he found it difficult getting up; at length by the good hand of providence, being gotten upon the Ice, he saw one of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men swimming down under the Ice, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving an hole, or open place, some few Rods below, there he waited, and took her up as she swum along. The other two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were in the River, till the two Men in the little Canoo came for their relief; at length all of them got their heads above the Water, and had a little time to pause, though a long, and difficult, and dangerous way to any shore, but by getting their little Canoo upon the Ice, and carrying one at a time o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hazardous Places, they did (though in a long while) get all safe to the shore, from whence they came.</p>
               <p>Remarkable also, was the Deliverance which <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Thomas Bissel</hi> of <hi>Windsor</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, did at another time receive. <hi>John
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000373_0058_0FA55AC0EF55C470"/>
Bissel</hi> on a Morning about break of day ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Nails out of a great Barrel wherein was a considerable quantity of Gun-Powder, and Bullets, having a Candle in his hand, the Powder took fire, <hi>Thomas Bissel</hi> was then put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on his clothes, standing by a Window, which though well fastened, was by the force of the Powder carried away at least four Rods; the Partition-wall from another Room was broken in pieces; The roof of the House opened and slipt of the Plates about five foot down; also the great Girt of the House at one end broke out so far, that it drew from the Summer to the end, most of its Tenant: the Woman of the House was ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sick, and another Woman under it in bed, yet did the divine Providence so order things as that no one received any hurt, excepting <hi>John Bissel,</hi> who fell through two Floors into a Cellar his shoes being taken from his feet, and found at twenty foot distance, his hands and his face very much scorched, without any other wound in his body.</p>
               <p>It would fill a Volume to give an account of all the memorable Preservations in the time of the late War with the <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Remarkable was that which hapned to <hi>Jabes Musgrove</hi> of <hi>Newbery,</hi> who being shot
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000373_0059_0FA55AC21D17D870"/>
by an <hi>Indian,</hi> the Bullet entred in at his Ear and went out at his Eye, on the other side of his Head, yet the Man was preserved from Death, yea, and is still in the Land of the living.</p>
               <p>Likewise several of those that were taken Captive by the <hi>Indians</hi> are able to relate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Stories concerning the gracious Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, in carrying them through many Dangers and Deaths, and at last setting their feet in a large place again. A Worthy Person hath sent me the Account which one lately belonging to <hi>Deerfield,</hi> (his name is <hi>Quintin Stockwell,</hi>) hath drawn up re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting his own Captivity and Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the more notable Occurrences of Divine Providence attending him in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress, which I shall therefore here insert in the Words by himself expressed: He Relateth asfollowes;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the year 1677. <hi>September</hi> 19. between Sun-set and dark, the <hi>Indians</hi> came upon us; I and another Man, being together, we ran away at the out-cry the <hi>Indians</hi> made, shout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and shooting at some other of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> that were hard by. We took a <hi>Swamp</hi> that was at hand for our refuge, the Enemy espying us so near them, ran after us, and shot many Guns at us, three Guns were
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000373_0060_0FA55AC2E3EB6B58"/>
discharged upon me, the Enemy being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three Rod of me, besides many other, before that. Being in this Swamp that was miry, I slumpt in, and fell down, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon one of the Enemy stept to me, with his Hatchet lift up to knock me on the head, supposing that I had been wounded, and so unfit for any other travel. I (as it hapned) had a Pistol by me, which though unchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, I presented to the <hi>Indian,</hi> who present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stept back; and told me, if I would yield, I should have no hurt, he said (which was not true) that they had destroyed all <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> and that the Woods were full of <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     </hi>ans, whereupon I yielded my self, and so fell into the Enemies hands, and by three of them was led away unto the place, whence first I began to make my flight, where two other <hi>Indians</hi> came running to us, and the one lifting up the Butt end of his Gun, to knock me on the head, the other with his hand put by the blow, and said, I was his Friend. I was now by my own House which the <hi>Indians</hi> burnt the last year, and I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to build up again, and there I had some hopes to escape from them; there was an Horse just by, which they bid me take, I did so, but made no attempt to escape there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, because the Enemy was near, and the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000373_0061_0FA55AC378FFCFE8"/>
Beast was slow and dull, then was I in hopes they would send me to take my own Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which they did, but they were so frighted that I could not come near to them, and so fell still into the Enemies hands, who now took me, and bound me, and led me away, and soon was I brought into the Company, of Captives, that were that day brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from <hi>Hatfield,</hi> which were about a mile off; and here methoughts was matter of joy and sorrow both, to see the Company: some Company in this condition being some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing, though little help any wayes; then were we pinioned and led away in the night over the Mountains, in dark and hideous wayes, about four miles further, before we took up our place for rest, which was in a dismal place of Wood on the East side of the Mountain. We were kept bound all that night. The <hi>Indians</hi> kept waking and we had little mind to sleep in this nights travel, the <hi>Indians</hi> dispersed, and as they went made strange, noises, as of Wolves and Owles, and other Wild Beasts, to the end that they might not lose one another; and if followed they might not be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>English.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>About the break of Day, we Marched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and got over the great River at <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptuck</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="unknown:000373_0062_0FA55AC4344A5658"/>
River mouth, and there rested a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hours. There the <hi>Indians</hi> marked out upon Trays the number of their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Slain as their manner is. Here was I again in great danger; A quarrel arose about me, whose Captive I was, for three took me. I thought I must be killed to end the controversie, so when they put it to me, whose I was, I said three <hi>Indians</hi> took me, so they agreed to have all a share in me: and I had now three Masters, and he was my chief Master who laid hands on me first, and thus was I fallen into the hands of the very worst of all the Company; as <hi>Ashpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> Captain told me; which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain was all along very kind to me, and a great comfort to the <hi>English.</hi> In this place they gave us some Victuals, which they had brought from the <hi>English.</hi> This morning also they sent ten Men forth to Town to bring away what they could find, some Provision, some Corn out of the Meadow they brought to us upon Horses which they had there taken. From hence we went up about the Falls, where we crost that River again; and whilst I was going, I fell right down lame of my old Wounds that I had in the War, and whilest I was thinking I should therefore be killed by the <hi>Indians,</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="unknown:000373_0063_0FA55AC4F5E1DE78"/>
and what Death I should die, my pain was suddenly gone, and I was much encouraged again. We had about eleven Horses in that Company, which the <hi>Indians</hi> made to carry Burthens, and to carry Women. It was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon when we now crossed that River. We travelled up that River till night, and then took up our Lodging in a dismal place, and were staked down and spread out on our backs; and so we lay all night, yea so we lay many nights. They told me their Law was, that we should lie so nine nights, and by that time, it was thought we should be out of our knowledge. The manner of staking down was thus; our Arms and Legs stretched out were staked fast down, and a Cord about our necks, so that we could stir no wayes. The first night of staking down, being much tired, I slept as comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably as ever; the next day we went up the River, and crossed it, and at night lay in <hi>Squakheag Meadows;</hi> our Provision was soon spent; and while we lay in those <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> went an Hunting, and the <hi>English Army</hi> came out after us: then the <hi>Indians</hi> moved again, dividing themselves and the Captives into many Companies, that the <hi>English</hi> might not follow their tract. At night having crossed the River, we met
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:000373_0064_0FA55AC5B08E34D0"/>
again at the place appointed. The next day we crost the River again on <hi>Squakheag</hi> side, and there we took up our quarters for a long time, I suppose this might be about thirty miles above <hi>Squakheag,</hi> and here were the <hi>Indians</hi> quite out of all fear of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish;</hi> but in great fear of the <hi>Mohawks;</hi> here they built a long <hi>Wigwam.</hi> Here they had a great Dance (as they call it) and concluded to burn three of us, and had got Bark to do it with, and as I understood afterwards, I was one that was to be burnt. Sergeant <hi>Plimpton</hi> an other, and <hi>Benjamin Wait</hi> his Wife the third: though I knew not which was to be burnt, yet I perceived some were designed thereunto, so much I understood of their Language: that night I could not sleep for fear of next dayes work, the <hi>Indians</hi> being weary with that Dance, lay down to sleep, and slept soundly. The <hi>English</hi> were all loose, then I went out and brought in Wood, and mended the fire, and made a noise on purpose, but none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked, I thought if any of the <hi>English</hi> would wake, we might kill them all sleeping, I removed out of the way all the Guns and Hatchets: but my heart failing me, I put all things where they were again. The next day when we were to be burnt, our
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:000373_0065_0FA55AC8E1B28E70"/>
Master and some others spake for us, and the Evil was prevented in this place: And hereabouts we lay three Weeks together. Here I had a Shirt brought to me, to make, and one <hi>Indian</hi> said it should be made this way, a second another way, a third his way. I told them I would make it that way that my chief Master said; Whereupon one <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> struck me on the face with his Fist. I suddenly rose up in anger ready to strike again, upon this hapned a great Hubbub, and the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>English</hi> came about me; I was fain to humble my self to my Master, so that matter was put up. Before I came to this place, my three Masters were gone a hunting, I was left with an other <hi>Indian,</hi> all the Company being upon a March, I was left with this <hi>Indian,</hi> who fell sick, so that I was fain to carry his Gun and Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet, and had opportunity, and had thought to have dispatched him, and run away; but did not, for that the <hi>English</hi> Captives had promised the contrary to one another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if one should run away, that would provoke the <hi>Indians,</hi> and indanger the rest that could not run away. Whilest we were here, <hi>Benjamin Stebbins</hi> going with some <hi>Indians</hi> to <hi>Wachuset, Hills,</hi> made his
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:000373_0066_0FA55ACB892DDE68"/>
escape from them, and when the news of his escape came; we were all presently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in and Bound; one of the <hi>Indians</hi> a Captain among them, and alwayes our great Friend, met me coming in, and told me <hi>Stebbins</hi> was run away; and the <hi>Indians</hi> spake of burning us; some of only burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and biting off our Fingers by and by. He said there would be a Court, and all would speak their minds, but he would speak last, and would say, that the <hi>Indian</hi> that let <hi>Stebbins</hi> run away was only in fault, and so no hurt should be done us, fear not: so it proved accordingly. Whilest we lingered hereabout, Provision grew scarce, one Bears Foot must serve five of us a whole day; we began to eat Horse-flesh, and eat up seven in all: three were left alive and were not killed. Whilest we had been here, some of the <hi>Indians</hi> had been down and fallen upon <hi>Hadley,</hi> and were taken by the <hi>English,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with, and let go again; and were to meet the <hi>English</hi> upon such a Plain, there to make further Terms. <hi>Ashpalon</hi> was much for it, but <hi>Wachuset</hi> Sachims when they came were much against it: and were for this, that we should meet the <hi>English</hi> indeed, but there fall upon them and fight them, and take them. Then <hi>Ashpalon</hi> spake to us <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="unknown:000373_0067_0FA55ACD2EC8EDC0"/>
not to speak a word more to further that matter, for mischief would come of it. When those <hi>Indians</hi> came from <hi>Wachuset,</hi> there came with them <hi>Squaws,</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> about four-score, who reported that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> had taken <hi>Uncas,</hi> and all his Men, and sent them beyond Seas, they were much en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We came at length to a place called <hi>Squaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Maug River,</hi> there we hoped for <hi>Sammon,</hi> but we came too late. This place I account to be above two hundred Miles above <hi>Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field:</hi> then we parted into two Companies; some went one way and some went ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; and we went over a mighty Mountain, we were eight dayes a going over it, and travelled very hard, and every day we had either Snow or Rain: We noted that on this Mountain all the Water run <hi>Northward.</hi> Here also we wanted Provision; but at length met again on the other side of the Mountain, <abbr>

off the Lake, we stayed here a great while to make Canoos to go over the Lake; here I was frozen, &amp; here again we were like to starve: All the <hi>Indians</hi> went a Hunting but could get nothing: divers dayes they <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wow'd</hi> but got nothing, then they desired the <hi>English</hi> to Pray, and confessed they could do nothing; they would have us Pray, and see what the <hi>English-man's God</hi> could do. I Prayed, so did Serjeant <hi>Plimpton,</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. The <hi>Indians</hi> reverently attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Morning and Night; next day they got Bears: then they would needs have us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire a Blessing, return Thanks at Meals: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while they grew weary of it, and the <hi>Sachim</hi> did forbid us: When I was frozen they were very cruel towards me, because I could not do as at other times. When we came to the Lake we were again sadly put to it for Provision; we were fain to eat Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood fryed in Bears Greace, at last we found a company of <hi>Raccoons,</hi> and then we made a Feast; and the manner was, that we must eat all. I perceived there would be too much for one time, so one <hi>Indian</hi> that sat next to me, bid me slip away some to him under his Coat, and he would hide it for me till another time; this <hi>Indian</hi> as soon as he had got my Meat, stood up and

made a Speech to the rest, and discovered me, so that the <hi>Indians</hi> were very angry, and cut me another piece, and gave me <hi>Raccoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I told them I had enough; so that ever after that they would give me none; but still tell me, I had <hi>Raccoon</hi> enough: so I suffered much, and being frozen was full of Pain, and could sleep but a little, yet must do my work. When they went upon the Lake, and as they came to the Lake, they light of a <hi>Moose</hi> and killed it, and staid there till they had eaten it all up; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon the Lake there arose a great Storm, we thought we should all be case a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but at last we got to an Island, and there they went to <hi>Powawing.</hi> The <hi>Powaw</hi> said that <hi>Benjamin Wait,</hi> and another Man, was coming, and that Storm was raised to cast them away: This afterward appeared to be true though then I believed them not. Upon this Island we lay still several dayes, and then set out again, but a Storm took us, so that we lay to and fro upon certain Islands about three Weeks: we had no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision but <hi>Raccoons,</hi> so that the <hi>Indians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves thought they should be starved. They gave me nothing, so that I was sundry dayes without any Provision: We went on upon

four or five miles before they overtook us: I was then pretty well spent; <hi>Samuel Russel</hi> was (he said) faint, and wondred how I could live, for he had (he said) ten meals to my one: then I was laid on the Sled, and they ran away with me on the Ice, the rest and <hi>Samuel Russel</hi> came softly after. <hi>Samuel Russel</hi> I never saw more, nor know what became of him: they got but half way, and we got through to <hi>Shamblee</hi> about midnight.

gave me a Dram of Brandey, and a little hasty pudding and Milk; when I tasted Victuals I was hungry, and could not have forborn it, but that I could not get it; now and then they would give me a little as they thought best for me; I lay by the fire with the <hi>Indians</hi> that night, but could not sleep for pain: next morning the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>French</hi> fell out about me, because the <hi>French</hi> as the <hi>Indian</hi> said, loved the <hi>English</hi> better than the <hi>Indians.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> presently turned the <hi>Indians</hi> out of doors, and kept me, they were very kind and careful, and gave me a little something now and then; while I was here all the Men in that Town came to see me: At this House I was three or four dayes, and then invited to another, and after that to another; at this place I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirteen dayes, and received much ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility from a young man, a Batchelour, who invited me to his House, with whom I was for the most part, he was so kind as to lodge me in the Bed with himself, he gave me a Shirt, and would have bought me, but could not, for the <hi>Indians</hi> asked a hundred pounds for me.

<pb n="55" facs="unknown:000373_0075_0FA55AD6B6E227D8"/>
I knew not what he said, and went his way. By and by came the Captain of the place into the <hi>Wigwam</hi> with about twelve armed Men, and asked where the <hi>Indian</hi> was that struck the <hi>English-man,</hi> and took him and told him he should go to the Bilboes, and then be hanged: the <hi>Indians</hi> were much te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified at this, as appeared by their Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Trembling.

me more, and every day bring me to his House to eat Victuals. I perceived that the common People did not like what the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> had done and did to the <hi>English.</hi> When the <hi>Indian</hi> was set free, he came to me, and took me about the middle, and said I was his Brother, I had saved his life once, and he had saved mine (he said) thrice. Then he called for Brandy and made me drink, and had me away to the <hi>Wigwams</hi> again, When I came there, the <hi>Indians</hi> came to me one by one, to shake hands with me, saying <hi>Wurregen Netop;</hi> and were very kind, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other, but that I had saved the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Life.

me, and strove to keep me chearly: for I was sometimes ready to faint: Often times they gave me a little Brandy. The next day the Chirurgion came again, and dressed me; and so he did all the while I was among the <hi>French. I</hi> came in at <hi>Christmass,</hi> and went thence <hi>May 2d.</hi> Being thus in the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's house, <hi>I</hi> was kept there till <hi>Ben.

               <p>Thus far is this poor Captives Relation concerning the changes of Providence which passed over him.</p>
               <p>There is one Remarkable passage more, affirmed by him: For he saith, that in their Travails they came to a place where was a great <hi>Wigwam</hi> (i.e. <hi>Indian House</hi>) at both ends was an <hi>Image;</hi> here the <hi>Indians</hi> in the War time were wont to <hi>Powaw</hi> (i.e. invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Devil) and so did they come down to <hi>Hatfield,</hi> one of the <hi>Images</hi> told them they should destroy a Town; the other said no,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:000373_0078_0FA55ADAEBDCBE98"/>
half a Town. This god (said that <hi>Indian</hi>) speaks true, the other was not good, he told them lies. No doubt but others are capable of declaring many passages of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence no less worthy to be Recorded than these last recited; but inasmuch as they have not been brought to my hands, <hi>I</hi> proceed to another Relation.</p>
               <p>Very Memorable was the Providence of God towards Mr. <hi>Ephraim How</hi> of <hi>New-Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> who was for an whole twelve Moneth given up by his Friends as a dead Man, but God preserved him alive in a desolate <hi>Island</hi> where he had suffered Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, and at last returned him home to his Family.</p>
               <p>The History of this Providence might have been mentioned amongst <hi>Sea-Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,</hi> yet considering it was not only so, <hi>I</hi> shall here <hi>Record</hi> what himself (being a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man) did relate of the Lords marvelous dispensations towards him, that so others might be incouraged to put their trust in God, in the times of their greatest straits and difficulties.</p>
               <p>On the 25. of <hi>August,</hi> in the year 1676. the said Skipper <hi>How</hi> with his two eldest Sons set sail from <hi>New-Haven</hi> for <hi>Boston</hi> in a small
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:000373_0079_0FA55ADBB8C3D858"/>
Ketch, Burden 17 Tun or thereabout: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Dispatch of their Business there, they set Sail from thence for <hi>New-Haven</hi> again, on the 10th of <hi>September</hi> following: but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Winds forced them back to <hi>Boston,</hi> where the said <hi>How</hi> was taken ill with a violent flux, which Distemper continued near a Moneth, many being at that time sick of the same Disease, which proved mortal to some. The merciful Providence of God having spared his life, and restored him to some measure of health; he again set Sail from <hi>Boston,</hi> Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 10. By a fair Wind they went forward so as to make <hi>Cape Cod;</hi> but suddenly the Weather became very Tempestuous, so as that they could not seize the <hi>Cape,</hi> but were forced off to Sea; where they were endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in a small Vessel by very fearful Storms and outragious Winds and Seas. Also, his Eldest Son fell sick and died in about eleven dayes after they set out to Sea. He was no sooner dead, but his other Son fell sick and died too. This was a bitter Cup to the good Father. It is noted in <hi>I Chron.7.22.</hi> that when the Sons of <hi>Ephraim</hi> were dead, <hi>Ephraim their Father mourned many dayes, and his Brethren came to comfort him.</hi> This <hi>Ephraim</hi> when his Sons were Dead his Friends on Shore knew it not, nor could they come to comfort him.

But when his Friends and Relations could not, the Lord himself did: for they died af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so sweet, gracious and comfortable a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that their Father professed he had joy in parting with them.

                  <hi>Jones</hi> (Son to Mr. <hi>William Jones</hi> one of the Worthy Magistrates in <hi>New-Haven</hi>) fell sick and died also, leaving the World with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable manifestations of true Repentance towards God, and Faith in Jesus Christ. Thus the one half of their Company was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, none remaining but the Skipper him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, one Mr. <hi>Augur,</hi> and a Boy. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was still sickly, and in a very weak estate, yet was fain to stand at the Helm 36 hours, and 24 hours at a time; in the mean time the boisterous Sea overwhelming the Vessel, so as that if he had not been lasht fast, he had certainly been washed over-board. In this Extremity, he was at a loss in his own thoughts, whether they should persist in stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the <hi>New-England</hi> Shore, or bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for the Southern Islands. He proposed that Question to Mr. <hi>Augur,</hi> they resolved that they would first seek to God by Prayer
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:000373_0081_0FA55ADDC0F70A30"/>
about it, and then put this difficult case to an issue, by casting a Lot. So they did; and the Lot fell on <hi>New-England. By</hi> that time a Moneth was expired, they lost the Rudder of their Vessel, so that now they had nothing but God alone to reply upon. In this deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable state were they for a fortnight. The <hi>Skipper</hi> (though infirm (as has been expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) yet for six weeks together, was hardly ever day; nor had they the benefit of warm Food for more then thrice or thereabouts. At the end of six weeks, in the Morning betimes, the Vessel was driven on the Tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a ledge of Rocks, where the Sea broke violently; looking out they espied a dismal Rocky Island to the Leeward, upon which if the Providence of God had not by the Breakers given them timely warning, they had been dashed in pieces. And this extremity was the Lords opportunity to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for their deliverance; they immediately let go an Anchor, and get out the Boat; and God made the Sea calm. The Boat proved leaky; and being in the midst of fears and amazements they took little out of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel. After they came ashoar they found themselves in a rocky desolate Island (near <hi>Cape Sables</hi>) where was neither Man nor Beast to be seen, so that now they were in
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:000373_0082_0FA55ADE9487F758"/>
extream danger of being starved to Death. But a Storm arose which beat violently upon the Vessel at Anchor, so as that it was staved in pieces; and a Cask of Powder was brought ashore, (receiving no damage by its being washed in the Water) also a Barrel of Wine; and half a Barrel of Molosses, together with many things useful for a Tent to preserve them from cold. This notwithstanding, new and great distresses attended them. For though they had Powder and Shot, there were seldom any Fowls to be seen in that Dismal and Desolate place, excepting a few <hi>Crows, Raven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> and <hi>Gulls.</hi> These were so few as that for the most part, the <hi>Skipper</hi> shot at one at a time. Many times half of one of these Fowls with the Liquor made a Meal for three. Once they lived five dayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Sustenance, at which time they did not feel themselves pincht with hunger as at other times; the Lord in mercy taking away their appetites, when their Food did utterly fail them. After they had been about twelve Weeks in this miserable Island, Mr. <hi>Hows</hi> dear Friend and Consort Mr, <hi>Augur</hi> Died; so that he had no living creature but the Lad before mentioned to converse with: And on <hi>April</hi> 2. 1677. that Lad Died also, so that the Master was now left alone upon the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:000373_0083_0FA55ADF441D5070"/>
Island, and continued so to be above a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a year, not having any living Soul to converse with. In this time he saw several Fishing Vessels Sailing by, and some came nearer the Island than that which at last took him in; but though he used what means he could that they might be acquainted with his Distress, none came to him, being afraid: for they supposed him to be one of those <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> who were then in Hostility against the <hi>English.</hi> The good Man whilest he was in his Desolate Estate, kept many dayes of Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Prayer, wherein he did confess and bewail his Sins, the least of which deserved greater Evils than any in this World ever were on can be subject unto; and begged of God that he would find out a way for his Deliverance. At last it came into his mind, that he ought very solemnly to praise God (as well as pray unto him) for the great mercies and signal preservations which he had thus far experienced. Accordingly he set apart a day for that end, spending the time in giving thanks to God for all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his Life, so far as he could call them to mind, and in special for those Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which had been mingled with his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; humbly blessing God for his
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:000373_0084_0FA55ADFFA45CD08"/>
wonderful goodness in preserving him alive by a Miracle of Mercy. Immediately after this, a Vessel belonging to <hi>Salem</hi> in <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> providentially passing by that Island, sent their Boat on shore, and took in <hi>Skipper How,</hi> who arrived at <hi>Salem,</hi> July 18. 1677. and was at last returned to his Family in <hi>New-Haven.</hi>

               <p>The Story is in brief as followeth:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>I</hi>n the Year 1616. A <hi>Fleming</hi> whose name was <hi>Pickman,</hi> coming from <hi>Norway</hi> in a Vessel loaden with Boards, was overtaken by a Calm, during which the Current car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him upon a Rock or little Island towards the extremities of <hi>Scotland</hi> To avoid a Wreck he commanded some of his Men to go into the Shallop, and to
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:000373_0085_0FA55AE34344AB80"/>
Tow the Ship. They having done so, would needs go up into a certain Rock to look for Birds Eggs: But as soon as they were got up into it, they at some distance perceived a Man, whence they imagined that there were others lurking thereabouts, and that this man had made his escape thither from some Pyrates, who, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, might surprize their Ship: and therefore they made all the hast they could to their Shallop, and so returned to their Ship. But the Calm continuing, and the Current of the Sea still driving them upon the Island, they were forced to get into the Long-boat, and to Tow her off again. The Man whom they had seen before-was in the mean time come to the brink of the Island, and made signs with his hands lifted up, and sometimes falling on his knees, and joyning his hands together, begging and crying to them for relief. At first they made some difficulty to get to him, but at last, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome by his lamentable signs, they went nearer the Island, where they saw something that was more like a Ghost than a living Person; a Body stark naked, black and hairy, a meagre and deformed Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, with hollow and distorted eyes; which raised such compassion in them, that
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:000373_0086_0FA55AE5E9C158A8"/>
they essayed to take him into the Boat: but the Rock was so steepy thereabouts, that it was impossible for them to land: whereupon they went about the Island, and came at last to a flat shore, where they took the Man abroad. They found nothing at all in the Island, neither Grass nor Tree, nor ought else from which a man could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure any subsistence, nor any shelter, but the ruins of a Boat, wherewith he had made a kind of a Hutt, under which he might lie down and shelter himself, against the injuries of Wind and Weather. No sooner were they gotten to the Ship, but there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose a Wind, that drave them off from the Island: observing this Providence, they were the more inquisitive to know of this Man, what he was, and by what means he came unto that uninhabitable place?</q>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> who being immediately forced by a Tempest, which presently arose, to let our Boat go; we were three of us in it, left to the mercy of the Wind and Waves, which carried us between <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="unknown:000373_0087_0FA55AE5FB178C58"/>
into the main Sea: In the mean time we had neither Food nor Drink, but only some Sugar in the Boat; upon this we li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and drank our own Urine, till our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were so dried up, that we could make no more: whereupon one of our Company being quite spent, died; whom we heaved overboard: and a while after a second was grown so feeble, that he had laid himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in the Boat, ready to give up the Ghost: But in this extremity it pleased God that I kenned this Island afar off, and thereupon encouraged the dying man to rouse up himself, with hopes of life: and accordingly, upon this good news, he raised himself up, and by and by our Boat was cast upon this Island, and split against a Rock.</p>
                  <p>Now we were in a more wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than if we had been swallowed up by the Sea, for then we had been delivered out of the Extremities we were now in for want of Meat and Drink; yet the Lord was pleased to make some provision for us: for on the Island we took some <hi>Sea-mews,</hi> which we did eat raw: We found also in the holes of the Rocks, upon the Sea-side, some Eggs; and thus had we through Gods good Providence wherewithal to subsist, as much as would keep as from starving: but
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:000373_0088_0FA55AE7B7F6A130"/>
what we thought most unsupportable, was thirst, in regard that the place afforded no fresh Water but what fell from the Clouds, and was left in certain Pits, which time had made in the Rock. Neither could we have this at all seasons, by reason that the Rock being small, and lying low, in stormy Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Waves dashed over it, and filled the Pits with Salt Water.</p>
                  <p>When they came first upon the Island a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the midst of it, they found two long Stones pitched in the Ground, and a third laid upon them, like a Table; which they judged to have been so placed by some Fishermen to dry their Fish upon; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this they lay in the nights, till with some Boards of their Boat, they made a kind of an Hutt to be a shelter for them. In this condition they lived together, for the space of about six Weeks, comforting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and finding some ease in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamity: till at last one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left alone, the burden became almost insupportable: For one day, awaking in the Morning he missed his Fellow, and getting up, he went calling and seeking all the island about for him, but when he could by no means find him, he fell into such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, that he often resolved to have cast,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:000373_0089_0FA55AE846FDB7F8"/>
himself down into the Sea, and so to put a final Period to that affliction, whereof he had endured but the one half, whilst he had a Friend that divided it with him. What became of his Comrade he could not guess, whether despair forced him to that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or whether getting up in the night, not fully awake, he fell from the Rock, as he was looking for Birds Eggs: for he had discovered no distraction in him, neither could imagine that he could on a sudden fall into that despair, against which he had so fortified himself by frequent and fervent Prayer. And his loss did so affect the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viver, that he often took his beer, with a purpose to have leaped from the Rocks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, yet still his Conscience stopped him, suggesting to him, that if he did it, he would be utterly damned for his self-Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Another Affliction also befel him, which was this; his only Knife wherewith he cut up the <hi>Sea-Dogs</hi> and <hi>Sea-Mews,</hi> having a bloody cloth about it, was carried away (as he thought) by some fowl of Prey; so that, not being able to kill any more, he was reduced to this extremity, with much difficulty to get out of the Boards of his Hutt, a great Nail, which he made shift so
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:000373_0090_0FA55AE914E9AB10"/>
to sharpen upon the Stones, that it served him instead of a <hi>K</hi>nife. When Winter came on, he endured the greatest misery imaginable: for many times the Rock and his Hutt were so covered with Snow, that it was not possible for him to go abroad to provide his Food; which extremity put him upon this Invention: he put out a little stick at the crevice of his Hutt, and bait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with a little <hi>Sea-Dogs</hi> fat, by that means he got some <hi>Sea-Mews,</hi> which he took with his hand from under the Snow, and so kept himself from starving. In this sad and solitary condition, he lived for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eleven Moneths, expecting therein to end his dayes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I have seen a Manuscript, wherein many memorable Passages of Divine Providence are Recorded. And this which I shall now mention amongst others.</p>
               <p>About the Year 1638. A Ship fell foul upon the Rocks and Sands, called the <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadories,</hi> sixty Leagues distant from the <hi>Isle of Providence.</hi> Ten of the floating Passengers got to a spot of Land, where having breathed awhile, and expecting to perish by Famine, eight of them chose rather to commit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the mercy of the waters; two only stood upon the spot of Land, one whereof soon died, and was in the Sands buried by his now desolate Companion. This solitary Person in the midst of the roaring Waters was encompassed with the goodness of Divine Providence. Within three dayes God was pleased to send this single person (who now alone, was Lord and Subject in this his little Common-wealth) good store of Fowl, and to render them so same, that the forlorn man could pick and chuse where he list. Fish also were now and then cast up within his reach, and somewhat that served for Fewel, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

them, which being come within view of, they used means to fetch him off the Said-spot of Sand, and brought him to the <hi>Isle of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> The Man having in so long a time conversed only with Heaven, lookt at first very strangely, and was not able at first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference promptly to speak and answer.</p>

And there are many who have in this respect been as Brands plucked out of the burning, when the Lord hath overthrown others as God overthrew <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> Such solemn works of Providence ought not to be forgotten. I shall now therefore proceed in giving an account of <hi>Remarkables</hi> respecting Thunder and Lightning, so far as I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived credible Information concerning them; The Particulars whereof are these which follow:</p>
               <p>In <hi>July</hi> 1654. A Man whose Name was <hi>Partridge</hi> (esteemed a very godly person) at <hi>Salisbury</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> was killed with Thunder and Lightning, his House being first set on fire thereby, and himself with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers endeavouring the quenching of it, by a second crack of Thunder with Lightning (he being at the door of his House) was struck dead, and never spake more. There were ten other persons also that were struck and lay for dead at the present, but they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, excepting <hi>Partridge.</hi> Some that view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, report that there were holes (like such as are made with shot) found in his Clothes, and Skin. One side of his Shirt and Body was scorched, and not the other. His House, though (as was said) set on fire by
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:000373_0094_0FA55AECA7BF5E88"/>
the Lightning in divers places, was not burnt down, but preserved by an abundance of Rain falling upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 31. 1658. There hapned a Storm of Thunder and Lightning with Rain, in the Town of <hi>Marshfield</hi> in <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony in <hi>New-England:</hi> Mr. <hi>Nathaneel Thomas, John Philips,</hi> and another belonging to that Town, being in the Field, as they perceived the Storm a coming, betook themselves to the next House for Shelter: <hi>John Philips</hi> sat down near the Chimney, his Face towards the inner Door. A black Cloud flying very low, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of it there came a great Ball of Fire, with a terrible crack of Thunder; the Fire-ball fell down just before the said <hi>Philips,</hi> he seemed to give a start on his Seat, and so fell back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, being struck dead, not the least moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life appearing in him afterwards. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Thomas</hi> who sat directly opposite to <hi>John Philips,</hi> about six foot distance from him, and a young Child that was then within three foot of him, through the Providence of God received no hurt, Yet many Bricks in the Chimney were beaten down, the principal Rafters split, the <hi>B</hi>attens next the Chimney in the Chamber were broken, one of the main Posts of the House into which the

Summer was framed rent into shivers, and a great part of it was carried several Rod from the House, the Door before <hi>Philips,</hi> where the fire came down, was broken.</p>
               <p>On the 28 of <hi>April A. D.</hi> 1664.

He did not stir nor groan after he was smitten, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued standing as before, bearing upon the Table. There was no visible impression on his body or clothes, only the sole of one of his Shoes was rent from the upper Leather. There were about twelve persons in the Room; none else received any harm, only one Woman (who is still living) was struck upon the Head, which occasioned some deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

ever since. The Fire on the House was quenched by the seasonable help of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 15. 1665. There were terrible cracks of Thunder. An House in <hi>Boston</hi> was struck by it, and the Dishes therein melted as they stood on the Shelves, but no other hurt done in the Town. Only Captain <hi>Davenport</hi> (a Worthy Man, and one that had in the <hi>Pequot</hi> War, ventured his life, and did great service for the Countrey) then resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Castle where he commanded: having that day wrought himself weary, and thinking to refresh himself with sleep, was killed with Lightning, as he lay upon his Bed asleep. Several of the Souldiers in the Castle were struck at the same time; but God spared their lives. It has been an old Opinion mentioned by <hi>Plutarch (sympos. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>q.</hi>2.) that Men asleep are never smitten with Lightning; to confirm which it has been alledged, that one lying asleep, the Lightning melted the Money in his Purse without doing him any further harm: And that a Cradle, wherein a Child lay sleeping, was broken with the Lightning, and the Child not hurt; And that the Arrows of King <hi>Mithridates</hi> being near his Bed, were burnt with Lightning, and yet himself being
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:000373_0097_0FA55AEE56223E98"/>

                  <hi>June</hi> 23. 1666. In <hi>Marshfield,</hi> another dismal Storm of Rain with Thunder and Lightning hapned. There were then in the house of <hi>John Philips</hi> (he was Father of that <hi>John Philips</hi> who was slain by Lightning in the year 1658.) fourteen persons; the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the house calling earnestly to shut the Door, that was no sooner done, but an astonishing Thunder-clap fell upon the house rent the Chimney, and split the Door. All in the house were struck. One of them (who is still living) saith, that when he came to himself, he saw the house full of Smoke, and perceived a grievous smell of Brimstone, and saw the fire ly scattered; though whether that fire came from Heaven or was violently hurled out of the Hearth, he can give no account. At first he thought

Two little Children sitting upon the edge of a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, had their lives preserved, though a Dog which lay behind them under the Table was killed.</p>
               <p>In the same year (in the latter end of <hi>May</hi>) <hi>Samuel Ruggles</hi> of <hi>Rocksborough</hi> in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England,</hi> going with a loaden Cart, was struck with Lightning. He did not hear the Thunder-clap, but was by the force of the Lightning e're he was aware, carried over his Cattle about ten foot distance from them. Attempting to rise up he found that he was not able to stand upon his right Leg, for his
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:000373_0099_0FA55B5D4B27AAC8"/>
right foot was become limber, and would bend any way, feeling as if it had no bone in it, nevertheless, he made a shift with the use of one leg to get to his Cattle (being an Horse and two Oxen) which were all killed by the Lightning. He endeavoured to take off the Yoak from the neck of one of the Oxen, but then he perceived that his thumb and two fingers in one hand were stupified that he could not stir them; they looked like cold clay, the blood clear gone out of that part of his hand. But by rubbing his woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded leg and hand, blood and life came into them again. As he came home pulling off his Stocking, he found that on the inside of his right Leg (which smarted much) the hair was quite burnt off, and it looked red. Just over his Ankle his Stocking was singed on the inside, but not on the outside, and there were near upon twenty marks about as big as pins heads, which the Lightning had left thereon. Likewise the Shoe on his left foot, was by the Lightning struck off his foot, and carried above two Rods from him. On the upper leather at the heel of the Shoe, there were five holes burnt through it, bigger than those which are made with Duck Shoe. As for the Beasts that were slain, the hair upon their skins was singed, so that one might

On the 18 of <hi>May</hi> (being the Lords day) <hi>A.D.</hi> 1673. The People at <hi>Wenham</hi> (their worthy Pastor Mr. <hi>Antipas Newman</hi> being lately dead) prevailed with the Reverend Mr. <hi>Higginson</hi> of <hi>Salem,</hi> to spend that Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath amongst them. The afternoon Sermon being ended, he with several of the Town went to Mr. <hi>Newman</hi> his House; whilest they were in discourse there, about the word and works of God, a Thunder storm arose. After a while a smart Clap of Thunder broke upon the House, and especially into the Room where they were sitting, and discoursing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; It did for the present deafen them all, filling the Room with smoke, and ae strong smell as of Brimstone. With the Thunder-clap, came in a Ball of Fire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s big as the Bullet of a great Gun, which suddenly went up the Chimney, as also the Smoke did. This Ball of Fire was seen at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This <hi>Richard Goldsmith,</hi> who was thus slain, was a Shoemaker by Trade, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reputed a good Man for the main; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Yet this must further be added, that half a year before his Death, God gave him a deep sence of his Evils, that he made it his business not only that his peace might be made with God, but with Men also, unto whom he had given just offence. He went up and down bewailing his great sin in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise-breaking; and was become a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious and lively Christian, promoting holy and edifying Discourses, as he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. At that very time when he was struck dead, he was speaking of some passages in the Sermon he had newly heard, and his last words were, <hi>blessed be the Lord.</hi>

Thunder-storm arose; during which Storm <hi>Josiah Walton</hi> (the youngest Son of Mr. <hi>William Walton</hi> late Minister of <hi>Marble-head</hi>) was in a Ketch coming in from Sea, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Harbours mouth, the Wind suddenly shifted to the <hi>Northward;</hi> a violent Gust of Wind coming down on the Vessel, the Seamen concluded to hand their Sails, <hi>Josiah Walton</hi> got upon the Main-yard to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite the matter, and foot down the Sail; when there hapned a terrible flash of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which breaking forth out of the Cloud, struck down three Men who were on the Deck, without doing them any hurt; but <hi>Josiah Walton</hi> being (as was said) on the Main-yard, the Lightning shattered his Thigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone all in pieces, and did split and shiver the Main-mast of the Vessel, and scorcht the Rigging. <hi>Josiah Walton</hi> falling down upon the Deck, his Leg was broken short off. His Brother being on the Deck, did (with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At first he was very sensible of his case; and took leave of his Friends, giving himself to a serious preparation for another World. His Relations used all means possible for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; though he himself told them he was a

In this misery he continued until the next Wednesday morning; and then departed this life; he was an hopeful young-man.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1678. on the 29<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>New-England;</hi> A Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clap with Lightning broke into the next house to the Colledge.

In one Room there then hapned to be the Wife of <hi>John Benjamin</hi> (Daughter to <hi>Thomas Swetman,</hi> the Owner of the House) who then had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant about two Moneths old in her Arms; also another Woman. They were all of them struck; the Child being by the force of the Lightning carried out of the Mothers Arms, and thrown upon the Floor some distance from her. The Mother was at first thought to be dead, but God restored her, though she lost the use of her Limbs for some considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time. Her feet were singed with the Lightning, and yet no sign thereof appearing on her Shoes. Also the Child and the other
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:000373_0105_0FA55B6580750CD8"/>
Woman recovered. In the next room were seven or eight persons who received no hurt. It was above a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

A Pewter Candlestick standing upon a joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool; some part of it was melted and carried away before the Lightning, and stuck in the Chamber floor over head, like Swan shot, and yet the Candlestick it self was not so much as shaken off from the Stool whereon it stood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 12. 1680. There was an amazing Thunder-storm at <hi>Hampton</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi> The Lightning fell upon the House of Mr. <hi>Joseph Smith,</hi> strangely shattering it in divers places. His Wife (the Grand-Daughter of that Eminent Man of God, Mr. <hi>Catton,</hi> who was the famous Teacher of the Church of Christ, first in Old, and then in New <hi>Boston</hi>) lay as dead for the present; being struck down with the Lightning, near the Chimney, yet God mercifully spared and restored her. But the said <hi>Smith</hi> his Mother (a gracious Woman)

               <p>Besides all these which have been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, one or two in <hi>Connecticut</hi> Colony, and four Persons dwelling in the Northern parts of this Countrey, were smitten with the fire of God, about sixteen years ago; the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of which Providences (though very Remarkable) I have not as yet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from those that were acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and therefore cannot here publish them.

House, where a Family of Children (their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents not at home when Lightning hapned) were much frighted, but received no other hurt: what are these but warning pieces, shewing that Mens lives may go next?</hi> Thus he,</p>
               <p>I proceed now to give an account of some late Remarkables about Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wherein several Vessels at Sea were concerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 17.1677. A Vessel whereof Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Berry</hi> was Master, set Sail from <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> Bound for the Island of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera.</hi> About 3. <hi>h. P. M.</hi> being half way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Cape Cod</hi> and <hi>Brewsters Islands,</hi> they were becalmed; and they perceived a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shower arising in the <hi>North-Northwest.</hi> The Master ordered all their Sails (except their two Courses) to be furled. When the shower drew near to them, they had only the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail abroad; all the Men were busie in lash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fast the Long-boat; The Master was walking upon the Deck, and as he came near the Main-mast, he beheld something very black fly before him, about the bigness of a small Mast, at the Larboard side; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately he heard a dreadful and amazing noise, not like a single Canon, but as if great
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:000373_0108_0FA55B67EB4295C0"/>
Armies of Men had been firing one against another; presently upon which the Master was struck clear round, and fell down for dead upon the Deck, continuing so for about seven minutes; but then he revived, having his hands much burnt with the Lightning. The Ship seemed to be on fire; and a very great Smoke having a Sulphurous smell came from between the Decks; so that no man was able to stay there, for more than half an hour after this surprizing Accident hapned. The Main-mast was split from the Top-gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant-mast head to the lower Deck. The Partners of the Pump were struck up at the Star-board side, and one end of two Cabbins staved down betwixt Decks. Two holes were made in one of the Pumps about the bigness of two Musquet Bullets. They were forced to return to <hi>Boston</hi> again, in order to the fitting of the Vessel with a new Mast. Through the mercy of the most high, no person in the Vessel received any hurt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what hath been expressed. Yet it is <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable</hi> that the same day, about the same time, two Men in or near <hi>Wenham</hi> were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Lightning, as they sat under a tree in the Woods.</p>
               <p>On <hi>June</hi> the sixth <hi>A. D.</hi> 1682. A Ship cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

the <hi>Jamaica Merchant,</hi> Captain <hi>Joseph Wild</hi> Commander, being then in the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> Lat.27. <hi>gr.</hi> about I <hi>h. P. M.</hi> was surprized with an amazing Thunder shower; the Lightning split the Main-mast, and knocked down one of the Sea-men, and set the Ship on fire between Decks, in several places. They used utmost endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish the fire, but could not do it; seeing they were unable to overcome those Flames, they betook themselves to their Boat. The fire was so furious between the Cabbin and the Deck in the Steeridge, that they could not go to the relief of each other, insomuch that a Man and his Wife were parted. The Man leaped over-board into the Sea, and so swam to the Boat: his Wife and a Child were taken out of a Gallery Window into the Boat. Three Men more were saved by leaping out of the Cabbin Window. There were aboard this Vessel which Heaven thus set on fire, thirty four persons; yet all escaped with their lives: For the gracious providence of God so ordered, as that Captain <hi>John Bennet</hi> was then in company, who received these distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and astonished Creatures into his Ship: so did they behold the Vessel burning, until about 8 <hi>h. P. M.</hi> when that which remained sunk to the bottom of the Sea. The Master
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:000373_0110_0FA55B6CF8C22AA8"/>
with several of the Seamen were by Captain <hi>Bennet</hi> brought safe to <hi>New-England,</hi> where they declared how wonderfully they had been delivered from Death which God both by fire and water had threatned them with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> 16. 1682. 3. A ship whereof <hi>Robert Luist</hi> is Master being then at Sea (bound for <hi>New-England</hi>) in <hi>Lat. 27.gr.</hi> about <hi>2.h. A.M.</hi> it began to Thunder and Lighten. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held three <hi>Corpusants</hi> (as Mariners call them) on the Yards: The Thunder grew fiercer, and thicker than before. Suddenly their Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel was filled with Smoke, and the smell of Brimstone, that the poor men were terrified with the apprehension of their Ships be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on fire. There came down from the Clouds a stream or flame of Fire as big as the Ships Mast, which fell on the middle of the Deck, where the Mate was standing, but then was thrown flat upon his back with three Men more that were but a little distance from him. They that were yet untouched, thought, not only that their fellow Mariners had been struck dead, but their Deck broken in pieces by that blow, whose sound seemed to them to exceed the report of many great Guns fired off at once. Some that were less dangerously hurt, made an Out-cry that their
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:000373_0111_0FA55B6E7A4A16B0"/>
legs were scalded; but the Mate lay spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There is one <hi>Remarkable</hi> more about <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>Lightning,</hi> which I am lately informed of by persons concerned therein; some cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances in the Relation being as wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as any of the preceding particulars. Thus it was: On <hi>July</hi> 24. in the Year 1681. The Ship called <hi>Alben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  </hi> (whereof Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Lad</hi> was then Master) being an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred leagues from <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> in <hi>Lat.</hi> 48. about <hi>h. P. M.</hi> met with a Thunder Storm. The <hi>Lightning</hi> burnt the Main-top-sail, split the Main-cap in pieces, rent the Mast all along. There was in special one dreadful Clap of Thunder, the report bigger than of a great Gun, at which all the Ships Company were amazed; then did there fall something from the Clouds upon the stern of the Boat, which broke into many small parts; split one of the Pumps, the other Pump much hurt also. It was a Bituminous matter, smelling much like

fired Gun-powder. It continued burning in the stern of the Boat, they did with Stick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But the strangest thing of all, is yet to be mentioned, When night came, observing the Stars, they perceived that their Compasses were changed. As for the Compass in the <hi>Biddikil,</hi> the North point was turned clear South. There were two other Compasses unhung in the <hi>Locker,</hi> in the Cabbin. In one of which the North point stood South, like that in the <hi>Biddikil;</hi> as for the other, the North point stood West. So that they Sailed by a Needle whose Pola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was quite changed. The Seamen were at first puzled how to work their Vessel right, considering that the South point of their Compass was now become North, but after a little use, it was easie to them. Thus did they Sail a thousand Leagues. As for the Compass wherein the Lightning had made the Needle to point Westward, since it was brought to <hi>New-England</hi> the Glass being broke, it has by means of the Air coming to it, wholly lost its virtue. One of those Compasses which had quite changed the Polarity from North to South, is still extant in <hi>Boston;</hi> and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

in my custody. The North point of the Needle doth remain fixed to this day, as it did immediately after the Lightning caused an alteration. The natural reason of which may be enquired into in the next Chapter: But before I pass to that, it may be, it will be grateful to the Reader, for me here to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate some parallel Instances, which have lately hapned in other parts of the World, unto which I proceed, contenting my self with one or two Examples, reserving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for the subsequent Chapter; where we shall have further occasion to take notice of them.</p>

               <p>By the same Authors, it is also Related, that in <hi>June A.D.</hi> 1671. an house was struck with Lightning in four places, in some places the Timber was split, and in other places had holes made in it, as if bored through with an Awger, but no impression of fire were any where to be seen. A Girl fifteen years old, fitting in the Chimney, was struck down and lay for dead, the space of half an hour. And it is probable, that she had never recovered, had not an able Physician been sent for, who viewing her, perceived that the Clothes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her Breast were made to look blewish by the Lightning: It had also caused her Paps to look fiery and blackish, as if they had been scorched with Gun-powder. Under her Breast the Lightning had left creases, a cross her body, of a brownish colour. Also some creases made by the Lightning as broad as ones finger run along her left Leg reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her Foot. The Physician caused two spoonfuls of <hi>Apoplectick Water</hi> to be poured down her throat, upon which she instantly

The Inn-keeper going into his. Wine-Celler to fetch Drink for his merry Guests, at that moment the furious Tempest plucked up the house and carried it a good way off.

not able to comprehend. <hi>Dost thou know the ballancings of the Clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?</hi> I have not yet seen any who give a satisfactory reason of those strange Fountains in <hi>New Spain,</hi> which Ebb and Flow with the Sea, though far from it; and which fall in Rainy Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and rise in dry; or concerning that Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>near St. <hi>Barthohmew's</hi> into which if one cast a stone though never so small, it makes a noise as great and terrible as a clap of Thunder. It is no difficult thing to produce a World of Instances, concerning which the usual An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is, an <hi>occult Quality</hi> is the cause of this strange operation, which is only a Fig-leaf whereby our common Philosophers seek to hide their own ignorance. Nor may we (with <hi>Erastus</hi>) deny that there are marvelous <hi>Sympathies</hi> and <hi>Antipathies</hi> in the natures of things. We know that the Horse does abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the Camel; the mighty Elephant is afraid of a Mouse: And they say that the Lion, who scorneth to turn his back upon the stoutest Animal, will tremble at the Crowing of a Cock. Some Men also have strange <hi>Antipathies</hi> in their natures against that sort of Food which others love and live upon. I have read of one that could not endure to eat either Bread or Flesh. Of another that

sell into a Swoonding fit at the smell of a Rose. Others would do the like at the smell of Vineger, or at the sight of an Eel or a Frog. There was a Man that if he did hear the sound of a Bell, he would immediately die away. Another if he did happen to hear any one sweeping a Room, an inexpressible horror would sieze upon him. Another if he heard one whetting a Knife his Gumms would fall a bleeding. Another was not able to behold a Knife that had a sharp point, without being in a strange agony. <hi>Quercetus</hi> speaketh of one that died as he was sitting at the Table, only because an Apple was brought into his sight. There are some who if a Cat accidentally come into the Room, though they neither see it, nor are told of it, will presently be in a Sweat and ready to die away. There was lately one living in <hi>Stow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Market,</hi> that when ever it Thundred would fall into a violent Vomiting, and so continue until the Thunder-storm was over.

Every one knoweth that the head of a Needle touched therewith will continue pointing towards the North Pole: so that the <hi>Magnet</hi> leaveth an impression of its own nature and vertue upon the Needle, causing it to stand pointed as the <hi>Magnet</hi> it self doth.

Just under the Line the Needle lieth Parallel with the Horizon, but Sailing North or South it begins to incline and increase ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it approacheth to either Pole, and would at last endeavour to erect it self, whence some ascribe these strange effects to the North Star, which they suppose to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry magnetical. There is reason to believe that the Earth is the great <hi>Magnet.</hi> Hence (as Mr. <hi>Seller</hi> observes) when a Bar of Iron has stood long in a Window, that end of it which is next to the Earth will have the same vertue which the Load-stone it self has. Some place the first Meridian at the <hi>Azores,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there the Needle varies not: but the like is to be said of some other parts of the World; yea under the very same Meridian in divers Latitudes there is a great variation as to the pointing of the Needle. <hi>It is affirmed, that between the shore of</hi> Ireland, France, Spain, Guiny, <hi>and the</hi> Azores, <hi>the North point varies towards the East, as some part of the</hi> Azores <hi>it deflecteth not. On the other side of the</hi> Azores, <hi>and this side of the</hi> AEquator, <hi>the North point of the Needle wheeleth to the West; so that in the</hi> Lat.36. <hi>near the shore, the variation is about 11 gr. but on the other side of the</hi> AEquator <hi>it is quite otherwise, for in</hi> Brasilia <hi>the South point
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:000373_0125_0FA55B7E454CB468"/>
varies</hi> 12 gr. <hi>unto the West, but Elongating from the Coast of</hi> Brasilia <hi>toward the Shore of</hi> Africa <hi>it varies Eastward, and arriving at the</hi> Cape Delas Aquilas, <hi>it rests in the Meridian and looketh neither way. Dr.</hi> Brown <hi>in be</hi> Psudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxia Epidemica <hi>P.</hi> 63. <hi>does rationally suppose that the cause of this variation may be the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of the Earth variously disposed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently mixed with the Sea. The Needle driveth that way where the greater and most powerful part of the Earth is placed. For whereas on this side the Isles of</hi> Azores <hi>the Needle varies Eastward, it may be occasioned by that vast Tract,</hi> 
                  <abbr>viz.</abbr> Europe, Asia, <hi>and</hi> Africa, <hi>seated towards the East, and disposing the Needle that way. Sailing further it</hi> veers <hi>its lilly to the West, and regards that quarter wherein the Land is nearer or greater; and in the same La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as it approacheth the shore augmenteth its variation. Hence at</hi> Rome <hi>there is a less va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation</hi> (<abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                  <hi>but five degrees</hi>) <hi>than at</hi> London, <hi>for on the west side of</hi> Rome <hi>are seated the great Continents of</hi> France, Spain, Germany; <hi>but unto</hi> England <hi>there is almost no Earth West, but the whole extent of</hi> Europe <hi>and</hi> Asia <hi>lies Eastward, and therefore at</hi> London <hi>the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is</hi> 11 Degrees. <hi>Thus also, by reason of the great Continent of</hi> Brasilia, <hi>the Needle deflects towards the Land</hi> 12 Degrees; <hi>but at the Straits
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:000373_0126_0FA55B7F87993890"/>
of</hi> Magellan, <hi>where the Land is narrowed, and the Sea on the other side, it varies but 5 or 6. So because the Cape of</hi> De las Agullas <hi>hath Sea on both sides near it, and other Land remote, and as it were aequidistant from it, the Needle conforms to the Meridian, In certain Creeks and Vallies it proveth irregular; the reason whereof may be some vigorous part of the Earth not far distant.</hi> Thus D. <hi>Brown,</hi> whose arguings seem, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal. Some have truly observed of <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> or Steel corroded with Vineger, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, or otherwise, and after reverberated by Fire, that the Load-stone will not at all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it: nor will it adhere, but ly therein like Sand. It is likewise certain, that the fire will cause the Load-stone to lose its vertue, inasmuch as its Bituminous Spirits are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by evaporated. <hi>Porta</hi> (Lib.7. Cap. 7.) saith that he did to his great admiration see a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous flame brake out of the Load-stone which being dissipated, the Stone lost it's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive vertue. Moreover, the Load-stone by being put into the fire may be caused quite to change its polarity. The truly Noble and Honourable <hi>Robert Boyle</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq,</abbr> many of whose excellent Observations and experiments have been advantagious, not only to the <hi>English</hi> Nation but to the Learned World; in his Book of the Usefulness of Experimental,

Natural Philosophy, <hi>Page</hi> 15. hath these words; <hi>Taking an Oblong Load-stone, and beating it red hot, I found the attractive faculty in not many minutes, either altogether abolisht, or at least so impaired and weakened, that I was scarce if at all able to discern it. But this hath been observed, though not so faithfully related, by more than one; wherefore I shall add, That by Refrigerating this red hot Load-stone either North or South, I found that I could give its extreams a Polarity</hi> (if I may so speak) <hi>which they would readily display upon an excited Needle freely placed in</hi> aequilibrium: <hi>And not only so, but I could by refrigerating the same end, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times North, and sometimes South, in a very short time change the Poles of the Load-stone at pleasure, making that which was a quarter of an hour before the North Pole, become the South; and on the contrary, the formerly southern Pole become the northern. And this change was wrought on the Load-stone, not only by cooling it directly North and South, but by cooling it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly: that end of it which was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the Ground growing the Northern Pole, and so</hi> (according to the Laws Magnetical) <hi>drawing to it the South end; and that which was remotest from the contrary one: As if indeed the Terrestial Globe were as some</hi> Magnetic Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers <hi>have supposed it, but a great</hi> Magnes,

                  <hi>since its</hi> effluvium's <hi>are able in some cases to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part a magnetic faculty to the Load-stone it self,</hi> Thus far Mr. <hi>Boyle;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also D. <hi>Brown</hi> shews, that if we erect a red hot Wire until it cool, then hang it up with Wax and untwisted Silk where the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er end and that which cooled next the Earth does rest, that is the Northern point. And if a Wire be heated only at one end, according as the end is cooled upwards or downwards, it respecttively requires a verticity. He also observes, if a Load-stone be made red hot in the fire, it amits the magnetical vigor it had before, and acquireth another from the Earth, in its refrigeration, for that part which cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth next the Earth will acquire the respect of the North; the experiment whereof he made in a Load-stone of parallelogram or long square figure, wherein only inverting the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams as it came out of the fire, he altered the Poles or faces thereof at pleasure. Unto some such reason as this, must the wonderful change occasioned by the Lightning in the Compasses of Mr. <hi>Lad's</hi> Vessel be ascribed: probably the heat of the Lightning caused the Needle to lose its vertue, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass in the Bidikle might stand pointed to the South, and that unhung in the Locker to the West, when they grew cold again, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly

                  <hi>Nitre</hi> is a special ingredient in the matter of Thunder and Lightning; This we may gather from the descension of the flame, which descends not only obliquely but perpendicularly, and that argues it does so not from any external force, but naturally, Mr. <hi>William Clark</hi> in his natural History of Nitre, observes that if the quantity of an ounce be put in a fire-shovel, and a live coal put upon it, the fire-shovel in the bottom will be red hot, and burn through whatever is under it; which demonstrates that this sort of fire does naturally burn downwards, when as all other fires do naturally ascend. For this cause <hi>Stella cadens</hi> is rationally concluded to be a Nitrous Substance; the like is to be affirmed of the Lightning. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

are exceeding marvelous, sometimes Gold, Silver, Brass, Iron has been melted thereby, when the things wherein they have been kept, received no hurt; yea, when the Wax: on the Bags which contained them, has not been so much as melted.

                  </hi> supposeth to be, in that the heat of the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning did condense the exterior parts of the Wine. It is also a very strange thing, which Histories report concerning <hi>Marcia</hi> (a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Princess</hi>) that the Child in her body was smitten and killed with Lightning, and yet the Mother received no hurt in her own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. It is hard to give a clear and satisfactory Reason why if a piece of Iron be laid upon the Cask it prevents the Thunder from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Wine contained therein, and also keeps Milk from turning. The <hi>Virtuosi</hi> of <hi>France</hi> in their Philosophical Conferences (<hi>vol.</hi>2.<hi>P.</hi>427.) suppose a Sympathy between Iron and the gross vapors of Thunder and Lightning. They say that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the <hi>Thunder-bolt</hi> does sometimes

resemble Steel, as it were to shew the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence that there is between Iron and Thunder: So that the Air being impregnate by those noisome vapours which are of the same nature with Iron, meeting with some piece of it laid on a Vessel, is joyned to the Iron by Sympathy, the Iron by its attractive vertue receives them, and by its retentive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains them, and by that means prevents the effects. This conjecture is ingenious. Nor is it easie to give a solid Reason why the Lightning should hurt one creature rather than another.

Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists observe, that venemous Creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing struck with Lightning lose their poyson; the reason of which may be, not only the heat but the venome of those Vapours attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the poyson to themselves. And that Vapors will kill in a moment is past doubt. In the Philosophical transactions for the year 1665. (<hi>P.</hi>44.) It is related that seven or eight persons going down Stairs into a Coal-pit, they fell down dead as if they had been shot: There being one of them whose Wife was informed that her Husband was stifled, she went near to him without any inconvenience; but when she went a little further, the Vapors caused her instantly to fall down dead. And it is famously known, concerning the Lake <hi>Avernus</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> that if Birds attempt to fly over it, the deadly vapors thereof kill them in a moment. But the Lightning doth more than meerly suffocate with mortiferous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors.

                        </gap>dley</hi> to come homewards, standing near the head of the Boat, were presently with a stroke of Thunder or Lightning, both struck off out of the Boat into the Water, the one of them stark dead, in whom though presently taken out of the water (having been by relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on scarce a minute in it) there was not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned any appearance of Life, sense or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:000373_0139_0FA55B8B02BC2648"/>
the other was stuck fast in the Mud (with his feet downwards, and his upper parts above water) like a Post not able to help himself out; but besides a present asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying or numness had no other hurt: but was for the present so disturbed in his Senses that he knew not how he came out of the Boat, nor could remember either Thunder or Lightning that did effect it: and was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry feeble and faint upon it (which though presently put into a warm Bed) he had not throughly recovered by the next night; and whither since he have or no, I know not. Others, in another Boat, about ten or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yards from these (as by their description I estimate) felt a disturbance and shaking in their Boat, and one of them had his Chair struck from under him, and thrown upon him, but had no hurt. These imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately made up to the others, and (some leaping into the Water to them) presently drew them into the Boat or on shore; yet none of them saw these two fall into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (not looking that way) but heard one of them cry for help presently upon the stroke, and smelt a very strong stinking smell in the Air; which, when I asked him that told it me, what kind of stink? he said, like such a smell, as is perceived upon the

striking of Flints together.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>He that was dead (when by putting into a warm Bed, and rubbing, and putting strong Waters into his month, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no Life could be brought into him) was the next morning brought to Town; where among multitudes of others, who came to see; Dr. <hi>Willis.</hi> Dr. <hi>Mellington,</hi> Dr. <hi>Lower,</hi> and my self, with some others, went to view the Corps, where we found no wound at all in the skin; the face and neck swart and black, but not more than might be ordinary, by the setling of the blood: on the right side of the Neck was a little blackish spott about an inch long, and about a quarter of an inch broad at the broadest, and was as if it had been seared with a hot Iron: and as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, one somewhat bigger on the left side of the neck below the ear. Streight down the Breast, but towards the left side of it, was a large place, about three quarters of a foot in length, and about two inches in breadth; in some places more, in some less, which was burnt and hard, like Leather burnt with the fire, of a deep blackish red colour, not much unlike the scorched skin of a losted Pig: and on the forepart of the left Shoulder such another spot about as big as a shilling; but that in the neck was
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:000373_0141_0FA55B8EA39F79F0"/>
blacker and seemed more seared. From the top of the right shoulder, sloping down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards that place in his Breast, was a narrow line of the like scorched skin; as if somewhat had come in there at the neck; and had run down to the breast and there spread broader.</p>
                  <p>The Buttons of his Dublet were most of them off, which some thought might have been torn off with the blast, getting in at the neck, and then bursting its way out, for which the greatest presumption was (to me) that besides four or five Buttons wanting towards the bottom of the breast, there were about half a dozen together clear off from the bottom of the Collar downwards, and I do not remember that the rest of the buttons did seem to be near worn out, but almost new. The Collar of his Doublet just over the fore-part of the right Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was quite broken asunder, cloth and stiffening, streight and downwards, as if cut or chopt asunder, but with a blunt tool; only the inward linnen or fustian lining of it was whole, by which, and by the view of the ragg'd edges, it seemed manifest to me, that it was from a stroke inward (from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out) not outwards from within.</p>
                  <p>His Hat was strangely torn, not just on
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:000373_0142_0FA55B8EB534F4D8"/>
the Crown, but on the side of the Hat, and on the Brim. On the side of it was a great hole, more than to put in ones fist through it: some part of it being quite struck away, and from thence divers gashes every way, as if torn or cut with a dull tool, and some of them of a good length, almost quite to the edges of the brim. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these, one or two gashes more, which did not communicate with that hole in the side. This also was judged to be by a stroke inwards; not so much from the view of the edges of those Gashes (from which there was scarce any judgement to be made either way) but because the lining was not torn, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ript from the edge of the Hat (where it was sown on) on that side where the hole was made. But his Hat not being found upon his head, but at some distance from him, it did not appear against what part of his head that hole was made.</p>
                  <p>Another sad disaster hapned <hi>January</hi> 24. 1665,6. When one Mr. <hi>Brooks</hi> of <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> going from <hi>Winchester</hi> towards his House near <hi>Andover,</hi> in very bad weather, was himself slain by Lightning, and the Horse he rode on under him. For about a Mile from <hi>Winchester</hi> he was found with
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:000373_0143_0FA55B8FB52B2908"/>
his face beaten into the Ground, one Leg in the Stirrup, the other in the Horses main; his Cloathes all burnt off his back, not a piece as big as an Hankerchief left intire, and his Hair and all his body singed. With the force that struck him down, his nose was beaten into his face, and his Chin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Breast; where was a Wound cut al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as low as to his Navil; and his clothes being as aforesaid torn, the pieces were so scattered and consumed, that not enough to fill the crown of a Hat could be found. His Gloves were whole, but his hands in them singed to the Bone. The Hip-bone and Shoulder of his Horse burnt and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and his Saddle torn in little pieces.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Very Remarkable also was that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned forty five years ago at another place in <hi>England,</hi> 
                  <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                  <hi>Withycomb</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> where on <hi>October</hi> 21. <hi>A. D.</hi> 1638. being Sabbath, day, whilest the People were attending the publick Worship of God, a black Cloud coming over the Church, there was suddenly an amazing Clap of Thunder, and with it a Ball of fire came in at the Window, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the House was very much damnified, and the People many of them struck down. Some of the Seats in the body of the Church
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:000373_0144_0FA55B903628A790"/>
were turned upside down, yet they that sat in them received no hurt. A Gentleman of note there (one Mr. <hi>Hill</hi>) sitting in his Seat by the Chancil, had his head suddenly smitten against the Wall, by which blow he died that night. Another had his Head clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, his Skull rent in three pieces, and his Brains thrown upon the Ground whole. The hair of his head through the violence of the blow stuck fast to the Pillar that was near him. A Woman attempting to run out of the Church, had her clothes set on fire; and her flesh on her back torn almost to the very bone. See Mr. <hi>Clarks</hi> Examples <hi>Vol.</hi>1. <hi>Chap.</hi>104. <hi>P,</hi>501.</p>
               <p>It is not Heresie to believe that <hi>Satan</hi> has sometimes a great operation in causing Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-storms.

Scriptures intimate as much as this cometh to In the sacred Story concerning <hi>Job,</hi> we find that Satan did raise a great Wind which blew down the House where <hi>Job's</hi> Children were Feasting. And it is said, <hi>Chap.</hi>1.<hi>ver.</hi>16. <hi>That the fire of God fell from Heaven, and burnt up the Sheep and the Servants; This <gap reason="foreign">

Mr. <hi>Caryl</hi> (according to his wonted manner) does both wittily and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously paraphrase upon the place; <hi>The fire of God</hi> (saith he) <hi>here is conceived to have been some terrible flash of Lightning; and it is the more probable because it is said to fall down from Heaven,</hi> that is, <hi>

There Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan can do mighty things, command much of the Magazine of Heaven, where that dreadful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery which makes men tremble, those fiery Meteors, Thunder and Lightning are stored and lodged. Satan let loose by God can do wonders in the Air; He can raise Storms, He can discharge the great Ordnance of Heaven, Thunder and Lightning; and by his Art can make them more terrible and dreadful than they are in their own</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="unknown:000373_0146_0FA55B91E0BA18F8"/>
nature. Satan is said to be <hi>the Prince of the Power of the Air,</hi> Eph.2.2. And we read of the working of Satan with all power and signs; and lying words, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 9. It is moreover predicted in the Revelation, that Antichrist should <hi>cause fire to come down from Heaven,</hi> Rev.13.13. Accordingly we read in History, that some of the Popes have by their skill in the black Art, caused Balls of fire to be seen in the Air. So then it is not beyond Satans power to effect such things, if the great God give him leave, without whose leave he cannot blow a Feather: much less raise a Thunder-storm. And as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures intimate Satan's Power in the Air to be great, so Histories do abundantly confirm it by remarkable Instances. One of the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of <hi>Empedocles</hi> has testified, that he saw his Master raising Winds and laying them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and there were once many Witnesses of it, whence they called <hi>Empedocles <gap reason="foreign">

The Popish Priests undertook by Conjuration to obtain Water. The Magical Ceremonies by them observed were most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and ridiculous. For they took an Asse, and put the Sacrament of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> into his Mouth, sang Funeral Verses over him, and then buried him alive before the Church doors; as soon as these rites, so pleasing to the Devil were finished, the Heavens began to look black, and the Sea to be agitated with Winds, and anon it rained, and lightned, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a most horrendous manner. <hi>Smetius</hi> in his <hi>Miscellanies,</hi> Lib. 5. Relates that a Girl foolishly imitating the Ceremonies of her Nurse, whom she had sometimes seen raising Tempests, immediately a prodigious Storm of Thunder and Lightning hapned, so as that a Village near <hi>Lipsia</hi> was thereby set on fire; This Relation is mentioned by <hi>Sennertus,</hi> as a thing really true.

And the truth of our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, seems to be confirmed by one of those sad effects of Lightning mentioned in the precedeing Chapter.

               <p>The <hi>Jewish Rabbins</hi> affirm, that all great and suddain Destructions are from Satan, the Angel of Death. That he has frequently an hand therein is past doubt. And if the fallen Angels are able (when God shall grant them a Commission) to cause fearful and fatal Thunders, it is much more true concerning the good and holy Angels, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 14, 15. When the Law was given at Mount <hi>Sinar,</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="unknown:000373_0149_0FA55B982CA80990"/>
there were amazing Thundrings and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, wherein the great God saw meet to make use of the Ministry of Holy Angels, <hi>Act.</hi>7.53. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2.

We know that one Night the Angel of the Lord smote in the Camp of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> an 185000. It is not improbable, but that those <hi>Assyrians</hi> were killed with Lightning: For it was with respect to that tremendous Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that those words were uttered, <hi>Who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us shall dwell with the devouring Fire, Isai.</hi>33.14.

Why might not holy Angels have an hand in that Lightning? There occurs to my mind, a Remarkable Passage mentioned by Dr. <hi>Beard</hi> in his Chapter about the Protection of Holy Angels over them that fear God <hi>(<hi>P.</hi>443.)</hi> he saith, that a certain Man travelling between two Woods in a great Tempest of Thunder

Surely there was the invisible Guardianship of an Holy Angel in that Providence.</p>
               <p>But though it be true, that both natural Causes and Angels do many times concurre when Thunder and Lightning, with the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects thereof, happen; nevertheless, the supream cause must not be disacknowledged.

The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism</hi> of <hi>Epicurus</hi> of old, (and of some in these dayes) who taught, that inasmuch as Thunder proceeds from natural causes, it is a childish thing for Men to have an awe upon

their hearts when they hear that voice, I say such Atheism is folly and wickedness. For the great God <hi>maketh the way for the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Thunder;</hi> nor does it ever miss or mistake its way, but alwayes lights where God has appointed it, <hi>Job</hi> 28.26. He directs the Lightning under the whole Heaven, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ends of the Earth; after it a voice roareth, that they may do whatsoever he commanded them upon the face of the world in the Earth, <hi>Job</hi> 37.3,12. Yea, and good Men should from this consideration be inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to endeavour that their Garments be kept from defilement, and that they be alwayes walking with God, since they know not but that Death may come upon them suddenly in such a way and by such means as this; As to outward Evils, there is one event to the Righteous and to the Wicked; to him that sacrificeth &amp; to him that sacrificeth not, as is the good so is the sinner. The examples mentioned in the preceding Chapter do confirm it, since divers of those whom the Thunder killed, were good men. And they that are in Christ, and who make it their design to live unto God, need not be dismayed at the most terrifying Thunder-claps, no more than a Child should be afraid when he hears the voice of his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Father. Notable is that passage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:000373_0154_0FA55B9DE43610B8"/>
by Mr. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> in his Treatise of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels (<hi>P.</hi>265. &amp; by Mr. <hi>Clark, vol.</hi>1. <hi>P.</hi> 512.) A prophane Man, who was also a Persecutor of Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> riding abroad, it Thundred ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dreadfully; at the which the Man greatly trembled; his Wife, who was eminent for Godliness being with him, asked, why he was so much afraid? to whom he replied; are not you afraid to hear these dreadful Thunder claps? no (saith she) not at all, for I know it is the voice of my Heavenly Father; and should a Child be afraid to hear his Fathers voice? At the which the Man was amazed, concluding with himself, these <hi>Puritans</hi> have a divine principle in them, which the World seeth not, that they should have peace and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity in their Souls when others are filled with dismal fears and horrors. He thereupon went to Mr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> bewailing the wrong he had done him, begging his Pardon and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and that he would tell him what he must do that so his Soul might he saved: and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a very godly man ever after. This was an happy Thunder-Storm.</p>

                     <hi>Concerning things preternatural which have hapned in</hi> New-England. <hi>A Remarkable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation about</hi> Ann Cole <hi>of</hi> Hartford. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning several Witches in that</hi> Colony. <hi>Of the Possessed Maid at</hi> Groton. <hi>An account of the House in</hi> Newberry <hi>lately troubled with a</hi> Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. <hi>A parallel Story of an House at</hi> Ted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth <hi>in</hi> England. <hi>Concerning another in</hi> Hartford. <hi>And of one in</hi> Portsmouth <hi>in</hi> New-England <hi>lately disquieted by Evil Spitits.

               </argument>
               <p>INasmuch as things which are praeternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and not accomplished without diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical operation, do more rarely happen, it is pity but that they should be observed. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Accidents of that kind have hapned in <hi>New-England;</hi> which I shall here faithfully Relate so far as I have been able to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of them.</p>
               <p>Very Remarkable was that Providence wherein <hi>Ann Cole</hi> of <hi>Hartford</hi> in <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> was concerned. She was, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a person of real Piety and Integrity,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:000373_0156_0FA55B9F467BC270"/>
Nevertheless, in the Year 1662. then living in her Fathers House (who has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise been esteemed a godly Man) She was taken with very strange Fits, wherein her Tongue was improved by a <hi>Daemon</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press things which she her self knew nothing of. Sometimes the Discourse would hold for a considerable time. The general purpose of which was, that such and such persons (who were named in the Discourse which passed from her) were consulting how they might carry on mischievous designs against her and several others, mentioning sundry wayes they should take for that end, particularly that they would afflict her Body, spoil her Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The general answer made amongst the <hi>Daemons,</hi> was, <hi>She runs to the Rock.</hi> This having been continued some hours, the <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> said, <hi>Let us confound her Language, that she may tell no more tales.</hi> She uttered matters unintelligible. And then the Discourse pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into a <hi>Dutch-tone</hi> (a <hi>Dutch</hi> Family then lived in the Town) and therein an account was given of some afflictions that had befallen divers; amongst others, what had befallen a Woman that lived next Neighbour to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Family, whose Arms had been strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pinched in the night, declaring by whom, and for what cause that course had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:000373_0157_0FA55B9FF80E28A0"/>
with her. The Reverend Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> (then Teacher of the Church in <hi>Hartford</hi>) being by, when the Discourse hapned, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he thought it impossible for one not familiarly acquainted with the <hi>Dutch</hi> (which <hi>Ann Cole</hi> had not in the least been) should so exactly imitate the <hi>Dutch-tone</hi> in the pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of <hi>English.</hi> Several Worthy Persons, (<abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> Mr. <hi>John Whiting,</hi> Mr. <hi>Samuel Hooker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Joseph Hains</hi>) wrote the intelligible sayings expressed by <hi>Ann Cole,</hi> whilest she was thus amazingly handled. The event was that one of the persons (whose Name was <hi>Greensmith</hi>) being a lewd and ignorant Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and then in Prison on suspicion for Witch-craft) mentioned in the Discourse as active in the mischiefs done and designed, was by the Magistrate sent for; Mr. <hi>Whiting</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nes</hi> read what they had written; and the Woman being astonished thereat, confessed those things to be true, and that she and other persons named in this preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Discourse, had had familiarity with the Devil: Being asked whether she had made an express Covenant with him; she answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, she had not, only as she promised to go with him when he called, which accordingly she had sundry times done; and that the Devil told her that at <hi>Christmass</hi> they would
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:000373_0158_0FA55BA0B0218880"/>
have a merry Meeting, and then the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between them should be subscribed. The next day she was more particularly enquired of concerning her Guilt respecting the Crime she was accused with. She then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that though when Mr. <hi>Hains</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to read what he had taken down in Writing, her rage was such that she could have torn him in pieces, and was as resolved as might be to deny her guilt (as she had done before) yet after he had read awhile, she was (to use her own expression) as if her flesh had been pulled from her bones, and so could not deny any longer: She likewise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the Devil first appeared to her in the form of a Deer or Fawn, skipping about her, wherewith she was not much affrighted, and that by degrees he became very familiar, and at last would talk with her. Moreover, she said that the Devil had frequently the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal knowledge of her Body. And that the Witches had Meetings at a place not far from her House; and that some appeared in one shape, and others in another; and one came flying amongst them in the shape of a Crow. Upon this Confession, with other concurrent Evidence, the Woman was Executed; so likewise was her Husband, though he did not acknowledge himself guilty. Other persons
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:000373_0159_0FA55BA20DDEACA8"/>
accused in the Discourse made their escape. Thus doth the Devil use to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve his Clients. After the suspected Witches were either exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted or fled, <hi>Ann Cole</hi> was restored to health, and has continued well for many years, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving her self a serious Christian.</p>
               <p>There were some that had a mind to try whither the Stories of Witches not being able to sink under water, were true; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly a Man and Woman mentioned in <hi>Ann Cole's Dutch</hi>-toned discourse, had their hands and feet tyed, and so were cast into the water, and they both apparently swam after the manner of a Buoy, part under, part above the Water. A by-stander imagining that any person bound in that posture would be so born up, offered himself for trial, but being in the like matter gently laid on the the Water, he immediately sunk right down. This was no legal Evidence against the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected persons; nor were they proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst on any such account; However doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that an Halter would choak them, though the Water would not; they very fairly took their flight, not having been seen in that part of the World since. Whether this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment were lawful, or rather Superstitious and Magical, we shall (<gap reason="foreign">

Another thing which caused a noise in the Countrey, and wherein Satan had undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a great influence, was, that which hapned at <hi>Groton.</hi> There was a Maid in that Town (one <hi>Elizabeth Knap</hi>) who in the Moneth of <hi>October,</hi> Anno. 1671. was taken after a very strange manner, sometimes weeping, sometimes laughing, sometimes roaring hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, with violent motions and agitations of her body, crying out <hi>Money, Money,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>November</hi> following, her Tongue for many hours together was drawn like a semicircle up to the roof of her Mouth, not to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, though some tried with their fingers to do it. Six Men were scarce able to hold her in some of her fits, but she would skip about the House yelling and looking with a most frightful Aspect. <hi>December</hi> 17. Her Tongue was drawn out of her mouth to an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary length; and now a <hi>Daemon</hi> began ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly to speak in her. Many words were uttered wherein are the <hi>Labial Letters,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any motion of her Lips, which was a clear demonstration that the voice was not her own. Sometimes Words were spoken seeming to proceed out of her throat, when her Mouth was shut. Sometimes with her Mouth wide open, without the use of any of the Organs of speech. The things then ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:000373_0161_0FA55BA34059B0F0"/>
by the Devil were chiefly Railings and Revilings of Mr. <hi>Willard</hi> (who was at that time a Worthy and Faithful Pastor to the Church in <hi>Groton.</hi>) Also the <hi>Daemon</hi> bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forth most horrid and nefandous Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, exalting himself above the most High. After this she was taken speechless for some time. One thing more is worthy of <hi>Remark</hi> concerning this miserable creature. She cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in some of her Fits, that a Woman, (one of her Neighbours) appeared to her, and was the cause of her Affliction. The Person thus accused was a very sincere, holy Woman, who did hereupon with the Advice or Friends visit the poor Wretch; and though she was in one of her Fits, having her Eyes shut, when the innocent person impeached by her came in; yet could she (so powerful were Satans Operations upon her) declare who was there, and could tell the touch of that Woman from any ones else. But the gracious Party thus accused and abused by a malicious Devil, Prayed earnestly with and for the Possessed creature; after which she confessed that Satan had deluded he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted by a <hi>Daemon.</hi> After those troubles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, he did by the Advice of Friends write down the particulars of those unusual Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. And the Account which he giveth thereof is as followeth;</p>
               <p>On <hi>December</hi> 3. in the night time, he and his Wife heard a noise upon the roof of their House, as if Sticks and Stones had been thrown against it with great violence; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he rose out of his Bed, but could see nothing. Locking the Doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s fast, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Bed again. About midnight they heard an Hog making a great noise in the House, so that the Man rose again, and found a great Hog in the house, the door being shut, but upon the opening of the door it ran out.</p>
               <p>On <hi>December</hi> 8. in the Morning, there were five great Stones and Bricks by an <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible hand</hi> thrown in at the west end of the

house while the Mans Wife was making the Bed, the Bedstead was lifted up from the floor, and the Bedstaff flung out of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and a Cat was hurled at her; a long Staff danced up and down in the Chimney; a burnt Brick, and a piece of a weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board were thrown in at the Window: The Man at his going to Bed put out his Lamp, but in the Morning found that the Saveall of it was taken away, and yet it was unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly brought into its former place. On the same day, the long Staff but now spoken of, was hang'd up by a line, and swung to and fro, the Man's Wife laid it in the fire, but she could not hold it there, inasmuch as it would forcibly fly out; yet after much ado with joynt strength they made it to burn. A shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle flew from the Window, though no body near it, many sticks came in at the same place, only one of these was so scragged that it could enter the hole but a little way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Man pusht it out, a great Rail like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise was thrust in at the Window, so as to break the Glass.</p>
               <p>At another time an Iron Crook that was hanged on a Nail, violently flew up and down, also a Chair flew about, and at last lighted on the Table where Victuals stood ready for them to cat, and was likely to spoil all, only

by a nimble catching they saved some of their Meal with the loss of the rest, and the overturning of their Table.</p>
               <p>People were sometimes Barricado'd out of doors, when as yet there was no body to do it: and a Chest was removed from place to place, no hand touching it. Their Keys being tied together, one was taken from the rest, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And a Bag of Hops was taken out of their Chest, wherewith they were beaten, till some of the Hops were scattered on the floor, where the Bag was then laid, and left.</p>

had an iron Pin twice thrown at him, and his Inkhorn was taken away from him while he was writing, and when by all his seeking it he could not find it, at last he saw it drop out of the Air, down by the fire: a piece of Leather was twice thrown at him; and a shoe was laid upon his shoulder, which he catching at, was suddenly rapt from him.

a principal sufferer in these afflictions: For on the 18. of <hi>December,</hi> he sitting by his Grandfather, was hurried into great motions and the Man thereupon took him, and made him stand between his Legs, but the Chair danced up and down, and had like to have cast both Man and Boy into the fire: and the Child was afterwards flung about in such a manner, as that they feared that his Brains would have been beaten out; and in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening he was tossed as afore, and the Man tried the project of holding him, but ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually. The Lad was soon put to Bed, and they presently heard an huge noise, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what was the matter? and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that his Bed-stead leaped up and down: and they (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Man and his Wife) went up, and at first found all quiet, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had been there long, they saw the Board by his Bed trembling by him, and the Bed-clothes flying off him, the latter they laid on immediately, but they were no sooner on than off; so they took him out of his Bed for quietness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> 29. The Boy was violently thrown to and fro, only they carried him to the house of a Doctor in the Town, and there he was free from disturbances, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home at night, his former trouble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:000373_0170_0FA55BAC407A8B18"/>
and the Man taking him by the hand, they were both of them almost tript into the fire. They put him to bed, and he was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the same iterated loss of his clothes, shaking off his Bed-board, and Noises, that he had in his last conflict; they took him up, designing to sit by the fire, but the doors clattered, and the Chair was thrown at him, wherefore they carried him to the Doctors house, and so for that night all was well. The next morning he came home quiet, but as they were doing somewhat, he cried out that he was prickt on the back, they looked, and found a three-tin'd Fork sticking strangely there; which being carried to the Doctors house, not only the Doctor himself said that it was his, but also the Doctors Servant affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it was seen at home after the Boy was gone. The Boys vexations continuing, they left him at the Doctors, where he remained well till awhile after, and then he complained he was pricked, they looked and found an iron Spindle sticking below his back; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained he was pricked still, they looked, and found Pins in a Paper sticking to his skin; he once more complained of his Back, they looked, and found there a long Iron, a bowl of a Spoon, and a piece of a Pansheard. They lay down by him on the Bed, with the

Another time he was thrust out of his Chair and rolled up and down with out cries, that all things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Particularly, on <hi>December</hi> 26. He barked like a Dog, and clock't like an Hen, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long distraining to speak, said, there's <hi>Powel,</hi> I am pinched; his Tongue likewise hung out of his mouth, so as that it could by no means be forced in till his Fit was over, and then he said 'twas forced out by <hi>Powel.</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="unknown:000373_0172_0FA55BAF95D0FDD0"/>
He &amp; the house also after this had rest till the ninth of <hi>January:</hi> at which time because of his intolerable ravings, and because the Child lying between the Man and his Wife, was pulled out of Bed, and knockt so vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the Bed-stead Boards, in a manner very perillous and amazing. In the Day time he was carried away beyond all possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their finding him. His Grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at last saw him creeping on one side, and drag'd him in, where he lay miserable lame, but recovering his speech, he said, that he was carried above the Doctors house, and that <hi>Powel</hi> carried him, and that the said <hi>Powel</hi> had him into the Barn, throwing him against the Cart-wheel there, and then thrusting him out at an hole; and accordingly they found some of the Remainders of the Threshed Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="153" facs="unknown:000373_0173_0FA55BB0A11F2BF8"/>
Man carried him to his Daughters, three miles from his own. The Boy was growing antick as he was on the Journey, but before the end of it he made a grievous hollowing, and when he lighted, he threw a great stone at a Maid in the house, and fell on eating of Ashes. Being at home afterwards, they had rest awhile, but on the 19 of <hi>January</hi> in the Morning he swooned, and coming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he roared terribly, and did eat Ashes, Sticks, Rug-yarn. The Morning following, there was such a racket with the Boy, that the Man and his Wife took him to Bed to them. A Bed-staff was thereupon thrown at them, and a Chamber pot with its Contents was thrown upon them, and they were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely pinched. The Man being about to rise, his Clothes were divers times pulled from them, himself thrust out of his Bed, and his Pillow thrown after him. The Lad also would have his clothes plucked off from him in these Winter Nights, and was wofully dogg'd with such fruits of Devilish spite, till it pleased God to shorten the Chain of the wicked <hi>Daemon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this while the Devil did not use to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in any visible shape, only they would think they had hold of the Hand that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times scratched them; but it would give them
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:000373_0174_0FA55BB15F3D6020"/>
the slip. And once the Man was discerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beaten by a Fist, and an Hand got hold of his Wrist which he saw, but could not catch; and the likeness of a <hi>Blackmore</hi> Child did appear from under the Rugg and Blanket, where the Man lay, and it would rise up, fall down, nod &amp; slip under the clothes when they endeavoured to clasp it, never speaking any thing.</p>
               <p>Neither were there many Words spoken by Satan all this time, only once having put out their Light, they heard a scraping on the Boards, and then a Piping and Drumming on them, which was followed with a Voice, singing <hi>Revenge! Revenge! Sweet is Revenge!</hi> And they being well terrified with it, called upon God; the issue of which was, that sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly with a mournful Note, there were six times over uttered such expressions as <hi>Alas! Alas! me knock no more! me knock no more!</hi> and now all ceased.</p>
               <p>The Man does moreover affirm, that a Seaman (being a Mate of a Ship) coming often to visit him, told him that they wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Wife who suspected her to be guilty of Witchcraft; and that the Boy (his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child) was the cause of this trouble; and that if he would let him have the Boy one day, he would warrant him his house should
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:000373_0175_0FA55BB1F8C3A978"/>
be no more troubled as it had been; to which motion he consented. The Mate came the next day betimes, and the Boy was with him until night; after which his house he saith was not for some time molested with evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>Thus far is the Relation concerning the <hi>Daemon</hi> at <hi>William Morse</hi> his House in <hi>Newbery.</hi> The true Reason of these strange disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is as yet not certainly known: some (as has been hinted) did suspect <hi>Morse</hi>'s Wife to be guilty of Witchcraft.</p>
               <p>One of the Neighbours took Apples which were brought out of that house and put them into the fire; upon which they say, their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were much disturbed. Another of the Neighbours, caused an Horse-shoe to be nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the doors, &amp; as long as it remained so, they could not perswade the suspected person to go into the house; but when the Horse-shoe was gone, she presently visited them. I shall not here inlarge upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and superstition of those Experiments, reserving that for another place: All that I shall say at present is, that the <hi>Daemons</hi> whom the blind Gentiles of old worshipped, told their Servants, that such things as these would very much affect them; yea, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

render their power ineffectual; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they would become subject, when their own directions were obeyed. It is sport to the Devils when they see silly Men thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded and made fools of by them.

Or it may be some other thing as yet kept hid in the secrets of providence might be the true origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of all this Trouble.</p>
               <p>A Disturbance not much unlike to this hapned above twenty years ago, at an house in <hi>Tedworth,</hi> in the County of <hi>Wilts</hi> in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> which was by wise men judged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Conjuration.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Mr. <hi>Mompesson</hi> of <hi>Tedworth</hi> being in <hi>March</hi> 1661. at <hi>Lungershall,</hi> and hearing a Drum beat there, he demanded of the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff of the Town what it meant, who told him, they had for some dayes been troubled with an idle Drummer, pretending Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and a Pass under the hands of some Gentlemen. Mr. <hi>Mompesson</hi> reading his Pass, and knowing the hands of those Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, whose Names were pretended to be subscribed, discovered the Cheat, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Vagrant to put off his Drum, and ordered a Constable to secure him: but not long after he got clear of the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:000373_0177_0FA55BB379347C48"/>
In <hi>April</hi> following, Mr. <hi>Momposson'</hi>s house was much disturbed with Knockings, and with Drummings; for an hour toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Daemon</hi> would beat <hi>Round-heads and Cuckolds,</hi> the <hi>Tattoo</hi> and several other points of War as well as any Drummer. On <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 5. The <hi>Daemon</hi> made a great noise in the House, and caused some Boards there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to move to and fro in the day time when there was an whole room full of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple present. At his departure, he left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him a Sulphurous smell, which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry offensive. The next night, Chairs wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked up and down the Room; the Childrens Shoes were hurled over their heads. The Minister of the Town being the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, a Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staff was thrown at him; and hit him on the Leg, but without the least hurt. In the latter end of <hi>December,</hi> 1662. They heard a noise like the jingling of Money, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of which was thought to be, some words spoken the night before, by one in the Family; who said that <hi>Faires</hi> used to leave money behind them, and they wished it might be so now. In <hi>January</hi> Lights were seen in the House, which seemed blue and glimmering, and caused a great stiffness in the eyes of them that saw them. One in the room (by what Authority I cannot tell) said, <hi>Satan,</hi> if the Drummer set thee a work
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:000373_0178_0FA55BB448F41570"/>
give three knocks and no more, which was done accordingly. Once when it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sharp severe Weather, the room was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly filled with a Noisome smell, and was very hot though without fire. This <hi>Daemon</hi> would play some nasty and many ludicrous foolish tricks. It would empty Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots into the Beds; and fill Porringers with Ashes. Sometimes it would not suffer any light to be in the room, but would carry them away up the Chimney. Mr. <hi>Mompes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> coming one morning into his Stable, found his Horse on the ground, having one of his hinder legs in his mouth, and so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened there, that it was difficult for several men with a Leaver to get it out. A Smith lodging in the House, heard a noise in the room, as if one had been shoeing an Horse, and somewhat come as it were with a Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers snipping at the Smith's Nose, most part of the night. The Drummer was under ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement suspicion for a Conjurer. He was condemned to Transportation. All the time of his restraint and absence, the House was quiet. See Mr. <hi>Glanvil's</hi> Collection of <hi>Modern Relations,</hi> P.71.<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But I proceed to give an account of some other things lately hapning in <hi>New-England,</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="unknown:000373_0179_0FA55BB52B6803C8"/>
which were undoubtedly praeternatural, and not without Diabolical operation. The last year did afford several Instances, not unlike unto those which have been mentioned. For then <hi>Nicholas Desborough</hi> of <hi>Hartford</hi> in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England,</hi> was strangely molested by stones, pieces of earth, cobs of Indian Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> falling upon and about him, which sometimes came in through the door, sometimes through the Window, sometimes down the Chimney, at other times they seemed to fall from the floor of the Chamber, which yet was very close; sometimes he met with them in his Shop, the Yard, the Barn, and in the Field at work. In the House, such things hapned frequently, not only in the night but in the day time, if the Man himself was at home, but never when his Wife was at home alone. There was no great violence in the motion, though several persons of the Family, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers also were struck with the things that were thrown by an invisible hand, yet they were not hurt thereby. Only the Man himself had once his Arm somewhat pained by a blow given him; and at another time, blood was drawn from one of his Legs by a scratch gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it. This molestation began soon after a Controversie arose between <hi>Desborough</hi> and another person, about a Chest of Clothes
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:000373_0180_0FA55BB826EE1080"/>
which the other said that <hi>Desoerough</hi> did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteously retain: and so it continued for some Moneths (though with several inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions.) In the latter end of the last year, when also the Man's Barn was burned with the Corn in it; but by what means it came to pass is not known. Not long after, some to whom the matter was referred, ordered <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> to restore the Clothes to the Person who complained of wrong; since which he hath not been troubled as before. Some of the stones hurled were of considerable bigness; one of them weighed four pounds, but generally the stones were not great, but very small ones. One time a piece of Clay came down the Chimney, falling on the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which stood at some distance from the Chimney. The People of the House threw it on the Hearth, whereit lay a considerable time: they went to their Supper, and whilest at their Supper, the piece of Clay was lifted up by an invisible hand, and fell upon the Table; taking it up, they found it hot, having lain so long before the fire, as to cause it to be hot.</p>
               <p>Another Providence no less Remarkable than this last mentioned, hapned at <hi>Portsmouth</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> about the same time: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

                  <q>On <hi>June</hi> 11. 1682. Being the Lords Day, at night showers of stones were thrown both against the sides and roof of the house of <hi>George Walton:</hi> some of the People went abroad, found the Gate at some distance from the house, wrung off the Hinges, and stones came thick about them: sometimes falling down by them, sometimes touching them without any hurt done to them though they seemed to come with great force, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Glass-Windows shattered to pieces by stones that seemed to come not from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out but within; the Lead of the Glass Casements, Window-Bars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forcibly outwards, and so standing bent. While the Secretary was walking in the room a great Hammer came brushing along against the Chamber floor that was over his head, and fell down by him. A Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick beaten off the Table. They took up nine of the stones and marked them, and laid them on the Table, some of them being as hot as if they came out of the fire; but some of those mark't stones were found flying about again. In this manner, about

four hours space that night: The Secretary then went to bed, but a stone came and broke up his Chamber-door, being put to (not lockt) a Brick was sent upon the like Errand. The abovesaid Stone the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lockt up in his Chamber, but it was fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out, and carried with great noise into the next Chamber. The Spit was carried up Chimney, and came down with the point forward, and stuck in the Back-log, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed by one of the Company to one side of the Chimney, was by an unseen hand thrown out at Window. This trade was driven on the next day, and so from Day to Day, now and then there would be some intermission, and then to it again. The stones were most frequent where the Master of the house was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Field or Barn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A black Cat was seen once while the Stones came, and was shot at, but she was too nimble for them. Some of the Family say, that they once saw the appearance of an hand put forth at the Hall Window, throwing stones towards the Entry, though there was no body in the Hall the while: sometimes a dismal hollow whistling would be heard; sometimes the noise of the trotting of an horse, and snorting, but nothing seen. The

Man went up the great Bay in his Boat to a Farm he had there, and while haling Wood or Timber to the Boat he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed by the Stones as before at home. He carried a stirrup iron from the house down to the Boat, and there left it; but while he was going up to the house, the iron came jingling after him through the Woods, and returned to the house, and so again, and at last went away, and was heard of on more. Their Anchor leapt over-board several times as they were going home and stopt the boat. A Cheese hath been taken out of the Press and crumbled all over the floor. A piece of Iron with which they weighed up the Cheese-press stuck into the Wall, and a Kittle hung up thereon.

About two hours after, a Frying-pan then hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Chimney was heard to ring so loud, that not only those in the house heard it, but others also that lived on the other side of the River near an hundred Rods distant or more.

caused a Swelling and much soreness on her head, being then in the yard by her house, and she presently entring into her house was bitten on both Arms black and blue, and one of her Breasts scratched; the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Teeth being like Mans Teeth, were plainly seen by many: Whereupon deserting their House to sojourn at a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours on the other side of the River, there appeared to said <hi>Mary</hi> in the house of her sojourning, a Woman clothed with a green Safeguard, a short blue Cloak, and a white Cap, making a profer to strike her with a Fire-brand, but struck her not. The Day following the same shape appeared again to her, but now arrayed with a gray Gown, white Apron, and white Head-clothes, in appearance laughing several times, but no voice heard.

               </argument>
               <p>THe <hi>Sadduces</hi> of those dayes being like unto <hi>Avicenna,</hi> and <hi>Averroes,</hi> and other Atheistical Philosophers in former times; say that there are no Spirits, and that all Stories concerning them are either Fabulous or to be ascribed unto natural causes.

<pb n="169" facs="unknown:000373_0189_0FA55BC1B6E204B0"/>
(if the Scriptures were silent) make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest beyond all contradiction, that there are Devils infesting this lower World. Most true it is, that Satan and all his wicked An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are limited by the providence of God: so as that they cannot hurt any Man or Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, much less any Servant of his, without a Commission from him, whose Kingdom is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all. It is a memorable Passage, which <hi>Chytraeus</hi> relateth concerning <hi>Luther,</hi> that when he was sought after by his Popish and Implacable Enemies (being then hid by the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi>) they consulted with Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians that so they might find where <hi>Luther</hi> absconded, but the Wizzards confessed they could not discover him. Undoubtedly the Devils knew where <hi>Luther</hi> hid himself; only God would not suffer them to reveal it. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, the Lord doth for wise and holy ends, sometimes lengthen the Chain which the infernal L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ons are bound fast in. And as there are many tremendous Instances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Truth hereof, so that of Satan's taking bodily possession of Men, is none of the least. Sometimes indeed it is very hard to discern between natural Diseases and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical Possessions; so as that persons really possessed have been thought to be only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested with some natural Disease, without any
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:000373_0190_0FA55BC271552E50"/>
special finger of the Evil Spirit therein. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius (de abditis rerum causis,</hi> Lib.2. Cap.16.) speaketh of a certain young Gentleman, that was taken with strange Convulsions, which did surprize him at least ten times in a day. In his Fits he had the use of his Speech and Reason free. Otherwise his Disease would have been judged no other than an ordinary <hi>Epilepsy.</hi> Much means was used by skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Physitians for his relief, but without success for three Moneths together; when all on a sudden, a <hi>Daemon</hi> began to speak out of the miserable Patient; and that with not only Latin but Greek Sentences, which the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted party himself had no knowledge of; and the <hi>Daemon</hi> discovered many secrets both of the Physitians and of other persons that attended, deriding them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> their vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to cure a Man whom he had the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of. There are sundry Authors (in special <hi>Balduinus</hi> in his Cases of Conscience, and <hi>Darrel</hi> in his History of the seven posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed persons in <hi>Lancashire</hi>) who have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to describe and characterise possessed persons. And such particulars as these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing are by them mentioned as signs of Possession.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the party concerned shall reveal secret things, either past or future, which without

               <p n="6">6. When the Belly is on a sudden puft up, and instantly flat again.</p>
               <p>These are thought to be certain Arguments of an <hi>Energumenical</hi> person. Some other signs are mentioned by <hi>Thyraeus (de obsessis</hi> Part 2. Cap.25,26.)</p>
               <p>There are who conceive (and that as they suppose upon Scripture grounds:) that Men may possibly be <hi>Daemoniacal,</hi> when none of those mentioned particulars can be affirmed of them. The Excellently learned and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> is of Opinion, that the <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montacks</hi> whom we read so frequently of in the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> were the same with <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepticks, Lunaticks,</hi> and <hi>Mad Men.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> at this day have their <hi>Mad men</hi> in great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,

supposing them to be acted by a spirit, but they (in that being themselves mad) take it to be a good when as 'tis an evil spirit that does operate in such persons. And that the <hi>Jews</hi> of old did look upon <hi>Maniacks</hi> to be possessed with an evil Spirit, is evident from that expression of theirs, <hi>Joh.</hi>10.20. <hi>He hath a Devil and is Mad.</hi> Moreover, we read of one, <hi>Mat.</hi>17.15. <hi>that was Lunatick, and did oft fall into the fire, and oft into the water.</hi> No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that this <hi>Lunatick</hi> person was a <hi>Daemoniack</hi> is clear from <hi>ver.</hi>18. where tis said, that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus rebuked the Devil and he departed out of him.</hi> And of the same person tis said, in <hi>Luk.</hi>9.39. <hi>A Spirit taketh him and teareth him.</hi> So <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Heinsius,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi>8.16. &amp; 17. 15. It has been commonly said that in Christs time more persons were possessed with evil Spirits than ever was known before or since; but if that were so, the <hi>Jews,</hi> and probably some <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> would have noted it as a thing strange and extraordinary; whenas we read of no such observation to be made on those times. And saith Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> (in his Discourse on <hi>John</hi> 10.20.) <hi>If those possessed Persons were not such as we now adayes conceive to be no other than Mad men, the World must be supposed to be well rid of Devils, which for my part I believe it is not.</hi> There is in special, a sort of Melancholy
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:000373_0193_0FA55BC8B55CE380"/>
madness, which is called <hi>Lycantbropia,</hi> or <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina Insania,</hi> h. e. When Men imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be turned into Wolves or other Beasts. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> relates concerning the Daughters of King <hi>Praetus,</hi> that they thought themselves Kine. <hi>Wierus (de praestigiis Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monum,</hi> L.3.C.21.) speaketh of one in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua,</hi> that would not believe to the contrary but that he was a Wolf: and of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who thought himself a Bear. <hi>Euwichius</hi> (and from him <hi>Horestus</hi>) writeth of a Man that was found in a Barn under the Hay, howling and saying he was a Wolf. The foolish Rusticks, who surprized him, began to flay him, that so they might see if he had not hair growing on the inside of his skin. <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restus</hi> has many instances to this purpose. <hi>Heurnius</hi> saith, that it is a Disease frequent in <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Hungaria.</hi> No doubt but this Disease gave occasion to <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Assertion, that some Men in his time were turned into Wolves, and from Wolves into Men again. Hence was <hi>Ovid</hi>'s Fable of <hi>Lycaon,</hi> and the Tale of <hi>Pausanias,</hi> being ten years a Wolf, and then a Man again. He that would see more instances, may read <hi>Austin de civ.

In the night, barking and howling at Gravel and in Desarts. We may suppose that <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> was troubled with this Disease. And that such persons are molested with a <hi>Daemon</hi> is evident from <hi>Luk</hi> 8.27. with <hi>Mark.</hi>5. 3,4. The possessed person there spoken of was <hi>Lycanthropos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are that acknowledge the existence of Spirits, and that the Bodies of men are sometimes really possessed thereby; who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless will not believe there are any such woful creatures <hi>in rerum naturd,</hi> as Witches, or persons confoederate with the Devil. I have read of a famous Wizard, whose Name was <hi>William de Lure,</hi> that after he had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured much in opposing their Opinion, who think that there are Men on Earth joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an explicit confoederacy with the fiends of Hell, was himself convicted and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for that crime which he designed to make the World believe that no Man was or could be guilty of. I shall not suspect all those as guilty of Witchcraft, nor yet of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, who call the received Opinion, about Witches into question. There are four or five <hi>English</hi> Writers, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> Mr. <hi>Scot, Ady,</hi> and of late <hi>Wagstaff</hi> and <hi>Webster,</hi> and another Anonymous Author; who do with great

vehemence affirm that never any did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that familiarity with the evil Spirits, which is commonly believed. <hi>Wierus</hi> (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a judicious Author) conceiveth that all those things supposed to be done by Witches are done by the evil Spirits themselves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any confoederates. But he is sufficiently refuted by <hi>Binsfieldius, Bodinus, Sennertus,</hi> and others. True it is, that many things have been looked upon as proceding from Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, when it has not been so. The Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathies and Antipathies of Nature have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been esteemed the effects of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft. A Sympathetical Powder, made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Magical Ceremonies has done strange things, so as that the Artist which used it, has upon that account been suspected of Witchcraft. A Man may easily by such natural Magick, as is described by <hi>Porta,</hi> and by <hi>Weckerus de secretis</hi> make the ignorant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he is a Wizard. It is also true, that the World is full of Fabulous Stories concerning some kind of Familiarities with the Devil, and things done by his help, which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of Creatures to accomplish. What Fables are there concerning <hi>Incubt</hi> and <hi>Succubae</hi> and of Men begotten by <hi>Daemons?</hi> No doubt but the Devil may delude the fancy that one of his Vassals shall think (as the

as to make them believe that they are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted into Beasts. <hi>Sennertus</hi> (in <hi>Pract.

The Story is this;</p>
               <p>A certain Woman, being in Prison on suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion for Witchcraft; pretending to be able to turn her self into a Wolf, the Magistrate before whom she was brought promised her, that she should not be put to death, in case she would then in his presence so transform her self. Which she readily consented unto. Accordingly she anointed her head, neck and arm-pits; immediately upon which she fell into a most profound sleep, for three hours; after which she suddenly rose up, declaring that she had been turned into a Wolf, and been at a place some miles distant, and there killed first a Sheep, and then a Cow; the Magistrate, presently sent to the place; and sound that first a sheep and then a Cow had there been killed. <hi>Wierus</hi> and <hi>Baptista Porta</hi> have divers Stories to the same purpose. It is then evident, that the Devil himself did that mischief, and in the mean time the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches who were cast into so profound a sleep by him, as that they could not by any noises

or blows be awakened, has their Phansies imposed upon by Dreams and Delusions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pleasure of their Master Satan. It must moreover, be sadly confessed, that many innocent persons have been put to death under the notion of Witch-craft, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much innocent blood hath been shed. Especially it hath been so in Popish times and places. Superstitious and Magical wayes of trying Witches have been a bloody cause of those Murders. Sometimes Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have been tried for Witch-craft by hot, sometimes by cold water (of which more in the eighth Chapter of this Essay) sometimes by pricking them; sometimes by sticking Awls under their Seats, sometimes by their ability, or otherwise to repeat the <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi>

The Author of the Advertisement to Mr. <hi>Glanvil's</hi> Relations (<hi>P.</hi>171.) saith that his curiosity led him to examine certain Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches at the Castle in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and that the most notorious Witch of them all pleaded that she was no Witch, because she was able to say the <hi>Lords Prayer and the Creed,</hi> and though she was out in repeating the <hi>Creed,</hi> she said the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> right.

               <p n="1">1. The Argument by many insisted on from the Scripture is irrefragable. Therein Witch-crafts are forbidden. And we often read in the Scripture of Metaphorical Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witchings, <hi>Noehum</hi> 3.4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. which Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes are undoubtedly taken from things that have a real existence <hi>in rerum nature.</hi> Yea, the Scripture makes particular mention of many that used those cursed Arts and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarities
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:000373_0201_0FA55BD3AF9FECD0"/>
with the Devil, <hi>e. g. Jannes,</hi> and <hi>Jambres, Balaam, Manasseh, Simon, Elymas.</hi> Nor is the Relation which the Scripture gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth of <hi>the Witch of Endor,</hi> and the reasons from thence deduced, to prove the being of Witches, sufficiently confuted by any of our late Witch-Advocate. Though (as one speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) some men to elude the Argument from that instance, <hi>play more Hocus-Pocus tricks in the Explication of that passage than the Witch her self did in the raising deceased Samuel.</hi> It is a poor evasion in those who think to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape the dint of this Argument, by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Witches and Familiar Spirits spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the Scripture, were only <hi>Juglers,</hi> or men that by <hi>Legerdemain</hi> would do strange feats of activity. The Divine Law requires that such Witches should be cut off by the Sword of Justice; which may not be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of every one that shall without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foederacy with the Devil play tricks of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerdemain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Experience has too often made it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that there are such in the World as hold a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In a word, it is a thing known, that there have been Men who would discourse in Languages, and reason no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably about Sciences which they never learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; who have revealed Secrets, discovered hidden Treasures, told whither stolen Goods have been conveyed, and by whom; and that have caused Bruit Creatures, nay Statues or Images to speak, and give rational Answers.

so that he revealed the secret transactions which had passed betwixt himself and the Devil. He would sometimes, with hideous roarings tell those that came to visit him, that now he knew that there was a God and a Devil, and an Heaven, and an Hell. So did he die a miserable spectacle of the righteous and fearful judgement of God. And every Age does produce new Examples of those that have by their own confession made the like cursed Covenants with the Prince of Darkness.</p>

Such an Image with pins in it, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally found in the Witches Houses; and upon the removal of it, the pins being taken out,

Sir <hi>George</hi> had immediate ease, and recovered his health.</p>
               <p>There is lately published (by Dr. <hi>Horneck</hi>) the History of the Witches in <hi>Sweden,</hi> by whose means that Kingdom was fearfully pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued: upon Examination they confessed their crime, &amp; were executed in the year 1670.</p>
               <p>And no longer since than the last year, <abbr>

                  </abbr> on <hi>Aug.</hi>25. 1682. three women who were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted at <hi>Exon</hi> in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> all of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that they had had converses and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities with the Devil.</p>
               <p>But the Instance of the Witch Executed in <hi>Hartford,</hi> here in <hi>New-England</hi> (of which the preceding Chapter giveth an account) considering the circumstances of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, is as convictive a proof as most single examples that I have met with. It is a vain thing, for the Patrons of Witches to think that they can <hi>Sham</hi> off this Argument, by suggesting that these Confessions did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the deluded imaginations of Mad and Melancholly persons. Some of them were as free from distemperature in their Brains, as their Neighbours. That divers Executed for Witches have acknowledged things against themselves which were never so, I neither doubt or deny. And that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Phansie may cause persons verily to

think they have seen and done these things which never had any Existence, except in their own Imaginations is indisputable. I fully concur with a passage which I find, in Worthy Dr. <hi>Owen's</hi> late excellent Discourse about the work of the Spirit in Prayer (<hi>Page</hi> 202.) where he has these words: <hi>We find by experience that some have had their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions so fixed on things evil and noxious by sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Delusions, that they have confessed against themselves things and crimes that have rendred them obnoxious to Capital Punishment, whereof they were never really and actually guilty.</hi> This not withstanding, that Persons whose Judgement and Reason has been free from disturbance by any Disease, should not only voluntarily acknowledge their being in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Familiarities with Satan, but mention the particular circumstances of those Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and give ocular demonstration of the truth of what they say, by discovering the <hi>Stigmata</hi> made upon their bodies, by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils hand: and that when more than one or two have been examined apart, they should agree in the circumstances of their Relations, and yet that all this should be the meer effect of Melancholly or Phrensie, cannot without offering violence to Reason and common Sense be Imagined. And as there are Witches
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:000373_0208_0FA55BDC7933DC20"/>
so many times they are the causes of those strange disturbances which are in houses haunted by Evil Spirits, such as those menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the former Chapter. Instances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this may be seen in Mr. <hi>Glanvils Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,</hi> together with the continuation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; published the last year by the Learned Dr. <hi>Henry More.</hi> Sometimes providence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the Devil himself (without the use of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments) to molest the houses of some as a punishment for sin committed. Most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly either for the sin of Murder. <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes that the House of <hi>Pusanias</hi> was haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an evil spirit after he had Murdered his Wife. Many like Instances have been reported and recorded by credible Authors. Or else for the sin of Theft. As for <hi>Walton</hi> the Quaker of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> whose House has been so strangely troubled, he suspects that one of his Neighbours has caused it by witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, she (being a Widow-woman) chargeth him with injustice in detaining some Land from her. It is none of my work to reflect upon the Man, nor will I do it; only if there be any late or old guilt upon his Conscience it concerns him by Confession and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to give Glory to that God, who is able in strange wayes to discover the sins of Men.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1659. There was at <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> an amazing Providence, containing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny strange passages. A wonderful hand of God, by what Instrument or Instruments soever: which was, a fire strangely kindled, which burnt down a Mans house, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards kindled in another, to which the mans Goods were carried, and to which, himself, and his Wife, and his Servant Girl were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and several things were thrown by an invisible hand, powerfully convincing, and thereby discovering the Hypocrifie and Theft of the Man, and for a warning to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to take heed of the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>November</hi> 7. In the Evening. The fire first kindled in this Man's Milk-house, and <hi>November</hi> 9. there was dust thrown upon this Man and his Wife, as they lay in Bed together, and there was knocking several

times and the same morning divers things were thrown about, and the Fire again kindled in the Milk-house, which was yet put out by the Woman her self; then it kindled in the Eves of the house, in the Thatch, which was put out by a Man which was their next Neighbour. That night as the Man had a pot of Beer in his hand, a stone fell into the Pot: then did he set down the pot upon the Table. When some Men came to be with them that night, they were speaking how convenient it would be to have a Tub filled with Water, to stand ready, in case they should have occasion to use it, and as they were going out of the door to prepare it, the fire again kindled in the Milk-house, and suddenly the whole house was on fire, but most of the Goods and Houshold-stuff were carried out and preserved: The fire was a strange fire, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry white, and not singing their hands when they pulled the things out of it.</p>
                  <p>The next day the Houshold-stuff was carried to another house, wherein was a Family: but those were to be in one end of the House, and the other, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end. But before the Man and his Wife went to Bed, there was dust thrown upon them, which so troubled them, that
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:000373_0211_0FA55BDE31D118F8"/>
the Man having another Man with them, and a Candle and Lanthorn in his hand, came up to me (saith my Author) who was in Bed, and asleep, but when I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, I heard him say, <hi>The hand of God still pursues me,</hi> and so he intreated me to go down with him, and accordingly I and my Brother went down, where we found them in the house, greatly troubled by reason of things that were thrown about, and some things were thrown presently after we came in. Hereupon we went to Prayer, and as I was kneeling down, dust was thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, but afterwards all was quiet, so long as we were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Prayer. When we arose from Prayer, I applied my self to the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a portion of Scripture, which was <hi>Psal.</hi>91. The Man standing by me, and holding the Candle, but presently some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing did beat out the Light; whereupon the Man said, <hi>That some body else must hold it.</hi> Presently a Knife was thrown at me, which fell behind me; my Brother said, he saw it come. Then a chopping Knife was thrown (I think at the Man's Wife) whereupon the Man said, <hi>Things are thrown at others for my sake.</hi> At length he fell upon his knees, and confessed that he had been an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erite, and a Pilfering Fellow, and that he

The Man's Wife who lived in the house, usually took up the things thus thrown; yet still in time of Prayer, all was quiet. In the morning after I had prayed (before which Prayer I was hit with a Dish) my Brother and I came away, and as we were coming
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:000373_0213_0FA55BE416490848"/>
near home, we turned aside to speak with a Friend, but before we got home, we heard that the house was on fire: hereupon they sent for me again, and in the mean time, they carried out their Goods, pulled off the Thatch, and quenched the fire; yet (<hi>as I beard</hi>) it kindled again, and again, till all the Man's Goods were carried out: and when these People whose House was burnt down to the ground, together with all their Goods, were removed into the Field, all was quiet in this second house; But some things were thrown in the Field; and in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, when another Minister and I went to them, some assured us that some things had been thrown. This was <hi>November</hi> II. the night following some noise was heard among the Houshold-stuff, as was testified to me.</p>
                  <p>Thus these poor Creatures were distressed, their House was burned down, that to which they were removed several times fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so that neither they nor their Goods might stay any longer there, nor durst any other receive them: but they, with their Goods were forced to lie in the open Field for divers dayes and nights together; being made a sad spectacle to all sorts of people that came far and near, to see and hear of

The Sermons were upon these Texts, <hi>Joh</hi> 11. 13. <hi>If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands towards him: if Iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy Tabernacles: For then shalt thou lift up thy Face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not be afraid;</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City, and the People not be afraid? shall there be evil in a City and the LORD hath not done it?</hi> Luk. 13. 2, 3. <hi>&amp;c. suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileans, because they suffered such things?

                  <q>The distressed persons attended diligently, and a great Congregation was assembled. These providential dispensations were not ordinary; yet there was a seeming blur cast, though not on the whole yet upon some part of it; for their Servant Girl was at last found throwing some things: and she afterwards confessed that an old Woman came to her, <hi>November</hi> 7. a little before these things come to pass, and told her that her Master and Dame were bewitched, and that they should hear a great fluttering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their house for the space of two dayes; she said also, that the old Woman told her, that she must hurl things at her Master and Dame, and withal bad her not to tell, for if she did the Devil would have her: and she confessed that she hurled the Fire-brand, an Hammer, and an iron Tack; and said; that she did it because the old Woman bad her, and said to her, that if she hurled things about the House, it would be the better. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

quite burned down: and another house to whom they removed, greatly molested, and at length fired. Besides the efficacy of Prayer is most observable, for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the Duty, and God's Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Omnipotent providence wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully magnified, thus to discover the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie and Theft of the Man, and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, graciously and mercifully delivering them.

Nevertheless, that Spirits have sometimes really (as well as ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarily) appeared to Mortals in the World,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:000373_0223_0FA55BEF79FE7368"/>
is amongst sober Men beyond contrioversie. And that such things were of old taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, we may rationally conclude from that Scripture, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 37. where it is said, that the Disciples <hi>were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a Spirit.</hi> It is observable, that such frightful <hi>Spectres</hi> do most frequently shew themselves in places where the light of the Gospel hath not prevailed. Some have propounded it as a question wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the inquiring into; What should be the reason that <hi>Daemons</hi> did ordinarily infest the Gentiles of old, as also the East and West <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> of later times, and that Popish Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are still commonly and grievously mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested by them; but in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in the <hi>united Provinces,</hi> and in all Lands where the Reformed Religion hath taken place, such things are more rare. <hi>Popish Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> do acknowledge that as to matter of fact it is really thus; and the reason which some of them assign for it, is, that the Devils are so sure of their Interest in <hi>Heretical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as that they pass over them, and come &amp; molest <hi>Papists,</hi> whom they are most afraid of losing. But they should rather have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed it to the Light of the Gospel, and the power of Christ going along therewith. <hi>Justin Martyr, Tertullian,</hi> and others observe
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:000373_0224_0FA55BF045A6E640"/>
that upon the first promulgation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, those Diabolical Oracles, whereby Satan had miserably deceived the Nations, were si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced; in which respect the Word of Christ <hi>Luk.</hi>10.17. was wonderfully fulfilled. The like may be said as to <hi>Protestant</hi> being less im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon then <hi>Popish</hi> Nations, by deceitful <hi>Daemons.</hi> It is moreover, sometimes very difficult to pass a true judgement of the <hi>Spectres</hi> which do appear, whether they are good or evil Angels, or the Spirits of decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed men. That Holy Angels were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seen in old times, we are from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of truth assured. And that the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical ministration doth still continue is past doubt, <hi>Heb.</hi>1.14. But their visible appearance is less frequent than formerly. They do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visibly perform many a good Office for the Heirs of Salvation continually. Nor is it to be questioned, but they may still appear visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, when the work which they are sent about cannot otherwise be performed. I would not reject as fabulous all those passages which are related by Judicious Authors referring to this subject.</p>
               <p>At a time when <hi>Grynaeus, Melancthon,</hi> and several other learned Men were discoursing together at an House in <hi>Spyres,</hi> there came a Man of very grave and godly countenance
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:000373_0225_0FA55BF0F5875A98"/>
into the House, desiring to speak with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon;</hi> who going forth to him, he told him that within one hour some Officers would be at that house to apprehend <hi>Grynaeus,</hi> and therefore required <hi>Melancthon</hi> to advise <hi>Grynaeus</hi> to flee out of that City; and having so spoken, he vanished out of sight. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> returning into the room, recounted the words of this strange Monitor; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Grynaeus</hi> instantly departed; and he had no sooner Boated himself upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but Officers came to lay hold of him. This Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is mentioned by <hi>Melancthon</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon <hi>Daniel.</hi> And he concludeth that the Man who had appeared to him was indeed an Angel, sent in order to <hi>Grynaeus</hi> his being delivered from the bloody hands of them that sought his life. Many Instances like to this I could mention. But I shall only take notice of a strange providence which came to pass of late years; the particulars whereof are known to some who I suppose may be still living.</p>
               <p>I find the History of the matter I intend in Mr. <hi>Clark'</hi>s Examples, <hi>Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>Page</hi> 18, 19. It is in brief as followeth;</p>
               <p>One <hi>Samuel Wallas</hi> of <hi>Stamford</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> having been in a Consumption for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, was worn away to a very skeleton
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:000373_0226_0FA55BF1AF577608"/>
and lay bed-rid for four years. But <hi>April</hi> 9. 1659. being the Lords Day, about 6 <hi>h. P.M.</hi> Finding himself somewhat revived, he got out of the Bed, and as he was reading a Book Entituled, <hi>Abraham's suit for Sodom,</hi> he heard some body knock at the Door. Whereupon (there being none then in the house but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) he took a staff in the one hand, and leaning to the wall with the other, came to the door, and opening it, a comely and grave old Man of a fresh complexion, with white curled Hair, entred; and after walking seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times about the room, said to him, <hi>Friend, I perceive you are not well.</hi> To whom <hi>Wallas</hi> replied, he had been ill many years, and that the Doctors said his Disease was a Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and past cure, and that he was a poor Man, and not able to follow their costly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, only he committed himself and life into the hands of God, to dispose of as he pleased. To whom the Man replied, <hi>Thou sayest very well, be sure to fear God, and serve him; and remember to observe what now I say to thee;</hi> Tomorrow morning go into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and there take two leaves of red Sage, and one of Blood-wort; and put those three Leaves into a cup of small Beer, and drink thereof as oft as need requires; the fourth Morning cast away those Leaves, and put in
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:000373_0227_0FA55BF4CA3CCDC8"/>
fresh ones, thus do for twelve dayes together; and thou shalt find e're these twelve dayes be expired, through the help of God thy Disease will be cured, and the frame of thy body al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. Also he told him that after his strength was somewhat recovered, he should change the Air, and go three or four Miles off; and that within a Moneth he should find that the Clothes which he had on his Back would then be too strait for him: Having spoken these things, he again charged <hi>Samuel Wallas</hi> to remember the Directions given to him, but above all things to fear God, and serve him. <hi>Wallas</hi> asked him, if he would eat any thing? unto whom he answered, <hi>No Friend,</hi> the Lord Christ is sufficient for me. Seldom do I drink any thing but what cometh from the Rock. So wishing the Lord of Heaven to be with him, he departed. <hi>Samuel Wallas</hi> saw him go out of the door, and went to shut the door after him, at which he returned half way into the Entry again, saying Friend, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what I have said to you, and do it, but above all fear God, and serve him. Wallas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Man passing in the Street, but none else observed him, though some were then standing in the doors opposite to <hi>Wallas</hi> his House. And although it Rained when this Grave Person came into the House, and had
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:000373_0228_0FA55BF627E89168"/>
done so all that day, yet he had not one space of wet or dirt upon him. <hi>Wallas</hi> followed the Directions prescribed, and was restored to his Health within the dayes mentioned. The Fame of this strange Providence being noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed abroad, sundry Ministers met at <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> to consider and consult about it, who concluded that this cure was wrought by a good Angel, sent from Heaven upon that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. However it is not impossible, but that Holy Angels may appear, and visibly converse with some. Yet for any to desire such a thing is unwarrantable, and exceeding dangerous. For thereby some have been imposed upon by wicked <hi>Daemons,</hi> who know how to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselves into Angels of Light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bodinus</hi> hath a strange Relation of a Man that prayed much for the assistance of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; and after that for above thirty years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he thought his prayer was heard; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often admonished of his Errors by a Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Monitor, as he apprehended, who once appeared visibly in the form of a Child; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhile in an orb of Light. Would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times speak to him when he saw nothing. Yet some fear that this Spirit which he took to be his good <hi>Genius</hi> was a subtle <hi>Cacodaemon. Plato</hi> writeth concerning <hi>Socrates,</hi> that he had a good <hi>Genius</hi> attending him, which

                  <hi>Remigius</hi> (and from him others) write of a young Man whose Name was <hi>Theodore Maillot,</hi> unto whom a <hi>Daemon</hi> appearing, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised him to reform his life, to abstain from Drunkenness, Therts, Uncleanness, and the like evils; and to Fast twice a Week, to be constant in attendance upon publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and to be very charitable to the Poor.</p>
               <p>The like pious Advice did another <hi>Daemon</hi> follow a certain Woman with, unto whom he

appeared. Could a good Angel have given better Counsel? but this was Satans policy, hoping that thereby he should have gained an advantage to take silly Souls alive in his cruel Snare. Like as Thieves upon the Road will sometimes enter into Religious Discourse, that so their fellow-Travellers may have good thoughts of them, and be the more easily dispoyled by them. And as the evil Spirit will speak good Words, so doth he sometimes appear in the likeness of good Men, to the end that he may the more effectually deceive and delude all such as shall be so unhappy as to entertain converses with him. No doubt but that he knows how to transform himself into the shape of not only an ordinary Saint, but of an Apostle, or holy Prophet of God, 2<hi> Cor.</hi>11.13,14. This we may gather from the sacred History of dead <hi>Samuel'</hi>s appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Saul.</hi> Some are of Opinion that real <hi>Samuel</hi> spake to <hi>Saul,</hi> his Soul being by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical incantations returned into his Body, so divers of the Fathers and School-men; also <hi>Mendoza, Delrio,</hi> and other Popish Authors. Of late M. <hi>Glanvil</hi> and Dr. <hi>Windet,</hi> do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part favour that notion. But <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Quest.</hi> and <hi>Respons.</hi> which pass under the Name of <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> are of the judgement, that a lying <hi>Daemon</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:000373_0231_0FA55BF7B98E5060"/>
to <hi>Saul</hi> in <hi>Samuel's </hi> likeness. Our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Divines generally are of this judgement. It was customary amongst the Gentiles for Magicians and <hi>Necromancers</hi> to cause dead persons to appear, and they would bring whomsoever they were desired to call for. Thus did a Wizard by <hi>Pompeys</hi> command, call a dead Souldier, of whom he enquired of the event of the <hi>Pharsalic War,</hi> vide <hi>Lucan Lib.</hi>6. Many Examples to this purpose, are Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Histories of former times; and mentioned by the old Poets. Those <hi>Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> were <hi>Cacodaemons,</hi> which feigned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be the Spirits of Men departed. I see no cogent reason why we should not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the like with respect unto <hi>Samuel</hi>'s ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing unto <hi>Saul.</hi> Most certain it is, that the Souls of holy Men departed, are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of Devils, much less of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians to bring them hither when they please. As for those that are gone into the other World, there is a Gulf fixed, that if men would they cannot pass into this World again without leave, <hi>Luk.</hi>16.26. If <hi>Dives</hi> could not bring <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Soul out of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, how the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Soul from thence I know not. <hi>Lyra</hi> (and from him others) pretends that God then interposed and sent real <hi>Samuel</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="unknown:000373_0232_0FA55BF875ECE2C8"/>
as he unexpectedly appeared to <hi>Baalam,</hi> when imployed about his Magical impostures. But I dare not believe that the Holy God, or the true <hi>Samuel</hi> would seem so far to countenance <hi>Necromancie</hi> or <hi>Psycomancy</hi> as this would be, should the Soul of <hi>Samuel</hi> really return into the World, when a Witch called for him, <hi>Saul</hi> desiring that it might be so. This Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion establisheth <hi>Necromancy,</hi> the main Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal upon which that cursed and lying Art is built, being this, that it is possible for men to cause the Souls of dead persons to be brought back again. This seeming <hi>Samuel</hi> did not at all ascribe his appearance to the extraordinary Providence of God, but rather to the Devil, since he complained that <hi>Saul</hi> had by the Witch disquieted him. The appearing <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel</hi> was seen <hi>ascending</hi> out of the Earth, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the true <hi>Samuel</hi> would rather have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>descending</hi> from Heaven. Moreover the words of the Witches, <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he said, <hi>tommorrow thou and thy Sons shall be with me,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>29.18. are hardly consistent with truth. Nor is it likely, that the true <hi>Samuel</hi> would Preach nothing but Desperation to <hi>Saul,</hi> without so much as once exhorting him in a way of Repentance, to endeavour that his peace might be made with that God whom he had provoked by his sins, <hi>V.

Some acknowledge that he may do so as to persons that are dead, but that he cannot personate good and innocent Men who are still living.

Nothing is more frequent, then for the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of worthy Men to be misrepresented after they are gone, and not capable of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves.

<pb n="214" facs="unknown:000373_0234_0FA55BF9F4D2A4E0"/>
Morning, so that what the <hi>Praefect</hi> and his Servant beheld, appeared to be nothing else but a Diabolical illusion; a spiteful <hi>Daemon</hi> designing to blast the credit, and take away the life of an innocent man. It is also reported by <hi>Albertus Granzius (Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5.) that <hi>Kunegund</hi> the <hi>Empress,</hi> was for some time thought to be guilty of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, by reason that a Noble person was frequently seen going out of her Chamber; but it after appeared that the suspected Noble person had not been there, only a <hi>Daemon</hi> in his shape. I concern not my self, with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentickness of that Relation. The Matter in hand is sufficiently confirmed by a thing that hapned more lately, and nearer home: For if any of the old Puritans, who, lived in <hi>Colchester</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> fifty years ago, be yet surviving, they can doubtless remember the strange things which hapned to one Mr. <hi>Earl,</hi> a young man in those dayes. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil did then frequently appear to him in the shape of some of his acquaintance, and would perswade him to three things. 1. That he should abstain from Praying. 2. That he should not frequent Church-Meetings. 3. That he should never Marry. But he did not hearken to these suggestions. The night wherein he was Married, soon after he and
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:000373_0235_0FA55BFCF9B75848"/>
his Wife were Bedded, the Devil came into the room, and pulled two of his Teeth out of his head, which put him to great pain; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he cried out, and when his Friends came in, they found his Mouth bloody, and used means to ease his pain. This Mr. <hi>Earl</hi> was afterwards for the space of ten years e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and anon assaulted by the Devil, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many appearances of his Friends, did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to seduce him. There were their two famous Men Ministers of those parts, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> Mr. <hi>John Rogers</hi> of <hi>Dedham,</hi> (who was Father to the late eminent Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> of <hi>Ipswich</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi>) and Mr. <hi>Liddal</hi> of <hi>Colchester.</hi> With these Mr. <hi>Earl</hi> did converse for comfort and instruction; but chiefly with Mr. <hi>Liddal,</hi> then whom there was not a man more eminent for Godliness. It fell out once that the Devil came to Mr. <hi>Earl</hi> in Mr. <hi>Liddal'</hi>s shape, and as Mr. <hi>Earl</hi>'s custom was, he did propose to the seeming Mr. <hi>Lid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> his cases of Conscience, but found that Mr. <hi>Liddal</hi> did not Discourse after his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rate, which made him suspect whether he was not imposed upon by a deceitful <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> The next Day going to Mr. <hi>Liddal</hi>'s House, he enquired whether he was with him the Day before, Mr. <hi>Liddal</hi> told him that he was not; then said Mr. <hi>Earl</hi> it was my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:000373_0236_0FA55BFE5BBA1D30"/>
in your shape. What a miserable Man am I, that know not when I speak with my Enemy or with my Friend? To which Mr. <hi>Liddal</hi> replied, if you would know when you speak with a Spirit or with a Man, remember and follow the advice of Christ; who when he appeared to his Disciples after his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and they thought he had been a Spirit, and were therefore troubled; he said to them, <hi>bandle me and see, for a Spirit hath not Flesh and Bones as you see me have,</hi> Luk.24.39. This Advice Mr. <hi>Earl</hi> followed. For not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Devil coming to him in Mr. <hi>Liddal's</hi> shape, he went to take hold on his Arms, but could feel no substance, only a vanishing sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. It seems that this Mr. <hi>Earl</hi> was once an <hi>Athiest,</hi> that did not believe that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And though God mercifully gave him Repentance yet he was miserably haunted with an evil Spirit all his dayes. I find that Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> in his first <hi>Vol.</hi> of Examples, <hi>Chap.</hi> 104. <hi>P.</hi>510. hath some part of this strange Providence, but he mentions not Mr. <hi>Earl</hi>'s Name. A Gentleman worthy of credit affirmed this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to be most certainly true, according to
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:000373_0237_0FA55BFFCE6CB020"/>
the particulars which have been declared. I have thought it therefore not unworthy the publication.</p>
               <p>There is another Remarkable Passage to this purpose, which hapned of later years, wherein the <hi>Turkish Chaous</hi> Baptized at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, January</hi> 30. <hi>A. D.</hi> 1658. was concerned. This <hi>Chaous</hi> being alone in his Chamber, <hi>3. h.P.M.</hi> a person in the likeness of Mr. <hi>Dury,</hi> the Minister with whom he did most ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily converse, came and sat by him. This seeming Mr. <hi>Dury</hi> told him, that he had wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a great deal of patience as to the matter of his Baptism; and that himself had endeavoured by all means possible to procure it, to be performed with publick Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and to that effect, had dealt with <hi>Richard,</hi> and several of his Counsel, but that now he perceived that it was in vain to strive or wait longer. And therefore advised him not to be much troubled at it, but setting his mind at rest, to leave these thoughts, and take up his resolution another way. When the <hi>Chaous</hi> heard this Discourse, being much perplexed in his Spirit, he lifted up his hands and eyes to Heaven, uttering Words to this effect. <hi>O my Lord Jesus Christ, what a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thing is this, that a true Christian cannot be owned by other Christians; that one who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:000373_0238_0FA55BFFF190ACC8"/>
on thee cannot be Baptized into thy Name.</hi> When he had so spoken, looking down, he saw no body, the appearance of Mr. <hi>Dury</hi> being vanished, which was at first an amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him; but recollecting himself, he began to rejoyce, as hoping that Satan would be disappointed of his Plot. About 8 <hi>h.</hi> at night, the true Mr. <hi>Dury</hi> met with the <hi>Chaous</hi> who acquainted him with what hapned to him, so did he more fully understand how he had been imposed upon by Satan. The men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Instances, are enough to prove that the Devil may possibly appear in the shape of good Men, and that not only of such as are dead, but of the still living. It might as a further confirmation of the truth we assert, have been here noted, that the Devil doth frequently amongst the <hi>Papists</hi> visibly appear, pretending to be Christ himself, as their own Authors do acknowledge. They affirm, that he came in the shape of Christ to <hi>Pachomius</hi> and to St. <hi>Martin.</hi> So hath he often appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Form of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> whereby miserable Souls have been seduced into gross I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries. It is likewise reported, that when <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> had spent a Day in Fasting and Prayer, there appeared to him one seeming to be Christ;but <hi>Luther</hi> said to him, <hi>away thou confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

Devil, I will have no Christ but what is in my Bible,</hi> whereupon the Apparition vanished. As for the Spirits of Men deceased, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they cannot reassume their Bodies, nor yet come to Men in this World when they will, or without a permission from him, in whose hand they are. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Sermon concerning <hi>Lazarus,</hi> saith that <hi>Daemons</hi> would oftentimes appear, falsly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending themselves to be the Souls of some lately dead. He saith, that he himself knew many <hi>Daemoniacks,</hi> that the Spirits in them would feign the voices of men lately killed, and would discover the secrets of such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, professing that they were the Souls of those very men. But those were no other then devilish lies. Upon which account men had need be exceeding wary what credit they give unto, or how they entertain communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with such <hi>Spectres.</hi> I do not say that all such Apparitions are Diabolical. Only that many of them are so. And as yet I have not met with any <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> whereby the certain <hi>appearance</hi> of a Person Deceased, may be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly discerned from a meer Diabolical illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. The Rules of judging in this case de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by <hi>Malderus</hi> are very fallible.</p>
               <p>As for the moving and procuring cause of
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:000373_0240_0FA55C0176A2A608"/>
such <hi>Apparitions,</hi> commonly it is by reason of some sin not discoverable in any other way. Either some act of injustice done, or it may be some Murder committed. <hi>Platina, Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clerus,</hi> and others relate, that Pope <hi>Benedict.</hi> 8 did after his death appear sitting upon a black Horse before a Bishop of his acquaintance, declaring the reason to be, in that he had in his life time nefariously consumed a great sum of Money, which belong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> to the Poor. And there are fresh Examples to this purpose lately published in the second Edition of Mr. <hi>Glanvils Sadducismus Triumphatus.</hi> He there speaks of a Man in <hi>Guilford,</hi> unto whom belonged some Copy-hold Land, which was to descend to his Children, he dying, leaving no Child born, his Brother took possession of the Estate. So it hapned that the deceased Man's Wife conceived with Child but a little before her Husbands death, which after she perceived, by the Advice of her Neighbours, she told her Brother in Law how matters were circumstanced; he raised upon her, calling her Whore, and said he would not be fooled out of his Estate so. The poor Woman went home troubled, that not only her Child should lose the Land, but which was worse, that she should be thought an Whore. In due time she was Delivered
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:000373_0241_0FA55C022F3B6670"/>
of a Son. Some time after which, as her Brother in Law was going out of the Field, his dead Brother (the Father of the injured Child) appeared to him at the Stile, and bid him give up the Land to the Child, for it was his Right. The Brother being greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted at this <hi>Spectre,</hi> ran away, and not long after came to his Sister, saying, she had sent the Devil to him, and bid her take the Land; and her Son is now possessed of it.</p>
               <p>The same Author relates, that the Wife of Dr. <hi>Bretton</hi> of <hi>Deptford</hi> (being a person of extraordinary Piety) did appear after her Death. A Maid of hers, whose name was <hi>Alice</hi> (for whom in her life time she had a great kindness) Married a near Neighbour. As this <hi>Alice</hi> was rocking her Infant in the night, some one knocking at the door, she a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose and opened it, and was surprized by the sight of a Gentlewoman, not to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from her late Mistriss. At the first sight she expressed great amazement, and said were not my Mistriss dead I should conclude you are she. The Apparition replied, I am she which was your Mistriss; and withal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that she had a business of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to imploy her in, and that she must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately go a little way with her. <hi>Alice</hi> trembled, and entreated her to go to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:000373_0242_0FA55C0539FAAAA8"/>
who was sitter to be employed than she, The seeming Mistriss replied, that she had been in the Chamber of him who was once her Husband, but he was asleep; nor had she any Commission to awake him. <hi>Alice</hi> then objected that her Child was apt to cry vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, and should she leave it, some hurt might come to him. The Apparition repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Child shall sleep until you return. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was no avoiding it; <hi>Alice</hi> followed her over the Style into a large Field, who said, observe how much of this Field I mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure with my feet, and when she had took a good large leisurly compass, she said, <hi>all this belongs to the Poor;</hi> it being gotten from them by wrongful means, and charged her to go and tell her Brother, whose it was at that time, that he should give it up to the poor again forthwith as he loved her and his Deceased Mother. This Brother was not the person that did this unjust act, but his Father. She added, that she was the more concerned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause her Name was made use of in some Writing that related to this Land. <hi>Alice</hi> asked her how she should satisfie her Brother that this was no Cheat or Delusion of her Phansie? She replied, tell him this Secret which he knows that only himself and I am privy to, and he will believe you. <hi>Alice</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised

her to go on this Errand. She enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her the rest of the night with divine Discourse, and Heavenly Exhortations. But when the twilight appeared, the <hi>Spectre</hi> said, <hi>I must be seen by none but your self,</hi> and so Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared. Immediately <hi>Alice</hi> makes hast home, being thoughtful for her Child, but found it as the <hi>Spectre</hi> said, fast asleep in the Cradle. That Day she went to her Master, the <hi>Doctor,</hi> who amazed at the account she gave, sent her to his Brother in Law. He at the first hearing of <hi>Alice</hi>'s Story, laughed at it heartily; supposing her to be troubled with strange whimsies. But then she told him of the Secret, which her appearing Mistriss the Gentleman's Sister, had revealed; upon which he presently changed his countenance, and told her he would give the Poor their own, which accordingly he did, and they now enjoy it. D. <hi>Bretton</hi> himself (being a Person of great sincerity) gave a large Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of his Wives Apparition, to several; and amongst others to Dr. <hi>Whichcot.</hi> And this Narrative was attested unto by Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Fowler,</hi> Feb. 16. 1680.

The night after there appeared again to him, the likeness of <hi>James Haddock;</hi> telling him, that the Woman, who had been his Wife, when living; was now Married unto one <hi>Davis</hi> in <hi>Malone;</hi> and that the said <hi>Davis</hi> and his Wife wronged the Son of <hi>James Haddock;</hi> and that the Will of <hi>Haddock,</hi> who had given a Lease to his Son, was not fulfilled; and therefore he desired <hi>Taverner</hi> to acquaint them therewith, and to see his Son righted. <hi>Taverner</hi> neglected to deliver his message, whereupon the <hi>Spectre</hi> appeared again unto him in divers formidable shapes, threatning to tear him in pieces, if he did not do as he
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:000373_0245_0FA55C081DC4B658"/>
was required. This made him leave his House where he dwelt in the Mountains and remove to the Town of <hi>Belfast,</hi> where it appeared to him again in the house of one <hi>Pierce,</hi> severely threatning of him. Upon which <hi>Taverner</hi> being much troubled in his Spirit, acquainted some of his Friends with his perplexity. They take Advice from Dr. <hi>Downs,</hi> then Minister in <hi>Belfast.</hi> and Mr. <hi>James South,</hi> Chaplain to the Lord <hi>Chichester;</hi> who went with <hi>Taverner</hi> to the house of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi> and in their presence he declared to her, that he could not be quiet for the Ghost of her former Husband <hi>James Haddock,</hi> who threatned to tear him in pieces, if he did not tell her she must right <hi>John Haddock</hi> her Son by him, in a Lease wherein she and <hi>Davis</hi> her now Husband had wronged him. Two nights after the <hi>Spectre</hi> came to him again, looking pleasantly upon him, asking if he had done the message? He answered, he had. Then he was told, he must do the like to the Executors. The Day following Dr. <hi>Jeremie Taylor</hi> Bishop of <hi>Down, Conner,</hi> and <hi>Dromore,</hi> being to keep Court at <hi>Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more;</hi> ordered his Secretary <hi>(Thomas Alcock)</hi> to send for <hi>Taverner,</hi> who accordingly came, and was strictly examined. The Bishop ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised him, the next time the <hi>Spectre</hi> appeared

And what is the reason that you appear for the relief of your Son in so small a matter, when so many Widows and Orphans are oppressed in the World and none of their Relations appear as you do to right them?</hi> That night <hi>Taverner</hi> lodged at my Lord <hi>Conways,</hi> where he saw the <hi>Spectre</hi> coming over a Wall; and approaching near to him, asked if he had done his Message to the Executor also? He replied, he had, and wondred that he should be still troubled. The Apparition bid him not be afraid, for it would not hurt him, nor appear to him any more, but to the Executor, if the Orphan were not righted. <hi>Taverners</hi> Brother being by, put him in mind to propound the Bishops Questions to the Spirit. Which he did; but the <hi>Spectre</hi> gave no answer to them; only seemed to crawl on his hands and feet over the Wall again, and vanished with a melodious Harmony. The persons concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the Lease (much against their wills) disposed of it for the use of <hi>Haddock</hi>'s Son, only for fear lest the <hi>Apparition</hi> should molest them also.

Animadvert upon what is here expressed, concerning the Questions which the Bishop would needs have propounded to, and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by this <hi>Spectre.</hi> I am perswaded, that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> who speaks of a Mans <hi>Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into those things which be hath not seen, Col.</hi>2.18. would hardly have given such counsel as the Bishop did.

               <q>
                  <p>He saith, (<hi>P.</hi>298.) that about the year 1623, one <hi>Fletcher</hi> of <hi>Rascal,</hi> a Town in the North-Riding of <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> a Yeoman of a good Estate married a Woman from <hi>Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Brigs,</hi> who had formerly been naught with one <hi>Ralph Raynard,</hi> who kept an Inn, within half a mile from <hi>Rascal,</hi> in the high Road betwixt <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Thuske,</hi> his Sister li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with him; this <hi>Raynard</hi> continuing in unlawful Lust with <hi>Fletcher</hi>'s Wife, and not being content therewith, conspired the death of <hi>Fletcher;</hi> one <hi>Mark Dunn</hi> being made privy, and hired to assist in the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which <hi>Raynard</hi> and <hi>Dunn</hi> accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed upon <hi>May Day,</hi> by drowning him, as they were Travelling all three together, from a Town called <hi>Huby,</hi> and acquainted the Wife with the deed, she gave them a Sack, therein to convey his Body, which they did, and buried it in <hi>Raynard</hi>'s back side, or <hi>Croft,</hi> where an old Oak had been stubbed up, and sowed Mustard-seed in the place, thereby to hide it; they then conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued their wicked course of Lust and Drunkenness; and the Neighbours did much wonder at <hi>Fletchers</hi> absence, but his Wife excused it, and said, <hi>he was only gone

aside for fear of some Writs being served upon him,</hi> and so it continued till about <hi>July 7th.</hi> after, when <hi>Raynard</hi> going to <hi>Topcliff-Fair,</hi> and setting up his Horse in the Stable, the Spirit of <hi>Fletcher</hi> in his usual shape and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, did appear unto him, and said, <hi>O Ralph, Repent, Repent, for my Revenge is at hand;</hi> and ever after, until he was put in the Goal the Spirit seemed continually to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, whereby he became sad and rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and his own Sister over-hearing his Confession and Relation of it to another person, did through fear of losing her own life, immediately reveal it to Sr. <hi>William Sheffield,</hi> who lived in <hi>Rascal;</hi> whereupon <hi>Raynard, Dunn,</hi> and the Wife, were all three apprehended, and sent to the Goal at <hi>York,</hi> where they were Condemned and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, near the place where <hi>Raynard</hi> lived; and <hi>Fletcher</hi> was buried; the two Men being hung up in Chains, and the Woman burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Gallows. I have recited this Story punctually, as a thing that hath been very much fixed on my Memory (being then but young) and a certain Truth, I being (with many more) an Ear-witness of their Confessions, and eye-witness of their Executions, and likewise saw <hi>Fletcher</hi> when he was taken up, where they had

                  <p>Again, the same Author (<hi>P.</hi>308.) relates that about the Year 1632. there lived one <hi>Walker,</hi> near <hi>Chester,</hi> who was a Yeoman of a good Estate, and a Widower; he had a young Kins-woman to keep his House, who was by the Neighbours suspected to be with Child, and was sent away one Evening in the dark, with one <hi>Mark Sharp</hi> a Collier, and was not heard of, nor little notice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of her, till a long time after one <hi>James Grayham</hi> a Miller, who lived two Miles from <hi>Walker</hi>'s House, being one night a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone very late in his Mill, grinding Corn, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twelve a Clock at night, the Doors being shut, there stood a Woman in the midst of the Floor, with her hair hanging down all bloody, and five large Wounds in her head; he was very much frighted, yet had the courage to ask her who she was, and what she wanted? to whom she answered, <hi>I am the Spirit of such a Woman, who lived with</hi> Walker, <hi>and being got with Child by him, be promised to send me to a private place, where I should be well lockt to, till I was brought

                        </gap>well, and then I should come again and keep his House, and accordingly</hi> (said the Apparition) <hi>I was one night late sent away with one</hi> Mark Sharp, <hi>who upon a Moor,</hi> (na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a place which the Miller knew) <hi>slew me with a Pick</hi> (such as Men dig Coals withal) <hi>and gave me these five Wounds, and after threw my Body into a Coal-pit hard by, and hid the Pick under the Bank, and his shoes and stockins being bloody, he endeavoured to wash them, but seeing the blood would not wash off, be left them there;</hi> And the Apparition further told the Miller, <hi>That he must be the Man to reveal it, or else she must still appear and haunt him.</hi> The Miller returned home very sad, and heavy, but spake not one word of what he had seen, yet eschewed as much as he could to stay in the Mill in the night without company, thinking thereby to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape the seeing this dreadful Apparition; But notwithstanding, one night when it began to be dark, the Apparition met him again, and seemed very fierce and cruel, threatning him, that if he did not reveal the Murder, she would continually pursue and haunt him; yet for all this, he still concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it, until St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Eve before <hi>Christmas,</hi> when being soon after Sun-set walking in his Garden, she appeared again, and then so

threatned and affrighted him, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised faithfully to reveal it the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: In the morning he went unto a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, and discovered the whole matter, with all the circumstances, and diligent search being made, the Body was found in a Cole-pit, with five wounds in the head, and the Pick, and Shoes, and Stockins yet bloody, and in every circumstance as the Apparition had related to the Miller: Whereupon <hi>Walker</hi> and <hi>Mark Sharp</hi> were both apprehended, but would confess no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. At the Assizes following, (I think it was at <hi>Durham</hi>) they were arraigned, found guilty, and Hanged; but I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hear that they confessed the Fact. It was reported that the <hi>Apparition</hi> did appear to the Judge, or the Fore-man of the Jury, but of that I know no certainty. There are many persons yet alive that can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this strange Murder, and I saw and read the Letter which was sent to Serjeant <hi>Hutton</hi> about it, from the Judge before whom they were tried, which maketh me relate it with greater <hi>confidence.</hi> Thus far we have Mr. <hi>Webster</hi>'s Relations.</p>

in <hi>England.</hi> The sum of the Story as it is published in Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi>'s Collection of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, <hi>P.</hi> 172. is this: On the ninth of <hi>November</hi> 1674. <hi>Thomas Goddard</hi> of <hi>Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> in the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Ogborn,</hi> about 9. <hi>h.

He seemed to stand by the Stile, which <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi> was to go over. When he came near, the <hi>Spectre</hi> spake to him with an audible voice, saying, <hi>Are you afraid?</hi> to whom he answered, I am, thinking of one who is dead and buried, whom you are like. To which the Apparition replied, <hi>I am he;</hi> come near me I will do you no harm; to which <hi>Goddard</hi> replied, I trust in him who hath bought my Soul with his precious blood, you shall do me no harm. Then the <hi>Spectre</hi> said, how stand cases at home? <hi>Goddard</hi> askt what cases? Then it asked him, how doth <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary?</hi> meaning belike, his Son <hi>William</hi> and his Daughter <hi>Mary,</hi> whom this <hi>Goddard</hi> had married.

The <hi>Spectre</hi> offered him some Money, desiring it might be sent to

his Daughter that was lately become a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; but <hi>Goddard</hi> answered, <hi>In the Name of Jesus Christ I refuse all such Money.</hi> Then the Apparition said, I perceive you are afraid, I will meet you some other time: so it went away. The next night about 7 <hi>h.</hi> it came and opened his Shop-Window, and looked him in the face, but said nothing. And the next night after as <hi>Goddard</hi> went into his back-side with a Candle light in his hand, but he being affrighted ran into his House, and saw it no more at that time. But on Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day <hi>November</hi> 12. as he came from <hi>Chilton,</hi> the Apparition met him again, and stood (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight foot) directly before him, and said with a loud voice, <hi>Thomas,</hi> bid <hi>William Avon</hi> take the Sword which he had of me, which is now in his House, and carry to the wood as we goe to <hi>Alton</hi> to the upper end of the wood by the wayes side, for with that sword I did wrong above thirty years ago, &amp; he never prospered since <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And do you speak with <hi>Edward Lawrence,</hi> and I desire you to pay him twenty shillings out of the Money which you received of <hi>James Eliot</hi> at two payments; for I borrowed so much Money of <hi>Edward Lawrence,</hi> and said that I had paid him, but I did not pay it him. This Money was received of <hi>James Eliot</hi> on a
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:000373_0257_0FA55C138D499C80"/>
Bond due to <hi>Avon</hi> and <hi>Goddard</hi> had it at two Payments after <hi>Avon</hi> had been Dead several Moneths. <hi>Lawrence</hi> saith that he lent <hi>Avon</hi> twenty shillings in Money about twenty years ago, which was never paid him again. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 23. <hi>Goddard</hi> did by Order from the Mayor of the Town, go with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law <hi>William Avon,</hi> with the Sword to the place where the Apparition said it should be carried. And coming away thence <hi>Goddard</hi> looking back saw the same Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereupon he called to his Brother in Law, and said, Here is the Apparition of your Father; <hi>William</hi> replied, I see nothing, then <hi>Goddard</hi> fell on his Knees, and said, Lord, open his eyes that he may see. But <hi>William</hi> said, Lord grant I may not see it, if it be thy blessed Will. Then the Ghost did to <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi>'s apprehension becken with his hand. To whom <hi>Goddard</hi> said, what would you have me to do? the Apparition replied, take up the Sword and follow me. To which he said, should both of us come? or but one of us? The <hi>Spectre</hi> replied, <hi>Thomas</hi> do you take up the Sword. So he took it up and followed the Apparition about ton poles into the wood. Then the <hi>Spectre</hi> coming towards <hi>Goddard</hi> he stept back two steps; but it said to him, <hi>I have a permission to you, and a commission not to
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:000373_0258_0FA55C14749614F8"/>
touch you.</hi> Then it took the Sword, and went to the place at which before it stood, and pointed the top of the Sword into the ground and said, In this place was buried the Body of him whom I Murdered in the Year 1635. but it is now rotten and turned to Dust. Whereupon <hi>Goddard</hi> said, For what cause did you Murder him? The seeming <hi>Avon</hi> replied I took Money from the Man, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with me, and so I Murdered him. Then <hi>Goddard</hi> said, who was confederate with you in the Murder? the <hi>Spectre</hi> Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, none but my self. What (said <hi>Goddard</hi>) would you have me do in this thing? The Apparition replied, Only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> let the World know that I Murdered a Man, and buried him in this place, in the year 1635. Then the <hi>Spectre</hi> laid down the Sword on the bare ground there, whereupon grew nothing, but seemed to <hi>Goddard</hi> to be as a Grave sunk <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. All this while <hi>William Avon</hi> remained where <hi>Goddard</hi> left him, and said he saw no Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition, only heard <hi>Goddard</hi> speak to the <hi>Spectre,</hi> and discerned another voice also, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Reply to <hi>Goddard's</hi> enquiries, but could not understand the words uttered by that voice. The next day the Mayor caused men to dig in the place where the <hi>Spectre</hi> said the Body was buried, but nothing could
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:000373_0259_0FA55C14EFC8F8A0"/>
be found. These examples then, shew that the Ghosts of Dead men do sometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and that for such causes as those men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. There have been some in the world so desperate as to make solemn Covenants with their living Friends, to appear unto them after their Death; and sometimes (though not alwayes) it hath so come to pass. It is a Remarkable passage which <hi>Baronius</hi> relates concerning <hi>Marsilius Ficinus,</hi> and his great Intimate <hi>Michael Mercatus.</hi> These two ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been warmly Disputing about the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, entred into a solemn Vow, that if there were truth in those No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about a future State in another World, he which died first should appear to his sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Friend. Not long after this, <hi>Ficinus</hi> Died. On a morning when <hi>Mercatus</hi> was intent upon his Studies, he heard the voice of <hi>Ficinus</hi> his Friend at his Window with a loud cry, saying, O <hi>Michael, Michael, Vera, vera sunt illa:</hi> O my Friend <hi>Michael,</hi> those noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the Souls of Men being immortal they are true, they are true. Whereupon, <hi>Mercatus</hi> opened his Window, and saw his Friend <hi>Marsilius Ficinus,</hi> whom he called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but he vanished away. He presently sent to <hi>Florence</hi> to know how <hi>Ficinus</hi> did, and was informed that he Died about the hour when
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:000373_0260_0FA55C17E110B4D8"/>
his Ghost appeared at <hi>Mercatus</hi> his Window. There are also later Instances, and nearer home, not altogether unlike to this. For in Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi>'s late Collection of Relation, (which we have had occasion more than once to mention.) It is said, that Dr. <hi>Farrar</hi> and his Daughter, made a compact, that the first of them which Died, if happy, should after Death appear to the surviver if possible; his Daughter with some difficulty consenting to the agreement. Some time after, the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter living then near <hi>Salisbury,</hi> fell in Labour, and having by an unhappy mistake a noxious Potion given to her, instead of another pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, suddenly Died.

Likewise one Mr. <hi>Watkinson,</hi> who lived in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> told his Daughter (taking her leave of him, and expressing her fears that she should never see him more) that should he Die, if ever God did permit the Dead to to see the living, he would see her again.

Who said <hi>Mall,</hi> did not I tell thee that I would see thee again? He exhorted her to be patient under her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and to carry it dutiful towards her Mother; and told her that her Child that was born since his departure should not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her long.

To issue their controversies, they agreed that he that died first should the third night after his Funeral, between the hours of twelve and one, appear at a little House in the Garden. After <hi>Sydenham</hi> was dead, Captain <hi>Dyke</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs to the place appointed between them two. He acquainted a near Kinsman, Dr. <hi>Thomas Dyke</hi> with his design, by whom he was earnestly disswaded from going to that place at that time; and was told, that the Devil might meet him and be his ruine, if he would venture on in such rash attempts. The Captain Replied, that he had solemnly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and nothing should discourage him; accordingly betwixt twelve and one he went into the Garden-house, and there tarried two or three hours, without seeing or hearing any thing more than what was usual. About six weeks after, Captain <hi>Dyke</hi> rides to <hi>Eaton,</hi> to place his Son a Scholar there. The morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before he returned from thence, after it was light, one came to his Bed-side, and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly drawing back the Curtains, calls <hi>Cap. Cap.</hi> (which was the term of familiarity which the <hi>Major</hi> when living used to call the <hi>Captain</hi> by) He presently perceived it was his <hi>Major,</hi> and replieth, <hi>What my Major!</hi> On the Table in the Room there lay a Sword which the <hi>Major</hi> had formerly given to the <hi>Captain.</hi>

The Captain arose, and came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another Chamber (where his Kinsman Dr. <hi>Dyke</hi> lodged) but in a visage and form much differing from himself, his Hair stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Eyes staring, and his whole Body trembling, telling with much affection what he had seen.

These <hi>Spectres</hi> appeared every night in <hi>June,</hi> 1682. How it is there since that, or what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents have followed in that place, I know Lon But I find in credible Authors, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Mischief and Destruction unto some or other hath been the effect of Apparitions: <hi>Luther</hi> tells us of a Shepherd (of whom also he speaketh charitably) that being haunted with a Spirit; the <hi>Apparition</hi> told him, that after eight dayes he would appear to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and carry him away, and kill him; and so it came to pass: the Ministers whom the poor man acquainted with his sorrowful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, advised him not to despair of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Soul, though God should suffer the Devil to kill his Body. I have read of threescore Persons all killed at once by an <hi>Apparition.

               <p>THe preceding Relations about <hi>Witchcrafts</hi> and <hi>Diabolical Impostures</hi> give us too just occasion to make enquiry into some <hi>Cases of Conscience,</hi> respecting things of this Nature. And in the first place the <hi>Quaere</hi> may be;</p>

                  <hi>Whether it is lawful to make use of any sort of Herbs of Plants to preserve from Witchcrafts, or from the power of Evil Spirits?</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer unto which is; That it is in no wise lawful, but that all attempts of that nature are Magical, and Diabolical, and therefore

detestable Superstition. As appears 1. In that if the <hi>Devils</hi> do either operate or cease to do mischief upon the use of such things it must needs be in that they are signs which give notice to the Evil Spirits what they are to do; Now for Men to submit to any of the <hi>Devils</hi> Sacraments is implicitly to make a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him. Many who practise these nefarious Vanities little think what they do. They would not for the World (they say) make a Covenant with the <hi>Devil,</hi> yet by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the <hi>Devils signals,</hi> with an opinion of receiving benefit thereby, they do the thing which they pretend to abhor. For, 2. Angels (bad as well as good) are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture incorporeal Substances. There are some Authors who by a <hi>corporal substance</hi> intend no more but a <hi>real being;</hi> so that the term is by them used in opposition to <hi>meer Phantasms</hi> in that sence, none but <hi>Sadduces</hi> will deny Angels to be Corporeal. And in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the Antient <hi>Doctors, Tertullian</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers call them <hi>Corpora.</hi> But commonly a Body is set in opposition to a meer Spiritual Substance, <hi>Mat.</hi>10.28. <hi>Heb.</hi>12.13. And thus it is certain that <hi>Daemons</hi> are <hi>incorporeal,</hi> Eph.6.12. they are frequently, not only by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, but in the Holy Scripture stiled <hi>Spirits,</hi> because of their being incorporeal. And
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:000373_0270_0FA55C228B060198"/>
thence it is that they are not visible or palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or any way incurring the outward sences, <hi>Luk.</hi>24.39. <hi>Homer</hi> saith that when the Ghost of <hi>Anticlea</hi> appeared to <hi>Ulysses,</hi> he attempted three times to embrace that Image, but could feel nothing; for it had not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but as <hi>Virgil</hi> expresseth it, <hi>Tenues sine corporevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas. Cajetan</hi> &amp; <hi>Vasquez</hi> affirm, that Apparitions can at no time be felt. It is not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but that Spirits may make use of <hi>vehicles,</hi> that are subject to the outward senses; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, a meer Spirit cannot be touched by humane hands. Moreover, we read of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>Daemons</hi> possessing one miserable Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>Luk.</hi>8.30. A Legion is at least 6000; now if they were corporeal Substances, it could not be that so many of them, should be in the same person at the sametime. And if they are incorporeal Substances, then it is not possible that Herbs or any sensible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects should have a natural influence upon them, as they have upon Elementary Bodies. This Argument is of such weight, as that <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrius,</hi> &amp; other heathenish Authors who affirm that <hi>Daemons</hi> are affected with smells, &amp; with blood,<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Suppose them to have aereal bodies. So do some <hi>Talmudical</hi> &amp; <hi>Cabalistical</hi> Writers; they hold that there are a middle sort of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, made of Fire and Air, who live upon

                  </gap>. <hi>Munster</hi> in his Notes on <hi>Lev.</hi>17. does out of <hi>R.Abraham,</hi> ate many passages to this purpose. But such <hi>Jewish Fables</hi> are so foolish, as that they need to confutation. And as the Argument we have mentioned is a sufficient refutation of them that Imagine a natural vertue to be in Herbs, whereby Evil Spirits are driven away; so may it be improved against their Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who suppose that Fumes are of force to expel <hi>Daemons.</hi> The Author of the Book of <hi>Tobit</hi> Chap. 6. tells a Tale, that the heart and Liver of a Fish, if a smoke be made therewith, the Devil will smell it, and then be forced to flee away <hi>from any one</hi> that shall be troubled with an Evil Spirit; and that <hi>Tobit</hi> following the counsel which <hi>Raphael</hi> gave him about these matters, the Devil fain to run for it, as far as to the utmost parts of <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, Chap.</hi>8, <hi>ver.</hi>2,3. This passage, is so far from being divine, as that indeed it is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and Magical. Whereas the <hi>Author</hi> saith, that <hi>whoever</hi> is troubled with an Evil Spirit, shall by that means find relief, he does expresly contradict the Son of God, who has taught otherwise, <hi>Mat.</hi>17.21. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.28. And his ascribing such vertue to the heart of a Fish, is as true as what <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> saith, who
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:000373_0272_0FA55C23EFB83F60"/>
affirms that the Gall of a black Dog will drive away Evil Spirits, and free from Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts. <hi>A</hi>nd there is as much credit to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to these things as to another <hi>Jewish Fable,</hi>

Root by the <hi>Jews,</hi> called <hi>Baaras,</hi> which if a Man pluck it up, he dieth presently; but to prevent that they make bare the Root, and then tye it with a string to a Dog, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away to follow his Master, easily plucks up the Root, whereupon the Dog di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but his Master may then without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger handle the Root, and thereby flight the Devils out of persons possessed with Infernal Spirits: whom he (in that also following the Heathen) supposes to be the Spirits of wicked men deceased. And that the <hi>Jews</hi> received these curious or rather cursed Arts from <hi>Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks,</hi> is manifest, inasmuch as <hi>Pliny</hi> taught that the Herb called <hi>Aglaophotis</hi> had power to raise the Gods, (so did they call the <hi>Devils</hi> whom they served.) Now that was the same Herb with <hi>Baaras;</hi> For as <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

So then the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king use of Herbs to fright away <hi>Devils,</hi> or to preserve from the power of Witches, is originally an Heathenish custome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which ought to be avoided and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred by those that call themselves Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>It is no less Superstitious, when Men En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by Characters, Words or Spells, to charm any <hi>Witches, Devils</hi> or <hi>Diseases.</hi> Such

Persons do (as <hi>Fuller</hi> speaks) fence them selves with the devils Shield against the devils Sword, <hi>Agrippa</hi> in his Books <hi>De occulta Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophia</hi> has many of these impious curiosities. But in his Book of <hi>the vanity of Sciences, Chap.</hi>48. he acknowledgeth that he wrote his other Book of <hi>Occult Philosophy,</hi> when he was a young Man, and bewails his iniquity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, confessing that he had sinfully mispent precious time in those unprofitable Studies. There is also an horrid Book full of Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and <hi>Magical Incantations,</hi> which the prophane Author hath ventured to publish under the name of <hi>King Solomon:</hi> There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a greater vanity than to imagine that devils are really frighted with Words and Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables: such practices are likewise of diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and heathenish original. They that have read Subjects of this nature, are not ignorant of what is related concerning the strange things done by the <hi>Incantations</hi> of that famous Wizard <hi>Apollonius.</hi> The like has been also noted of the <hi>Brackmanes</hi> of old, who were much given to such unlawful Arts. It is still customary amongst the Heathenish <hi>Africans,</hi> by <hi>Incantations</hi> to charm Serpents; Which when they are in that way brought to them by the devil, they use with the blood of such Serpents to anoint their Weapons, that so
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:000373_0276_0FA55C2930F22AA8"/>
they may become the more mortiferous. And that the like <hi>Incantations</hi> were practised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Gentiles of old is evident from that verse of <hi>Virgil,</hi> in his 8 <hi>Eclog.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frigidus in pratis cantando rumpiter anguis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As also by that of <hi>Ovid</hi> in <hi>Metam.</hi> Lib. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viperiasrumpi verbis &amp; carmina fauces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, the Holy Scriptures intimate, that such diabolical practices were used by some in the dayes of old, Those words of <hi>David, Psal.</hi>58.4,5. imply no less, as our Excellent <hi>Rainold</hi> has with great Learning and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment evinced. It must be acknowledged that the notion which many have from <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> taken up, as if Serpents to avoid the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Charms, would lay one Ear to the ground, and with their tails stop the other ear, is to be reckoned amongst vulgar errors; nevertheless, that there were then Charmers in the World, the mentioned (as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) Scriptures notifie. Moreover, those Inchanters had their <hi>formulae,</hi> whereby they did imprecate the persons whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed hurt unto; and the <hi>Devil</hi> (when the Great and Holy God saw meet to permit him)
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:000373_0277_0FA55C2A23E10730"/>
would upon the using of those words go to work, and do strange things. Hence <hi>Livy</hi> speaks of the <hi>Devotaria Carmina</hi> used by Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards. The truth of this is also manifest from some passages in <hi>AEschines</hi> his Oration against <hi>Ctesiphon.</hi> And of this nature were <hi>Balaams Curses,</hi> desired by <hi>Baalak,</hi> as <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments</hi> against <hi>Jacob,</hi> Numb. 22.6. &amp; 23.23. If it had not been a thing famously known, that <hi>Baalam</hi> (a black Wizard) did mischief others by his <hi>Incantations,</hi> the King of <hi>Moab</hi> would never have sent to him for that end. And as Witchcrafts of this kind were frequent among the Gentiles who know not God; so in a more especial manner amongst the <hi>Ephesians</hi> before they were enlightened by the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Upon their Conversion to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, as many as had used <hi>curious</hi> (i. e. as the <hi>Syriac</hi> Translation rightly Interprets <hi>Magical</hi>) Arts, brought their Books toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and burned them before all men, <hi>Acts 19.19.</hi> Which sheweth that <hi>Ephesus</hi> did once abound with these Heathenish Superstitions.

There are some that practise such things in their simplicity, not knowing that therein they gratifie the Devil. <hi>Voetius</hi> in his Disputation, <hi>de Magia, P.</hi> 576. speaks of one that according to the vain conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion received by Tradition from fore Fathers, would sometimes attempt things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but upon <hi>Voetius</hi> his instructing him concerning the sin and evil which was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the Man durst never more do as formerly.

whose Consciences tell them they have been guilty of the same iniquity; God grant that it may have the same effect on them. It is a marvelous and an amazing thing, that in such a place as <hi>New-England,</hi> where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel hath shined with great power and glory, any should be so blind as to make attempts of this kind; yet some such I know there have been. A Man in <hi>Boston</hi> gave to one a Sealed Paper, as an effectual remedy against the Tooth-ach, wherein were drawn several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Characters, and these words written, <hi>IN Nomine Patris Filii, &amp; Spiritus Sancti, Preserve thy Servant, such an one. (Bodinus</hi> and others write of a convicted Witch, whose Name was <hi>Barbary Dore,</hi> that confessed she had often cured Diseases, by using the like words unto those mentioned.) Not long since a Man left with another in this Town, as a rare secret a Cure for the Ague, which was this, five Letters, <abbr>

These con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations have made me the more willing a little to inlarge upon the Argument in hand.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed to handle the next
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:000373_0282_0FA55C317A8EB900"/>
Case, it may not be amiss to Answer that which seems the most considerable Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the Arguments thus far insisted on. It is then by some objected that <hi>Musick</hi> driveth away Evil Spirits. For when <hi>David</hi> took an Harp and played with his hand, the Evil Spirit departed from <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>16.23. so that it seems the Devils are driven away by Sounds, and why not then by Words, or Fumes, or Herbs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. It is confessed that Satan does take great advantage from the ill humors and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases which are in the Bodies of Men great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly molest their Spirits. Especially it is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e concerning Melancholly, which has therefore been called <hi>Balneum Diaboli,</hi> the Devils Bath, wherein he delights to be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When Bodily Diseases are removed by the use of natural means, the matter upon which the Evil Spirit was wont to operate being gone, he does no more disturb and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet the minds of men as before that he did. The passive disposition in the Body ceasing, the active affliction caused by the Devil cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth also. <hi>Rulandus</hi> Writes of Possessed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who were cured by Emetic Medicines, clearing them of those melancholly humors, by means whereof the Evil Spirit had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:000373_0283_0FA55C324CDD7CD0"/>
great advantages over them. This also <hi>Pomponatius</hi> does by many Instances confirm. <hi>Sennertus</hi> likewise has divers passages to the same purpose. Also we see by frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, persons strangely hurried by Satan, have by the blessing of God upon the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Physitian been delivered from those woful molestations. <hi>Ferrarius, Delrio, Burgensis,</hi> and others, Commenting on 1<hi>Sam.</hi> 16. conceive that the Ingress and Egress of Evil Spirits depends upon the humors and dispositions of the Body; which Assertion is not universally true: For sometimes the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath laughed at the Physitians, who have thought by Medicinal Applications to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess him. Examples for this may be seen in <hi>Fernelius</hi> and <hi>Codronobus.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Voe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in his Disputation, <hi>de Emergumenis,</hi> Page 1025. speaketh cautiously and Judiciously, in asserting that we may not suppose that the Devils taking bodily possession of this or that person, depends wholly upon corporeal dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions; nevertheless that natural Distempers sometimes are an occasion thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is also true that <hi>Musick</hi> is of great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y against Melancholly discomposures. This notwithstanding, there is no reason to conclude with <hi>Mendozo, Bodin,</hi> and others, that <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sick</hi> is so hateful to the Devil, as that
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:000373_0284_0FA55C330078F0F0"/>
he is necessitated to depart when the pleasant sound is made. If that were so, how comes it to pass that appearing <hi>Daemons</hi> do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times depart with a melodious sound? or that in the Conventicles of Witches there is Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick heard? But <hi>La Torr</hi> has notably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed such Imaginations. Indeed the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and delightfulness of Musick has a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power to lenifie Melancholly passions. They say that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> by Musick restored a Frantick Man to his Wits again. Thus was <hi>Saul</hi>'s pensive Spirit refreshed by <hi>David</hi>'s plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Harp, and when he was refreshed and well, the Evil Spirit which took advantage of his former pensiveness, upon his alacrity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him. So that it remains still a truth, that corporeal things have no direct Physical influence upon Infernal Spirits, and that therefore for men to think that they shall drive away <hi>Daemons</hi> by any such means is folly and Superstition. I shall add no more in Answer to the first <hi>Quaere</hi> proposed.</p>
               <p>A second <hi>Case,</hi> which we shall here take occasion to enquire into, is, <hi>Whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Bewitched Persons to draw blood from those whom they suspect for Witches, or to put Urin into a Bottle, or to nail an Horse-shoe at their Doors, or the like, in hopes of recovering health thereby?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="unknown:000373_0285_0FA55C33B8EA8E80"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There are several great Authors who have discovered and declared the evil of all such practices. In special <hi>Voetius, Sennertus,</hi> and our <hi>Perkins</hi> disapprove thereof. There is another Question much what of the same nature with this, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> Whether a Bewitched person may lawfully cause any of the Devils <hi>Symbols</hi> to be removed in order to gaining Health? As suppose an Image of Wax in which Needles are fixed, whereby the Devil doth at the instigation of his Servants, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the diseased person whether this b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing discovered may be taken away, that so the Devils power of operation may cease, and that the sick person may in that way obtain health again? The Affirmative of this <hi>Quaestion</hi> is stiffly maintained by <hi>Scotus, Caje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, Delrio, Malderus,</hi> and by Popish Authors generally. Yet amongst them <hi>Hesselius, Estius,</hi> and <hi>Sanchez,</hi> hold the Negative. And so do all our Protestant Writers, so far as I have had occasion to observe. And although some make light of such practices, and others undertake to justifie them, yet it cannot just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be denied but that they are impious follies.</p>
               <p>For 1. They that obtain Health in this way have it from the Devil. The Witch cannot recover them, but by the Devils help. Hence as it is unlawful to entreat Witches to
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:000373_0286_0FA55C3497C5AD98"/>
heal bewitched persons, because they cannot do this, but by Satan, so is it very sinful by scratching, or burnings, or detention of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to endeavour to constrain them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bewitch any; for this is to put them upon seeking to the Devil. The Witch does nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inflict not remove the disease, but by the assistance of the Devil; therefore either to desire or force thereunto, is to make use of the Devils help. The person this reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered cannot say, <hi>The Lord was my Healer,</hi> but <hi>the Devil was my Healer.</hi> Certainly it were better for a Man to remain sick all his dayes, ye? (as <hi>Chrys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hence 2. Men and Women have by such practices as these mentioned, black commerce and communion with the Devil. They do (though ignorantly) concern and involve themselves in that Covenant which the Devil has made with his devoted and accursed Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals. For, whereas it is pleaded, that if the thing bewitched be thrown into the fire, or the Urin of the sick stopped in a Bottle, or an Horse-shoe nailed before the door, then by vertue of the compact which is between the Devil and his Witches, their power of doing more hurt ceaseth; they that shall for such an end so practise, have fellowship with
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:000373_0287_0FA55C35362FE708"/>
that Hellish Covenant. The Excellent <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus</hi> argueth solidly, in saying, <hi>they that force another to do that which he cannot possibly do, but by vertue of a compact with the Devil, have themselves implicitly communion with the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Covenant.</hi> And so is the case here.

To use any Ceremonies invented by Satan, to attain a supernatural end, implies too great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment with him.

Nay such practices do imply an invocation of the Devil for relief, and a pleading with him the Covenant which he hath made with the Witch, and a declaration of confidence that the Father of Lies will be as good as his

word. For the nefandous Language of such a practice, is this: <q>Thou O Devil, hast made a Covenant with such an one, that if such a Ceremony be used, thou wilt then cease to torment a poor creature that is now afflicted by thee. We have used that Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and therefore now O Satan we expect that thou shouldest be as good as thy word which thou hast covenanted with that Servant of thine, and cease torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Creature that has been so afflicted by thee.</q> Should Men in words speak thus, What horrid Impiety were it? therefore to do actions which import no less, is (whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deluded Souls think of it) great and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Iniquity.</p>

This later did more hurt by his Cures, than the former by his Curses. How persons that shall unbewitch others by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Urin into a Bottle, or by casting Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into the fire, or nailing of Horse-shoes at Mens doors, can wholly clear themselves from being white Witches, I am not able to understand.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Innocent persons have been extreamly wronged by such Diabolical tricks. For sometimes (as is manifest from the Relation of the <hi>Groton</hi> Maid, mentioned in the fifth Chapter of this Essay) the Devil does not only himself inflict Diseases upon Men, but represent the visages of innocent persons to the phansies of the diseased, making them believe that they are tormented by them, when only himself does it. And in case they follow the Devils direction, by observing the Ceremonies which he has invented, hee'l afflict their Bodies no more. So does his malice bring the persons accused by him (though never so innocent) into great su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion. And he will cease afflicting the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of one, in case he may ruin the credit of another, and withal endanger the Souls of those that hearken to him. If the Devil
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:000373_0290_0FA55C39A1B58FF8"/>
upon scratchings, or burnings, or stoppings of Urin, or the nailing of an Horse-shoe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall cease to afflict the body of any, he does this either as being compelled thereto, or voluntarily. To imagine that such things shall constrain the Evil Spirit to cease afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether he will or no, is against all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. But if he does this voluntarily, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ting their bodies, he does a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mischief to Souls. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The Devil heals the Body that he may wound the Soul. He will heal them with all his heart, provided that he may but thereby draw men to look unto him for help, instead of seeking unto God alone, in the use of his own means, and so receive that honour (the thing that he aspires after) which is the Lords due. How gladly will that wicked Spirit heal one body upon condition that he may entangle many Souls with Superstition. And if Men and Women (especially in places of light) will hearken to him, it is a righteous thing with God to suffer it to be thus. It is past doubt that Satan, who has the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>wer of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. has also (by divine permission) power to inflict, and consequently to remove Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases from the bones of men. In natural Diseases he has many times a great operation, and is willing to have them cured rather by
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:000373_0291_0FA55C39B3743208"/>
the use of Superstious then of natural means. It is noted in their <hi>Germanic Ephemeris</hi> for the year 1675. that a Man troubled with a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stula,</hi> which the Physitians by all their Art could no way relieve; a person that was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed a Wizard undertook to cure him; and applying a Powder to the wound, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few dayes the sick party recovered. The powder was some of the ashes of a certain Woman who had been burnt to death for a Witch. This was not altogether so horrid as that which is by Authors worthy of credit reported to come to pass, in the days of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> VI. when the Plague raging in <hi>Rome,</hi> a Magician (whose Name was <hi>Demetrius Spartan</hi>) caused it to be stayed by sacrificing a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Such power hath the righteous God given unto Satan over the sinful Children of Men; yea such a Ruler hath he set over them as a just punishment for all their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness. His chief design is to improve that power which by reason of sin he hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to seduce into more sin. And the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God to punish the World for iniquity, often suffers the Enemy to obtain his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires this way. What strange things have been done, and how have Diseases been heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the sign of the Cross many times? By
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:000373_0292_0FA55C3B046F0280"/>
which means Satans design in advancing staurolatry to the destruction of thousands of Souls, has too successfully taken place. And this iniquity did he early and gradually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance amongst Christians. I have not been able without astonishment to read the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges related by <hi>Austin de civitate</hi> D<hi>ei Lib.</hi>22. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. He there speaks of one <hi>Innocentis,</hi> whom he calls a most Religious Woman, who having a Cancer in her Breast; the most skilful Physitians doubted of the cure. But in her sleep she was admonished to repair unto the Font where she had been Baptized, and there to sign that place with the sign of the Cross, which she did, and was immediately healed of her Cancer. In the same Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he reports that a Friend of <hi>Hesperius</hi> did from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> send him some Earth that was taken out of the place where our Lord Christ had been buried; &amp; that <hi>Hesperius</hi> had no sooner received it but his House which before had been molested with Evil Spirits was rid of those troublesome guests. He gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth an account also, of strange Cures wrought by the Reliques of the Martyrs. It was not (he saith) known where the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of <hi>Protasius</hi> and <hi>Gervas</hi> (holy Martyrs) were buried; but <hi>Ambrose</hi> had it revealed to him in his sleep; and a blind Man approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Another was cured of Blindness by the Reliques of the Martyr <hi>Stephen.</hi> And a Child playing abroad, a Cart wheel run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him and bruised him, so that it was thought he would immediately expire; but his Mother carrying him into the House that was built to honour the memory of St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> life and health were miraculously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. Many other wonderful cures doth <hi>Austin</hi> there mention, as done by <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Reliques. But who seeth not that the hand of <hi>Joab</hi> was in all these things? For by this means Satan hath filled the World with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition. The Cross is worshipped; The Reliques of Martyrs are adored; The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to God alone is given to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The same method has the grand Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my observed, that so he might bring that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition of <hi>Iconolatry</hi> or Image Worship, which is so provoking to the jealous God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to repute amongst Christians. It would be endless to enumerate how many in Popish Countries have been cured of Diseases which for their sins God hath suffered the Devil to punish them with, by touching the Image of this or that Saint. Nay, some whose bodies have been possessed with evil Spirits, have in that way of Superstition found relief; in a
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:000373_0294_0FA55C3BF057B798"/>
more especial manner, when the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> hath been presented before persons Possessed, the Devil in them hath cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and shrieked after a fearful manner, as if he had been put to horrible torture at the sight of that Image, and so hath seemed to depart out of the miserable creature molested by him; and all this that so deluded Papists might be hardened in their Superstitious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that Image. Many such devices hath Satan to ensnare and ruin the Souls of Men. Some report that the Bodies of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates in the <hi>Greek Churches</hi> at this day, are strangely handled by the Devil, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death hath taken hold of them. M. <hi>Ricaut</hi> in his Relation of the present state of the <hi>Greek Churches,</hi> Page 279.<hi>&amp;c.</hi> saith that a grave <hi>Kaloir</hi> told him that to his own cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge, a person who fell under their Church-censure, after he had been for some time buried, the People where his corps lay interred, were affrighted with strange Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions, which they concluded arose from the Grave of the accursed Excommunicate, which thereupon was opened, and they found the Body uncorrupted, and replete with Blood, the Coffin furnished with Grapes, Nuts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> brought thither by infernal Spirits. The <hi>Kaloirs</hi> resolved to use the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy

In the mean time Prayers, and Masses, and Offerings were presented for the dead, and whilst they were performing these Services, on a sudden was heard a rumbling noise in the Coffin of the dead party. Which being opened, they found the body consumed and dissolved into dust, as if it had been Interred seven years. The hour and minute of this dissolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compared with the date of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> release when signed at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was found exactly to agree with that moment. If there be truth in this Relation, 'tis a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful evidence of Satans Reigning amongst a Superstitious People, who nevertheless call themselves Christians; and that he does by such means as these keep them under chains of darkness still. The Devil hath played such Reax as these are, not only amongst Christians but amongst the Gentiles of old. For <hi>Titus Latinus</hi> was warned in his sleep that he should declare unto the Senate that they must reniew their Stage-plays; he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to deliver his Message, was again by

Still persisting in his omission the <hi>Daemon</hi> again cometh to him, so that he was surprized with an acute and horrible dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease. Hereupon by counsel of his Friends, he was carried in his Bed into the Senate, and as soon as he had declared what he had seen, his Health was restored, that he returned home upon his feet: The issue was, Stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays were more in fashion than ever before. <hi>Augustin de civitate Dei, Lib.</hi>4. <hi>Cap.</hi>26.Learned men are not ignorant that strange Cures were effected amongst the Heathen by the use of <hi>Talismans,</hi> or <hi>Images;</hi> of which inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Zoroaster</hi> (the Father of Magicians) is supposed to be the first Author.

men of the error of their way) the like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils may no more be heard of amongst us; this notwithstanding, it may not be improper here to recite some facerious passages, which I have met with in <hi>Hemmingius</hi> his Discourse, <hi>De superstitione Magica,</hi> since they are to my present purpose, as discovering what delight the infernal Spirits take in drawing Men to make use of Superstitious means for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of health unto their bodies. The Learned Author mentioned, reports, that as he was instructing his Pupils in the Art of <hi>Logic,</hi> he had occasion to recite a couple of Verses consisting of nine Hobgoblin words, <hi>Fecana, cajeti, dephenes,</hi> &amp;c. adding by way of Joke, that those Verses would cure a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if every day a piece of Bread were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the sick person, with one of these words written upon it. A simple Fellow that stood by, thought <hi>Hemmingius</hi> had been in earnest in what he spoke, and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having a Servant that f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Others seeing the efficacy of the Amulet did the like, and many were cured of Feavers thereby. In the same Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:000373_0298_0FA55AEFBB2DA880"/>
                  <hi>P.</hi>908. <hi>Hemingius</hi> writeth of a knavish Scholar, that a certain Woman repairing to him for help, who was excedingly troubled with sore eyes, promising him a good reward for his cure, the Knave, though he had no skill, yet for lucre sake, he promised to effect the cure; and in order thereto taketh a Piece of Paper, and maketh therein Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, unto which he never saw the like be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, only then devised them, and writeth in great Letters these Abominable Words, <hi>Diabolus eruat tibi oculos, &amp; foramina stercoribus impleat.</hi> (The Papists say that their Saint <hi>Francis</hi> caused the Devil to depart out of a possessed person by using an a like bruitish ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.) He folded up the Paper in a cloth, requiring the diseased party to wear it about her neck, which she did and her disease was healed. After two years, being desirous to know what was in the Paper, she caused it to be opened and read; and being greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and inraged at this Indignity, cast the Paper away, immediately upon which her sore eyes returned again. Without doubt then, the <hi>Devils</hi> design in this cure, was to encourage the prophane <hi>Impostor</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the removal of diseases by like Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious and wicked practices, whereby his own and the Souls of others unto whom he should
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:000373_0299_0FA55AF072674648"/>
impart the Mystery, would be endangered. The like is to be affirmed concerning at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to heal diseases, by scratching suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Witches, or stopping Urin in Bottles, nailing of Horse-shoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may be the time will come, when they that have been thus foolish, will feel their own Consciences smiting them for what they have done. Let them remember the Example of that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and famous Gentlewoman, Mrs. <hi>Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood;</hi> the occasion of whose sorrowful and doleful desertion, was, in that having a Child sick, she asked counsel of a Wizard about its Recovery. Certainly, it is better for persons to repent of sin the procuring cause of all affliction, and by the prayer of Faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themselves to the Lord Jesus, the great Physitian both of body and soul, and so to wait for healing in the use of lawful means, until God shall see meet to bestow that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on them; I say this is better, than to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low such dark methods as those declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, wherein if they have found any suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, they may fear it is in wrathful judgment unto them or theirs. Some observe that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who receive present healing in such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful wayes, usually come to unhappy ends at last. Let me then conclude the Answer unto the case propounded with the words

                  </abbr> 
                  <hi>Whether it be lawful to bind persons suspected for Witches, and so cast them into the Water, in order to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a discovery of their innocency or guiltiness; so as that if they keep above the Water, they shall be deemed as confoederate with the Devil, but if they sink they are to be acquitted from the crime of Witchcraft.</hi> As for this way of purgation it cannot be denied but that some learned men have indulged it. King <hi>JAMES</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth of it, in his Discourse of Witch-craft <hi>B.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi>6. supposing that the water refur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to receive Witches into its Bosom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have perfidiously violated their Covenant with God, confirmed by Water in Baptism. <hi>Kornmannus</hi> and <hi>Scribonius</hi> do upon the same ground justifie this way of tryal. But a worthy <hi>Casuist</hi> of our own, giveth a judicious Reply to this supposed, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> that all Water is not the Water of Baptism, but that only which is used in the very act of Baptism. Moreover, according to this notion the <hi>Proba</hi> would serve only for such persons as have been Baptized, <hi>Wierus</hi> and <hi>Bodinus</hi> have
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:000373_0301_0FA55AF39EF82578"/>
written against this Experiment. So hath <hi>Hemmingius;</hi> who saith, that it is <hi>both supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and ridiculous.</hi> Likewise, that Learned Physitian <hi>John Heurnius</hi> has published a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, which he calls, <hi>Responsum ad supremam curiam Hollandiae nullum esse aequae innatatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem lamiarum indicium.</hi> That Book I have not seen, but I find it mentioned in <hi>Meursius</hi> his <hi>Athenae Batavae</hi> Amongst <hi>English</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, Dr. <hi>Cott</hi> hath endeavoured to shew the unlawfulness of using such a practice. Also Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> is so far from approving of this <hi>probation by cold water,</hi> as that he rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to think that the persons who put it in practice are themselves after a sort practisers of Witch-craft.

               <p n="1">1. This practice has no Foundation in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor in Scripture. If the Water will bear none but Witches, this must need proceed either from some natural or some super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural cause. No natural cause is or can be assigned why the bodies of such persons
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:000373_0302_0FA55AF4F9965AF8"/>
should swim rather than of any other. The Bodies of Witches have not lost their natural Properties, they have weight in them as well as others. Moral changes and viceousness of mind, make no alteration as to these na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural proprieties which are inseparable from the body. Whereas some pretend that the Bodies of Witches are possessed with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and on that account are uncapable of sinking under the water; <hi>Malderus</hi> his reply is rational, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> that the Allegation has no solidity in it, witness the <hi>Gadarens</hi> Hoggs, which were no sooner possessed with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil but they ran into the Water, and there perished. But if the experiment be superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, it must either be Divine or Diabolical. It is not divine; for the Scripture does no where appoint any such course to be taken to find out whether persons are in league with the Devil or no. It remains then that the experiment is Diabolical. If it be said, that the Devil has made a compact with Wizards, that they shall not be drowned, and by that means that Covenant is discovered; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy is, we may not in the least build upon the Devils word. By this Objection the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ultimately resolved into a Diabolical Faith. And shall that cast the scale, when the lives of men are concerned? Suppose
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:000373_0303_0FA55AF5C33A5310"/>
the Devil saith these persons are Witches, must the Judge therefore condemn them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Experience hath proved this to be a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious way of trying Witches, therefore it ought not to be practised. Thereby guilty persons may happen to be acquitted, and the innocent to be condemned. The Devil may have power to cause supernatation on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a person that never made any compact with him. And many times known and convicted Wizards have sunk under the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when thrown thereon. In the <hi>Bohemian</hi> History mention is made of several Witches, who being tried by cold water were as much subject to submersion as any other persons. <hi>Delrio</hi> reports the like of another Witch. And <hi>Godelmannus</hi> speaks of six Witches in whom this way of trial failed. <hi>Malderus</hi> saith It has been known that the very same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons being often brought to this probation by Water, did at one time swim and another time sink; and this difference has sometimes hapned according to the different persons making the experiment upon them; in which respect one might with greater reason con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the persons who used the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were Witches, then that the persons tried were so.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This way of purgation is to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:000373_0304_0FA55AF6903B8098"/>
of, like other provocations or appeals to the Judgement of God; invented by men: such as <hi>Camp-fight, Explorations by hot water, &amp;c.</hi> In former times it hath been customary (and I suppose tis so still among the <hi>Norwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi>) that the suspected party was to put his hand into scalding water, and if he received no hurt thereby then was he reputed inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; but if otherwise, judged as guilty. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, the trial by <hi>fire Ordeal</hi> has been used in our Nation in times of Darkness. Thus <hi>Emma</hi> the Mother of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, was led barefoot and blindfold over certain hot irons, and not hapning to touch any of them, was judged innocent of the crime which some suspected her as guilty of. And <hi>Kunegund</hi> Wife to the Emperour <hi>Henry II.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accused of Adultery, to clear her self, did in a great and honourable Assembly take up seven glowing irons one after onother with her bare hand, and had no harm thereby. These bloody kind of Experiments are now generally banished out of the World. It is pity the <hi>Ordeal</hi> by cold water is not exploded with the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This <hi>vulgar probation</hi> (as it useth to be called) was first taken up in times of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, being (as before was hinted of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Magical Impostures) propagated from
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:000373_0305_0FA55AF73A210EC8"/>
                  <hi>Pagans</hi> to <hi>Papists,</hi> who would (as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from <hi>Bernards</hi> 66 Serm. <hi>in Cantica</hi>) sometimes bring those that were under suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion for Heresie unto their Purgation in this way. We know that our <hi>Ancestors,</hi> the old <hi>Pagan Saxons</hi> had amongst them four sorts of <hi>Ordeal</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Trial or <hi>Judgement</hi> as the <hi>Saxon</hi> word signifies) whereby when sufficient proof was wanting, they sought (according as the Prince of darkness had instructed them) to find out the truth concerning su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected persons, one of which <hi>Ordeals</hi> was this, the persons surmised to be guilty, having Cords tied under their Arms, were thrown with it into some River, to see whether they would sink or swim. So that this Probation was not originally confined to Witches, but others supposed to be Criminals were thus to be tried: but in some Countries they thought meet thus to examine none but those who have been suspected for familiarity with the Devil. That this custom was in its first rise Superstitious is evident from the Ceremonies of old used about it. For the <hi>Proba</hi> is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, except the person be cast into the Water with his right hand tied to his left foot. Also, by the Principle which some approvers of this Experiment alledge to confirm their fansies; their Principle is, <hi>Nihil quod per

This is as true as <hi>Lucian</hi>'s Relation about his own being by Witch-craft transformed into an Asse; and I suppose both are as true as that cold water will discover who are Witches.

this kind of trial by Water, was put down in <hi>Paris</hi> A. D. 1594. by the supream Court there. Some learned <hi>Papists</hi> have ingenuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged that such <hi>Probations</hi> are Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious. It is confessed that they are so, by <hi>Tyraeus, Binsfeldius, Delrio,</hi> and by <hi>Malde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus de magia,</hi> Tract. 10. <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Dub.</hi> 11. who saith, that they who shall practise this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, and pass a judgement of Death upon any persons on this account, will (without repentance) be found guilty of Murder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</p>
               <p>It was in my thoughts to have handled some other Cases of the like nature with these insisted on: but upon further consideration, I suppose it less needful, the practices which have given occasion for them being so grosly Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious, as that they are ashamed to show their heads openly. The <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Magicians amongst the Heathen Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of old practised a sort of <hi>Divination</hi> by <hi>Sieves</hi> (which kind of <hi>Magic</hi> is called <hi>Coscino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantia</hi>) The like Superstition has been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Popish Countries, where they have been wont to utter some words of Scripture, and the Names of certain Saints over a <hi>Sieve,</hi> that so they might by the motion thereof, know where something stollen or lost was to be found. Some also have believed that if
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:000373_0308_0FA55AFA1CEC57B8"/>
they should cast Lead into the Water, then <hi>Saturn</hi> would discover to them the thing they enquired after. It is not <hi>Saturn</hi> but <hi>Satan</hi> that maketh the discovery, when any thing is in such a way revealed. And of this sort is the foolish Sorcery of those Women that put the white of an Egg into a Glass of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that so they may be able to divine of what Occupation their future Husbands shall be. It were much better to remain ignorant than thus to consult with the Devil. These kind of practices appear at first blush to be Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; so that I shall not multiply Words in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the evil of them. It is noted that <hi>the Children of Israel did secretly those things that are not right against the Lord their God,</hi> 2 King.17.9.

I shall in this Chapter only take notice of two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars amongst our selves, with some parallel Instances which have hapned in other parts of the World. I am informed that there is now at <hi>Weymouth</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> a Man and his Wife who are both of them Deaf, and
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:000373_0310_0FA55AFC83596818"/>
that the Woman had been so from her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; and yet that she understands as much concerning the state of the Countrey, and of particular persons therein, and of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable occurrences, as almost any one of her Sex; and (which is more wonderful) though she is not able to speak a word, she has by signs made it appear that she is not ignorant of <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, nor of Man's misery by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor of Redemption by Christ, and the great concernments of Eternity, and of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, and that she her self has had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of a work of Conversion in her own Soul. I have made enquiry about this matter of some that are fully acquainted therewith, and have from a good hand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this following account. <q>
                     <hi>Matthew Prat</hi> aged about fifty five years, was in his minority by his godly Parents educated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously, and taught to read: When he was about twelve years old, he became to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Deaf by sickness, and so hath ever since continued; after the loss of his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was taught to write: his Reading and Writing he retaineth perfectly, &amp; makes much good improvement of both, but his Speech is very broken, and imperfect, not easily intelligible; he maketh use of it more seldom; only to some few that are wonted
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:000373_0311_0FA55AFDD92D8A98"/>
to it. He discourseth most by Signs, and by Writing. He is studious and judicious in matters of Religion, hath been in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowship, a partaker of all Ordinances near thirty years, hath approved himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good satisfaction therein, in all wayes of Church Communion, both in publick and private; and judged to be a well wrought Convert and real Christian. <hi>Sarab Prat</hi> his Wife, being about forty three years old, was also quite deprived of Hearing by sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, when about the third year of her Age, after she could speak, and had begun to learn Letters, having quite lost Hearing, she lost all speech (doubtless all remembrance and understanding of Words and Language,) her Religious Parents being both dead, her godly Brother <hi>Ephraim Hunt</hi> (yet surviving) took a Fatherly care of her, she also happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell under the Guardianship and Tuition of the Reverend Mr. <hi>Thomas Thacher,</hi> who laboured with design to teach her to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Speech or Language by Writing, but it was never observed that any thing was really effected; she hath a notable accuracy and quickness of understanding by the Eye, she discourseth altogether by signs, they that are able to discourse with her in that way, will communicate any matter much more
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:000373_0312_0FA55AFF4C4D46D8"/>
speedily (and as full) as can be by Speech, and she to them. Her Children sign from the Breast, and learn to speak by their eyes and fingers sooner than by their tongues. She was from her Child-hood naturally so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and susceptible of good civil Education, but had no knowledge of a Deity, or of any thing that doth concern another life and world. Yet God hath of his infinite mercy, revealed Himself, his Son, and the great Mysteries of Salvation unto her by an Extraordinary and more immoderate work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Spirit (as tis believed) in a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work of Conversion. An account of her Experience was taken from her in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by her Husband; upon which she was Examined by the Elders of the Church, they improving her Husband and two of her Sisters, intelligent persons, and notably skill'd in her artificial Language; by whose help they attained good satisfaction, that she understandeth all the Principles of Religion: Those of the Unity of the Divine Essence, Trinity of Persons, the Personal Union, the Mystical Union, they made most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent enquiry about, and were satisfied that her Knowledge and Experience was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and sound, and they hoped saving. She was under great exercise of Spirit, and
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:000373_0313_0FA55AFF7333D960"/>
most affectionately concerned for and about her Soul, her Spiritual and Eternal estate. She imparted her self to her Friends, and expressed her desire of help. She made use of the Bible and other good Books, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t such places and passages as suited her condition, and that with tears; she did once in her Exercise, write with a Pin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Trencher three times over, <hi>Ah poor Soul!</hi> and therewithal burst forth into tears, before divers of her Friends. She hath been wont to enquire after the Text, and when it hath been shewed to her to look and muse upon it. She knoweth most, if not all persons Names that she hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with. If Scripture Names, will readily turn and point to them in the Bible. It may be conceived, that although she understands neither Words, Letters, nor Language; yet she understands things Hieroglyphically. The Letters and Words are unto her but signs of the things, and as it were Hieroglyphicks. She was very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of Church-Communion in all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and was admitted with general and good satisfaction, and hath approved her self to the best observation, a grave and gracious Woman. They both attend pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship with much reverence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:000373_0314_0FA55B004D0947C0"/>
and are very inoffensive (and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers respects) exemplary in their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</q> Thus far is that Narrative, written <hi>June</hi> 27. 1683.</p>
               <p>I suppose no one that rightly consider the Circumstances of this Relation will make a scruple about the lawfulness of admitting such Persons to participate in the Holy Mysteries of Christ's Kingdom. All judicious <hi>Casuists</hi> determine, that those who were either born, or by any accident made Deaf and Dumb, if their Conversation be blameless, and they able by sign; (which are Analogous to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal expressions) to declare their knowledge and faith; may as freely be received to the Lords Supper, as any that shall orally make the like Profession.

Its certain that some such have been made to understand the Mysteries of the Gospel, so as to suffer Martyrdome on that account.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1620, one that was Leaf and
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:000373_0315_0FA55B00F780B1C8"/>
Dumb, being solicited by the <hi>Papists</hi> to be present at <hi>Masse,</hi> chose rather to suffer death. It is also a thing known, that Men are able by signs to discourse, and to communicate their sentiments one to another. There are above thirty <hi>Mutes</hi> kept in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court for the Grand Seignior to sport with: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom Mr. <hi>Ricaut</hi> in his History of the present State of the <hi>Ottoman Empire</hi> (<hi>P.</hi>62.) reports, that they are able by signs not only to signifie their sence in familiar Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, but to recount Stories, and understand the Fables of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Religion, the Laws and Precepts of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> the Name of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and what else may be capable of being expressed by the tongue. This Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Mutes</hi> is so much in fashion in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, that almost every one can deliver his sense in it. And that Deaf persons have been sometimes able to write, and to understand what others say to them by the very motion of their Lips is most certain. <hi>Camerarius</hi> tells us of a young Man and a Maid then living at <hi>Noremberg,</hi> who though Deaf and Dumb, could Read and Write, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>pher, and by the motion of a mans Lips, knew his meaning. <hi>Platerus</hi> speaketh of one Deaf and Dumb born, that yet could express his mind in a Table-book, and understood
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:000373_0316_0FA55B01B97175A8"/>
what others wrote therein, and was wont to attend upon the Ministry of <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> understanding many things by the motion of the lips of the Preacher. Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> in his Examples (<hi>Vol.</hi>1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.) saith, that there was a Woman in <hi>Edinburg</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> (her Name was <hi>Gennet Lowes</hi>) who being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Deaf and Dumb, could understand what People said meerly by the moving of their Lips. It is famously known that Mr. <hi>Crisp</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> could do the like. <hi>Borellus</hi> giveth an account of one that lost his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a violent Disease when he was five years old, yet if they did but whisper to him, he could by their Lips perceive what they said. There is one now living (or that not many years since was so) in <hi>Silesia</hi> in whom that Disease of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> caused a total Deafness; who nevertheless, by exact obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the motion of Mens Lips, can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what they say; and if they do but Whisper he perceives what they say better than if they vociferate never so loudly. He attends upon publick Sermons, being able to give an account of what is delivered, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he may but see the Preacher speaking, though he cannot hear a word. It is consistent with reason that <hi>Mutes</hi> should understand what others say by the motion of their Lips,
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:000373_0317_0FA55B02DA0ECE90"/>
since it is evident that the lips are of great use in framing Speech. Hence <hi>Job</hi> calls his speech, <hi>the moving of his lips,</hi> Chap.16. <hi>Ver.</hi>5, and we know that tongueless persons by the help of their lips and other Organs of speech have been able to speak. Ecclesiastical story informs us of several Confessors of the truth, who after their Tongues were cut out by bloody Persecutors could still bear witness to the truth. <hi>Hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>richius</hi> (that cruel King of the <hi>Vandals</hi>) caused the Tongues of many to be violently pluckt out of their mouths; Who after that could speak as formerly: Only two of them when they became guilty of the sin of Uncleanness were able to speak no more; this has been attested by three cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Witnesses who knew the persons: See Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s <hi>Church History,</hi> P. 130. There is lately Published (in <hi>Latin</hi>) a very strange Relation of a Child in <hi>France</hi> (his Name was <hi>Peter Durand</hi>) who being visited with the <hi>Small Pox</hi> when he was about six years old, his Tongue putrified, and was quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed. After which (the <hi>Uvula</hi> in his Mouth being longer than it was before) he could by the help of the other Organs of Speech discourse as plainly as if he had never lost his Tongue. These things are marvellous. And yet I have lately met with a passage
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:000373_0318_0FA55B03439B7A28"/>
more strange than any of these related. There is (or was in the Year 1679.) living near <hi>Kerchem</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> a Man (his name is <hi>John Algair</hi>) who suddenly lost the use of his Speech: the case has been so with him, that fourteen years together, he can never speak but at one hour of the Day, just as the Sun cometh to the Meridian he has the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of his Speech for an hour and no more; so that he knoweth exactly when it is twelve a Clock, because then he can speak, and not a minute before that, nor a minute after one. This is related in the <hi>Germanic Ephemerides</hi> of <hi>Miscellaneous Curiosities,</hi> for the Year 1679. <hi>Observat.</hi> 188. It is evident that the Sun has a marvelous influence as to some Diseases, which the bodies of Men are subject unto. For in <hi>Egypt</hi> though the Plague rage the day before, on that very day when the Sun enters into <hi>Leo,</hi> it ceaseth, when also the Floods of <hi>Nilus</hi> abate, as Geographers inform us.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is possible by Art to teach those that are by nature Deaf and Dumb to speak. The <hi>Dectylogy</hi> of <hi>Beda</hi> is pretty, whereby Men speak as nimbly with the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as with the tongue; taking five fingers of the one hand for Vowels, and the several positions of the other for Consonants. But that Deaf persons may learn to speak, happy
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:000373_0319_0FA55B049A107088"/>
experience hath proved, and that by many Instances. A <hi>Castro</hi> has given an account of the method by him successfully observed in teaching a Boy to speak that was born Deaf. After the use of some purgative me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, he caused the Hair to be shaved off from his head, over the <hi>Coronal suture;</hi> and then frequently anointed the shaven place with a mixture of <hi>Aqua vitae, Salt peter, Oyl of Butter, Almonds,</hi> &amp;c. Having done this, he began to speak to the deaf person (not at his Ear, but) at his <hi>Coronal suture;</hi> and there after the use of Unctions and Emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions the sound would pierce, when at his Ears it could not enter, so did he by degrees teach him to speak (<hi>vide Ephem. German. Anno</hi> 1670. <hi>Observat.</hi> 35.) But others have with good effect, followed another kind of method. There was a <hi>Spanish</hi> Noble Man (Brother to the Constable of <hi>Castile</hi>) who being born Deaf and consequently Dumb from his Infancy, Physitians had long in vain tried Experiments for his Relief. At last a certain Priest undertook to teach him to speak. His attempt was at first laughed at, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while the Gentleman was able (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his Deafness still remained) to converse and discourse with any Friend. he was taught to speak by putting a cord about
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:000373_0320_0FA55B05F4D99E08"/>
his Neck, and straitning or losening the same, to advertise him when to open or shut his Mouth, by the Example of his Teacher. <hi>N</hi>or was there any difference found between his Speech and that of other Men, only that he did not regulate his voice, speaking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly too high (<hi>vid.</hi> Conferences of <hi>Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osi P.</hi>215.) Not long since <hi>Fran. Mercur. Helmont,</hi> designing to teach a Deaf man to speak, concluded it would be more easily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable if the experiment were made with an Eastern wide-mouthed Language, which does remarkably expose to the Eye the motions of the Lips, Tongue and Throat. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he tried with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue; &amp; in a short time his Dumb Schollar became an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Hebrician.</hi> Others have lately been as successful in their attempts to cause Deaf persons to speak and understand the <hi>Europaean</hi> Languages. We need not go out of our own Nation, for there we find living Instances. In the Philosophical Transactions for the Year 1670. <hi>Numb.</hi>61. an account is given concerning Mr. <hi>Daniel Whaley</hi> of <hi>North-Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> who by an accident lost his Hearing when he was about five years or age; and so his Speech, not at once, but by degrees in about half a years time. In the Year 1661. The Learned and Ingenious Dr.

                  <hi>Wallis</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> undertook to teach the Deaf Gentleman to speak and write. Nor did the Doctor fail in attaining his end. For in the space of one year, the Dumb man had read over great part of the <hi>English</hi> Bible, and had attained so much skill as to express himself intelligibly in ordinary affairs, to understand Letters written to him, and to write Answers to them. And when Forreigners out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity came to visit him, he was able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the most difficult words of their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (even <hi>polish</hi> it self) which any could propose unto him. Nor was this the only person on whom the Doctor she <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> his skill, but he has since done the like for another (a Gentleman of a very good Family) who did from his Birth want his Hearing. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Dr. <hi>Holder</hi> in his late Book about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural production of Letters, giveth Rules for the teaching of the Deaf and Dumb to speak.</p>
               <p>I have the rather mentioned these things; for that there are several others in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey who are Deaf and Dumb; whenas if they had an ingenious Instructor, I am abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly satisfied that they might be taught to speak, their Deafness notwithstanding. Nor is this more difficult than it is to learn those that are blind to write; which though some may think it impossible and incredible, there

                  </abbr> Lieutenant <hi>Collier</hi>) who about sixteen years ago, being sensible of pain in his throat, made use of the common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies in that case, but to little effect. At last the pain about those parts became very extream, especially when he drank any Beer, nor was he able to swallow without much

difficulty, so that he lived upon Water and liquid Substances. After he had been for some time in this misery, a Stone appeared under his Tongue, which though visible to the Eye, continued there for some dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was taken out; and at last of it self fell into his mouth, (and so into his hands) leaving an hole behind it at the Roof of his Tongue. This Stone I have by me, whilest I write this, only some part of it is broken away; that which remains, weighs twelve Grains. The person concerned, affirms, that it was first of a yellowish Colour, but now it is white, not being an inch in length, in shape somewhat resembling a Mans Tongue. But that which made the matter the more strange, was, that when he had occasion to void Urin, he was in as much pain as if the Stone had been in his Bladder or Kidney; for when his Urin passed from him, he was usually put into a Sweat with pain and anguish; the reason whereof I shall leave unto the more curious Inquisitors into Nature to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. There are <hi>Lapideous Humors</hi> in the Bodies of men, occasioned sometimes by Colds, sometimes by ill Diet which are apt to become Stones. It is related by the late <hi>German Curiosi,</hi> that in the year 1655. a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of quality in <hi>Dantzick</hi> was much affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

with a painful Tumor in his Tongue, a skilful Chirurgeon perceiving a Stone there, cut it out, upon which the Patient recovered, the Stone being as big as a small <hi>Olive.</hi> The like hapned to another in the Year 1662. Again in the Year 1678. a Gentlewoman in <hi>Grunberg,</hi> having been for several Years in the Spring and in the Fall afflicted with a pain in her tongue, at last the pain became intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, untill a Stone as big as a a <hi>Filbord.</hi> Nut came out of her Tongue, upon which she had ease. In the <hi>Philosophical Transactions</hi> for the Year 1672. <hi>Page</hi> 4062. an account is given of a Man in <hi>England</hi> who had a Stone breeding under his Tongue, occasioned by his suffering much cold in a Winter Sea-Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Not long after his Landing, he found an hard lump in the place where the Stone was generated. There were eight years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the time of the Stones first breeding and its being taken away. Upon a fresh cold-taking he suffered much pain, but when his cold was over his pain ceased. At last it caused a swelling about his throat, especially at the first draught of Beer at Meals. The last Summer of his affliction, the Stone cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to be vertiginous; and some dayes, before its excision, such an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

his Mouth, as would presently wet all the Bed about him. The Stone weiged but seven Grains, being much of the shape of our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Horse-beans. This Stone was by ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Observators judged to be one of those Tumors called <hi>Atheroma,</hi> and therefore the Name they would have it called by, is <hi>Lapis Atheromatis.</hi> Stones have been taken out of the Joynts of many Gouty persons, some cold Imposthumes arising in their joynts before. <hi>Sennertus, Platerus, Bartholinus, Skenckius,</hi> and other learned Men have observed that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bodies are subject to putrification in every part of them, and many notable Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to this purpose are mentioned in the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Transactions at <hi>London;</hi> and by the <hi>Curiosi</hi> in forreign Countries. I presume it will not be unacceptable unto such as have not those Books, for me to relate some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples out of them to our present purpose. There was then, a Man who being troubled with a <hi>Catarrh</hi> and obstruction of Urin, when a Vein was opened there came four Stones out of it.

In the same year there was an Ox near <hi>Padua,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which could by no means be made fat; but was observed to be strangely stupid, and to hold down his head after an unusual manner; they that killed him, found that his Brains were petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, being as hard as Marble.

for some years Consumptive, after his Death the Physitians opened him, and found in the midst of his heart (which was very much dried) a Bone like an Almond, perfectly expressing the genuine Effigies of the dead Gentleman, representing his very Beard, and all the features of his face of exactly, as that it was not possible for any Artist to have drawn a Picture more like the Person, than Nature had performed in this Bone (<hi>vide Germ.

Nor is that much less prodigious which <hi>Albosius</hi> reports concerning a Tailors Wife (her Name was <hi>Columba Chatry</hi>) who having conceived with Child, the usual time for Delivery being come, was in great pain, and other symptoms of Birth appeared, yet she was never Delivered, but lived twenty eight years in much misery, still retaining her Burden.

since a Woman who having drunk <hi>Stagnating</hi> Water out of a Pond where Frogs used to keep, grew <hi>Cachectical,</hi> and swelled so as that she was thought to be <hi>Hydropical.</hi> One Evening walking near the Ponds where the Frogs cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, she perceived Frogs to croke in her Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

Of this some account is given by Mr. <hi>Thacher,</hi> in the first Chapter of our present Collection.

Accidents. In the Moneth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> it having rained a great part of the day, at night it froze extreamly, so as that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Limbs were broken off from many Trees by the weight of the Ice, caused by the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den friezing of the Rain upon the Boughs. It was somewhat formidable to hear the crackings made a good part of the night, by the falling of so much Wood (thousands of Cords) as was by that means occasioned. Of later years several places in this Countrey have been visited with strange and awful Tempests. That was very Remarkable which hapned in <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>New-England, July</hi> 8. 1680.

Afterwards as it pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed towards <hi>Matthew Bridge</hi>'s House, it tore down some Trees and Indian Corn, and there rose up into the Air for the space of a quarter of a Mile; afterwards it came down upon the Earth in a more violent manner; the effects whereof he saw not, but it may be known by the following Relation.</q>

                  <q>
                     <hi>Matthew Bridge</hi> who was an Eye-witness of what hapned, Declares that he observed a thick Cloud coming along his Fathers Field before his house, as to appearance ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry black; in the inside of the Cloud as it passed over him, there seemed to be a light Pillar as he judged about eight or ten Foot diameter, which seemed to him like a Screw
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:000373_0335_0FA55B160CAD3188"/>
or solid Body. Its motion was continually circular, which turned about the rest of the Cloud. It passed along upon the Ground, tearing all before it, Bushes by the roots, yea the Earth it self, removing old Trees as they lay along on the Earth, and Stones of a great magnitude, some of which could not be found again: great Trees were twisted and torn down, and carried a distance from the place where they were; Branches of Trees, containing about a Load of Wood, were blown from their Bodies, and carried forty yards or more. The Cloud it self was filled with Stones, Bushes, Boughs, and other things that it had taken up from the Earth, so that the top and sides of the Cloud seemed like a green Wood. After it went from him, it went a mile and half before it scattered, bearing down the Trees before it above a Mile in breadth; passing through a thick Swamp of <hi>Spruse, Pine,</hi> and other young Trees (which was about half a mile through) it laid all flat to the ground, yet the Trees being young, are since risen up: it was observable as it passed through a new planted Orchard, it not only pulled up some of the young Trees by the roots, but broke off some of them in the bodies, about two or three foot high, as if they had been

shot off not hurting the Stocks. Moreover, there was such a great noise made by the Storm, that other considerable noises at the same time, as falling of very great Trees ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near one, could not be heard. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove said <hi>Matth. Bridge,</hi> and a Boy with him endeavoured to run to the House, but were prevented by the Storm, so that they were necessitated to ly flat upon the Ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind some Bushes, and this thick Cloud and Pillar passed so near them as almost to touch their feet, and with its force bent the Bushes down over them, and yet their lives were preserved. <hi>John Robbins</hi> a Servant Man was suddenly slain by this Storm, his Body being much bruised, and many Bones bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the violence thereof.</q> Thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that.</p>
               <p>The last year was attended with sundry Remarkable Tempests in several parts of this Countrey. One of which hapned in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Haven</hi> Colony, <hi>June</hi> 10.1682. Concerning which I have received from a good hand the following account. This Storm began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 2. <hi>h. P. M.</hi> and continued two hours. It reached <hi>Stratford, Milford, Fairfield, New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Haven,</hi> and it was very violent in every one of these places, especially <hi>Milford,</hi> where three Barns were blown down by it, and one
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:000373_0337_0FA55B1789B6E0A0"/>
House new built, that was forty foot in length, well inclosed, was moved from the Foundation at one corner, near two foot and an half; but the greatest strength of the Storm was about six miles above <hi>Stratford,</hi> as is evident by the great Havock, that is there made, for the compass of half a mile in breadth, scarce a Tree left standing, which is not shaken by the Storm; the strongest Oaks are torn up by the roots, sometwo foot, some three foot and more over; young Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins that were not so big as a Mans middle, were broken off in the midst: This Storm came out of the West, and the Wind did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end somewhat vere towards the North; it was attended with a violent Rain: the very noise of the Wind in the Woods, was such, as that those that were in it could not hear the fall of a Tree a few Rods from them. Great Limbs of Trees were carried like Feathers in the Air an incredible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Trees they were broken from: Many that were at work in the Woods were in great danger, and had no way to preserve themselves but by running into open Plains, where there were no Trees. The strength of the Storm passed along East and by South, over <hi>Stratford River,</hi> and between <hi>Milford</hi> and <hi>New-Haven,</hi> and there it passed away
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:000373_0338_0FA55B1AD546F9C8"/>
into the Sound towards <hi>Long-Island:</hi> Many thousands of Trees were blown down both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and below the place before specified, but in the compass of that half mile, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est strength of the Storm was; for here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most there was an universal Destruction of all the Trees, leaving the place upon Hills so naked that very few Trees are found standing. Thus of that Tempest.</p>
               <p>Also, on <hi>June</hi> 26. 1682. there were the most amazing Lightnings that have been known in <hi>New-England,</hi> a great part of the night being thereby made as light as the Day. In some places grievous Hail fell with the Lightning, breaking the Windows of some Houses. But at <hi>Springfield</hi> it was most dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, where great pieces of Ice, some seven, some nine inches about, fell down from the Clouds with such violence that the Shingles upon some Houses were broken thereby, and holes beat into the Ground, that a man might put his hand in. Several acres of Corn (both Wheat and Indian) were beat down and destroyed by the Hail. Yet this Hail-storm (though terrible) was not comparable to that which hapned three years ago in another part of the World, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> at the Town of <hi>Blois</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where the People were by the amazing fury of a prodigious Tempests af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:000373_0339_0FA55B1C3562FE00"/>
out of their sleep, and forced to rise out of their Beds that they might save their lives. Several Houses, and two (Churches) Meeting-houses, were beat down to the ground. This Tempest was likewise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a most prodigious Hail, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousand stones being found as big as a Mans fist. This unusual Artillery of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, broke all the Slates wherewith the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were covered, and the Glass-windows, all over the Town, as if they had been beaten in a Morter. Without the Town eight whole Parishes with the Fields adjacent were wholly ruined by that Hail, in such a terrible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that it seemed as if no Corn had been sown, or Vines planted there. Four other Parishes were much endamaged, multitudes of Chimneys beaten down, so that the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage thereby, with the breaking of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Tyles, were valued to be above two hundred thousand Crowns; and the harm in the Vineyards, and Corn-fields in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable. The Divine Providence was very much seen, in that Man, Woman nor Child were killed in this fearful Desolation. The Reader may see a more full Relation of this prodigious Hail-storm in Mr. <hi>Burton</hi>'s surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Miracles of Nature, <hi>Page</hi> 180,181. As for those sudden Gusts wherewith part of

                  <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and several Towns near <hi>New-Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> were Alarm'd, the like hapned at a place in <hi>England,</hi> fourteen years ago; the account whereof may be seen in the <hi>Philosophical Transactions</hi> Numb.17. <hi>Page</hi> 2156. which I shall here insert. It is that which followeth, <hi>Octob.</hi> 30. 1669. betwixt five and six of the Clock in the Evening, the Wind Westerly, at <hi>Ashley</hi> in <hi>North-Hampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> hapned a formidable <hi>Hurricane,</hi> scarce bearing sixty yards in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Its first discern'd assault was upon a Milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Maid, taking her Pail and Hat from off her Head; and carrying it many scores of yards from her, where it lay undiscovered some dayes. Next, it storm'd the Yard of one <hi>Sprigge,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Westthorp</hi> (a name of one part of the Town) where it blew a Wagon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body off of the Axel-trees, breaking the Wheels and Axel-trees in pieces, and blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three of the Wheels so shattered over a Wall. The Wagon stood somewhat cross to the passage of the Wind. Another Wagon of Mr. <hi>Salisburies</hi> marched with great speed upon its Wheels against the side of his House to the astonishment of the Inhabitants. A branch of an <hi>Ash-tree</hi> of that bigness that two lusty Men could scarce lift it, blew over

Mr. <hi>Salisburies</hi> House without hurting it, and yet this Branch was torn from a Tree, an hundred yards distant from that House. A Slate was found upon a Window of the house of <hi>Samuel Templer</hi>

               <p>Thus much concerning Remarkable <hi>Tempests.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Earthquakes</hi> deserve to be mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst <hi>Remarkable Providences,</hi> since <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> himself could say; that the Man is stupid and unreasonable who is not affected with them. This part of the World hath not been altogether free from such tremendous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; albeit, through the gracious providence of God) there never was yet any harm done amongst us thereby, so far as I have heard. The Year 1638. was attended with a considerable <hi>Earth-quake.</hi> There are who affirm that they heard a strange kind of noise before the Earth began to tremble. Another <hi>Earth-quake</hi> was observed in some parts of <hi>New-England, Anno Domini</hi> 1658. Also in in the Year 1662. on the 26, 27, and 28 of <hi>January,</hi> the Earth was shaken at least six times in the space of three dayes. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that upon the first approach of the <hi>Earth-quake,</hi> the things on the Shelves in the House began to move. Many People ran out of their Houses with fear and amazement: but no House fell, nor was any damage su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:000373_0343_0FA55B1FE505AD28"/>
stained. There was another <hi>Earth-quakes April</hi> 3. 1668. We in <hi>Boston</hi> were sensible of it, but some other parts of the Countrey were more terribly shaken. The <hi>Indians</hi> say that the <hi>Earth-quake</hi> this year, did stop the course of a considerable River. It is also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that amongst the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Nova-Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> there hapned an <hi>Earth-quake</hi> which rent an huge Rock asunder to the center, wherein was a vast hollow of an immeasurable depth. Concerning <hi>Earth-quakes</hi> which have lately hapned in remoter parts of the World, I shall not here insert any thing, having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned them in my <hi>Discourse of Comets,</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the last year. Only therein I have not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of that memorable <hi>Earth-quake,</hi> in <hi>France May</hi> 12. 1682. having received Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning it more lately. Such Readers as are inquisitive into things of this nature, may see that <hi>Earth-quake</hi> described &amp; discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on, in the <hi>Weekly Memorials for the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Page</hi> 125, &amp;c. Remarkable was that which hapned <hi>A. D.</hi> 1670. at a place called <hi>Kene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunck,</hi> in the <hi>Province of Main</hi> in <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> where not far from the River side a piece of Clay Ground, was thrown up over the top of high Oakes that grew between it and the River, into the River, stopping the course thereof, and leaving an hole forty
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:000373_0344_0FA55B20AA6D7B10"/>
yards square, wherein were thousands of clay Bullets, like Musket Bullets. It is also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that the like to this hapned at <hi>Casco</hi> (twenty miles to the Eastward of the other place) much about the same time: Whether the removal of this ground did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from an <hi>Earth-quake,</hi> or by the eruption of Mineral Vapors, or from some other cause, may be disputed. They that would give a probable conjecture concerning the natural cause, must first know whether a great Drought, or much Rain, or both suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively, did not proceed, of which I am not informed. The like Memorable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents have hapned in several places in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> both in the former, and in this present age; which it may be twill be pleasing and edifying to some Readers for me here to commemorate. To proceed. The like to what hath been related, fell out 1571. in <hi>Hereford-shire; Marcley Hill,</hi> in the East part of the Shire; with a roaring noise, removed it self from the place where it stood, and for three dayes together travelled from its old <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="325" facs="unknown:000373_0345_0FA55B2152637178"/>
and Trees, whereof some were overturned, and some that stood upon the Plain are firmly growing upon the Hill, those that were East were turned West, and those in the West were set in the East. In this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it overthrew <hi>Kinnaston Chappel,</hi> and turned two High-wayes near an hundred yards from their old paths. The Ground that thus removed was about twenty six Acres, which opening it self with Rocks and all, bore the Earth before it for four hundred yards space, without any stay, leaving Pastu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in place of the Tillage, and the Tillage overspread the Pasturage. Lastly overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its lower parts, it mounted to an Hill of twelve Fathom high, and there rested, after three dayes Travel. Again on the third of <hi>January,</hi> A. D. 1582. at <hi>Hermitage</hi> in <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set-shire,</hi> a place of ground of three Acres, removed from its old place (as is testified by <hi>Stow</hi> in his <hi>Summary</hi>) and was carried over another Closure where Alders and Willows grew, the space of forty Rod or Perches, and stopped the High-way that led to <hi>Corne,</hi> and the Hedges that it was inclosed with, inclose it still, and the Trees stand bolt upright, and the place where this Ground was before, is left like a great Pit. Also on the fourth of <hi>August</hi> 1585. at <hi>Metingham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> after a
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:000373_0346_0FA55B220F96A960"/>
very violent Tempest of Thunder and Rain, the Ground suddenly began to sink, and three great Elms growing upon it, were carried so deep into the Earth, that no part of them could any more be seen. The Hole left is in compass eighty yards, and a Line of fifty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom plummed into it finds no bottom. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>December</hi> 18. 1596. a mile and half from <hi>Westram</hi> Southward (which is not many miles from <hi>Motingam</hi>) two Closes lying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, separated, with an Hedge of Hollow Ashes; there was found a part thereof twelve Pearches long, to be sunk six foot and and an half deep; the next morning fifteen foot more; the third morning eighty foot more at the least, and so daily that great Trench of Ground containing in length about eighty Pearches, and in breadth twenty eight, began with the Trees and Hedges on it, to lose it self from the rest of the Ground lying round about it, and withal to move and shoot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward day and night for eleven dayes. The Ground of two Water-pits, the one six foot deep of Water, the other twelve at the least, and about four Pearches over in breadth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sundry Tuffs of <hi>Aldens</hi> and <hi>Ashes</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Bottoms, with a great Rock of Stone under them, were not only removed out of their places, and carried towards the

Also there an Hedge thirty Pearches long, carried Southwad with his Trees, seven <hi>P</hi>earches at the least; and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry other sinkings there be in divers places, one of sixty Foot, another of forty seven, and another of thirty four foot, by means of which confusion is come to pass, that where the highest Hills were, there be the deepest Dales, and the lowest Dales are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the highest Ground. The whole mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of breaking, was at the least nine Acres. One Instance more I find to the like purpose in Mr. <hi>Childrey</hi> his <hi>Britannia Baconica,</hi> pag.131. where speaking of the natural Rarities of <hi>Cheshire,</hi> he thus writeth, <hi>July</hi> 1. 1657. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 3.<hi>h.</hi> in the Parish of <hi>Bukley,</hi> was heard a
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:000373_0348_0FA55B2379138E98"/>
very great noise like Thunder afar off, which was much wondred at, because the sky was clear, and no appearance of a Cloud. Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after a Neighbour comes to me (saith the Author of this Relation) and told me I should see a very strange thing, if I would go with him, so coming into a Field, called the <hi>Lay-field,</hi> we found a very great Bank of Earth which had many tall Oaks growing on it, quite sunk under the ground, Trees and all. At first we durst not go near it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Earth for near twenty yards round about is exceeding much rent, and seems rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall in; but since that time my self and some others by Ropes have ventured to see the bottom, I mean to go to the brink, so as to discern the visible bottom, which is Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and conceived to be about thirty yards from us, under which is sunk all the Earth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it for sixteen yards round at least; three tall Oaks, a very tall Awber, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain other small Trees, and not a sprigg of them to be seen above water: four or five Oaks more are expected to fall every moment and a great quantity of Land is like to fall, indeed never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="329" facs="unknown:000373_0349_0FA55B2466CC4BF8"/>
depth, but how far hollow, or how far deep is not to be found out by Man. Some of the water was drawn out of this Pit with a Bucket, and they found it to be as salt as Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water; whence some imagine that there are certain large passages there, into which the Sea flows under ground, but I rather think, that this Salt-Water is no more but that which issues from those Salt Springs about <hi>Nantwich,</hi> and other places in this Shire. But of this no more at present.</p>
               <p>Some Remarkable <hi>Land-floods,</hi> have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hapned in <hi>New, England.</hi> Nor is that which came to pass this present year to be here wholly passed over in silence. In the Spring time the great River at <hi>Connecticot</hi> useth to overflow, but this year it did so after Midsummer, and that twice: For <hi>July</hi> 20. 1683. A considerable Flood unexpectedly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose, which proved detrimental to many in that Colony. But on <hi>August</hi> 13. a second and a more dreadful Flood came. The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were then observed to rise twenty six foot above their usual Boundaries. The Grass in the Meadows, also the English Grain was carried away before it. The Indian Corn by the long continuance of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is spoiled: so that the four River Towns <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> 
                  <hi>Windsor, Hartford, Weathersfield, Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Town,</hi> are extream sufferers. They write
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:000373_0350_0FA55B25394E3A20"/>
from thence, that some who had hundreds of Bushels of Corn in the Morning, at night had not one Peck left for their Families to live upon. There is an awful intimation of Divine Displeasure <hi>Remarkable</hi> in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; inasmnch as <hi>August</hi> 8. a day of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Humiliation with Fasting and Prayer, was attended in that Colony, partly on the account of Gods hand against them in the former Flood; the next week after which, the hand of God was stretched out over them again, in the same way, after a more terrible manner then at first. It is also <hi>Remarkable</hi> that so many places should suffer by inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as this year it hath been. For at the very same time when the Flood hapned at <hi>Connecticot,</hi> there was an <hi>Hurricane</hi> in <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> attended with a great exundation of the Rivers there, so as that their Tobacco and their Indian Corn is very much dammfied Moreover, we have received Information this Summer, that the mighty River <hi>Danow</hi> (the biggest in <hi>Europe</hi>) hath overflowed its Banks, by means whereof many have lost their lives. Also near <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> there lately hapned an unusual Flood, whereby much harm was done; and had the Waters continued rising but one hour longer, the City had probably been destroyed thereby. There was likewise

a sudden and extraordinary Flood in <hi>Jamai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>o,</hi> which drowned many (both Men and Beast) and was very detrimental to some Plantations there. They that came lately from thence, assure us that the Waters in some places arose an hundred and fifty foot. Such mighty Streams did the Heavens sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly power down upon them. Thus doth the great God <hi>Who sits King upon the Floods for ever,</hi> make the World see how many wayes he hath to punish them, when it shall seem good unto him. Many such things are with him. There are who think that the last Comet, and those more rare Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Superiour Planets,</hi> hapning this Year, have had a natural influence into the mentioned Inundations. Concerning the Flood at <hi>Connecticot,</hi> as for the more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate natural cause, some impute it to the great Rain which preceded. Others did imagine that some more than usual <hi>Cataracts</hi> did fall amongst the Mountains, there having been more Rain then what now fell, sometimes when no such Flood has followed. It is not impossible, but that the Wind might be a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary cause of this Calamity; Judicious Observators write concerning the River <hi>Dee</hi> in <hi>Cheshire</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that though much Rain do fall, it riseth but little, but if the South
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:000373_0352_0FA55B2672319430"/>
Wind beat vehemently upon it, then it swells and overflows the Grounds adjoyning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly; the reason of which is, that the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being broad towards the Sea, when the Rain falls it hath a quick and easie passage, but the South Wind brings the Sea in, and doth somewhat stop the free passage of the River into the Sea. Whether there might not be some such natural reason of the great Flood in <hi>Connecticot</hi> at this time; the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious upon the place, who know best how things are there circumstanced may consider. With us in <hi>Boston</hi> it was then at first an <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clydon;</hi> but in the afternoon the Wind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Southerly, when it blew with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est fierceness. If it were so at <hi>Connecticot,</hi> it seems very probable that the fury of the wind gave a check to the free passage of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which caused the sudden overflowing of the Waters. It has moreover been by some observed, that the breaking forth of subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Waters has caused very prodigious Floods. Since the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> when the Fountains of the great Deep were opened, no History mentions a more surprizing and amazing Inundation than that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned five years ago at <hi>Gascoyn</hi> in <hi>France</hi>) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding (as tis probably judged) from the irruption of Waters out of the Earth.

which Remarkable accident, a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious account is given in the late <hi>Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Collections,</hi> published by Mr. <hi>Robert Hook, Page</hi> 9. There being but one of these Books in the Countrey; the Ingenious will not blame me, if I here insert what is there Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, which is as followeth;</p>

                  <p>In the beginning of the Moneth of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 1678. after some gentle rainy dayes which had not swelled the Waters of the <hi>Garonne</hi> more than usual; one night this River swelled all at once so mightily, that all the Bridges and Mills above <hi>Tolouse</hi> were carried away by it. In the Plains which were below this Town, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants who had built in places, which by long Experience they had found safe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough from any former Inundation, were by this surprized, some were drowned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their Cattle; others had not saved themselves but by climbing of Trees, and getting to the tops of Houses; and some others which were looking after their Cattle in the Field, warned by the noise which this horrible and furious Torrent of Water (rowling towards them with a swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness like that of the Sea (in <hi>Britain</hi> he means) made at a distance, could not scape without being overtaken, though they fled

with much precipitation: this nevertheless did not last many hours with this violence. At the same time Exactly, the two Rivers only of <hi>Adour</hi> and <hi>Gave,</hi> which fall from the <hi>Pyraenean Hills,</hi> as well as the <hi>Geronne,</hi> and some other small Rivers of <hi>Gascoyn,</hi> which have their Source in the plain, as the <hi>Gimone,</hi> the <hi>Save</hi> and the <hi>Ratt,</hi> overflowed after the same manner, and caused the same Devastations. But this Accident hapned not at all to the <hi>Aude,</hi> the <hi>Ariege,</hi> or the <hi>Arise,</hi> which come from the Mountains of <hi>Toix,</hi> only that they had more of the same then those of the <hi>Conseraut,</hi> the <hi>Comminge,</hi> the <hi>Bigorre.</hi> Those who have heard talk of those Inundations at a distance, were not at all astonished at it, believing it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the violent Rains of some Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests which had suddenly filled these Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or that they had caused a sudden Thaw of the Snow of the <hi>Pyraeneans,</hi> which had swelled the Rivers that were near.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monsieur Martel</hi> of <hi>Montabaun,</hi> Advocate of the Parliament, an Inquisitive and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Man hath searched after this cause of this Deluge (by the order of <hi>Monsieur Fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cault Intendant de Justice en la generalite de montaban,</hi> one not less seeing and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in ingenious Sciences, than expert

and exact in the performance of his charge and imployment) understanding that this overflowing could not be produced by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the forementioned causes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assured that it must have had one more extraordinary than all these.</p>
                  <p>And first he grounded his thoughts upon the report of the People of the place who were witnesses of this Prodigy. And above all of those who being in the highest Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys of the <hi>Pyraeneans</hi> at the very Source, had either seen or known all circumstances, for they all agreed, that it had rained indeed but that the Rain was neither so great, nor lasted so long as to swell the Rivers to that excess, or to melt the Snow off the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. But the nature of these Waters, and the manner of their flowing from the Mountains, confirmed him perfectly in his Sentiments. For, 1. The <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the <hi>Lower Pyraeneans</hi> observed, that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters overflowed with violence from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails of the Mountains, about which there were opened several Channels, which form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so many furious Torrents tore up the trees, the Earth and great Rocks in such nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row places where they found not a passage large enough. The Water which also spouted from all the sides of the Mountain
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:000373_0356_0FA55B2D68256F70"/>
in innumerable Jets, which lasted all the time of the greatest overflowing, had the tast of Minerals.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In some of these passages the Waters were stinking (as when one stirs the mud at the bottom of Mineral Water) in such sort that the Cattle refused to drink of it, which was more particularly taken notice at <hi>Lombaz,</hi> in the overflowing of the <hi>Save,</hi> (which is one of the Rivers) where the Horses were eight hours thirsty before they would endure to drink it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Bishop of <hi>Lombez</hi> having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to cleanse his Gardens, which the <hi>Save</hi> passing through by many Channels by this overflowing, had filled with much Sand and Mud; those which entred them felt an itching like to that which one feels when one Bathes in Salt-water, or washes one self with some strong Lixivial: these Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have caused the same kind of itching risings in the skin. This last Observation is not less strong then both the others to prove, that this over-flowing was not either caused by the Rains, or by the meltings of the Snow, because this itching could not be produced by either of the said Waters, which are not at all of this nature, but by some Mineral juice, either <hi>Vitriolic</hi> or <hi>Alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous</hi>
                     <pb n="337" facs="unknown:000373_0357_0FA55B2E05CA4108"/>
which the Waters had dissolved in the Bowels of the Mountains, and had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried along with it in passing through those numerous Crannies. And tis for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that <hi>Monsieur Martel</hi> believes he had found out the true cause of this overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be nothing else but the subterraneous Waters; for if the Heavens have not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his prodigious quantity of Waters, neither by the Rain, nor the melting of the Snow: it cannot come else where then from the Bowels of the Earth, from whence pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through divers Channels, it had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted and carried along with it that stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pungent quality.</p>

may not judge of Men meerly by outward accidents which befal them in this World, since all things happen alike unto all, and no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them. We have seen amongst our selves, that the Lords faithful Servants have sometimes been the Subjects of very dismal dispensations. There hapned a most awful providence at <hi>Farmington</hi> in <hi>Connecticot</hi> Colony, <hi>Dec.</hi> 14. 1666. When the House of Serjeant <hi>John Hart</hi> taking fire in the night, no man knows how, (only it is conjectured that it might be occasioned by an Oven) he and his Wife, and six Children were all burned to death before the Neighbours Knew any thing of it, so that his whole Family had been extinguished by the fatal Flames of that unhappy night, had not one of his Children been providentially from home at that time. This <hi>Hart</hi> was esteemed a choice Christian, and his Wife also a good Woman. Such things sometimes fall upon those that are dear unto God, to intimate, <hi>if this be done to the green tree, what shall be done to the dry,</hi> that is fit for nothing but the fire. Nevertheless, a Judgement may be so circumstanced, as that the displeasure of Heaven is plainly written upon it, in legible Characters. On which account it is said, <hi>that the wrath of God

is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of Men,</hi> Rom.1.18. Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Learned Men have published whole Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns profitable to be read, on this Subject, <hi>e. g. Goulartius</hi> his Historical Collections. <hi>

Yea, the divine providence in Remarkable Punishments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon very wicked men has been so conspicuous and glorious, as that the Gentiles of old could not but take notice of it.

men that are acquainted therewith, observe the blasting rebukes of providence upon the late <hi>Singing and Dancing Quakers,</hi> in signal Instances, two or three of which may be here Recorded, that so others may hear and fear and do no more so wickedly.</p>
               <p>The first instance, shall be that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the unhappy man that was Murdered in <hi>Long-Island,</hi> of which a good hand in those parts, in a Letter bearing Date, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 12. 1681. writes as follows. <q>There went down about a Moneth since three mad <hi>Quakers,</hi> called <hi>Thomas Case's</hi> Crew, one man named <hi>Denham,</hi> belonging to <hi>Newer-snicks,</hi> and two Women with him belonging to <hi>Oyster-Bay;</hi> these went down to <hi>South-hold,</hi> where they meet with <hi>Samuel Banks</hi> of <hi>Fairfield,</hi> the most Blasphemous Villain, that ever was known in there parts. These joyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with some other Inhabitants of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi> of the same spirit; there went into their company a young Merchant, named <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Harris,</hi> who was somewhat inclining to the <hi>Quakers</hi> before; (he belonged to <hi>Boston</hi>) they all got about him, and fell a Dancing and Singing, according to their Diabolical manner. After some time, the said <hi>Harris</hi> began to act like them, and to Dance, and sing, and to speak of extraordinary raptures
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:000373_0362_0FA55B326DE84608"/>
of joy; and to cry out upon all others as Devils, that were not of their Religion; which also they do frequently: when the said <hi>Harris</hi> manifested these signs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, as they accounted it; they solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted of him as one of their company; and <hi>Banks</hi> or <hi>Denham</hi> (for I have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten which of the two) gave him this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> forward his Tongue should be as the Pen of a ready Writer, to declare the praises of their Lord,</hi> After this, the young man who was sober and composed before, ran up and down, <hi>Singing Joy,</hi> and calling such Devils as should say any thing in way of opposition: and said his Father was a Devil that begat him. Quickly after he went from the Town of <hi>South-hold,</hi> to a Farm belonging to that Town, to the house of a <hi>Quaker</hi> of the same spirit, and went to bed before the rest of the Family, and when a young man of the same house went to go to bed to him, he told him that he must get up, and go to <hi>South-hold</hi> that night, where he had left <hi>Banks</hi> and the rest; the young man endeavoured to perswade him to lie still till day, but he would not, but gat up, and went away; after some time he was missed, and enquiry made for him, but he could not be heard of, only his Hat, and
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:000373_0363_0FA55B3288D49AD8"/>
Gloves, and Neck-cloth was found in the Road from the Farm to the Town. And two dayes after, <hi>Banks</hi> looking into a Bible, suddenly shut it again, crying out, his friend <hi>Harris</hi> was dead; the next day he was found by the Sea side, about a quarter of a mile from the place, where his hat and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things were found, but out of the road, with three holes like stabs in his throat, and no Tongue in his Head, nor the least sign thereof, but all was clear to his Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone within, his mouth close shut, one of his Eyes hanging down upon his cheek out of his head, the other sunk so deep in his head that at first it seemed quite out, but was whole there. And Mr. <hi>Joshua Hobart,</hi> who was one of them to view his dead Body, told me that there was no sign of any Tongue left in his Mouth, <hi>such was the end of that Tongue which had the promise of being as the Pen of a ready Writer.</hi> Further the night after he was buried, Captain <hi>young</hi> (who is high Sheriff and chiefly concerned in looking after the business) as he told me himself, being in bed, in the dead of the night, was awakened by the voice of this <hi>Harris,</hi> calling to his Window very loud, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

night; the next night when he was asleep, it came into his house, close to his Bed-side, and called very loud, asking him if he heard him, and awaked him.</q> Thus concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Tragical Story.</p>
               <p>An intelligent and credible person living upon that Island, in a Letter, Dated <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 4. 1683. adds as follows; <q>There was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four years since, by some of the same crew, another attempt made amongst us, which was also attended with the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, though not so fatal an issue; There was a young Woman, a Daughter of a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> among us, who was howled into their Society, as <hi>Harris</hi> was, and quickly fell to railing on others, and then to raving, being in a dreadful condition, so that several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of their Gang watched with her, and she was made wonderful strong to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strive them, and to break away from them. One of their own party newly in favour with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, told me that he was by in the night when they watched with her, and in the very darkness of the night, they heard a very doleful noise, like the crying of a young Child in the yard of field near the house, which filled the Auditors with some fearful Apprehensions, which when the
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:000373_0365_0FA55B343B621278"/>
young Woman heard, she violently brake from her Attendance, saying, <hi>the Lord calls me, and I must go,</hi> so in the dark she got from them, to the cry-ward as they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and it was a good space of time before they could find her, and then she was as one affrighted, and bereaved of understanding, and continued so a space of time, sometimes ridiculous to behold, sometimes very awful, till such time as Justice <hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Huntington,</hi> by the use of means recovered her, which her <hi>Quaking Friends</hi> nothwithstanding their brags could not do; so that I heard her Husband say, <hi>that he was convinced that the Devil was among them.</hi> This Providence was at that time fearful among us, yet since, both that Woman and her Husband are railing <hi>Quakers,</hi> and do Hum and Revile as the rest of them, though several forsook their Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon this account.</q> Thus Hee:</p>
               <p>That which was perpetrated by this woful Generation of <hi>Quakers,</hi> no longer since than this last Summer in <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony, is horrid to be related. Yet inasmuch as the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, will make appear unto all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that <hi>Quakers</hi> are under the strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions of Satan; I think my self bound to acquaint the World, that not many Moneths ago, a Man passing under the name of <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than

Dunen</hi> (alias <hi>Singleterry</hi>) a <hi>Singing Quaker,</hi> drew away the Wife of one of <hi>Marshfield</hi> to follow him; Also one <hi>Mary Ross</hi> falling into their company, was quickly possessed with the Devil, playing such Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Diabolical tricks, as the like hath seldom been known or heard of. For she made her self naked, burning all her Clothes; and with infinite Blasphemy said that she was Christ, and gave names to her Apostles, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Dunen</hi> by the name of <hi>Peter,</hi> another by the name of <hi>Thomas,</hi> declaring that she would be dead for three dayes, and then rise again; and accordingly seemed to die; and while she was pretendedly dead, her Apostle <hi>Dunen</hi> gave out, that they should see glorious things after her Resurrection. But that which she then did, was, she commanded <hi>Dunen</hi> to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice a Dog. The Man and the two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>Quakers</hi> Danced naked together, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing but their shirts on. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable brought them before the Magistrates in <hi>Plimouth,</hi> where <hi>Ross</hi> uttered such prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Blasphemy as is not fit to be mentioned, <hi>Dunen</hi> fell down like a dead Man upon the floor, and so lay for about an hour, and then came to himself. The Magistrates demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reason of his strange actings, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was, that <hi>Mary Ross</hi> bid him, and he
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:000373_0367_0FA55B380C1ED050"/>
had no power to resist. Thus when Men will not receive the Truth in the love of it, the righteous Judgement of God sends upon them <hi>the efficacy of Error,</hi> that they shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lie. That the <hi>Quakers</hi> are some of them undoubtedly possessed with Evil and Infernal Spirits, and acted in a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner by the inmates of Hell, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, not only from the related Instances, but by other awful Examples which might be mentioned. They are indeed to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, in that they themselves know not that an Evil Spirit doth possess and act them. Yet others should from that consideration dread to come among such Creatures, lest haply the Righteous God suffer Satan to take possession of them also. Memorable and marvelous is that Relation published the last year, by Dr. <hi>Henry More,</hi> in his addition to Mr. <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Collections,</hi> Page 58. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein a true and faithful account is given of a Man whose Name is <hi>Robert Churchman,</hi> living at <hi>Balsham</hi> in <hi>Cambridge-shire,</hi> who was for some time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled in <hi>Quakerisme,</hi> and then an Infernal Spirit spake in him, pretending to be an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Light. Inasmuch as there is (so far as I have heard) but one of those Books in this Countrey; I suppose it will be a service for the Truth, and may (if the Lord please
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:000373_0368_0FA55B3872EBFAF0"/>
to add his blessing) tend to reclaim some from the error of their way, and to deterr those from <hi>Quakerisme</hi> who have through the temptations of Satan any inclinations thereunto, if that notable History should be more divulged; I shall therefore here insert it. And thus it was, Dr. <hi>Templar</hi> (the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in <hi>Balsham</hi>) perceiving that <hi>Robert Churchman</hi> was in danger of being poysoned and seduced by the papers which the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> had been dispersing in that place, desired him, that when any of their Books came to his hands, he might have the perusal of them. Which being granted, he suggested that it would be very convenient that the person who had given him that Book should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent when they considered it together. This also was consented to. When the <hi>Quaker</hi> came, a special subject of the Discourse was, <hi>Whether the Scripture is to be owned as a Rule:</hi> This the <hi>Quaker</hi> denied, asserting that the Rule was within them. Hereupon Dr. <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar</hi> desired <hi>Churchman</hi> to take notice, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> did not own the Scriptures to be their Rule, which before this Conference he would not believe concerning them. The next time he met with his Brother <hi>Thomas Churchman,</hi> he acquainted him with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which had been in Dr. <hi>Templars</hi>
                  <pb n="349" facs="unknown:000373_0369_0FA55B3955AD0AB0"/>
House, and said for his part he would not be of that Religion which did disown the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be the Rule. Not long after, the Wife of the forementioned <hi>Quaker</hi> coming to his House to visit his Wife, he met her at the door, and told her she should not come in, intimating that her visit would make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision betwixt them. After some Parley the <hi>Quakers</hi> Wife spake unto him in these words, <hi>Thou wilt not believe unless thou see a sign, and thou mayest see some such.</hi> Within a few nights after, <hi>Robert Churchman</hi> had a violent Storm upon the room where he lay, when it was very calm in all other parts of the Town, and a voice within him, as he was in Bed, spake to him, and bid him <hi>Sing Praises, Sing Praises;</hi> telling him, that he should see the Glory of the <hi>New Jerusalem;</hi> about which time a <hi>glimmering Light</hi> appeared all about the room. Toward the morning the <hi>Voice</hi> commanded him to go out of his Bed naked, with his Wife and Children. They all standing upon the Floor, the <hi>Spirit</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king use of his Tongue, bid them to lie down and put their Mouthes in the dust. which they did accordingly. It likewise commanded them to go and call his Brother and Sister, that they might see the <hi>New-Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> to whom he went naked about half a mile.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="unknown:000373_0370_0FA55B3E62788238"/>
When he had delivered his Message, that which spake within him to denounce wrath against them, and declare that Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone would fall upon them, as it did upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> if they did not obey; and so he returned to his own house. Where upon the Floor of a low room, he stood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about three or four hours. All that while he was acted in a very unusual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, sometimes the <hi>Spirit within</hi> forced him to <hi>Sing,</hi> sometimes to Bark like a Dog. When his Brother and Sister who followed him were very importunate with him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist it, it bid him to kill them, making use of these words, <hi>These my Enemies which would not that I should Reign over them, bring them and slay them before my face.</hi> It made him to utter with great readiness; many places of Scripture, which he had no knowledge of before. The drift of what was spoken, was to perswade him to comply with the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and it named some which lived in the Neighbouring Towns. About three or four hours being thus spent, he came to himself, and was able to give a perfect account of what had befallen him.</p>
               <p>Several nights after, the same trouble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned upon him. His Wife was tortured with extraordinary pains; the Children

which lay in the room, complained that their Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>thes were stopped with Wool as they were in Bed. The disturbance was so great, that he had thoughts of leaving his House for a time, and made it his desire to be at Dr. <hi>Templars;</hi> who prevailed with him not to be so sudden in his removal, but to make some further Trial. It pleased God upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation with him in Prayer every day in the house, that he was at last perfectly free from all molestation. The <hi>Quakers</hi> hearing of his condition, gave it out, that the power of God would come upon him again, and that the Wound was but skinned over by the Priest. Which made Dr. <hi>Templar</hi> the more importunate with him to keep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the Publick Worship of God, and to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with them or their Writings. Which direction he followed till <hi>November</hi> 1661. and then perusing one of their Books, a little after upon the tenth day of that Moneth his troubles returned. A voice within him began to speak to him after the former manner. The first Sentence which it uttered was, <hi>Cease thou from Man, whose breath is in his Nostrils, for wherein is he to be accounted.</hi> The design which he discerned it did aim at, was to take him off from come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Church (where he had been that
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:000373_0372_0FA55B3F9EB2DB30"/>
day) and from hearing the Word of God. It suggested several other Scriptures in order to the perswading of him to a compliance with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and told him, that it would strive with him as the Angel did with <hi>Jacob,</hi> until the breaking of the Day, at which time it left him. The two next nights it gave him the same molestation, saying, it must be with him as it was with <hi>David,</hi> who <hi>gave no sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eye-lids, until he found a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.</hi> Upon Wednesday at night he was very peremptory in his resisting of it. When it began to solicit him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that he saw it was a Spirit of delusion, which he would not obey. Upon which the Spirit denounced a Curse against him in these words, <hi>Go ye Cursed into everlasting fire,</hi> and so left him with a very great heat in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. After this, he was in his own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in a very comfortable condition, and while he was considering what had hapned, a voice within him spake to him, saying, That the Spirit which was before upon him was a Spirit of Delusion, but now the true Spirit of God was come into him. It ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him, that the Doctrine of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was true, and that God had an Elect Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that those whom the Father Elected
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:000373_0373_0FA55B3FFA5F3108"/>
the Son hath Redeemed, and when Christ Redeemeth, the Holy Ghost Sanctifieth, and told him that the Minister of the Town would further instruct him about the truth of these things. Upon Thursday morning about break of day, it set him upon his knees as he was in bed, and bid him Farewel. The same day it came upon him in the field as he was going to, and coming from the Market, &amp; pressed upon him to believe that it was the good Spirit which he was acted with, which he still doubted of. One night that week a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many Arguments which it used to that purpose, it told him if he would not believe without a sign, he might have what sign he would. Upon that <hi>Robert Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> desired, if it was a good Spirit, that a Wier-Candlestick which stood upon the Cup-board might be turned into Brass, which the Spirit said he would do. Presently there was a very unsavoury smell in the Room, like that of the snuff of a Candle newly put out; but nothing else was done towards the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the promise. Upon the Lords Day following, he then attending the publick Worship of God, it came upon him. When the Chapters were named, he turned to them in his Bible, but was not able to read. When the Pslam was Sung, he could not pronounce
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:000373_0374_0FA55B40B457BFF0"/>
a syllable. Upon Monday morning his Speech was wholly taken away from him. When the Minister in that place came to, him and asked him how it was with him, he moved his head towards him, but was not able to speak; the Minister waited an hour or two in the Room, hoping that his Speech might have returned unto him, and that he might have gained from him some account of his condition. But finding no alteration, he desired those who were present to joyn with him in Prayer. As they were Praying <hi>Churchman</hi>'s Body was with much violence thrown out of Bed, and then with great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency he called to the Minister Dr. <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar</hi> to hold his tongue. When Prayer was done, his Tongue was bound as before, till at last he broke out into these words: <hi>Thine is the Kingdome, Thine is the Kingdom;</hi> which he repeated (as was judged) above an hundred times. Sometimes he was forced into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Laughter, <hi>sometimes into Singing,</hi> his hands were usually imployed in beating his Breast. All of them who stood by, could discern unusual heavings in his Body. This Distemper did continue towards the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the next day, and then the voice within him signified to him that it would leave him, bidding him get upon his Knees
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:000373_0375_0FA55B417306CE20"/>
in order to that end, which he did, and then presently he had a perfect command of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>When Dr. <hi>Templar</hi> came to him, he gave a sober account of all the passages of the day before, having a distinct remembrance of what the Spirit forced him to do, and what was spoken to him by those that stood by. In particular he told the Doctor that he was compelled to give him that disturbance in Prayer, before-mentioned; the Spirit using his Limbs and Tongue, as it pleased, contrary to the inclination of his own mind.</p>
               <p>Upon the Thursday following, the Spirit began to rage after its former manner, as Dr. <hi>Templar</hi> was at Prayer with him, it was very discernable how it wrought upon his Body, forced him to grate his Teeth, and draw his Mouth awry. He told the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster after he had done, that it bid him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce woe against him. It pleased God upon continuance in prayer with him, at last to release him of all his trouble, and so far to make it advantagious to him and to his Wife, and some others, which were too much by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assed with the Principles of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that now they have a perfect dislike of that way, and do diligently attend upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Thus concerning this strange but true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. We may by this judge whose Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the singing <hi>Quakers</hi> are; and what Spirit doth powerfully breath in, and act those miserable and deluded <hi>Enthusiasts.</hi>

               <p>It hath been by many observed, that Men addicted to horrid Cursings and Execrations, have pulled down the imprecated vengeance of Heaven upon themselves. Sundry very awful Examples of this kind have lately hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: I shall here mention one or two.</p>
               <p>The hand of God was very <hi>Remarkable,</hi> in that which came to pass in the <hi>Narragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set Countrey</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> not many weeks since. For I have good Information, that on <hi>August</hi> 28. 1683. A Man there (<abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                  <hi>Samuel Wilson</hi>) having caused his Dog to mischief his Neighbours Cattle, was blamed for his so doing. He denied the fact with Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wishing that he might never stir from that place <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f he had so done. His Neighbour being troubled at his denying the truth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:000373_0377_0FA55B432E49E638"/>
him, and told him he did very ill to deny what his Conscience knew to be truth. The <hi>Atheist</hi> thereupon used the Name of God in his Imprecations; saving, <hi>He wished to God he might never stir out of that place, if be had done that which he was charged with.</hi> The words were scarce out of his mouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he sunk down dead, and never stirred more; a Son in Law of his standing by and catching him as he fell to the ground.</p>
               <p>A thing not unlike to this hapned (though not in <hi>New-England</hi> yet) in <hi>America,</hi> about a year ago. For in <hi>September</hi> 1682. A man at the Isle of <hi>Providence</hi> belonging to a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel whereof one <hi>Wollery</hi> was Master, being charged with some deceit in a matter that had been committed to him, in order to his own Vindication, horridly wished <hi>that the Devil might put out his eyes, if he had done as was suspected concerning him.</hi> That very night a Rhume fell into his Eyes, so as that within a few dayes he became sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k blind. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany being astonished at the Divine hand which thus conspicuously and signally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; put him ashore at <hi>Providence,</hi> and left him there. A Physitian being desired to undertake his Cure, hearing how he came to lose his sight, refused to meddle with him. This account I lately received from credible
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:000373_0378_0FA55B43D3765490"/>
persons, who knew and have often seen the Man whom the Devil (according to his own wicked wish) made blind, through the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and righteous judgement of God.</p>
               <p>Moreover, that worse than bruitish sin of <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> hath been witnessed against from Heaven by <hi>severe and signal Judgments.</hi> It was a sign of the fearful Wrath of God, upon that notorious Drunkard, at a place called <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>atucket</hi> in <hi>Long-Island;</hi> who as he was in Drink, fell into the Fire (the People in the House then being in Bed and asleep) and so continued for some considerable time, until he received his Deaths wound. At his first awakening he roared out <hi>Fire! Fire!</hi> as if it had been one in Hell, to the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment of all that heard him. One in the House flung a pail of Water on him to quench his Clothes, but that added to his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; so he continued yelling after an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous manner, <hi>Fire! Fire!</hi> and within a day or two died in great misery. And though this Drunkard died by fire, it is <hi>Remarkable</hi> that many of those who have loved drink, have died by water, and that at the very time when their understandings have been drowned with Drink. It is an awful consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that there have been at several times above forty persons in this Land, whom death
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:000373_0379_0FA55B4473888CF8"/>
hath found in that woful plight, so that their immortal Souls have gone out of Drunken Bodies, to appear before God the Judge of all.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Remarkable Judgement</hi> hath first or last fallen upon those who have sought the hurt of the People of God in <hi>New-England,</hi> is so notorious, as that it is become the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of every Man. This <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness hath eat up the Nations his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he hath broke their Bones, and pierced them through with his Arrows. Some Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries have escaped longer unpunished than others; but then their ends have been of all the most woful, and tragical at last. I shall instance only in what hath lately come to pass, with respect unto the Heathen who rose up against us, thinking to swallow us up quick, when their Wrath was kindled against us. Blessed be the Lord, who hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us a prey to their Teeth. The Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains amongst them were all cut off, either by Sword or Sickness in the War time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting those in the Eastern parts, whose Ring-leaders outlived their fellows; but now God hath met with them. There were in special two of those <hi>Indians,</hi> who shed much innocent Blood, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz. </hi>
                  </abbr> 
                  <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Squando.</hi>
                  <pb n="360" facs="unknown:000373_0380_0FA55B478C04E780"/>
As for bloody <hi>Simon,</hi> who was wont to boast of the Mischiefs he had done, and how he had treacherously shot and killed such and such <hi>English-men,</hi> he died miserably the last Winter, Another <hi>Indian</hi> discharging a Gun hapned to shoot <hi>Simon,</hi> so as to break his Arm. After which he lived two years, but in extremity of pain, so as that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> when enquired of, how <hi>Simon</hi> did; their usual Answer was <hi>Worse then Dead.</hi> He used all means that Earth and Hell (for he betook himself to <hi>Powaws</hi>) could afford him for his recovery, but in vain. Thus was the wickedness of that Murtherer at last returned upon his own head.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Squando,</hi> the <hi>Sachem</hi> of the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Saco;</hi> the Story of him is upon sundry accounts <hi>Remarkable.</hi> Many years ago he was sick, and near unto death, after which he said, that one pretending to be the <hi>English-mans</hi> God, appeared to him in form of an <hi>English Minister;</hi> and discoursed with him, requiring him to leave off his drinking of <hi>Rum,</hi> and religiously to observe the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and to deal justly amongst Men, withal promising him that if he did so, then at death his Soul should go upwards to an happy place; but if he did not obey these commandments, at death his Soul should go
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:000373_0381_0FA55B48F5816B10"/>
downwards, and be for ever miserable. But this pretended God said nothing to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> However, this <hi>Apparition</hi> so wrought upon <hi>Squando,</hi> as that he left his Drunkenness, and became a strict observer of the Sabbath day; Yea, so as that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes kept it as a day of Fast, and would hear the <hi>English Ministers</hi> Preach, and was very just in his dealing. But in the time of the late <hi>Indian War,</hi> he was a principal Actor in the bloody Tragedies in that part of the Countrey. The last year the pretended <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish-mans God,</hi> appeared to him again, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the form of a Minister, requiring him to kill himself, and promising him that if he did obey, he should live again the next day, and never die more. <hi>Squando</hi> acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Wife, and some other <hi>Indians</hi> with this new Apparition, They most earnestly advised him not to follow the murde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <p n="2">2. Many among us have been in more than ordinary hazard by <hi>Rattle-Snakes,</hi> some have set their feet upon them, some have been bitten by them upon the skin, and one as he was stooping down to drink at a Spring of Water, spied a <hi>Rattle-Snake</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two foot of his head rising up against him; thus manifold wayes in danger by this Venimous Creature, and yet none of us have suffered any harm, but only one was bitten in the finger, and in a short time perfectly healed.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. In the time of the Wars with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> we were not only preserved from the <hi>Heathen</hi> in the midst of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> but by the Lords making some of them to be a Wall of Defence unto us. And thus we
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:000373_0384_0FA55B4B38D554E8"/>
were saved by a Destroying means.</p>
                           <p>And at this time the Providence of God was very remarkable in preserving many of our People, in one of our Garrisons, who were driven to Garrison several Houses, and the House of which now I speak, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain about sixty persons; and in this House one of the Souldiers taking a Gun Loaden with Bullets into his hand, as he stood in a lower Room, the Lock being half bent, and he holding the Gun right upwards, the Gun was Discharged, though many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were in the Chamber, yet none of them suffered any harm, because Providence did guid the Shot into the Summer, that piece of Timber which is the support of the Chamber.</p>
                           <p>Also one in the same House, looking with a Candle under a Bed for something he wanted, fired some Flax, which filled the Room with Flame and Smoke, and two small Children lay sleeping in this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, but were preserved from the fire, or any harm by the throng of People in the Room, at length one of the Children was taken up by one of the Men with a purpose of throwing it out of the Chamber
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:000373_0385_0FA55B4BF7F02CD8"/>
Window, but at that very moment thers was such an abatement of the Flame, and hope that the worst of the danger was past, that he held the Child in his Arms; and yet presently after the fire brake out again in the uppermost Room in the House, nigh to a Barrel of Gun-powder: but some were guided, strengthened and succeeded in their endeavour, to the extinguishing the fire; so that the Lives, and Limbs, and Goods of all these was preserved by the good hand of God, who doth wonderfully when we know not what to do.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. One of the Children of the Church grown up, (though not in full Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) was left to fall into a most notorious abominable practice, which did occasion the Church to meet and humble their Souls by Fasting and Prayer, and at this time in the Sermon and Prayer, It was Declared, that the Lord had determined either to bring our Children nearer to him, &amp; not to suffer them to live out of full communion with his Church, or else he would in his Anger leave them to such Abominations as shall cut them off from his Church; And since this time, many young People have by the grace of the Lord been prepared for full Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:000373_0386_0FA55B4CB44EFDC0"/>
and have taken hold of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, confessing, that they have felt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of that Word upon that abashing occasion spoken: And thus the fall of one hath been the rising of many. Where sin abounds, the Lord can make Grace to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabound.</p>

                           <p>There was a Young-man endeavouring to subdue a young Horse; and a Rope at one end of it was fastned about the Horses neck, but the Horse running with great speed, the other end of the Rope caught the Foot of this Young Man, as in a snare, and was so entangled therein, that he was drawn ten Rods upon his back in a very rough and uneven place of Land, he being utterly unable to free himself, and none at, hand that could help him; and thus it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to this <hi>Extremity,</hi> the Horse of himself stood still, so long, and no longer time, than that the Young Man did clear his foot out of the Rope; and thus was Delivered out of the Danger, and suffered not a broken Bone, nor any considerable bruise or harm. 
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:000373_0387_0FA55B4D800F2300"/>
there was another Young Man, who sat upon a plough-Beam, and suddenly his Cattle moving his Plough turned, and one of his Legs was entangled within the Plough, and the Plough-Irons pressing hard against some part of his Body, but could not free himself; and the more he called to the Cattle, the more speedily they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and thus was in danger of being torn in pieces; but in this extremity it was not long before the Cattle of themselves stood still.</p>
                           <p>There was another Young Man, who did fall about ten foot from some part of the Mill Timber into deep Waters, and a place of many Rocks, a Stream very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and he was carried about eleven Rod down the Stream, where there was a great piece of Ice, and while he was in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and amazed Posture, his hand was guided to take hold of that Ice, and there to hold until one who saw him fall, did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon that Ice, and drew him out of the Waters, and thus they were both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</p>
                           <p>There was a very aged Man among us, who riding in his Cart over a River, and when the Cattle were coming out of the River, he endeavoured to come out of the
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:000373_0388_0FA55B50AC65D840"/>
Cart, but he did fall down so nigh to the Wheel, that it began to press hard against his Breast, and he only speaking to the Cattle they stood still, and ceased moving till he was removed out of the danger, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, if they had moved a few inches more, he had been prest to death.</p>

               <p>Thus far is Mr. <hi>Fitch's</hi> Narrative. Had all others been as diligent in observing the Works of God, as this Worthy Person has, the account of <hi>New-Englands Remarkables</hi> would have been more-full and compleat. But other things must be left for another at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of this kind. I shall only add at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, That there have been many sudden Deaths in this Countrey, which should not pass without some Remark. For when such Strokes are multiplied, there is undoubtedly a speaking voice of Providence therein. And so it hath been with us in <hi>New-England</hi> this last year, and most of all the last Summer. To my observation in <hi>August</hi> last, within the space of three of four weeks, there were twelve sudden Deaths (and it may be others have observed more than I did) some of them being in respect of sundry Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces exceeding awful. Let me only add here, that sudden Death is not alwayes a Judgment
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:000373_0389_0FA55B520B196288"/>
unto those who are taken out of an evil World: It may be a mercy to them, and a warning unto others, as the sudden Death of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Wife was. Many of whom the World was not worthy, have been so removed out of it. <hi>Moses</hi> died suddenly. And so have some excellent persons in this Countrey done. Governour <hi>Eaton</hi> at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Haven;</hi> and Governour <hi>Haines</hi> at <hi>Hartford</hi> Died in their sleep without being sick. That Excellent Man of God Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> as he was walking in his House in this <hi>Boston,</hi> was taken with a <hi>Syncope,</hi> fell down Dead and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver spake more. The like has hapned to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Servants of God in other parts of the World. Famous Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> on a Lords Day after he had Preached and Administred the Sacrament, went to Bed well, and went to Heaven that night. Nor is there any rule or reason for Christians to pray absolutely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sudden Death. Some Holy Men have with submission to the Will of the most High, desired and prayed for such a Death. So did Mr. <hi>Capel,</hi> and God gave him his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire; for on <hi>September</hi> 21. 1656. having Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched twice that Day, and performed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Duties with his Family, he went to Bed and Died immediately. The like is reported by Dr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> in his Church History, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:000373_0390_0FA55B5383EDAD20"/>
that <hi>Angelical Man</hi> Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> who would often pray, (if God saw fit) that he might die rather a sudden than a lingring Death, and so it came to pass. For as he was Travelling in the Coach with Sr. <hi>John Osborne,</hi> and reading of a Book (for he would lose no time) he was taken with a Fainting Fit, and though instantly taken out in the Arms of one there present, and all means possible used for his Recovery, he there Died, <hi>August,</hi> 24. 1607. The Learned &amp; Pious <hi>Wolfius</hi> (not the Divine who has written Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries on several parts of the Scriptures; but he that published <hi>Lectionum Memorabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium &amp; Reconditarum Centenarios</hi>) On <hi>May</hi> 23. 1600. being in usual Health, was, after he had Dined, surprised with a sudden ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, whereof he Died within a few hours. That Holy Man <hi>Jacobus Faber,</hi> who did and suffered great things for the Name of Christ, went suddenly into the silent Grave: On a Day when some Friends came to visit him, after he had courteously entertained them, he laid himself down upon his Bed to take some Repose; and no sooner shut his Eyes, but his Heaven-born Soul took its flight into the World of Souls.</p>
               <p>The Man who being in Christ, shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be doing something for God, may
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:000373_0391_0FA55B5436C2A958"/>
bid Death welcome when ever it shall come, be it never so soon, never so suddenly.</p>
