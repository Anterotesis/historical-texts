            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN a Committee of the whole Houſe upon the American Papers, February 20th, 1775, Lord North made the following Motion:</p>
            <p>"That it is the opinion of this Committee, that when the Governor, Council, and Aſſembly, or General Court, of any of his Majeſty's Provinces, or Colonies in America, ſhall propoſe to make proviſion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the condition, circumſtances, and ſituation of each Province or Colony, for contributing their proportion to the common defence; (ſuch proportion to be raiſed under the authority of the General Aſſembly of ſuch Province or Colony, and to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſable by Parliament) and ſhall engage to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion alſo for the ſupport of the civil government, and the adminiſtration of juſtice, in ſuch Province or Colony, it will be proper, if ſuch propoſal ſhall be approved of by his Majeſty and the two Houſes of Parliament, for ſo long as ſuch proviſion ſhall be made accordingly, to forbear, in reſpect of ſuch Province or Colony, to levy any duty, tax, or aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to impoſe any further duty, tax, or aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, except only ſuch duties as it may be expedient to levy or impoſe, for the regulation of Commerce, the net produce of duties laſt mentioned, to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the account of each Province or Colony reſpectively."</p>

In the courſe of the debate upon the report of this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Major General Burgoyne ſpoke in ſubſtance as follows:</p>
            <p>MR. SPEAKER,</p>
            <p>FROM the time I have been under orders to ſerve in America, I have thought it an unbecoming part to give my voice as a judge in any American queſtion, this upon your paper only excepted. But having taken ſome ſhare in the debates of laſt year, which have been miſrepreſented, and having appeared in ſome diviſions this year, before I had any knowledge or ſuſpicion of my deſtination, I anxiouſly wiſh to take this occaſion to explain the motives upon which I have invariably acted: and notwithſtanding the exhauſted ſtate of the debate, I riſe with confidence in the Houſe, that they will give that indulgence to my ſituation, which I ſhould have little claim to upon any other pretenſions.</p>
            <p>Sir, I think an explanation the more neceſſary, becauſe, both without doors and within, alluſions and references are making continually to the ſentiments of thoſe who are to act in the military department, a very important, but very unenviable lot.</p>
            <p>In ſome of the licentious prints of the times, there have not been wanting ſuggeſtions to the Public, that a ſanguinary Miniſter had choſen the Generals beſt fitted by their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to carry havock and deſtruction through the continent of America: Within theſe walls we have been treated very differently, indeed; we have found an attention, a reſpect, a favor of opinion and of expreſſion, that has imprinted upon my mind, and I am perſuaded equally upon the minds of my colleagues, a ſincere ſatisfaction and a deep ſenſe of gratitude to Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on all ſides of the Houſe.—But ſtill, Sir, I have obſerved, through the courſe of the debate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an opinion to prevail, that a great latitude of orders is to be given; and that, in acting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:042784_0004_101C93BC86624700"/>
ſuch latitude, we ſhall be influenced by the ſpeeches we hear in this place, ſome of which are ſuppoſed to convey the moſt inflammatory ideas others, ideas of the moſt humiliating conceſſion.</p>
            <p>I do not know, Sir, that any ſuch latitude will be given—at leaſt it will hardly extend to my inferior ſtation. The utmoſt merit I ſhall be able to claim, in this expedition, will probably be, that of an attentive, an aſſidious, circumſcribed obedience. But I can ſpeak with confidence of thoſe under whom I am to leave this country, as well as of the high and reſpectable officer who now commands in America; ſuch men will not want the oratory of this Houſe to give a due tone to their ſpirit or humanity.</p>
            <p>A noble ſentiment fell from an honourable Gentleman<note n="*" place="bottom">Colonel Barre.</note> in my eye—"That bravery and compaſſion were aſſociate vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues."—May they remain blended on the minds of every military man in America!—Let the perſuaſion uniformly prevail, that upon a review of our conduct hereafter; by our diſpaſſionate and impartial countrymen, our bravery will be judged by the teſt of our compaſſion.—Should we inevitably be made the inſtruments of puniſhment, let every action of the unhappy conflict be directed and marked by that temper, which ever ought to diſcriminate the correction of the ſtate, from the ſudden and impetuous impulſe of paſſion and revenge.—But with theſe principles at the heart of every ſoldier—and <hi>there</hi> they will be—for there is a charm in the very wanderings and dreams of liberty that diſarms an Engliſhman's anger—with theſe principles at the heart, care muſt be taken, that the honour, the aſcendancy, the impreſſion of the Britiſh arms be not inſulted or diminiſhed in the hands of thoſe to whom they are intruſted: and while we remember, we are contending againſt fellow ſubjects and brothers, it muſt not be forgot we
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:042784_0005_101C93BFC9C8C6A8"/>
are contending in the criſis, and for the fate, of the Britiſh empire.</p>
            <p>An honourable young member<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Ackland.</note> on the other ſide, who has entered into the army with a zeal that juſtly entitles him to the eſteem of every officer, and whoſe parliamentary ſpirit and talents have this day proved him a moſt valuable acquiſition to this Houſe—aſked early in the dabate—Whether it could be ſuppoſed, thoſe Americans who denied the authority of Britiſh Legiſlature, would accept the mode of Taxation propoſed by theſe reſolutions? I believe they will not, and I differ with him ſo far upon this occaſion as to ſay, I do not like the reſolutions the worſe upon that account. While they hold out conciliation to thoſe who wiſh to return to obedience and fidelity and muſt be accepted by all rational men and well intentioned ſubjects, the refuſal of them will be as explicitly and deciſively declaratory, as any manifeſto could expreſs, of the principles upon which they act who continue to reſiſt, and it puts the diſpute upon clear ground.</p>
            <p>Sir, in foreign war, the <hi>conſcience</hi> of the quarrel belongs to the State alone. the ſoldier draws his ſword with alacrity; the cauſe in which he engages reſts between God and his Prince; and he wants no other excitements to this duty, than ſuch as the glory of his Country, perſonal honour, and juſt ambition will ſuggeſt. In civil diſcord (without inquiring ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitically whether in any or in what poſſible caſe a military ſervant of the Crown can be juſtified, in declining a ſervice to which he is legally commanded) I believe a conſideration of the cauſe will find its way to the breaſt of every conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man, and in the execution of his duty he will feel ſorrow and remorſe on one ſide, or ſatisfaction and inward comfort on the other, according to the private judgment he entertains.—I perceive gentlemen on every ſide the houſe acknowledge
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:042784_0006_101C6535EB256518"/>
the truth of this general obſervation.—off, I ſhall be aſtoniſhed if any gentleman denies the particular application of it.—Is there a man in England—I am confident there is not an officer or ſoldier in the King's ſervice, who does not think the Parliamentary rights of Great Britain a cauſe to fight for, to bleed and die for? Sir, I will aſſert, that the profeſſed advocates of America have never ventured to meet this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fairly—They have always ſhifted it to collateral inquiries, accuſation, recrimination, and examination of the meaſures by which we have been led into our preſent dilemma. Sir, paſt errors may be great and manifeſt, every adminiſtration for ten years paſt may have had their ſhare.—It is not my preſent purpoſe to juſtify any—Inquries may be very proper at a proper time; but, as a Member of Parliament, I hold myſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably called upon, to take up the queſtion upon this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant <hi>Now,</hi> this unparalleled moment in the Engliſh Hiſtory, when we tamely ſuffer Government to be ſuſpended—when we fit here the mere ſhadow of authority—the phantom of a Parliament, aſſembling only to lament the ſubſtance we have loſt, and to propoſe and ſubtiliſe queſtions of our own impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</p>
            <p>Sir, another method of evading a debate upon the true me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of this queſtion, has been to confound the underſtanding. Ingenious men will run changes upon real and virtual repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation; external and internal taxes; revenue and regulation; till one's head grows dizzy with diſtinctions, and the moſt groſs abſurdities and contradictions become for a moment ſpecious: but it is not in rhethoric or ſophiſtry to argue the great rational majority of the people of England, out of the plain, ſimple propoſition which is contained in the declaratory act of the ſixth of the preſent King.—The reaſon of the nation has been long convinced—the trial now only is, whether we have ſpirit to ſupport our conviction—Sir, if the whole body of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom does not rouſe at this alarm, and ſhake off that torpitude under which our public ſpirit has long ſhamefully languiſhed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:042784_0007_101C93C4A41DF4D8"/>
—if every claſs and diſtinction of men do not join in this great cauſe—if our merchants and manufacturers do not in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance take example from the Americans, and render it glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by adapting it to a better cauſe—if they do not feel inſult and affront in the ſuſpicion, that while one country dares the interruption of commerce to effectuate her chimerical claims, the other will not exert equal fortitude to vindicate her fundamental rights—if this be our wretched ſtate—I agree, that the ſooner a formal ſurrender is made, the better; let Great Britain revert to her primitive inſignificancy in the map of the world, and the Congreſs of Philadelphia be the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to diſpenſe the bleſſings of Empire—Let us ſpare the blood of our ſubjects, let us ſpare the treaſures of the ſtate, but let us, at the ſame time, confeſs, we are no more a people.</p>
            <p>Sir, after this avowal of my principles, it might be thought, that I ſought the ſituation in which I am going to be employed—I publickly declare I did not ſeek it.—I will take leave to ſay on the part of my colleagues, it was ſought by none of us—but it was accepted with that ſubmiſſion which is due from ſervants of the Crown, and with that ſenſe of gratitude to his Majeſty, which the importance of the truſt required.—I feel an additional call of gratitude on my own part, for the honor my name receives in being claſſed with thoſe of the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed officers to whom I have alluded.</p>
            <p>I will treſpaſs no longer upon the time of the Houſe. With the ſentiments I have expreſſed, I take leave of all Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can queſtions, with theſe ſentiments I ſhall take leave of my country; I ſhall endeavour to maintain them in arguments, if admitted to any intercourſe in America; I ſhall enforce them to the beſt of my power, if called upon to act in the line of my profeſſion—conſcientiouſly covinced, that upon the due ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of them both here and on the other ſide the Atlantic, the exiſtence of this country and conſtitution, directly, emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and concluſively, depends.</p>
