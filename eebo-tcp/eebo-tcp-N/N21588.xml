            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE</head>
            <p>THE celebrating the praiſes of the dead, is an argument ſo worn out by long and frequent uſe; and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo nauſeous, by the flattery that uſually attends it, that it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if funeral orations, or panegyrics, are more conſidered for the elegancy of ſtyle, and fineneſs, of wit, than for the authority they carry with them as to the truth of matters of fact. And yet I am not hereby deterred from meddling with this kind of argument, nor from handling it with all the plainneſs I can: delivering only what I myſelf heard and ſaw, without any borrowed ornament.</p>
            <p>I do eaſily foreſee how many will be engaged for the ſupport of their
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:028377_0003_0FD8DB42531306B0"/>
impious maxims and immoral practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to diſparage what I am to write. Others will cenſure it, becauſe it comes from one of my profeſſion, too many ſuppoſing us to be induced, to frame ſuch diſcourſes for carrying on what they are pleaſed to call <hi>Our Trade.</hi> Some will think I dreſs it up too arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially, and others, that I preſent it too plain and naked.</p>
            <p>But being reſolved to govern my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the exact rules of truth, I ſhall be leſs concerned in the cenſures I may fall under. It may ſeem liable to great exception, that I ſhould diſcloſe ſo many things, that were diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, if not under the ſeal of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, yet under the confidence of friendſhip; but this noble lord himſelf not only releaſed me from all obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this kind, when I waited on him in his laſt ſickneſs, a few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, but gave it me in charge not to ſpare him in any thing which I thought might be of uſe to the living; and was not ill pleaſed to be laid open,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:028377_0004_0FD8DB439A6E4BE0"/>
as well in the worſt as in the beſt and laſt part of his life, being ſo ſincere in his repentance, that he was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to take ſhame to himſelf, by ſuffering his faults to be expoſed for the benefit of others.</p>
            <p>I write with one great diſadvantage —that I cannot reach his chief deſign, without mentioning ſome of his faults: but I have touched them as tenderly as the occaſion would bear; and I am ſure with much more ſoftneſs than he deſired, or would have conſented to, had I told him how I intended to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage this part. I have related no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with perſonal reflections on any others, concerned with him, wiſhing rather that they themſelves, reflecting on the ſenſe he had of his former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, may be thereby led to forſake their own; than that they ſhould be any ways reproached by what I write: and therefore though he uſed very few reſerves with me, as to his courſe of life, yet ſince others had a ſhare in moſt parts of it, I ſhall relate nothing
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:028377_0005_0FD8DB4839C4D950"/>
but what more immediately concerned himſelf: and ſhall ſay no more of his faults, than is neceſſary to illuſtrate his repentance.</p>
            <p>The occaſion that led me into ſo particular a knowledge of him, was an intimation given me by a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his acquaintance, of his deſire to ſee me. This was ſometime in October, 1679, when he was ſlowly recovering out of a great diſeaſe. He had underſtood that I often attended on one well known to him, that died the ſummer before; he was alſo then entertaining himſelf in that low ſtate of his health, with the firſt part of the <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation</hi> then newly come out, with which he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not ill pleaſed: and we had acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally met in two or three places ſome time before.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the motives that led him to call for my company. After I had waited on him once or twice, he grew into that freedom with me,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:028377_0006_0FD8DB499B47F688"/>
as to open to me all his thoughts, both of religion and morality, and to give me a full view of his paſt life, and ſeemed not uneaſy at my frequent viſits. So till he went from London, which was in the beginning of April, I waited on him often.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I heard how ill he was, and how much he was touched with the ſenſe of his former life, I writ to him, and received from him an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that, without my knowledge, was printed ſince his death; from a copy which one of his ſervants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the preſs. In it there is ſo undeſerved a value put on me, that it had been very indecent for me to have publiſhed it: yet that muſt be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his civility and way of breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and indeed he was particularly known to ſo few of the clergy, that the good opinion he had of me, is to be imputed only to his unacquaintence with others.</p>
            <p>My end of writing, is ſo to diſcharge
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:028377_0007_0FD8DB4E9D84AFB8"/>
the laſt commands this lord left on me, as that it may be effectual to awaken thoſe who run on to all the exceſſes of riot; and that in the midſt of thoſe heats, which their luſts and paſſions raiſe in them, they may be a little wrought on by ſo great an inſtance, of one who had run round the whole circle of luxury; and as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays of himſelf, <hi>Whatſoever his eyes deſired, he kept it not from them; and withheld his heart from no joy.</hi> But when he looked back on all that on which he had waſted his time and ſtrength, he eſteemed it vanity and vexation of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: though he had both as much na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural wit, and as much acquired by learning, and both as much improved by thinking and ſtudy, as perhaps any libertine of the age. Yet when he reflected on all his former courſes, even before his mind was illuminated with better thoughts, he counted them madneſs and folly.</p>
            <p>But when the powers of religion came to operate on him, then he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:028377_0008_0FD8DB51B9C955C0"/>
a deteſtation to the contempt he formerly had of them, ſuitable to what became a ſincere penitent, and expreſſed himſelf in ſo clear and ſo calm a manner, ſo ſenſible of his fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings towards his maker and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, that as it wrought not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle on thoſe that were about him; ſo, I hope, the making it public may have a more general influence, chiefly on thoſe on whom his former converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might have had ill effects.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to give his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as fully as I could take it: for I who ſaw him only in one light, in a ſedate and quiet temper, when he was under a great decay of ſtrength and loſs of ſpirits, cannot give his picture with that life and advantage that others may, who knew him when his parts were more bright and lively: yet the compoſure he was then in, may perhaps be ſuppoſed to balance any abatement of his uſual vigour which the declination of his health brought him under.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="unknown:028377_0009_0FD8DB5424DE3B80"/>I have written this diſcourſe with as much care, and have conſidered it as narrowly as I could. I am ſure I have ſaid nothing but truth. I have done it ſlowly, and often uſed my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts in it, not being ſo much concerned in the cenſures which might fall on myſelf, as cautious that nothing ſhould paſs, that might obſtruct my only deſign of writing, which is the doing what I can towards the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a looſe and lewd age.</p>
            <p>And if ſuch a ſignal inſtance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with all the evidence that we have for our moſt holy faith, has no effect on thoſe who are running the ſame courſe, it is much to be feared they are given up to a reprobate ſenſe.</p>

            <head>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE LIEE and DEATH OF JOHN, EARL OF ROCHESTER.</head>
            <p>JOHN WILMOT earl of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> was born in April, anno domini 1648. His father was <hi>Henry</hi> earl of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> but beſt know by the title of lord <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot,</hi> who bore ſo great a part in all the late wars, that mention is often made of him in the hiſtory. He had the chief ſhare in the honour of the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028377_0011_0FD8DB595CB11F90"/>
of his majeſty that now reigns, after <hi>Worcheſter</hi>-fight, and the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from place to place, till he happily eſcaped into <hi>France;</hi> but dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the king's return, he left his ſon little other inheritance, than the honour and title derived to him, with the pretenſions ſuch eminent ſervices gave him to the king's favour. Theſe were carefully managed by the great prudence and diſcretion of his mother, a daughter of that noble and ancient family of the <hi>St. John's</hi> of <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> ſo that his education was carried on in all things ſuitably to his quality.</p>
            <p>When he was at ſchool he was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary proficient at his book; and thoſe ſhining parts which have ſince ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with ſo much luſtre, began then to ſhew themſelves: He acquired the Latin to ſuch perfection, that to his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-day he retained a great reliſh for the fineneſs and beauty of that tongue; and was exactly verſed in the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable authors that writ about <hi>Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>' time, whom he read often with that peculiar delight, which the greateſt wits have ever found in thoſe ſtudies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:028377_0012_0FD8DB5AE02B0FC8"/>When he went to the univerſity, the general joy that over-ran the whole nation upon his majeſty's reſtoration but was not regulated with that ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and temperance, that became a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious gratitude to God for ſo great a bleſſing, produced ſome of its ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects on him: He began to love theſe diſorders too much.</p>
            <p>His tutor was that eminent and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous divine Dr. <hi>Blanford,</hi> afterwards promoted to the ſees of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Worceſter.</hi> And under his inſpection, he was committed to the more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate care of Mr. <hi>Phineas Berry,</hi> a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of <hi>Wadham</hi> college, a very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and good natured man; whom he afterward uſed with much reſpect, and rewarded as became a great man. But the humour of that time wrought ſo much on him, that he broke off the courſe of his ſtudies, to which no means could ever effectually recal him; till when he was in <hi>Italy</hi> his governor Dr. <hi>Balfour,</hi> a worthy and learned man, now a celebrated phyſician in <hi>Scotland,</hi> his native country, drew him
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028377_0013_0FD8DB5EB155DA30"/>
to read ſuch books as were moſt likely to bring him back to love learning and ſtudy: and he often acknowledged to me, in particular three days before his death, how much he was obliged to love and honour this his governor, to whom he thought he owed more than to all the world, next after his parents for his care and ſidelity of him, while he was under his truſt.</p>
            <p>But no part of it affected him more ſenſibly, than that he engaged him by many tricks (ſo he expreſſed it) to delight in books and readings. So that ever after he took occaſion in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of thoſe woeful extravagancies that conſumed moſt of his time to read much: and though the time was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally but indifferently employed, for the choice of the ſubjects of his ſtudies was not always good, yet the habitual love of knowledge, together with theſe fits of ſtudy, had much awakened his underſtanding and prepared him for better things, when his mind ſhould be ſo far changed as to reliſh them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:028377_0014_0FD8DB6258E4B9F8"/>He came from his travels in the 18th year of his age, and appeared at court with as great advantages as moſt ever had. He was a graceful and well ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped perſon, tall, and well made, if not a little too ſlender. He was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly well bred, and what by a modeſt behaviour natural to him, what by a civility become almoſt as natural, his converſation was eaſy and obliging. He had a ſtrange vivacity of thought, and vigour of expreſſion. His wit had a ſubtility and ſublimity both that were ſcarce imitable. His ſtyle was clear and ſtrong. When he uſed fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures they were very lively, and yet far enough out of the common road. He had made himſelf maſter of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and modern wit, and of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> as well as the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> He loved to talk and write of ſpeculative matters, and did it with ſo fine a thread that even thoſe that hated the ſubjects that his fancy run upon, yet could not but be charmed with his way of treating them. <hi>Boileau</hi> among the <hi>French,</hi> and

               <hi>Cowley</hi> among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> wits, were thoſe he admired moſt, Sometimes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens thoughts mixed with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures, but that flowed rather from the impreſſions they made on him when he read them, by which they came to return upon him as his own thoughts, than that he ſervilely copied them from any. For few men ever had a bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er flight of fancy more ſteadily go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by judgment than he had. No wonder a young man ſo made and ſo improved was very acceptable in a court.</p>
            <p>Soon after his coming thither, he laid hold on the firſt occaſion that offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſhew his readineſs to hazard his life in the defence and ſervice of his, country. In the Winter of 1665, he went with the earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi> to ſea, when he was fent to lie for the <hi>Dutch Eaſt India</hi> fleet; and was in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> commanded by Sir <hi>Thomas Tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diman,</hi> when the attack was made on the port of <hi>Bergen</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhips having got into that port. It was as deſperate an attempt as ever was
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028377_0016_0FD8DB6858DBB560"/>
made: during the whole action, the Earl of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> ſhewed as brave and and as reſolute courage as was poſſible. A perſon of honour told me he heard the Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> who was in the ſame ſhip, often magnify his courage at that time very highly. Nor did the rigours of the ſeaſon, the hardneſs of the voyage, and the extreme dangers he had been in, deter him from running the like on the very next occaſion. For in the Summer following he went to ſea again, without communicating his deſign to his neareſt relations. He went aboard the ſhip commanded by Sir <hi>Edward Spragge,</hi> the day before the great ſea-fight of that year. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the volunteers that were in the ſame ſhip were killed. Mr. <hi>Middleton,</hi> (brother to Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton</hi>) was ſhot in his arms. During the action, Sir <hi>Edward Spragge</hi> not being ſatisfied with the behaviour of one of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, could not eaſily find a perſon who would cheerfully venture through ſo much danger, to carry his commands to that captain. This lord offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028377_0017_0FD8DB69F71BC5D8"/>
to the ſervice; and went in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boat through all the ſhot, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his meſſage, and returned back to Sir <hi>Edward:</hi> which was much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by all that ſaw it. He thought it neceſſary to begin his life with theſe demonſtrations of his courage in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement and way of fighting, which is acknowledged to be the greateſt trial of clear and undaunted valour.</p>
            <p>He had ſo entirely laid down the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance that was growing on him before his travels, that at his return he hated nothing more. But falling into company that loved theſe exceſſes, he was, though not without difficulty, and by many ſteps, brought back to it again. And the natural heat of his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy being inflamed by wine, made him ſo extravagantly pleaſant, that many to be more diverted by that humour, ſtudied to engage him in deeper and deeper intemperance; which at length did ſo entirely ſubdue him, that, as he told me, for five years together he was continually drunk: not all the while under the viſible effect of it, but his
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028377_0018_0FD8DB6DFA8D8080"/>
blood was ſo inflamed, that it was not in all that time cool enough to to be perfectly maſter of himſelf. This led him to ſay and do many wild and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable things: by this, he ſaid, he had broke the firm conſtitution of his health, that ſeemed ſo ſtrong, that nothing was too hard for it; and he had ſuffered ſo much in his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he almoſt diſpaired to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it.</p>
            <p>There were principles in his natural temper, that being heightened by that heat carried him to great exceſſes—a violent love of pleaſure, and a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to extravagant mirth. The one involved him in great ſenſuality; the other led him to many odd adventures and frolicks, in which he was oft in hazard of his life. The one being the ſame irregular appetite in his mind, that the other was in his body, which made him think nothing diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that was not extravagant. And though in cold blood he was a generous and good natured man, yet he would go far in his heats, after any thing that
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028377_0019_0FD8DB6F2AEECC88"/>
might turn to a jeſt or matter of diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>He ſaid to me, He never improved his intereſt at court, to do a premeditated miſchief to other perſons. Yet he laid out his wit very freely in libels and ſatires, in which he had a peculiar ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of mixing his wit with his malice, and fitting both with ſuch apt words, that men were tempted to be pleaſed with them; from thence his compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures came to be eaſily known, for few had ſuch a way of tempering theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as he had. So that when any thing extraordinary that way came out, as a child is fathered ſometimes by its reſemblance, ſo was it laid at his door as its parent and author.</p>
            <p>Theſe exerciſes in the courſe of his life were not always equally pleaſant to him; he had often ſad intervals and ſevere reflections on them. And though then he had not theſe awakened in him from any principle of religion, yet the horror that nature raiſed in him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſome ſickneſſes, made him too eaſy to recieve ſome ill principles,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028377_0020_0FD8DB70DC379A30"/>
which others endeavoured to poſſeſs him with; ſo that he was ſoon brought to ſet himſelf to ſecure and fortify his his mind againſt that, by diſpoſſeſſing it of all he could of the belief or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of religion.</p>
            <p>The licentiouſneſs of his temper, with the briſkneſs of his wit, diſpoſed him to love the converſation of thoſe who divided their time between lewd acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and irregular mirth. And ſo he came to bend his wit and direct his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and endeavours to ſupport and ſtrengthen theſe ill principles both in himſelf and others.</p>
            <p>An accident fell out after this, which confirmed him more in theſe courſes. When he went to ſea in the year 1665 there happened to be in the ſame ſhip with him, Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> and another gentleman of quality; theſe two, the former eſpecially, ſeemed perſuaded that they ſhould never return into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> ſaid, he was ſure of it: the other was not ſo poſitive. The Earl of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> and the laſt of theſe, entered into a formal engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028377_0021_0FD8DB77A89FE318"/>
not without ceremonies of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that if either of them died, he ſhould appear and give the other notice of the future ſtate, if there was any. But Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> would not enter into the bond. When the day came that they thought to have taken the <hi>Dutch</hi> fleet in the port of <hi>Bergen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> though he had ſuch a ſtrong preſage in his mind of his approaching death, yet he generouſly ſtaid all the while in a place of the greateſt danger. The other gentleman ſignalized his courage in a moſt undaunted manner, till near the end of the action, when he fell on a ſudden into ſuch a trembling that he could ſcarce ſtand: and Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> going up to him to hold him up, as they were in each others arms, a cannot ball killed him outright, and carried away Mr. <hi>Mountague's</hi> belly, ſo that he died within an hour after.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> told me that theſe preſages they had in their minds, made ſome impreſſion on him, that there were ſeparated beings; and that the ſoul, either by a natural ſagacity,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028377_0022_0FD8DB7AF1100F00"/>
or ſome ſecret notice communicated to it, had a ſort of divination. But that gentleman's never appearing was a great ſnare to him, during the reſt of his life. Though when he told me this he could not but acknowledge, it was an unreaſonable thing to think, that beings in another ſtate were not under ſuch laws and limits, that they could not command their own motions, but as the Supreme Power ſhould order them; and that one who had ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the natural principles of truth, as he had, had no reaſon to expect that ſuch an extraordinary thing ſhould be done for his conviction.</p>
            <p>He alſo told me of another odd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that one had of his approaching death in the lady <hi>Warre,</hi> his mother in law's houſe. The chaplain dreamed that ſuch a day he ſhould die, but being by all the family put out of the belief of it, he had almoſt forgot it; till the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before at ſupper, there being thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen at table, according to fond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that one of theſe muſt ſoon die, one of the young ladies pointed to him
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028377_0023_0FD8DB7C9D3D0028"/>
that he was to die. He remembering his dream fell into ſome diſorder, and the lady <hi>Warre</hi> reproving him for his ſuperſtition, he ſaid, he was confident he was to die before morning; but he being in perfect health it was not much minded. It was <hi>Saturday</hi>-night, and he was to preach the next day. He went to his chamber and ſat up late, as appeared by the burning of his candle, and had been preparing his notes for his ſermon, but was found dead in his bed the next morning. Theſe things he ſaid, made him inclined to believe the ſoul was a ſubſtance diſtinct from matter; and this often returned into his thoughts. But that which perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his perſuaſion about it, was that in the ſickneſs which brought him ſo near death before I firſt knew him, when his ſpirits were ſo low and ſpent, that he could not move nor ſtir, and did not expect to live an hour. He ſaid his reaſon and judgment were ſo clear and ſtrong, that from thence he was fully perſuaded that death was not the ſpending or diſſolution of the ſoul, but
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028377_0024_0FD8DB811BDF4CB8"/>
only the ſeparation of it from matter. He had in that ſickneſs great, remorſes for his paſt life, but he afterwards told me, they were rather general and dark horrors, than any convictions of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God. He was ſorry he lived ſo as to waſte his ſtrength ſo ſoon, or that he had brought ſuch an ill name upon himſelf; and had an agony in his mind about it, which he knew not well how to expreſs. But at ſuch times though he complied with his friends in ſuffering divines to be ſent for, he ſaid, he had no great mind to it: and that it was but a piece of his breeding, to deſire them to pray by him, in which he joined but little himſelf.</p>
            <p>As to the ſupreme Being, he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome impreſſion of one: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed often to me, That he had never known an entire <hi>atheiſt,</hi> who full believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there was no God. Yet when he explained his notion of that Being, it amounted to no more than a vaſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that had none of the attributes of goodneſs and juſtice we aſcribe to the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028377_0025_0FD8DB821887FBC8"/>
Deity. Theſe were his thoughts about religion, as himſelf told me.</p>
            <p>For morality, he freely owned to me, that though he talked of it as a fine thing, yet this was only becauſe he thought it a decent way of ſpeaking, and that as they went always in cloaths, though in their frolicks they would have choſen ſometimes to have gone naked, if they had not feared the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſo that though ſome of them found it neceſſary for human life to talk of of morality, yet he confeſſed they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not for it, further than the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it was neceſſary for their credit, and affairs; of which he gave me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances, as their profeſſing and ſwearing friendſhip, where they hated morality; their oaths and imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their addreſſes to women, which they intended never to make good; the pleaſure they took in defaming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſons, and ſpreading falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of ſome, perhaps in revenge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not engage them to comply with their ill deſigns: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light they had in making people quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028377_0026_0FD8DB8396E8D288"/>
their unjuſt uſage to their credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and putting them off by any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful promiſe they could invent, that might deliver them from preſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. So that in deteſtation of theſe courſes, he would often break forth into ſuch hard expreſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf, as would be indecent for another to repeat.</p>
            <p>Such had been his principles and practices in a courſe of many years, which had almoſt quite extinguiſhed the natural propenſities in him to juſtice and virtue. He would often go in to the country, and be for ſome months whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed in ſtudy, or the ſallies of his wit; which he came to direct chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſatire. And this he often defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to me; by ſaying there were ſome people who could not be kept in order or admoniſhed but in this way. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, That it might be granted that a grave way of ſatire, was ſometimes no unprofitable way of reproof. Yet they who uſed it only out of ſpite, and mixed lies with truth, ſparing nothing that mightadorn their poems, or gratify their
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028377_0027_0FD8DB89678B90D0"/>
revenge, could not excuſe that way of reproach, by which the innocent often ſuffer; ſince the moſt malicious things, if wittily expreſſed, might ſtick to and blemiſh the beſt character in the world; and the malice of a libel could hardly conſiſt with the charity of an admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To this he anſwered, A man could not write with life, unleſs he was heated by revenge: for to make a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire without reſentment on the cold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>philoſophy,</hi> was as if a man would in cold blood, cut mens' throats, who had never offended him. And he ſaid, The lies in theſe libels came often in as ornaments that could not be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without ſpoiling the beauty of the poem.</p>
            <p>For his other ſtudies, they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided between the comical and witty writings of the ancients and moderns, the <hi>Roman</hi> authors, and books of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, which the ill ſtate of health he was fallen into made more neceſſary to himſelf; and which qualified him for an odd adventure which I ſhall but juſt mention. Being under an unlucky ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028377_0028_0FD8DB896A8CEDD8"/>
which obliged him to keep out of the way, he diſguiſed himſelf ſo that his neareſt friends could not have known him, and ſet up in <hi>Tower-ſtreet,</hi> for an <hi>Italian</hi> mountebank, where he practiſed phyſick for ſome weeks not without ſucceſs. In his latter years he read books of hiſtory more. He took pleaſure to diſguiſe himſelf as a porter, or as a beggar; ſometimes to follow ſome mean amours, which for the variety of them he affected. At other times merely for diverſion he would go about in odd ſhapes, in which he acted his part ſo naturally, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thoſe who were in the ſecret, and ſaw him in theſe ſhapes, could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve nothing by which he might be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>I have now made the deſcription of his former life and principles, as fully as I thought neceſſary to anſwer my end in writing. And yet with thoſe reſerves, that I hope I have given no juſt cauſe of offence to any. I have ſaid nothing but what I had from his own mouth, and have avoided the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028377_0029_0FD8DB8B19112CE0"/>
mentioning of the more particular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of his life, of which he told me not a few. But ſince others were concerned in them, whoſe good only I deſign, I will ſay nothing that may provoke or blemiſh them. It is their reformation, and not their diſgrace, I deſire: this tender conſideration of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers has made me ſuppreſs many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable and uſeful things he told me. But finding that though I ſhould name none, yet I muſt relate ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as would give great occaſion for the reader to conjecture concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſons intended right or wrong, either of which were inconvenient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, I have choſen to paſs them quite over. But I hope thoſe that know how much they were engaged with him in his ill courſes, will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what touched with this tenderneſs I expreſs towards them; and be thereby the rather induced to reflect on their ways, and to conſider without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or paſſion, what a ſenſe this noble lord had of their caſe, when he came at laſt ſeriouſly to reflect upon his own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:028377_0030_0FD8DB8C609F8830"/>I now turn to thoſe parts of this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, wherein I myſelf bore ſome ſhare, and which I am to deliver upon the obſervations I made, after a long and free converſation with him for ſome months. I was not long in his company when he told me, He ſhould treat me with more freedom than he had ever uſed to men of my profeſſion. He would conceal none of his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from me, but lay his thoughts open without any diſguiſe; nor would he do it to maintain debate or ſhew his wit, but plainly tell me what ſtuck with him. And he proteſted to me, that he was not ſo engaged to his old maxims, as to reſolve not to change, but if he could be convinced, he would chooſe rather to be of another mind. He ſaid, he would impartially weigh what I ſhould lay before him, and tell me freely when it did convince him, and when it did not. He expreſſed this diſpoſition of mind to me in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo frank, that I could not but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, and be much taken with his way of diſcourſe. So we entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028377_0031_0FD8DB92F0D720C8"/>
almoſt all the parts of natural and revealed religion, and of morality. He ſeemed pleaſed, and in a great meaſure ſatisfied, with what I ſaid on many of theſe heads. And though our freeſt converſation was when we were alone, yet upon ſeveral occaſions other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were witneſſes to it. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from many hands, that my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was not diſtaſteful to him, and that the ſubjects about which we talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt, were not unacceptable. And he expreſſed himſelf often not ill plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with many things I ſaid to him, and particularly when I viſited him in his laſt ſickneſs: ſo that I hope it may not be altogether unprofitable, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the ſubſtance of thoſe matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which we argued ſo freely, with our reaſoning upon them. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps what had ſome effects on him, may be not altogether ineffectual upon others.</p>
            <p>I followed him with ſuch arguments as I found were moſt likely to prevail with him. And my not urging other reaſons proceeded not from any diſtruſt
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028377_0032_0FD8DB9406933658"/>
I had of their force, but from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of uſing thoſe that were moſt proper for him. He was than in a low ſtate of health, and ſeemed to be ſlowly recovering from a great diſeaſe. He was in the milk diet, and apt to fall into hectic-fits; any accident weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened him; ſo that he thought he could not live long. And when he went from <hi>London,</hi> he ſaid, He believed he ſhould never come to town more. Yet during his being in town, he was ſo well that he went often abroad, and had great vivacity of ſpirit. So that he was under no ſuch decay that either dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened or weakened his underſtanding; nor was he any way troubled with the ſpleen or vapours, or under the power of melancholy.</p>
            <p>What he was then, compared to what he had been formerly, I could not ſo well judge, who had ſeen him but twice before. Others have told me they perceived no difference in his parts. This I mention more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that it may not be thought that melancholy or want of ſpirits made
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028377_0033_0FD8DB9865D16968"/>
him more inclined to recieve any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; for indeed I never diſcovered any ſuch thing in him.</p>
            <p>Having thus opened my way to the heads of our diſcourſe, I ſhall next mention them. The three chief things we talked about, were morality, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral religion, and revealed religion, Chriſtianity in particular. For mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he confeſſed, he ſaw the neceſſity of it, both for the government of the world, and the preſervation of health, life and friendſhip; and was very much aſhamed of his former practices, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe he had made himſelf a beaſt, and brought pain and ſickneſs upon his body, and had ſuffered much in his reputation, than from any deep ſenſe of a Supreme Being, or another ſtate. But ſo far this went with him that he firmly reſolved to change the courſe of his life, which he thought he ſhould effect by the ſtudy of philoſophy, and had not a few, no leſs ſolid and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant notions concerning the folly and madneſs of vice. But he confeſſed he
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028377_0034_0FD8DB9A10536D98"/>
had no remorſe for his paſt actions or offences againſt God, but only as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries to himſelf and to mankind.</p>
            <p>Upon this ſubject I ſhewed him the effects of philoſophy, for reforming the world. That it was a matter of ſpeculation, which but few either had the leiſure or the capacity to enquire into. But the principle that muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form mankind, muſt be obvious to every man's underſtanding. That philoſophy in matters of morality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the great lines of our duty, had no very certain fixed rule, but the leſſer offices and inſtances of our duty went much by the fancies of men, and cuſtoms of nations; and conſequently could not have authority enough to bear down the propenſities of nature, appetite or paſſion. For which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in theſe two points.</p>
            <p>The one was about that maxim of the Stoics, to extirpate all ſorts of paſſion and concern for any thing. That, take it by one had, ſeemed deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, becauſe if it could be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, it would make all the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028377_0035_0FD8DB9E16302D00"/>
of life eaſy; but I think it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, becauſe nature after all our ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving againſt it, will ſtill return to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Yet on the other hand it diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the bonds of nature and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſlackened induſtry which will move but dully, without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heat, and if it delivered a man of many troubles, it deprived him of the chief pleaſures of life which ariſe from friendſhip.</p>
            <p>The other was concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of pleaſure, how far that was to go. Upon this, he told me the two maxims of his morality then were; that he ſhould do nothing to the hurt of any other, or that might prejudice his own health. And he thought that all pleaſure, when it did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with theſe, was to be indulged as the gratification of our natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites. It ſeemed unreaſonable to imagine theſe were put into a man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be reſtrained, or curbed to ſuch a narrowneſs. This he applied to the free uſe of wine and women.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:028377_0036_0FD8DBA09B1405A8"/>To this I anſwered, that if appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites being natural, was an argument for indulging them, then the revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful might as well alledge it for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the covetous for ſtealing, whoſe appetites are no leſs keen on thoſe objectſ and yet it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that theſe appetites ought to be curbed. If the difference is urged from the injury another perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, the injury is as great, if a man's wife is defiled, or his daughter corrupted: and it is impoſſible for a man to let looſe his appetites to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant luſts, and not tranſgreſs in theſe particulars. So there was no curing the diſorders that muſt riſe from thence but by regulating theſe appetites. And why ſhould we not as well think that God intended our brutiſh and ſenſual appetites ſhould be governed by our reaſon, as that the fierceneſs of beaſts ſhould be managed and tamed by the wiſdom, and for the uſe of man? So that it is no real abſurdity, to grant that theſe appetites were put into men, on purpoſe to exerciſe their reaſon in the reſtraint and government
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028377_0037_0FD8DBA55A458278"/>
of them. Which to be able to do, miniſters a higher and more laſting pleaſure to a man, than to give them their full ſcope and range. And if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rules of philoſophy be obſerved, ſuch as the avoiding thoſe objects that ſtir paſſions, nothing raiſes higher paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions than ungoverned luſt, nothing darkens the underſtanding and depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a man's mind more, nor is any thing managed with more frequent returns of other immoralities, than ſuch oaths and imprecations as are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended to compaſs what is deſired. The expence that is neceſſary to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theſe irregularities, make a man falſe in his other dealings.</p>
            <p>All this he freely confeſſed was true; upon which I urged that if it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for a man to regulate his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite in things which he knew to be hurtful to him, was it not reaſonable for God to preſcribe a regulation of theſe appetites, whoſe unreſtrained courſes did produce ſuch miſchievious effects? That it could not be denied, but doing to others what we would
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028377_0038_0FD8DBA6D38A7CB8"/>
have others do unto us, was a juſt rule Thoſe men then that knew how extremely ſenſible they themſelves would be of the diſhonour of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in caſe their wives or daughters, muſt needs condemn themſelves, for doing that which they could not bear from another. And if the peace of mankind, and the entire ſatisfaction of our whole life, ought to be one of the chief meaſures of our actions, then let all the world judge, whether a man that confines his appetite, and lives contented at home, is not much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than thoſe that let their deſires run after forbidden objects.</p>
            <p>The thing being granted to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in itſelf, then the queſtion falls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the reſtrain of appetite in ſome inſtances, and the freedom of a man's thoughts, the ſoundneſs of his health, his application to affairs, with the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinelſs of his whole life. Whether the one is not to be done before the other? As to the difficulty of ſuch a reſtraint, though it is not eaſy to be done, when a man allows himſelf many liberties in
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028377_0039_0FD8DBAA9B8F30E8"/>
which it is not poſſible to ſtop; yet thoſe who avoid the occaſions that may kindle theſe impure flames, and keep themſelves well employed, find the victory and dominion over them no ſuch impoſſible or hard matter as may ſeem at firſt view.</p>
            <p>So that though the philoſophy and morality of this point were plain, yet there is not ſtrength enough in that principle to ſubdue nature and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</p>
            <p>Upon this I urged that morality could not be a ſtrong thing, unleſs a man was determined by a law within himfelf: for if he only meaſured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by decency, or the laws of the land, this would teach him only to uſe ſuch caution in his ill practices, that they ſhould not break out too viſibly; but would never carry him to an inward and univerſal probity. That virtue was of ſo complicated a nature, that unleſs man became entirely within its diſcipline, he could not adhere ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly to any one precept. For vices are often made neceſſary ſupports to
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028377_0040_0FD8DBABDB79C0A0"/>
one another. That this cannot be done either ſteadily, or with any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, unleſs the mind does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly comply with, and delight in the dictates of virtue. And that could not be effected, except a man's nature was internally regenerated and changed by a higher principle. Till that came about, corrupt nature would be ſtrong, and philoſophy but feeble; eſpecially when it ſtruggled with ſuch appetites or paſſions as were much kindled, or deeply rooted in the conſtitution of ones body.</p>
            <p>This, he ſaid, ſounded to him like enthuſiaſm or canting. He had no notion of it, and ſo could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. He comprehended the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of reaſon and philoſophy, in which as the mind became much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, there would ſoon follow as he believed, a greater eaſineſs in obeying its precepts.</p>
            <p>I told him on the other hand, that all his ſpeculations of philoſophy would not ſerve him in any ſtead, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of his nature and life, till he
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028377_0041_0FD8DBB0D419CC38"/>
applied himſelf to God for inward aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. It was certain that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions made in his reaſon governed him, as they were lively preſented to him. But theſe are ſo apt to ſlip out of our memory, and we too apt to turn our thoughts from them, and at ſometimes the contrary impreſſions are ſo ſtrong, that let a man ſet up a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning in his mind againſt them, he finds that celebrated ſaying of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Video melior a proboque deterior a ſequor.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>I ſee what is better, and approve it: but follow what is worſe,</l>
               </q>
to be all that philoſophy will amount to. Whereas thoſe who upon ſuch occaſions apply themſelves to God, by earneſt prayer, feel a diſengagement from ſuch impreſſions and themſelves endued with a power to reſiſt them. So that the bonds which formerly held them, fall off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:028377_0042_0FD8DBB4B9FAAE90"/>This he ſaid muſt be the effect of a heat in nature. It was only the ſtrong diverſion of the thoughts that gave the ſeeming victory, and he did not doubt but if one could turn to a problem in Euclid, or to write a copy of verſes, it would have the ſame effect.</p>
            <p>To this, I anſwered, that if ſuch methods did only divert the thoughts, there might be ſome force in what he ſaid; but if they not only drove out ſuch inclinations, but begat impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons contrary to them, and brought men into a new diſpoſition and habit of mind, then he muſt confeſs there was ſomewhat more than a diverſion in theſe changes, which were brought on our minds by true devotion. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that reaſon and experience were the things that determined our perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; that as experience without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be thought the deluſion of our fancy, ſo reaſon without experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had not ſo convincing an operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But theſe two meeting together, muſt needs give a man all the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he can deſire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:028377_0043_0FD8DBB718F6ABB8"/>He could not ſay it was unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to believe that the Supreme Being could make ſome thoughts ſtir in our minds with more or leſs force as it pleaſed him: eſpecially the force of theſe motions, being for the moſt part, according to the impreſſion that was made on our brains, which that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which directed the whole frame of nature, could make grow, deeper as it pleaſed. It was alſo reaſonable to ſuppoſe God a being of ſuch goodneſs, that he would give his aſſiſtance to ſuch as deſired it. For though he might upon ſome greater occaſions in an extraordinary manner turn ſome people's minds, yet ſince he had endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man with a faculty of reaſon, it is fit that men ſhould employ that as far as they could, and beg his aſſiſtance; which certainly they can do.</p>
            <p>All this ſeemed reaſonable, and at leaſt probable. Now good men who felt upon their frequent applications to God in prayer, a freedom from thoſe ill impreſſions, that formerly ſubdued them, and inward love to virtue and
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028377_0044_0FD8DBBC5AD4BA88"/>
true goodneſs, and eaſineſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in all the parts of holineſs, which was fed and cheriſhed in them by a ſeriouſneſs in prayer, and did languiſh as that went off; had as real a percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of inward ſtrength in their minds, that did riſe and fall with true devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they perceived the ſtrength of their bodies increaſed or abated, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they had or wanted good nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>After many diſcourſes upon this ſubject, he ſtill continued to think all was the effect of fancy. He ſaid, that he underſtood nothing of it, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that he thought they were very happy whoſe fancies were under the power of ſuch impreſſions, ſince they had ſomewhat on which their thoughts reſted and centered. But when I ſaw him in his laſt ſickneſs, he then told me, he had another ſenſe of what we had talked concerning prayer and inward aſſiſtances.</p>
            <p>This ſubject led us to diſcourſe of God, and of the notion of religion in general. He believed there was a
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028377_0045_0FD8DBBC5DA81A20"/>
Supreme Being. He could not think the world was made by chance, and the regular courſe of nature ſeemed to demonſtrate the eternal power of its Author. This, he ſaid, he could never ſhake off; but when he came to explain his notion of the Deity, he ſaid, he looked upon it as a vaſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that wrought every thing by the neceſſity of its nature; and thought that God had none of thoſe affections of love or hatred, which breed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation in us; and conſequently could not ſee there was to be either reward or puniſhment. He thought our conceptions of God were ſo low, that we had better not think much of him. And to love God ſeemed to him a preſumptuous thing, and the heat of fanciful men.</p>
            <p>Therefore he believed there ſhould be no other religious worſhip, but a general celebration of that being in ſome ſhort hymn. All the other parts of worſhip he eſteemed the inventions of prieſts, to make the world believe they had a ſecret of incenſing and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028377_0046_0FD8DBBE24C544E0"/>
God as they pleaſed. In a word, he was neither perſuaded that there was a ſpecial Providence about human affairs, nor that prayers were of much uſe, ſince that was to look on God as a weak being, that would be overcome with importunities. And for the ſtate after death, he thought, the ſoul did not diſſolve at death, yet he doubted much of rewards or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the one he thought too high for us to attain by our ſlight ſervices; and the other was too extreme to be inflicted for ſin. This was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his ſpeculations about God and religion.</p>
            <p>I told him his notion of God was ſo low that the Supreme Being ſeemed to be nothing but nature. For if that Being had no freedom or choice of its own actions, nor operated by wiſdom and goodneſs, all thoſe reaſons which led him to acknowledge a God, were contrary to this conceit. For if the order of the univerſe perſuaded him to think there was a God, he muſt at the ſame time conceive him to be both wiſe
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028377_0047_0FD8DBBECB0843B8"/>
and good, as well as powerful, ſince theſe all appeared equally in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: though his wiſdom and goodneſs had ways of exerting themſelves, that were far beyond our notions or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
            <p>If God was wiſe and good, he would naturally love and be pleaſed with thoſe that reſembled him in theſe perfections, and diſlike thoſe that were oppoſite to him. Every rational being naturally loves itſelf, and is delighted in others like itſelf, and averſe from what is not ſo. Truth is a rational nature acting in conformity to itſelf in all things, and goodneſs is an inclination to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the happineſs of other beings. So truth and goodneſs were the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial perfections of every reaſonable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and certainly moſt eminently in the Deity. Nor does his mercy or love raiſe paſſion or perturbation in him; for we feel that to be a weakneſs in ourſelves, which indeed only flows from our want of power, or ſkill to do what we wiſh or deſire.</p>
            <p>It is alſo reaſonable to believe God
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028377_0048_0FD8DBC261F06290"/>
would aſſiſt the endeavour of the good, with ſome helps ſuitable to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And it could not be imagined, that thoſe who imitated him ſhould not be eſpecially favoured by him; and therefore ſince this did not fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in this ſtate, it was moſt reaſonable to think it ſhould be in another, where the rewards ſhall be an admiſſion into a more perfect ſtate of conformity with God with the felicity that follows it; and the puniſhments ſhould be a total excluſion from him, with all the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and darkneſs that muſt follow that.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſeemed to be the natural reſults of ſuch ſeveral courſes of life, as well as the effects of divine juſtice, reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or puniſhing. For ſince he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſoul had a diſtinct ſubſtance ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the body, upon its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution there was no reaſon to think it paſſed into a ſtate of utter oblivion, of what it had been in formerly. But that as the reflections on the good or evil it had done, muſt raiſe joy or hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in it, ſo thoſe good or ill diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons accompanying the departed ſouls,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:028377_0049_0FD8DBC9AF6506B0"/>
they muſt either riſe up to a higher perfection, or ſink to a more depraved and miſerable ſtate.</p>
            <p>In this life, variety of affairs and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects do much cool and divert our minds; and are on the one hand, often great temptations to the good, and give the bad ſome eaſe in their trouble; but in a ſtate wherein the ſoul ſhall be ſeparated from ſenſible things, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a more quick and ſublime way of operation, this muſt very much exalt the joys and improvements of the good, and as much heighten the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and rage of the wicked.</p>
            <p>So that it ſeemed a vain thing to pretend to believe a Supreme Being, that is wiſe and good as well as great, and not think a diſcrimination will be made between the good and the bad, which, it is manifeſt, is not fully done in this life.</p>
            <p>As for the government of the world if we believe the Supreme Power made it, there is no reaſon to think he does not govern it. For all that we can fancy againſt it is the diſtraction which that
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:028377_0050_0FD8DBCA98F6CEE0"/>
infinite variety of ſecond cauſes, and the care of their concernments muſt give to the firſt, if it inſpects them all. But as among men thoſe of weaker ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities are wholly taken up with ſome one thing, whereas thoſe of more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged powers can, without diſtraction, have many things within their care; as the eye can at one view receive a great variety of objects, in that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs, without confuſion: So if we conceive the divine underſtanding to be as far above ours, as his power of creating and framing the whole u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe is above our limited activity, we will no more think the government of the world a diſtraction on him. And if we have once overcome this preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, we ſhall be ready to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a providence directing all affairs; a care well becoming the great crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
            <p>As for worſhipping him, if we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine our worſhip is a thing that adds to his happineſs, or gives him ſuch a fond pleaſure as weak people have to hear themſelves commended; or that
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028377_0051_0FD8DBCF5681F680"/>
our repeated addreſſes do overcome him through our mere importunity, we have certainly very unworthy thoughts of him. The true end of worſhip comes within another conſideration, which is this, a man is never entirely reformed till a new principle governs his thoughts; nothing makes a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo ſtrong, as deep and frequent meditations of God, whoſe nature though it be far above our comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet his goodneſs and wiſdom are ſuch perfections as fall within our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. And he that thinks often of God, and conſiders him as governing the world, and as ever obſerving all his actions, will feel a very ſenſible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſuch meditations, as they grow more lively and frequent with him; ſo the end of religious worſhip, either public or private, is to make the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of God have deeper root and a ſtronger influence on us. The fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent returns of theſe are neceſſary, leſt if we allow of too long intervals between them, theſe impreſſions may grow feebler, and other ſuggeſtions
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028377_0052_0FD8DBD0978CD6D0"/>
may come in their room. And the returns of prayer are not to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as favours extorted by mere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, but as rewards conferred on men ſo well diſpoſed and prepared for them, according to the promiſes that God had made for anſwering our prayers, thereby to engage and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh a devout temper in us, which is the chief root of all true holineſs and virtue.</p>
            <p>It is true, we cannot have ſuitable notions of the divine eſſence; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we have no juſt Idea of any eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence whatſoever. Since we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider all things either by their outward figure or effects, and from thence make inferences what their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt be; ſo though we cannot frame any perfect image in our minds of the Divinity, yet we may from the diſcoveries God has made of himſelf, form ſuch conceptions of him, as may poſſeſs our minds with great reverence for him, and beget in us ſuch a love of thoſe perfections as to engage us to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them. For when we ſay we love,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028377_0053_0FD8DBD59ECF5058"/>
the meaning is, we love that being God that is holy, juſt, good, wiſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely perfect. And loving theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes in that object, will certainly carry us to deſire them in ourſelves. For whatever we love in another, we naturally, according to the degree of our love, endeavour to reſemble. In ſum, the loving and worſhipping of God, though they are juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able returns and expreſſions of the ſenſe we have of his goodneſs to us, yet they are exacted of us not only as a tribute to God, but as a mean to beget in us a conformity to his nature, which is the chief end of pure and undefiled reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>If ſome men have at ſeveral times found out inventions to corrupt this, and cheat the world, it is nothing but what occurs in every form of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to which men betake themſelves. Mountebanks corrupt phyſic: petty-foggers have entangled the matters of property: and all profeſſions have been vitiated by the knaveries of a number of their calling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:028377_0054_0FD8DBD8D86642F8"/>With all theſe diſcourſes he was not equally ſatisfied. He ſeemed convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that the impreſſions of God being much in men's minds, would be a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful means to reform the world; and did not ſeem determined againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. But for the next ſtate he thought it more likely that the Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan anew, and that her ſenſe of what ſhe had done in this body, lying in the figures that are made in the brain as ſoon as ſhe diſlodged, all theſe periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that the ſoul went into ſome other ſtate to begin a new courſe.</p>
            <p>But I ſaid upon this head, that this was at beſt a conjecture raiſed in him by his fancy, for he could give no reaſon to prove it true. Nor was all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance our ſouls had of paſt things, ſeated in ſome material figures lodged in the brain: though it could not be denied but that a great deal of it lay in the brain. That we have many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted notions and ideas of immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial things, which depend not on bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Figures. Some ſins, ſuch as falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and ill nature were ſeated in the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028377_0055_0FD8DBDACD8DBA00"/>
mind, as luſt and appetite were in the body; and as the whole body was the receptacle of the ſoul, and the eyes and ears were the organs of ſeeing and hearing, ſo was the brain the ſeat of memory. Yet the power and faculty of memory, as well as of ſeeing and hearing, lay in the mind; and ſo it was no inconceivable thing that either the ſoul by its own ſtrength, or by the means of ſome ſubtiler organs, which might be fitted for it in another ſtate, ſhould ſtill remember as well as think.</p>
            <p>But indeed we know ſo little of the nature of our ſouls, that it is a vain thing for us to raiſe an hypotheſis out of the conjectures we have about it, or to reject one, because of ſome difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that occur to us; ſince it is as hard to underſtand how we remember things now, as how we ſhall do it in another ſtate; only we are ſure we do it now, and ſo we ſhall be then when we do it.</p>
            <p>When I preſſed him with the ſecret joys a good manfelt, particularly as he drew near death, and the horrors of ill men
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028377_0056_0FD8DBDC16C456B0"/>
eſpecially at that time; he was willing to aſcribe to the impreſſions they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from their education. But he often confeſſed that whether the buſineſs of religion was true or not, he thought thoſe who had the perſuaſions of it, and lived ſo that they had quiet in their conſciences, and believed God govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the world, and acquieſced in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and had the hope of an endleſs bleſſedneſs in another ſtate, the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt men in the world. And ſaid, he would give all he was maſter of to be under thoſe perſuaſions, and to have the ſupports and joys that muſt needs flow from them.</p>
            <p>I told him the main root of all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in men's principles, was their ill life; which, as it darkened their minds, and diſabled them from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning better things; ſo it made it neceſſary for them to ſeek out ſuch opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as might give them eaſe from thoſe clamours, that would otherwiſe have been raiſed in them. He did not deny but that after the doing of ſome things, he felt great and ſevere chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028377_0057_0FD8DBE20734BA00"/>
within himſelf: But he ſaid, he felt not theſe after ſome others which I would perhaps call far greater ſins, than thoſe that affected him more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly. This I ſaid, might flow from the diſorders he had caſt himſelf into, which had corrupted his judgment and vitiated his taſte of things; and by his long continuance in, and frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating of ſome immoralities, he had made them ſo familiar to him that they had become as it were natural: And then it was no wonder if he had not ſo exact a ſenſe of what was good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; as a fevriſh man cannot judge of taſtes.</p>
            <p>He did acknowledge the whole ſyſtem of religion, if believed, was a greater foundation of quiet than any other thing whatſoever; for all the quiet he had in his mind, was, that he could not think ſo good a being as the Deity would make him miſerable. I aſked him if when by the ill courſe of his life he had brought ſo many diſeaſes on his body, he could blame God for it; or expect that he ſhould deliver him from
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:028377_0058_0FD8DBE357702AF8"/>
them by a miracle. He confeſſed there was no reaſon for that. I then urged that if ſin ſhould caſt the mind by a natural effect, into endleſs horrors and agonies, which being ſeated in a being not ſubject to death, it muſt laſt for ever unleſs ſome miraculous power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed, could he accuſe God for that which was the effect of his own choice and ill life.</p>
            <p>He ſaid, they were happy that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, for it was not in every man's power.</p>
            <p>And upon this we diſcourſed long about revealed religion. He ſaid, he did not underſtand the buſineſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration; he believed the writers of the Scriptures had heats and honeſty, and ſo writ; but could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how God ſhould reveal his ſecrets to mankind. Why was not man made a creature more diſpoſed for religion, and better illuminated? He could not apprehend how there ſhould be any corruption in the nature of man, or a lapſe derived from Adam. God's communicating his mind to one man,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028377_0059_0FD8DBE76ECB2810"/>
was the putting it in his power to cheat the world. For propneſies and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, the world had always been full of ſtrange ſtories; for the boldneſs and cunning of the contrivers meeting with the ſimplicity and credulity of the people, things were eaſily received; and being once received, paſſed down without contradiction. The incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of ſtyle in the Scriptures, the odd tranſitions, the ſeeming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, chiefly about the order of time, the cruelties enjoyned the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> in deſtroying the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſicion, and many other rites of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> worſhip, ſeemed to him unſuitable to the divine nature; and the firſt three chapters of Geneſis, he thought could not be true, unleſs they were parables. This was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what he excepted to reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed religion in general, and to the old Teſtament in particular.</p>
            <p>I anſwered to all this, that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing upon the teſtimony of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in other matters where there was no reaſon to ſuſpect the teſtimony,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028377_0060_0FD8DBEA687C6910"/>
chiefly where it was confirmed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtances, was not only a reaſonable thing, but was the hinge on which all the government and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the world depended; ſince all courts of juſtice proceed from evidence given by witneſſes, for the uſe of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings is but a thing more lately brought into the world.</p>
            <p>So then if the credibility of the thing, the innocence and diſintereſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the witneſſes, the number of them, and the moſt public confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that could poſſibly be given, do concur to perſuade us of any matter of fact, and it is a vain thing to ſay, becauſe it is poſſible for ſo many men to agree in a lie, that therefore theſe have done it. In all other things a man gives his aſſent when the credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is ſtrong on the one ſide, and there appears nothing on the other ſide to balance it.</p>
            <p>So ſuch numbers agreeing in the teſtimony of theſe miracles, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance—our Saviour's calling <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the grave the fourth day after
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028377_0061_0FD8DBED1879F9D8"/>
he was buried, and his own riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain after he was certainly dead; if there had been ever ſo many impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world, no man can with reaſonable colour pretend this was one.</p>
            <p>We find both by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> writers that lived in that time, that our Saviour was crucified: and that all his diſciples and followers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved certainly that he roſe again. They believed this upon the teſtimony of the Apoſtles, and of many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds who ſaw it, and died confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. They went about to perſuade the world of it, with great zeal, though they knew they were to get nothing by it, but reproach and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: and by many wonders which they wrought they confirmed their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Now to avoid all this by ſaying, it is poſſible this might be a contrivance and to give no preſumption to make it ſo much as probable, that it was ſo, is in plain Engliſh to ſay, <hi>We are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, let the evidence be what it will, we will not believe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:028377_0062_0FD8DBF10AE6D138"/>He ſaid, if a man ſays he cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, what help is there? for he was not maſter of his own belief, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving was at higheſt but a probable opinion.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwered, that if a man will let a wanton conceit poſſeſs his fancy againſt theſe things and never conſider the evidence for religion on the other hand, but reject it upon a flight view of it, he ought not to ſay he cannot, but will not believe. And while a man lives an ill courſe of life, he is not fitly qualified to examine the matter aright. Let him grow calm and virtuous, andup on due applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examine things fairly, and then let him pronounce according to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, if to take it at its loweſt, the reaſons on the one hand are not much ſtronger than they are on the other. For I found he was ſo poſſeſſed with the general conceit, that a mixture of knaves and fools had made all extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary things eaſily believed, that it carried him away to determine the matter, without ſo much as looking
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028377_0063_0FD8DBF25B6EC420"/>
on the hiſtorical evidence for the truth of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which he had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, but had bent all upon his wit and ſtudy to the ſupport of the other ſide.</p>
            <p>As for that, that believing is at beſt but an opinion; if the evidence be but probable, it is ſo; but if it be ſuch that it cannot be queſtioned, it grows as certain as knowledge. For we are no leſs certain that there is a great town called <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the ſeat of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> empire, than that there is another called <hi>London.</hi> We have as little doubt that queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> once reigned, as that king <hi>Charles</hi> now reigns in <hi>England.</hi> So that believing may be as certain, and as little ſubject to doubting as ſeeing or knowing.</p>
            <p>There are two ſorts of believing divine matters; the one is wrought in us by our comparing all the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of matter of fact, for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of revealed religion, with the propheſies in the Scripture; where things were punctually predicted, ſome ages before their completion; not in
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028377_0064_0FD8DBF41932BAB8"/>
dark and doubtful words, uttered like oracles, that could bend to any event; but in plain terms, as the foretelling that <hi>Cyrus</hi> by name ſhould ſend the <hi>Jews</hi> back from the captivity, after the fixed period of ſeventy years: The hiſtory of the Syrian and Egyptian kings ſo punctually foretold by <hi>Daniel;</hi> and the prediction of the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with many circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces relating to it, made by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; joining theſe to the excellent rule and deſign of the Scripture in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of morality, it is at leaſt as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to believe this as any thing elſe in the world. Yet ſuch a believing as this, is only a general perſuaſion in the mind, which has not that effect, till a man applying himſelf to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections ſet down in the Scriptures, which upon ſuch evidence cannot be denied, to be as reaſonable, as for a man to follow the preſcriptions of a learned phyſician, and when theſe rules are both good and eaſy, to ſubmit to them for the recovering of his health, and by following theſe, finds a
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028377_0065_0FD8DBF79E0B6BE8"/>
power entering within him, that frees him from the ſlavery of his appetites and paſſions, that exalts his mind above the accidents of life, and ſpreads an inward purity in his heart, from which a ſerene and calm joy ariſes within him. And good men by the efficacy theſe methods have upon them, and from the returns of their prayers and other endeavours, grow aſſured that theſe things are true, and anſwerable to the promiſes they find regiſtered in Scripture.</p>
            <p>All this, he ſaid, might be fancy. But to this I anſwered, that as it were unreaſonable to tell a man that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and knows he is awake, that perhaps he is in a dream, and in his bed, and only thinks he is abroad, or that as ſome go about in their ſleep, ſo he may be aſleep ſtill; ſo good and religious men know, though others may be abuſed by their fancies, that they are under no ſuch deception; and find they are neither hot nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtical, but under the power of calm and pure principles. All this he
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028377_0066_0FD8DBF91BDA5730"/>
ſaid he did not underſtand, and that it was to aſſert or beg the thing in queſtion which he could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</p>
            <p>As for the poſſibility of revelation, it was a vain thing to deny it: For as God gives us the ſenſe of ſeeing mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial objects by our eyes, and opened in ſome a capacity of apprehending high and ſublime things, of which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men ſeemed utterly incapable; ſo that it was a weak aſſertion, that God cannot awaken a power in ſome men's minds, to apprehend and know ſome things in ſuch a manner that others are not capable of it. This is not half ſo incredible to us as ſight is to a blind man, who yet may be convinced there is a ſtrange power of ſeeing, that governs men, of which he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deprived.</p>
            <p>As for the capacity put into ſuch men's hands to deceive the world, we are at the ſame time to conſider that beſides the probity of their tempers, it cannot be thought but God can ſo forcibly bind up a man in ſome things
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028377_0067_0FD8DBFE6F356F18"/>
that it ſhould not be in his power to deliver them otherwiſe than as he gives him in commiſſion. Beſides the confirmation of miracles are a divine credential, to warrant ſuch perſons in what they deliver to the world; which cannot be imagined can be joined to a lie, ſince this were to put the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence of God, to atteſt that which no honeſt man will do.</p>
            <p>For the buſineſs of the fall of man, and other things of which we cannot perhaps give ourſelves a perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, we who cannot fathom the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the council of God, do very unreaſonably to take on us to reject an excellent ſyſtem of good and holy rules, becauſe we cannot ſatisfy our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about ſome difficulties in them. Common experience tells us there is a great diſorder in our natures, which is not eaſily rectified. All philoſophers were ſenſible of it, and every man that deſigns to govern himſelf by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, feels the ſtruggle between it and nature. So that it is plain, there is a lapſe of the high powers of the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:028377_0068_0FD8DBFFE6DBA990"/>But why, ſaid he, could not this be rectified by ſome plain rules given; but men muſt come and ſhew a trick to perſuade the world they ſpeak to them in the name of God? I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that religion being a deſign to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and ſave mankind, was to be ſo opened as to awaken and work upon all ſorts of people: and generally men of a ſimplicity of mind, were thoſe that were the fitteſt objects for God to ſhew his favour to. Therefore it was neceſſary that meſſengers ſent from heaven, ſhould appear with ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming evidences, as might awaken the world, and prepare them by ſome aſtoniſhing ſigns, to liſten to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine they were to deliver.</p>
            <p>Philoſophy, that was only a matter of fine ſpeculation, had few votaries. And as there was no authority in it to bind the world to believe its dictates, ſo they were only received by ſome of nobler and reſined natures, who could apply themſelves to and delight in ſuch notions. But true religion was to be built upon a foundation, that
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028377_0069_0FD8DC016731D428"/>
ſhould carry more weight on it, and to have ſuch convictions as might not only reach thoſe who were already diſpoſed to receive them, but rouſe up ſuch as without great and ſenſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation would have otherwiſe ſlept on in their ill courſes.</p>
            <p>Upon this and ſome other occaſions, I told him I ſaw the ill uſe he made of his wit, by which he flurred the grav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things with a ſlight daſh of his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and the pleaſure he found in ſuch wanton expreſſions, as calling the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miracles, <hi>The ſhewing of a trick,</hi> did really keep him from examining them, with that care which ſuch things required.</p>
            <p>For the old Teſtament, we are ſo remote from that time, we have ſo little knowledge of the Language in which it was writ, have ſo imperfect an account of the hiſtory of thoſe ages, know nothing of their cuſtoms, forms of ſpeech, and the ſeveral periods they might have by which they reckoned their time, that it is rather a wonder we ſhould underſtand ſo much of it,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028377_0070_0FD8DC0734A90C70"/>
than that many paſſages in it ſhould be ſod ark to us. The chief uſe it has to us Chriſtians is, that from writings which the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledge to be divinely inſpired, it is manifeſt the <hi>Meſſia</hi> was promiſed before the deſtruction of their temple; which being done long ago, and theſe propheſies agreeing to our Saviour, and no other; here is a great confirmation given to the Goſpel. But though many things in theſe books could not be underſtood by us, who lived above three thouſand years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the chief of them were written, it is no ſuch extraordinary matter.</p>
            <p>For that of the deſtruction of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi> by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> it is to be conſidered that if God had ſent a plague among them all, that could not have been found fault with. If then God had a right to take away their lives, without injuſtice or cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he had a right to appoint others to do it, as well to execute it by a more immediate way. And the taking away people by the ſword is a much gentler way of dying, than to be ſmitten with
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028377_0071_0FD8DC0A31558828"/>
a plague or a famine. And for the children that were innocent of their father's faults, God could in another ſtate make that up to them. So all the difficulty is, why were the <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> commanded to execute a thing of ſuch barbarity? But this will not ſeem ſo hard, if we conſider that this was to be no precedent for future times; ſince they did not do it but upon ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al warrant and command from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, evidenced to all the world by ſuch mighty miracles as did plainly ſhew that they were particularly deſign'd by God for the executioners of his juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. And God by employing them in ſo ſevere a ſervice, intended to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them with great horror of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which was puniſhed in ſo extreme a manner.</p>
            <p>For the rites of their religion, we can ill judge of them, except we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtood the idolatries round about them; to which we find they were much inclined. So they were to be bent by other rites to an extreme averſion from them; and yet by the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028377_0072_0FD8DC0C9C7771F0"/>
pomp of many of their ceremonies and ſacrifices, great indulgencies were given to a people naturally fond of a viſible ſplendor in religious worſhip.</p>
            <p>In all which, if we cannot deſcend to ſuch ſatisfactory anſwers, in every particular as a curious man could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, it is no wonder. The long inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of time, and other accidents, have worn out thoſe things which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give us a clear light into the meaning of them. And for the ſtory of the creation, how far ſome things in it may be parabolical, and how far hiſtorical, has been much diſputed; there is nothing in it that may not be hiſtorically true. For if it be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that ſpirits can form voices in the air, for which we have as good authority as for any thing in hiſtory, then it is no wonder that <hi>Eve</hi> being ſo lately created, might be deceived and think a ſerpent ſpake to her, when the evil ſpirit framed the voice.</p>
            <p>But in all theſe things I told him he was in the wrong way, when he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the buſineſs of religion, by ſome
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028377_0073_0FD8DC10EECEC1F0"/>
dark parts of ſcripture: there I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to conſider the whole contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Chriſtrian</hi> religion, the rules it gives, and the methods it preſcribes. Nothing can conduce more to the peace, order, and happineſs of the world, than to be governed by its rules. Nothing is more for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of every man in particular. The rules of ſobriety, temperance and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, were the beſt preſervers of life, and which was perhaps more, of health. Humility, contempt of the vanities of the world, and being well employed, raiſes a man's mind to a freedom from the follies and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that haunted the greater part. Nothing was ſo generous and great, as to ſupply the neceſſities of the poor, and to forgive injuries. Nothing rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and maintained a man's reputation ſo much, as to be exactly juſt and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, kind, charitable, and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate; nothing opened the powers of a man's ſoul ſo much as a calm tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; a ſerene mind free of paſſion and diſorder. Nothing made ſocieties,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028377_0074_0FD8DC1297BCC458"/>
families, and neighbourhoods ſo happy, as when theſe rules which the Goſpel preſcribes, took place, <hi>Of doing us we would have others do to us, and loving our neighbours as ourſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> worſhip was alſo plain and ſimple; ſuitable to ſo pure a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. The ceremonies of it were few and ſignificant, as the admiſſion to it by a waſhing with water, and a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of our Saviour's death in bread and wine; the motives in it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade to this purity were ſtrong—that God ſees us, and will judge us for all our actions—that we ſhall be ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py or miſerable, as we paſs our lives here—the example of our Saviour's life, and the great expreſſions of his love in dying for us, are mighty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to obey and imitate him—the plain way of expreſſion uſed by our Saviour and his apoſtles, ſhews there was no artifice, where there was ſo much ſimplicity uſed—there was no ſecrets kept only among the prieſts, but every thing was open to all <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus</hi>—the rewards of holineſs are not
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028377_0075_0FD8DC1435065F10"/>
entirely put over to another ſtate, but good men are ſpecially bleſt with peace in their conſciences, great joy in the confidence they have of the love of God, and of ſeeing him for ever: And often a ſingle courſe of bleſſings follows them in their whole lives: but if at other times calamities fell on them, theſe were ſo much mitigated by the patience they were taught, and the inward aſſiſtances with which they were furniſhed, that even thoſe croſſes were converted into bleſſings.</p>
            <p>I deſired he would lay all theſe things together, and ſee what he could except to them, to make him think this was a contrivance. Intereſt: ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in all human contrivancies. Our Saviour plainly had none; he avoided applauſe, withdrew himſelf from the offers of a crown; he ſubmitted to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and reproach, much contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his life, and to a moſt ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and painful death.</p>
            <p>His apoſtles had none neither; they did not pretend either to power or wealth, but delivered a doctrine that
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028377_0076_0FD8DC181CC73BB8"/>
muſt needs condemn them, if they ever made uſe of it; they declared their commiſſion fully without reſerve till other times; they recorded their own weakneſs: ſome of them wrought with their own hands; and when they received the charities of their converts, it was not ſo much to ſupply their own neceſſities, as to diſtribute to others; they knew they were to ſuffer much for giving their teſtimonies to what they had ſeen and heard; in which ſo many in a thing ſo viſible, as Chriſt's reſurrection and aſcenſion, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Holy Ghoſt which he had promiſed, could not be deceived. And they gave ſuch public confirmations of it, by the wonders they themſelves wrought, that great multitudes were converted to a doctrine, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the oppoſition it gave to luſt and paſſion, was borne down and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for three hundred years; and yet its force was ſuch, that it not only weathered out all thoſe ſtorms, but even grew and ſpread vaſtly under them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:028377_0077_0FD8DC1989A9E080"/>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> about threeſcore years after, found their numbers great and their lives innocent. And even <hi>Lucian</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt all his raillery, gives a high teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to their charity and contempt of life, and the other virtues of the <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> which is likewiſe more than once done by malice itſelf, <hi>Julian</hi> the apoſtate.</p>
            <p>If a man will lay all this in one ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and compare with it the few exceptions brought to it, he will ſoon find how ſtrong the one, and how ſlight the other are. Therefore it was an improper way, to begin at ſome cavils about ſome paſſages in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> or the <hi>Old,</hi> and from thence to prepoſſeſs one's mind againſt the whole. The right method had been firſt to conſider the whole matter, and from ſo general a view to deſcend to more particular enquiries. Whereas they ſuffered their minds to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled with prejudices, ſo that they never examined the matter impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>To the greateſt part of this he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028377_0078_0FD8DC1F6C0A1FC8"/>
to afſent, only he excepted to the belief of Myſteries in the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> which he thought no man could do, ſince it is not in a man's power to believe that which he cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and of which he can have no notion.</p>
            <p>The believing myſteries, he ſaid, made way for all the jugglings of Prieſts, for they getting the people under them in that point, ſet out to them what they pleaſed; and giving it a hard name, and calling it a <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the people were tamed, and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed it.</p>
            <p>The reſtraining a man from the uſe of women, except one in the way of marriage, and denying the remedy of divorce, he thought unreaſonable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions on the freedom of mankind. And the buſineſs of the clergy, and their maintenance, with the belief of ſome authority and power conveyed in their orders, looked, as he thought, like a piece of contrivance. And why, ſaid he, muſt a man tell me, I cannot be ſaved, unleſs I believe things againſt
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028377_0079_0FD8DC2116503438"/>
my reaſon, and then that I muſt pay him for telling me of them? Theſe were all the exceptions which at any time I heard from him to <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> To which I made theſe anſwers.</p>
            <p>For myſteries, it is plain there is in every thing ſomewhat unaccountable. How animals or men are formed in their mother's bellies, how ſeeds grow in the earth, how the ſoul dwells in the body, and acts and moves it; how we retain the figures of ſo many words or things in our memories, and how we draw them out ſo eaſily and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our thoughts or diſcourſes? How ſight and hearing were ſo quick and diſtinct, how we move, and how bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were compounded and united?</p>
            <p>Theſe things if we follow them into all the difficulties, that we may raiſe about them, will appear every whit as unaccountable as any myſtery of religion. And a blind or deaf man would judge ſight or hearing as incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, as any myſtery may be judged by us: for our reaſon is not equal to them. In the ſame rank, different
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028377_0080_0FD8DC256803ED50"/>
degrees of age or capacity raiſe ſome far above others: ſo that children can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fathom the learning nor weak perſons the counſels of more illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated minds. Therefore it was no wonder if we could not underſtand the divine eſſence. We cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how two ſuch different natures as ſoul and body ſhould ſo unite together, and be mutually affected with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other's concerns; and how the ſoul has one principle of reaſon, by which it acts intellectually, and another of life by which it joins to the body and acts vitally; two principles ſo widely differing both in their nature and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and yet united in one and the ſame perſon. There might be as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hard arguments brought againſt the poſſibility of theſe things, which yet every one knows to be true, from ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative notions, as againſt the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries mentioned in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>As that of the Trinity, that in one eſſence there are three different prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of operation, which, for want of terms fit to expreſs them by, are
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028377_0081_0FD8BE5BF48ED198"/>
called perſons, and are called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and that the ſecond of theſe did unite himſelf in a moſt intimate manner with the humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt: and that the ſufferings he underwent were accepted of God as a ſacrifice for our ſins: who thereupon confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on him a power of granting eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life to all that ſubmit to the terms on which he offers it: and that the matter of which our bodies once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, which may be as juſtly called the bodies we laid down at our deaths, as theſe can be ſaid to be the bodies we formerly lived in, being refined and made more ſpiritual, ſhall be reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to our ſouls and become a fit inſtrument for them in a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect eſtate: and that God inwardly bends and moves our wills, by ſuch impreſſions as he can make on our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and minds.</p>
            <p>Theſe, which are the chief myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our religion, are neither ſo unreaſonable, that any other objection lies againſt them, but this, that they
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028377_0082_0FD8DC2B9F9AC260"/>
agree not with our common notions, nor ſo unaccountable that ſomewhat like them, cannot be aſſigned in other things, which are believed really to be, though the manner of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be apprehended.</p>
            <p>So this ought not to be any juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the ſubmiſſion of our reaſon to what we cannot ſo well conceive, provided our belief of it be well grounded. There have been too many niceties brought indeed, rather to darken than explain theſe: they have been defended by weak argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and illuſtrated by ſimilies not always ſo very apt and pertinent. And new ſubtilties have been added which have rather perplexed than cleared them. All this cannot be denied; the oppoſition of hereticks anciently occaſioned too much curioſity among the fathers: which the ſchool-men have wonderfully advanced of late times.</p>
            <p>But if myſteries were received rather in the ſimplicity in which they are delivered in the Scriptures, than
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028377_0083_0FD8DC31237F72B8"/>
according to the diſcantings of fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men upon them, they would not appear much more incredible, than ſome of the common objects of ſenſe and perception. And it is a needleſs fear that if ſome myſteries are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that are plainly mentioned in the new Teſtament, it will then be in the power of the prieſts to add more at their pleaſure. For it is an abſurd inference from our being bound to aſſent to ſome truths about the divine eſſence, of which the manner is not underſtood, to argue that therefore in an object preſented duly to our ſenſes, ſuch as bread and wine, we ſhould be bound to believe againſt their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that it is not what our ſenſes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it to be, but the whole fleſh and blood of Chriſt; an entire body being in every crumb and drop of it. It is not indeed in a man's power to believe thus againſt his ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where the object is proportioned to them, and fitly applied, and the organs are under no indiſpoſition or diſorder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:028377_0084_0FD8DC32DADF3238"/>It is certain that no myſtery is to be admitted, but upon very clear and expreſs authorities from Scripture, which could not reaſonably be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in any other ſenſe. And though a man can form no explicit notion of a myſtery, for then it would be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a myſtery; yet in general he may believe a thing to be, though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give himſelf a particular account of the way of it; or rather, though he cannot anſwer ſome objections that lie againſt it. We know we believe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch in human matters, which are more within our reach; and it is very unreaſonable to ſay we may not do it in divine things, which are much more above our apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>For the ſevere reſtraint of the uſe of women, it is hard to deny that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege to Jeſus Chriſt as a law-giver, to lay ſuch reſtraints as all inſerior le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators do; who when they find the liberties their ſubjects take, prove hurtful to them, ſet ſuch limits, and make ſuch regulations as they judge neceſſary and expedient. It cannot
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028377_0085_0FD8DC33413E1998"/>
be ſaid but the reſtraint of appetites is neceſſary in ſome inſtances; and if it is neceſſary in theſe, perhaps other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints are no leſs neceſſary to fortify and ſecure them. For if it be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that men have a property in their wives and daughters, ſo that to defile the one, or corrupt the other, is an unjuſt and injurious thing; it is certain, that except a man carefully governs his appetites, he will break through theſe reſtraints: and There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour knowing that nothing could ſo effectually deliver the world from miſchief and unreſtrained appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, as ſuch a conſinement, might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſonably enjoin it. And in all ſuch caſes we are to balance the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies on both hands, and where we find they are heavieſt, we are to acknowledge the equity of the law. On the one hand there is no prejudice but the reſtraint of appetite; on the other are the miſchiefs of being given up to pleaſure, of running inordinately into it, of breaking the quiet of our own family at home, and of others
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:028377_0086_0FD8DC37288DDDD0"/>
abroad; the engaging into much paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the doing many falſe and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things to compaſs what is deſired, the waſte of men's eſtates, time, and health. Now let any man judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the prejudices of this ſide are not greater than that ſingle one on the other ſide, of being denied ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?</p>
            <p>For polygamy, it is but reaſonable ſince women are equally concerned in the laws of marriage, that they ſhould be conſidered as well as men. But in a ſtate of polygamy they are under great miſery and jealouſy, and are indeed barbarouſly uſed. Man being alſo of a ſociable nature, friendſhip and converſe were among the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive intendments of marriage, in which as far as man may excel the wife in greatneſs of mind, and height of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the wife ſome way makes that up with, her affection and tender care: ſo that from both happily mixed, there ariſes a harmony, which is to virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minds one of the greateſt joys of life. But all this is gone in a ſtate of
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028377_0087_0FD8DC399C55E418"/>
polygamy, which occaſions perpetual jarrings and jealouſies. And the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety does but engage men to a freer range of pleaſure, which is not to be put in the balance with the far greater miſchiefs that muſt follow the other courſe.</p>
            <p>So that it is plain, our Saviour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the nature of man, what it could bear, and what was fit for it, when he ſo reſtrained us in theſe our liberties.</p>
            <p>And for divorce, a power to break that bond would too much encourage married perſons in the little quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings that may riſe between them, if it were in their power to depart one from another. For when they know that cannot be, and that they muſt live and die together, it does naturally incline them to lay down their reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to endeavour to live as well together as they can.</p>
            <p>So the law of the goſpel being a law of love, deſigned to engage <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to mutual love; it was fit that all ſuch proviſions ſhould be made, as might
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:028377_0088_0FD8DC3B1AA8CC70"/>
advance and maintain it: and all ſuch liberties be taken away, as are apt to enkindle and foment ſtrife. This might fall inſtances to be uneaſy and hard, enough, but laws conſider what falls out moſt commonly, and cannot provide for all particular caſes. The beſt laws are in ſome inſtances very great grievances. But the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges being balanced with the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, meaſures are to be taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>Upon this whole matter I ſaid, that pleaſure ſtood in oppoſition to other conſiderations of great weight, and ſo the deciſion was eaſy. And ſince our Saviour offers us ſo great rewards, it is but reaſonable he has a privilege of loading theſe promiſes with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as are not in themſelves grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our natural inclinations: for all that propoſe high rewards, have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a right to exact difficult perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.</p>
            <p>To this he ſaid, we are ſure the terms are difficult, but are not ſo ſure of the rewards. Upon this I told
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028377_0089_0FD8DC3EB6FD4928"/>
him, that we have the ſame aſſurance of the rewards, that we have of the other parts of <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> We have the promiſes of God made to us by Chriſt, confirmed by many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. We have the earneſts of theſe, in the quiet and peace which follows a good conſcience; and in the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him from the dead, who hath promiſed to raiſe us up. So that the reward is ſufficiently aſſured to us: and there is no reaſon it ſhould be given to us, before the conditions are perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on which the promiſes are made. It is but reaſonable we ſhould truſt God, and do our duty, <hi>in hopes of that eternal life, which God who cannot lye, hath promiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The difficulties are not ſo great, as thoſe which ſometimes the commoneſt concerns of life bring upon us. The learning ſome trades or ſciences, the governing our health or affairs, bring us often under as great ſtraights. So that it ought to be no juſt prejudice, that there are ſome things in Religion that are uneaſy, ſince this is rather the
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028377_0090_0FD8DC41D9683A08"/>
effect of our corrupt natures, which are farther depraved by vicious habits, and can hardly turn to any new courſe of life, without ſome pain, than of the dictates of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which are in themſelves juſt and reaſonable, and will be eaſy to us when renewed, and in a good meaſure reſtored to our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive integrity.</p>
            <p>As for the exceptions he had to the maintenance of the clergy, and the authority to which they pretended; if they ſtretched their deſigns too far, the Goſpel did plainly reprove them for it. So that it was very ſuitable to that church, which was ſo groſsly faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty this way, to take the Scriptures out of the hands of the people, ſince they do ſo manifeſtly diſclaim all ſuch practices. The prieſts of the true <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> have no ſecrets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, which the world muſt not know, but are only an order of Men dedicated to God, to attend on ſacred things, who ought to be holy in a more peculiar manner, ſince they are to handle the things of God. It
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028377_0091_0FD8DC46E762E2C0"/>
was neceſſary that ſuch perſons ſhould have a due eſteem paid them, and a fit maintainance appointed for them, that ſo they might be preſerved from the contempt that follows poverty, and the diſtractions which the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt it might other ways involve them in. And as in the order of the world, it was neceſſary for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of magiſtracy and government, and for preſerving its eſteem, that ſome ſtate be uſed (though it is a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs when great men have philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical minds, to deſpiſe the pageant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it.) So the plentiful ſupply of the clergy, if well uſed and applied by them, will certainly turn to the advantage of religion. And if ſome men either through ambition or covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs uſed indirect means, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile compliances to aſpire to ſuch dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and being poſſeſſed of them, applied their wealth either to luxury or vain pomp, or made great fortunes out of it for their families; theſe were perſonal failings in which the doctrine of Chriſt was not concerned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="unknown:028377_0092_0FD8DC47DA4BA8B0"/>He upon that told me plainly, there was nothing that gave him, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, a more ſecret encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their ill ways, than that thoſe who pretended to believe, lived ſo that they could not be thought to be in earneſt, when they ſaid it. For he was ſure religion was either a mere contrivance, or the moſt important thing that could be. So that if he once believed, he would ſet himſelf in great earneſt to live ſuitably to it. The aſpirings that he had obſerved at court, of ſome of the clergy, with the ſervile ways they took to attain to preferment, and the animoſities among thoſe of ſeveral parties, about trifles, made him often think they ſuſpected the things were not true which in their ſermons and diſcourſes they ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended.</p>
            <p>Of this he had gathered many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; I knew ſome of them were miſtakes and calumnies; yet I could not deny but ſomething of them might be too true. And I publiſh this the more freely, to put all that pretend
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028377_0093_0FD8DC4CA1EB6D08"/>
to religion, chiefly to thoſe that are dedicated to holy functions, in mind of the great obligation that lies on them to live ſuitably to their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Since otherwiſe a great deal of the irreligion and atheiſm that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, may too juſtly be charged on them: for wicked men are delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of meaſure when they diſcover ill things in them, and conclude from thence not only that they are hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, but that religion itſelf is a cheat.</p>
            <p>But I ſaid to him on this head, that though no good man could continue in the practice of any known ſin, yet ſuch might by the violence or ſurpriſe of a temptation, to which they are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as much as others, be of a ſudden overcome to do an ill thing, to their great grief all their life after. And then it was a very unjuſt inference, upon ſome few failings, to conclude that ſuch men do not believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But how bad ſo many are, it cannot be denied but that there are alſo many both of the clergy and laity, who give great and real demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028377_0094_0FD8DC4DD723DBD0"/>
of the power religion has over them; in their contempt of the world, the ſtrictneſs of their lives, their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to forgive injuries, to relieve the poor and to do good on all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And yet even theſe may have their failings, either in ſuch things wherein their conſtitutions are weak, or their temptations ſtrong and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. And in all ſuch caſes we are to judge of men, rather by the courſe of their lives, than by the errors that they through infirmity or ſurpriſe may have ſlipt into.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the chief heads we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed on; and as far as I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I have faithfully repeated the ſubſtance of our arguments. I have not concealed the ſtrongeſt things he ſaid to me, but though I have not enlarged on all the excurſions of his wit in ſetting them off, yet I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them their full ſtrength, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed them; and as far as I could recollect, have uſed his own words. So that I am afraid ſome may cenſure me for ſetting down theſe things ſo
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028377_0095_0FD8DC52B2F8E3A0"/>
largely, which impious men may make an ill uſe of, and gather together to encourage and deſend themſelves in their vices. But if they will compare them with the anſwers made to them, and the ſenſe that ſo great and refined a wit had of them afterwards, I hope they may through the bleſſing of God be not altogether ineffectual.</p>
            <p>The iſſue of all our diſcourſe was this; he told me, he ſaw vice and impiety were as contrary to human ſociety, as wild beaſts let looſe would be; and therefore he firmly reſolved to change the whole method of his life, to become ſtrictly juſt and true, to be chaſte and temperate, to forbear ſwearing and irreligious diſcourſe, to worſhip and pray to his maker. And that though he was not arrived at a full perſuaſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> he would never employ his wit more to run it down, or to corrupt others.</p>
            <p>Of which I have ſince a further aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance from a perſon of quality, who converſed much with him, the laſt year of his life; to whom he would
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:028377_0096_0FD8DC53DD7D4D18"/>
often ſay, that he was happy, if he did believe, and that he would never endeavour to draw him from it.</p>
            <p>To all this I anſwered, that a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life would be very uneaſy to him, unleſs vicious inclinations were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. It would otherwiſe be a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſtraint. Nor could it be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected without an inward principle to change him; and that was only to be had by applying himſelf to God for it in frequent and earneſt prayers. And I was ſure if his mind were once clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of theſe diſorders, and cured of thoſe diſtempers, which vice brought on it, ſo great an underſtanding would ſoon ſee through all thoſe flights of wit, that do feed atheiſm and irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which have a falſe glittering in them, that dazzles ſome weak-fighted minds, who have not capacity enough to penetrate further than the ſurfaces of things: and ſo they ſtick in theſe toils, which the ſtrength of his mind would ſoon break through, if it were once freed from thoſe things that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and darkened it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:028377_0097_0FD8DC58D3B81498"/>At this paſs he was when he went from <hi>London,</hi> about the beginning of April. He had not been long in the country when he thought he was ſo well, that being to go to his eſtate in <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> he rode thither poſt. This heat and violent motion did ſo inflame an ulcer, that was in his blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it raiſed a very great pain in thoſe parts. Yet he with much difficulty came back by coach to the Lodge at <hi>Woodſtock-Park.</hi> He was then wounded both in body and mind. He underſtood phyſic and his own conſtitution and diſtemper ſo well, that he concluded he could hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover: for the ulcer broke and vaſt quantities of purulent matter paſt with his urine. But now the hand of God touched him, and as he told me, it was not only a general dark melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly over his mind, ſuch as he had formerly felt, but a moſt penetrating cutting ſorrow. So that though in his body he ſuffered extreme pain for ſome weeks, yet the agonies of his
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:028377_0098_0FD8DC5BCAF86D08"/>
mind ſometimes ſwallowed up the ſenſe of what he felt in the body.</p>
            <p>He told me, and gave it me in charge, to tell it to one for whom he was much concerned, that though there were nothing to come after this life, yet all the pleaſures he had ever known in ſin, were not worth that torture he had felt in his mind. He conſidered he had not only neglected and diſhonoured, but had openly defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Maker, and had drawn many others into the like impieties. So that he looked on himſelf as one that was in great danger of being damned. He then ſet himſelf wholly to turn to God unſeignedly, and to do all that was poſſible in that little remainder of his life which was before him, to redeem thoſe great portions of it, that he had formerly ſo ill employed.</p>
            <p>The miniſter that attended conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on him, was that good and worthy man Mr. <hi>Parſons,</hi> his mother's chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, who hath ſince his death preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the directions he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him, his funeral ſermon;
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028377_0099_0FD8DCA126C08070"/>
in which there are ſo many remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſages, that I ſhall refer my reader to them, and will repeat none of them here, that I may not thereby leſſen his deſire to edefy himſelf by that excellent diſcourſe, which has given ſo great and ſo general a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to all good and judicious read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. I ſhall ſpeak curſorily of every thing, but that which I had immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from himſelf. He was viſited every week of his ſickneſs by his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan, that truly primitive prelate, the lord biſhop of Oxford, Dr. <hi>Fell;</hi> who though he lived ſix miles from him, yet looked on this as ſo import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant a piece of his paſtoral care, that he went often to him; and treated him with that decent plainneſs and freedom which is ſo natural to him; and took care alſo that he might not on terms more eaſy than ſafe, be at peace with himſelf. Dr. <hi>Marſhall</hi> the learned and worthy rector of Lincoln College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> being the miniſter of the pariſh, was alſo frequently with him; and by theſe helps he was ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028377_0100_0FD8DC626CCB0E68"/>
and ſupported, that he might not on the one hand ſatisfy himſelf with too ſuperficial a repentance, nor on the other hand be out of meaſure oppreſſed with a ſorrow without hope.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as I heard he was ill, but yet in ſuch a condition that I might write to him, I wrote a letter to the beſt purpoſe I could. He ordered one that was then with him, to aſſure me it was very welcome to him: but not ſatisfied with that, he ſent me an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, which, as the counteſs of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> his mother told me, he dictated every word, and then ſigned it.</p>
            <p>I was once unwilling to have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it, becauſe of a compliment in it to myſelf, far above my merit, and not very well ſuiting with his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>But the ſenſe he expreſſes in it of the change then wrought on him, hath upon ſecond thoughts prevail'd with me to publiſh it, leaving out what concerns myſelf.</p>

               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:028377_0103_0FD8DC6A58FE7FA0"/>At my coming to his houſe, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident fell out not worth mentioning, but that ſome have made a ſtory of it. His ſervant, being a Frenchman, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up my name wrong, ſo that he miſtook it for another, who had ſent to him, that he would undertake his cure, and he being reſolved not to meddle with him, did not care to ſee him. This miſtake laſted ſome hours, with which I was the better contented, becauſe he was not then in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that my being about him could have been of any uſe to him; for that night was like to have been his laſt. He had a convulſion fit, and raved; but opiates being given him, after ſome hours reſt, his raving left him ſo entirely, that it never again returned to him.</p>
            <p>I cannot eaſily expreſs the tranſport he was in, when he awoke and ſaw me by him. He broke out in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt expreſſions concerning my kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in coming ſo far to ſee ſuch a <hi>one,</hi> uſing terms of great abhorrence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf, which I forbear to
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028377_0104_0FD8DC6BDEECCF20"/>
relate. He told me, as his ſtrength ſerved him at ſeveral ſnatches, for he was then ſo low, that he could not hold up diſcourſe long at once, what ſenſe he had of his paſt life; what ſad apprehenſion for having ſo offended his maker, and diſhonoured his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; what horrors he had gone through, and how much his mind was turned to call on God, and on his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Saviour So that he hoped he ſhould obtain mercy, for he believed he had ſincerely repented; and had now a calm in his mind after that ſtorm that he had been in for ſome weeks.</p>
            <p>He had ſtrong apprehenſions and perſuaſions of his admittance to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; of which he ſpake once not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome extraordinary emotion. It was indeed the only time that he ſpake with any great warmth to me; for his ſpirits were then low, and ſo far ſpent, that though thoſe about him told me, he had expreſſed formerly great ſervour in his devotions; yet na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was ſo much ſunk, that theſe were in a great meaſure fallen off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="unknown:028377_0105_0FD8DC72A380A750"/>But he made me pray often with him; and ſpoke of his converſion to God as a thing now grown up in him to a ſettled and calm ſerenity. He was very anxious to know my opinion of a death-bed repentance. I told him, that before I gave any reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that, it would be convenient that I ſhould be acquainted more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with the circumſtances and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of his repentance.</p>
            <p>Upon this he ſatisfied me in many particulars. He ſaid, he was now perſuaded both of the truth of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, and of the power of inward grace, of which he gave me this ſtrange account. He ſaid, Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> in order to his conviction, read to him the 53d chapter of the prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and compared that with the hiſtory of our Saviour's paſſion, that he might there ſee a prophecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, written many ages before it was done; which the <hi>Jews</hi> that blaſphemed Jeſus Chriſt ſtill kept in their hands, as a book divinely inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. He ſaid to me, that as he heard
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:028377_0106_0FD8DC72A5A953B0"/>
it read, he felt an inward force upon him, which did ſo enlighten his mind, and convince him, that he could reſiſt it no longer: for the words had an authority which did ſhoot like rays or beams in his mind; ſo that he was not only convinced by the reaſonings he had about it, which ſatisfied his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but by a power which did ſo effectually conſtrain him, that he did ever after as firmly believe in his Saviour, as if he had ſeen him in the clouds.</p>
            <p>He had made it be read ſo often to him, that he had got it by heart: and went through a great part of it in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with me, with a ſort of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly pleaſure, giving me his reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on it. Some few I remember, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> v. 1. Here, he ſaid, was foretold the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition the goſpel has to meet with from ſuch wretches as he was. <hi>He hath no form or comelineſs, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him:</hi> v. ii. On this he ſaid, the meanneſs of his appearance and
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028377_0107_0FD8DC774050B040"/>
perſon has made vain and fooliſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſparage him, becauſe he came not in ſuch a fool's coat as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in.</p>
            <p>What he ſaid on the other parts I do not well remember: and indeed I was ſo affected with what he ſaid then to me, that the general tranſport I was under during the whole diſcourſe, made me leſs capable to remember theſe particulars, as I wiſh I had done.</p>
            <p>He told me, that he had thereupon received the ſacrament with great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and that was increaſed by the pleaſure he had in his lady's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it with him; who had been for ſome years miſled into the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and he himſelf had been not a little inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in procuring it, as he freely acknowledged. So that it was one of the joyfulleſt things that befel him in his ſickneſs, that he had ſeen that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief removed, in which he had ſo great a hand,</p>
            <p>And during his whole ſickneſs, he expreſſed ſo much tenderneſs and true
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028377_0108_0FD8DC789BC09958"/>
kindneſs to his lady, that as it eaſily defaced the remembrance of every thing wherein he had been in fault formerly, ſo it drew from her the moſt paſſionate care and concern for him that was poſſible; which indeed deſerves a higher character than is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to give of a perſon yet alive. But I ſhall confine myſelf to the dead.</p>
            <p>He told me, he had overcome all his reſentments to all the world; ſo that he bore ill-will to no perſon, nor hated any upon perſonal accounts. He had given a true ſtate of his debts, and had ordered to pay them all, as far as his eſtate that was not ſettled, could go: and was confident that if all that was owing to him were paid to his executors, his creditors would be all ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>He ſaid, he found his mind now poſſeſſed with another ſenſe of things, than ever he had formerly. He did not repine under all his pain, and in one of the ſharpeſt fits he was under while I was with him, he ſaid, he did willingly ſubmit; and looking up to
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028377_0109_0FD8DC7DA88D39C0"/>
heaven, ſaid, God's holy will be done, I bleſs him for all he does for me. He knew he could never be ſo well, that life could be comfortable to him. He was conſident he ſhould be happy if he died, but he feared if he lived he might relapſe. And then ſaid he to me, in what a condition ſhall I be, if I relapſe after all this? But, he ſaid, he truſted in the grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and was reſolved to avoid all thoſe temptations, that courſe of life and company, that was likely to inſnare him: and he deſired to live on no other account, but that he might by the change of his manners ſome way take off the high ſcandal his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer behaviour had given. All theſe things at ſeveral times I had from him, beſides ſome meſſages which very well became a dying penitent to ſome of his former friends, and a charge to publiſh any thing concerning him, that might be a means to reclaim others. Praying God, that as his life had done much hurt, ſo his death might do ſome good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:028377_0110_0FD8DC8026927748"/>Having underſtood all theſe things from him, and being preſſed to give him my opinion plainly about his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate; I told him, that though the promiſes of the goſpel did all depend upon a real change of heart and life, as the indiſpenſible condition upon which they were made; and that it was ſcarce poſſible to know certainly whether our hearts are changed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it appeared in our lives; and the repentance of moſt dying men, being like the how lings of condemned pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners for pardon, which flowed from no ſenſe of their crimes, but from the horror of approaching death; there was little reaſon to encourage any to hope much from ſuch ſorrowing; yet certainly if the mind of a ſinner, even on a death-bed, be truly renewed and turned to God, ſo great is his mercy, that he will receive him, even in that extremity.</p>
            <p>He was ſure his mind was entirely turned, and though horror had given him his firſt awaking, yet that was
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028377_0111_0FD8DC8416E17BA0"/>
now grown up into a ſettled faith and converſion.</p>
            <p>There is but one prejudice lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all this, to defeat the good ends of divine providence by it upon others, as well as on himſelf; and that is, it was a part of his diſeaſe, and that the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſpirits made ſuch an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in him, that he was not what he had formerly been: and this ſome have carried ſo far as to ſay, that he died mad. Theſe reports are raiſed by thoſe who are unwilling that the laſt thoughts or words of a perſon, every way ſo extraordinary, ſhould have any effect either on themſelves or others. And it is to be feared, that ſome may have ſo far feared their conſciences, and exceeded the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meaſures of ſin and infidelity, that neither this teſtimony, nor one coming from the dead, would ſignify much towards their conviction.</p>
            <p>That this lord was either mad or ſtupid, is a thing ſo notoriouſly untrue, that it is the greateſt impudence for any that were about him, to report
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028377_0112_0FD8DC8557768010"/>
it; and a very unreaſonable credulity in others to believe it. All the while I was with him, after he had ſlept out the diſorders of the fit, he was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without ravings, but had a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his thoughts, in his memory, in his reflections on things and perſons, far beyond what I ever ſaw in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo low in his ſtrength. He was not able to hold out long in diſcourſe, for his ſpirits failed; but once for half an hour, and often for a quarter of an hour, after he awakened, he had a vivacity in his diſcourſe that was extraordinary, and in all things like himſelf.</p>
            <p>He called often for his children, his ſon the now earl of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and his three daughters, and ſpake to them with a ſenſe and feeling that cannot be expreſſed in writing.</p>
            <p>He called me once to look on them all, and ſaid, ſee how good God has been to me, in giving me ſo many bleſſings, and I have carried myſelf to him like an ungracious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful dog.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="unknown:028377_0113_0FD8DC8C85825EB0"/>He once talked a great deal to me of public affairs, and of many perſons and things, with the ſame clearneſs of thought and expreſſion, that he had ever done before. So that by no ſign but his weakneſs of body, and giving over diſcourſe ſo ſoon, could I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a difference between what his parts formerly were, and what they were then.</p>
            <p>And that wherein the preſence of his mind appeared moſt, was in the total change of an ill habit grown ſo much upon him, that he could hardly govern himſelf, when he was any ways heated, three minutes without falling into it; I mean ſwearing.</p>
            <p>He had acknowledged to me the former winter, that he abhorred it as a baſe and indecent thing, and had ſet himſelf much to break it off; but he confeſſed that he was ſo over pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by that ill cuſtom, that he could not ſpeak with any warmth, without repeated oaths, which, upon any ſort of provocation, came almoſt naturally from him. But in his laſt remorſes
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028377_0114_0FD8DC8F71FD1E80"/>
this did ſo ſenſibly affect him, that by a reſolute and conſtant watchfulneſs, the habit of it was perfectly maſtered; ſo that upon the returns of pain which were very ſevere and frequent upon him, the laſt day I was with him; or upon ſuch diſpleaſures as people ſick or in pain are apt to take of a ſudden at thoſe about them: on all theſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he never ſwore an oath all the while I was there.</p>
            <p>Once he was offended with the delay of one that he thought made not haſte enough, with ſome what he called for, and ſaid in a little heat, <hi>that d—d fellow.</hi> Soon after I told him, I was glad to find his ſtyle ſo reformed, and that he had ſo entirely overcome that ill habit of ſwearing; only that word of calling any d—d, which had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned upon him, was not decent.</p>
            <p>His anſwer was, Oh that language of fiends which was ſo familiar to me, hangs yet about me: ſure none has deſerved more to be damned than I have done. And after he had hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aſked God pardon for it, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028377_0115_0FD8BE5CD4B3C248"/>
me to call the perſon to him, that he might aſk him forgiveneſs; but I told him that was needleſs, for he had ſaid it of one that did not hear it, and ſo could not be offended by it.</p>
            <p>In this diſpoſition of mind did he continue all the while I was with him, four day's together; he was then brought ſo low that all hope of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very was gone. Much purulent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came from him with his urine, which he paſſed always with ſome pain; but one day with unexpreſſible torment. Yet bore it decently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking out into repinings, or impatient complaints. He imagined he had a ſtone in his paſſage, but it being ſearched, none was found.</p>
            <p>The whole ſubſtance of his body was drained by the ulcer, and nothing was left but ſkin and bone; and by lying much on his back, the parts there began to mortify. But he had been formerly ſo low, that he ſeemed as much paſt all hopes of life as now; which made him one morning after a full and ſweet night's reſt procured by
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028377_0116_0FD8DC9098D73508"/>
laudanum, given him without his knowledge, to fancy it was an effort of nature, and to begin to entertain ſome hopes of recovery: for he ſaid, he felt himſelf perfectly well, and that he had nothing ailing him, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme weakneſs, which might go off in time; and then he entertained me with the ſcheme he had laid down for the reſt of his life, how retired, how ſtrict, and how ſtudious he intended to be. But this was ſoon over, for he quickly felt that it was only the effect of a good ſleep, and that he was ſtill in a very deſperate ſtate.</p>
            <p>I thought to have left him on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, but not without ſome paſſion, he deſired me to ſtay that day. There appeared no ſymptom of preſent death, and a worthy phyſician then with him told me, that though he was ſo low that an accident might carry him away on a ſudden; yet without that, he thought he might live yet ſome weeks.</p>
            <p>So on Saturday at four o'clock in the morning I left him, being the 24th
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028377_0117_0FD8DC94D13EEAC0"/>
of July. But I durſt not take leave of him; for he had expreſſed ſo great an unwillingneſs to part with me the day before, that if I had not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yielded to one day's ſtay, it was like to have given him ſome trouble, therefore I thought it better to leave him without any formality. Some hours after he aſked for me, and when it was told him, I was gone, he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be troubled, and ſaid, has my friend left me, then I ſhall die ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. After that he ſpake but once or twice till he died: he lay much ſilent: once they heard him pray very devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And on Monday about two of the clock in the morning, he died without any convulſion, or ſo much as a groan.</p>

            <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>THUS he lived, and thus he died, in the three and thirtieth year of his age. Nature had fitted him for great things, and his knowledge and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation qualified him to have been one of the moſt extraordinary men, not only of his nation, but of the age he lived in: and I do verily believe, that if God had thought fit to have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued him longer in the world, he had been the wonder and delight of all that knew him.</p>
            <p>But the infinitely wiſe God knew better what was fit for him, and what the age deſerved. For men who have ſo caſt off all ſenſe of God and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deſerve not ſo ſignal a bleſſing, as
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028377_0119_0FD8DC9B20E3B938"/>
the example and conviction which the reſt of his life might have given them.</p>
            <p>And I am apt to think that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs took pity on him, and ſeeing the ſincerity of his repentance, would try and venture him no more in circumſtances of temptation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps too hard for human frailty.</p>
            <p>Now he is at reſt, and I am very confident enjoys the fruits of his late, but ſincere repentance. But ſuch as live, and ſtill go on in their ſins and impieties, and will not be awakened neither by this, nor the other alarms that are about their ears, are, it ſeems given up by God to a judicial hardneſs and impenitency,</p>
            <p>Here is a public inſtance of one who lived of their ſide, but could not die of it: and though none of all our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines underſtood better than he, the ſecret myſteries of ſin, had more ſtudied every thing that could ſupport a man in it, and had more reſiſted all external means of conviction than he had done; yet when the hand of God inwardly touched him, he could no
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:028377_0120_0FD8DC9D58B30B38"/>
longer kick againſt thoſe pricks, but humbled himſelf under that mighty hand; and as he uſed often to ſay in his prayers, he who had ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him, found then no other ſhelter, but his mercies and compaſſions.</p>
            <p>I have written this account with all the tenderneſs and caution I could uſe, and in whatſoever I may have failed, I have been ſtrict in the truth of what I have related, remembering that of Job, Will ye lie for God?</p>
            <p>Religion has ſtrength and evidence enough in itſelf, and needs no ſupport from lies and made ſtories. I do not pretend to have given the formal words that he ſaid, though I have done that where I could remember them. But I have written this with the ſame ſincerity, that I would have done, had I known I had been to die immediately after I had finiſhed it.</p>
            <p>I did not take notes of our diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes laſt winter after we parted; ſo I may perhaps in the ſetting out of my anſwers to him, have enlarged on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things both more fully and more
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028377_0121_0FD8DC5E749B58A0"/>
regularly, than I could ſay them in ſuch free diſcourſes as we had. I am not ſo ſure of all I ſet down as ſaid by me, as I am of all ſaid by him to me. But yet the ſubſtance of the greateſt part, even of that, is the ſame.</p>
            <p>It remains that I humbly and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſeech all that ſhall take this book in their hands, that they will conſider it entirely, and not wreſt ſome parts to an ill intention. God, the ſearcher of hearts, knows with what fidelity I have writ it. But if any will drink up only the poiſon that may be in it, without taking alſo the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote here given to thoſe ill principles; or conſidering the ſenſe that this great perſon had of them, when he reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeriouſly on them; and will rather confirm themſelves in their ill ways, by the ſcruples and objections which I ſet down, than be edified by the other parts of it; as I will look on it as a great infelicity, that I ſhould have ſaid any thing that may ſtrengthen them in their impieties, ſo the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my intentions will, I doubt not,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:028377_0122_0FD8DCA29A63E7B8"/>
excuſe me at his hands, to whom I offer up this ſmall ſervice.</p>
            <p>I have now performed, in the beſt manner I could, what was left on me by this noble lord, and have done with the part of an hiſtorian. I ſhall in the next place ſay ſomewhat as a divine. So extraordinary a text does almoſt force a ſermon, though it is plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough itſelf, and ſpeaks with ſo loud a voice, that thoſe who are not awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened by it, will perhaps conſider no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I can ſay.</p>
            <p>If our libertines will become ſo far ſober as to examine their former courſe of life, with that diſengagement and impartiality, which they muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a wiſe man ought to uſe in things of greateſt conſequence, and balance the account of what they have got by their debaucheries, with the miſchiefs they have brought on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others by them, they will ſoon ſee what a mad bargain they have made.</p>
            <p>Some diverſion, mirth, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is all they can promiſe themſelves;
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028377_0123_0FD8DCA41C87CD70"/>
but to obtain this, how many evils are they to ſuffer! How many have waſted their ſtrength, brought many diſeaſes on their bodies, and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated their age in the purſuit of thoſe things? And as they bring old age early on themſelves, ſo it becomes a miſerable ſtate of life to the greateſt part of them; gouts, ſtranguries, and other infirmities, being ſevere reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for their paſt follies; not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the more lothſome diſeaſes, with their no leſs trouble ſome cures, which they muſt often go through, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver themſelves up to forbidden plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>Many are disfigur'd beſide, with the marks of their intemperance and lewdneſs, and which is yet ſadder, an infection is derived oftentimes on their innocent, but unhappy iſſue, who being deſcended from ſo vitiated an original, ſuffer for their exceſſes.</p>
            <p>Their fortunes are profuſely waſted both by their neglect of their affairs, they being ſo far buried in vice, that they cannot employ either their time or
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028377_0124_0FD8DCA80E4624F0"/>
ſpirits, ſo much exhauſted by intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, to conſider them; and by that prodigal expence which their luſts put them upon.</p>
            <p>They ſuffer no leſs in their credit, the chief mean to recover an entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled eſtate: for that irregular expence forceth them to ſo many mean ſhifts, makes them ſo often falſe to all their promiſes and reſolutions, that they muſt needs feel how much they have loſt, that which a gentleman, and men of ingenuous tempers do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prefer even to life itſelf, their honour and reputation.</p>
            <p>Nor do they ſuffer leſs in the nobler powers of their minds, which by a long courſe of ſuch diſſolute practices, come to ſink and degenerate ſo far, that not a few, whoſe firſt bloſſoms gave the moſt promiſſing hopes, have ſo withered, as to become incapable of great and generous undertakings, and to be diſabled to every thing, but to wallow like ſwine in the filth of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, their ſpirits being diſſipated, and their minds ſo nummed, as to be
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:028377_0125_0FD8DCA96B97BAA0"/>
wholly unfit for buſineſs, and even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed to think.</p>
            <p>That this dear price ſhould be paid for a little wild mirth, or groſs and corporal pleaſure, is a thing of ſuch unparalleled folly, and if there were not too many ſuch inſtances before us, it might ſeem incredible.</p>
            <p>To all this we muſt add the horrors that their ill actions raiſe in them, and the hard ſhifts they are put to to ſtave off theſe, either by being perpetually drunk or mad, or by an habitual dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe of thinking and reflecting on their actions, and (if theſe arts will not perfectly quiet them) by taking ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary in ſuch atheiſtical principles as may at leaſt mitigate the ſourneſs of their thoughts, though they cannot abſolutely ſettle their minds.</p>
            <p>If the ſtate of mankind and human ſocieties are conſidered, what miſchiefs can be equal to thoſe which follow theſe courſes.</p>
            <p>Such perſons are a plague wherever they come, they can neither be truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor beloved, having caſt off both
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:028377_0126_0FD8DCAF353429B8"/>
truth and goodneſs, which procure confidence and attract love; they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſome by their ill practices, and do irreparable injuries to the reſt; they run great hazards, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to much trouble, and all this to do what is in their power to make damnation as ſure to themſelves as poſſibly they can. What influence this has on the whole nation is but too viſible; how the bonds of nature, Wedlock, and all other relations are quite broken. Virtue is thought an antique piece of formality, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion the effect of cowardice or knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Theſe are the men that would reform the world, by bringing it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a new ſyſtem of intellectual and moral principles, but bate them a few bold and lewd jeſts, what have they ever done, or deſigned to do, to make them be remembered, except it be with deteſtation? They are the ſcorn of the preſent age, and their names muſt not in the next.</p>
            <p>Here they have before them an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of one who was deeply corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:028377_0127_0FD8DCB017CF0820"/>
with the contagion which he firſt derived from others, but unhappily heightened it much himſelf. He was a maſter indeed, and not a bare tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fler with wit, as ſome of theſe are who repeat, and that but ſcurvily, what they may have heard from him or ſome others, and with impudence and laughter will face the world down, as if they were to teach it wiſdom; who, God knows, cannot follow one thought a ſtep further than as they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it; and take from them their bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed wit and their mimical humour, and they will preſently appear what they indeed are, the leaſt and loweſt of men.</p>
            <p>If they will, or if they can think a little, I wiſh they would conſider that by their own principles, they cannot be ſure that religion is only a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; all they pretend to is only to weaken ſome arguments that are brought for it; but they have not brow enough to ſay, they can prove that their own principles are true.</p>
            <p>So that at moſt they bring their
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:028377_0128_0FD8DCB1A0067C80"/>
cauſe no higher, than that it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble religion may not be true. But ſtill it is poſſible it may be true, and they have no ſhame left that will deny that it is alſo probable it may be true; and if ſo, then what mad men are they who run ſo great a hazard for nothing?</p>
            <p>By their own confeſſion it may be there is a God, a judgment, and a life to come; and if ſo, then he that believes theſe things, and lives accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, as he enjoys a long courſe of health and quiet of mind, an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent reliſh of many true pleaſures, and the ſerenities which virtue raiſes in him, with the good will and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which it procures him from others; ſo when he dies, if theſe things prove miſtakes, he does not outlive his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, nor ſhall it afterwards raiſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or diſquiet in him if he then ceaſes to be. But if things be true, he ſhall be infinitely happy in that ſtate, where his preſent ſmall ſervices ſhall be ſo exceſſively rewarded.</p>
            <p>The libertines on the other ſide, as they know they muſt die, ſo the
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:028377_0129_0FD8DCB61AFE1090"/>
thoughts of death muſt be always me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy to them, they can have no pleaſant view of that which yet they know cannot be very far from them. The leaſt painful idea they can have of it is, that it is an extinction and ceaſing to be, but they are not ſure even of that. Some ſecret whiſpers within make them, whether they will or not, tremble at the apprehenſions of another ſtate; neither their tinſel wit, nor ſuperficial learning, nor their impotent aſſaults upon the weak ſide as they think of religion, nor the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt notions of impiety, will hold them up then. Of all which I now preſent ſo lively an inſtance, as perhaps hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry can ſcarce parellel.</p>
            <p>Here were parts ſo exalted by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and improved by ſtudy, and yet ſo corrupted and debaſed by irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and vice, that he who was made to be one of the glories of his age was become a proverb, and if his repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance had not interpoſed, would have been one of the greateſt reproaches of it. He knew well the ſmall ſtrength
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028377_0130_0FD8DCB719E420C8"/>
of that weak cauſe, and at firſt deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but afterwards abhorred it. He felt the miſchiefs, and ſaw the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it; and therefore though he lived to the ſcandal of many, he died as much to the edefication of all thoſe who ſaw him; and becauſe they were but a ſmall number, he deſired that he might even when dead, yet ſpeak. He was willing nothing ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed that might caſt reproach on himſelf, and on ſin, and offer up glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God and religion. So that though he lived a heinous ſinner, yet he died a moſt exemplary penitent.</p>
            <p>It would be a vain and ridiculous inference, for any from hence to draw arguments about the abſtruſe ſecrets of predeſtination; and to conclude that if they are of the number of the elect, they may live as they will, and that divine grace will at ſome time or other violently conſtrain them, and irreſiſtably work upon them. But as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was called to that eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for which he was appointed, in ſo ſtupendous a manner, as is no warrant
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:028377_0131_0FD8DCB88E6FA5F0"/>
for others to expect a vocation; ſo if upon ſome ſignal occaſions ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions fall out, which, how far they are ſhort of miracles, I ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, it is not only a vain but a pernicious imagination, for any to go on in their ill ways, upon a fond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and expectation that the like will befal them. For whatſoever God's extraordinary dealings with ſome may be, we are ſure his common way of working is by offering theſe things to our rational faculties, which, by the aſſiſtance of his grace, if we improve them all we can, ſhall be certainly effectual for our reformation; and if we neglect or abuſe theſe, we put ourſelves beyond the common methods of God's mercy, and have no reaſon to expect that wonders ſhould be wrought for our conviction; which though they ſometimes happen, that they may give an effectual alarm for the awaking of others, yet it would deſtroy the whole deſign of religion, if men ſhould depend upon, or look for ſuch an extraordinary and forcible operations of God's grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="unknown:028377_0132_0FD8DCBEB8593F48"/>And I hope that thoſe who have had ſome ſharp reflections on their paſt life, ſo as to be reſolved to forſake their ill courſes, will not take the leaſt encouragement to themſelves in that deſperate and unreaſonable reſolution of puttnig off their repentance till they can ſin no longer, from the hopes I have expreſs'd of this Lord's obtaining mercy at the laſt; and from thence preſume that they alſo ſhall be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when they turn to God on their death-beds. For what mercy ſoever God may ſhew to ſuch as really were never inwardly touched before that time; yet there is no reaſon to think that thoſe who have dealt ſo diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly with God and their own ſouls, as deſignedly to put off their turning to him, upon ſuch conſiderations, ſhould be then excepted with him.</p>
            <p>They may die ſuddenly, or by a diſeaſe that may ſo diſorder their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, that they ſhall not be in any capacity of reflecting on their paſt lives. The inward converſion of our minds is not ſo in our power, that
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:028377_0133_0FD8DCC0132E08C0"/>
it can be effected without divine grace aſſiſting. And there is no reaſon for thoſe who have neglected theſe aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances all their lives, to expect them in ſo extraordinary a manner at their death. Nor can one, eſpecially in a ſickneſs, that is quick and critical, be able to do thoſe things that are often indiſpenſibly neceſſary to make his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance complete: and even in a longer diſeaſe, in which there are lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger opportunities for theſe things. Yet there is great reaſon to doubt of a repentance begun and kept up mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by terror, and not from any inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous principle. In which, though I will not take on me to limit the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, which are boundleſs, yet this muſt be confeſſed, that to delay repentance, with ſuch a deſign, is to put the greateſt concernment that we have, upon the moſt dangerous and deſperate iſſue that is poſſible.</p>
            <p>But they that will ſtill go on in their ſins, and be ſo partial to them, as to ceaſe all endeavours to ſtrengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their evil courſe, even by
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:028377_0134_0FD8DCC3E2AC01D0"/>
theſe very things which the providence of God ſets before them, for the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of theſe ſtrong holds of ſin: What is to be ſaid to ſuch? It is to be feared, that if they obſtinately perſiſt, they will by degrees come within that curſe, "He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill: and he that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill. But if our Goſpel is hid, it is hid to them that are loſt, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, leſt the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them."</p>
