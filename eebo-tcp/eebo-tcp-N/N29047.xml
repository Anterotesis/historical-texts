            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>ARTICLE</hi> I. There ſhall be a firm, inviolable and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal peace, and true and ſincere friendſhip, between the French Republic and the United States of America, as well between their countries, territories, cities and places, as between their citizens and inhabitants, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of perſons or places.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Miniſters Plenipotentiary of the two parties, not being empowered at preſent to agree relative to the treaty of alliance of the 6th of February, 1778, to the treaty of friendſhip and commerce of the ſame date, and to the convention of the 14th of November, nor to the indemnities mutually due and claimed, the parties ſhall further negotiate upon theſe points at a convenient time; and until they ſhall be agreed upon theſe points, the ſaid treaties and convention ſhall have no effect, and the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the two nations ſhall be regulated as follows:</p>
            <p n="3">III. The ſhips belonging to the State taken on either ſide, or which may be taken before the exchange of ratifications, ſhall be given up.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The properties captured and not yet definitively condemned, or which may be captured before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of ratifications, except contraband merchandiſe deſtined for an enemy's port, ſhall be mutually reſtored upon the following proofs of property, viz.</p>
            <p>On the one part, and on the other, the proofs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty relative to merchant veſſels, armed or unarmed, ſhall be a paſſport in the following form:</p>
            <q>
               <p>To all thoſe to whom theſe preſents ſhall come, be it known, that power and permiſſion has been given to —, Maſter or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the veſſel called the —, of the city of —, of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of — tons, or thereabouts, now lying in the port or harbour of —, and deſtined for —, laden with —, that after his ſhip has been viſited, and before his departure, he ſhall make oath, before officers authoriſed for that purpoſe, that the ſaid ſhip belongs to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038726_0004_1012C1B30CDFB720"/>
one or more ſubjects of —, the execution of which form ſhall be annexed to theſe preſents, in order that he may obſerve and cauſe to be obſerved by his crew the maritime ordinances and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, and give in a liſt ſigned and atteſted, containing the names and ſurnames, places of birth and abode, of the perſons compoſing the crew of his ſhip, and of all on board her, whom he ſhall not receive on board without the knowledge and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the officers authoriſed for that purpoſe; and in every port and harbour where he ſhall enter with his ſhip, he ſhall ſhew the preſent permiſſion to the proper officers, and make to them a faithful report of all that has paſſed during his voyage, and carry the colours, arms and flags of the French Republic or the United States, during his ſaid voyage: In teſtimony of which we have ſigned theſe preſents, cauſed them to be counterſigned by —, and thereunto put the ſeal of our arms.</p>
               <p>"Given at —, in the year of our Lord —.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And this paſſport ſhall be ſufficient without any other document, notwithſtanding any regulation to the contrary.</p>
            <p>It ſhall not be neceſſary to renew or revoke this paſſport, whatever number of voyages the ſaid ſhip ſhall have made, unleſs they ſhall not have returned home within the ſpace of a year.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the cargo, the proofs ſhall be certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, containing an account what place the ſhip has left, and where it is going to, ſo that prohibited and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band merchandiſe may be diſtinguiſhed by certificates, which certificates ſhall have been made by the officers of the place from whence the ſhip ſhall have ſet out, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the accuſtomed forms of the country. And if theſe paſſports or certificates, or both, ſhall have been deſtroyed by accident, or taken away by force, the want of them ſhall be ſupplied by every other proof of property admiſſible according to the general uſage of nations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:038726_0005_1012C1B498DC8C38"/>For other ſhips beſides merchant ſhips, the proof ſhall be the commiſſions they bear. This article ſhall take effect from the date of the ſignature of the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; and if by the date of the ſaid ſignature proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall have been condemned contrary to the ſpirit of the ſaid Convention, and previous to the knowledge of this ſtipulation, the property ſo condemned ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored or paid for.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The debts contracted by either of the two nations towards the individuals of each ſhall be acquitted, or the payment ſhall be in courſe, as if there had been no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding between the two ſtates; but this clauſe ſhall not extend to indemnities, claimed for captures or condemnations.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The trade between the two parties ſhall be free; the ſhips of the two nations, and their privateers, as well as their prizes, ſhall be treated in their reſpective ports as thoſe of the moſt favoured nation; and in general the two parties ſhall enjoy in each other's ports, with reſpect to commerce and navigation, the ſame privileges as the moſt favoured nations.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The citizens and inhabitants of the United States may diſpoſe by will, donation, or otherwiſe, of their goods, moveable and immoveable property, poſſeſſed in the European territory of the French Republic; and the citizens of the French Republic ſhall have the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with regard to the goods, moveable and immoveable property, poſſeſſed in the territory of the United States, in favour of ſuch perſons as they ſhall think proper.— The citizens and inhabitants of one of the two States, who ſhall be heirs of the goods, moveable or immoveable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty ſituate in the other, may ſucceed <hi>ab inteſtat,</hi> without there being any neceſſity for letters of neutrality, and without the effect of this ſtipulation being conteſted or
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038726_0006_1012C1B624001850"/>
impeached under any pretence whatever; and the ſaid heirs, whether by private right, or <hi>ab inteſtat,</hi> ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from all right whatever of any one in either of the two nations. It is agreed, that this article ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate in any manner from the laws which are now in force, in either of the two nations, or which may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated hereafter againſt emigration; and alſo, that in caſe the laws of either of the two ſtates ſhall limit to foreigners the exerciſe of the right of immoveable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, ſuch immoveable property may be ſold, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſpoſed of, in favour of the inhabitants or citizens of the country where they ſhall be ſituate; and it ſhall be open to the other nation to eſtabliſh ſimilar laws.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. To favour the commerce of both nations, it is agreed, that if war (which God forbid) ſhould break out between the two nations, the merchants and other citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, or reſpective inhabitants, ſhall be allowed on both ſides ſix months after the declaration of war; during which period they ſhall have time to retire, with their effects and moveables, which they may carry away, or ſell, as they ſhall think proper, without the leaſt impediment; their effects, and ſtill leſs their perſons, ſhall not, during the period of ſix months, be ſeized. On the contrary, they ſhall have paſſports, which ſhall be valid for the time neceſſary to enable them to return home, and thoſe paſſports ſhall be given for themſelves, as well as for their ſhips and effects which they ſhall deſire to take or ſend away. Theſe paſſports ſhall ſerve as protections againſt all inſults and all captures on the part of privateers, as well with regard to themſelves as their effects; and if within the term above mentioned there ſhall have been committed by one of the parties, its citizens, or inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, any wrong towards their perſons or their property, they ſhall have complete ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:038726_0007_1012C1B929AD2C98"/>IX. The debts due by individuals of one of the two nations to the individuals of the other ſhall not, in caſe of war or national diſpute, be ſequeſtered or confiſcated, no more than the claims or funds which ſhall be found in the public funds, or in the public or private banks.</p>
            <p n="10">X. The two contracting parties may nominate for the protection of trade Commercial Agents, who ſhall reſide in France and the United States. Each of the parties may accept ſuch place as it ſhall judge proper, where the reſidence ſhall be fixed. Before any agent can exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his functions, he muſt be accepted according to the received forms of the party to which he is ſent, and when he ſhall be received and provided with his exequatur, he ſhall enjoy the rights and prerogatives which are enjoyed by ſimilar agents of the moſt favoured nations.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. The citizens of the French Republic ſhall not pay, in any ports, harbours, roads, countries, iſlands, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and places of the United States, other or greater du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or impoſts, of what nature ſoever they may be, and whatever names they may have, than thoſe which the moſt ſavoured nations are, or ſhall be bound to pay; and they ſhall enjoy all rights, liberties, privileges, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, and exemptions, relating to trade, navigation, and commerce, whether in paſſing from one part of the ſaid ſtates to another, or whether in going there or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from ſome part to any part of the world, that the ſaid nations enjoy, or ſhall enjoy; and reciprocally the citizens of the United States ſhall enjoy in the territory of the French Republic, in Europe, the ſame privileges, and immunities, as well for their goods as their perſons, as for what concerns trade, navigation, and commerce.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. The citizens of the two nations may conduct their veſſels and their merchandiſes (always excepting ſuch as are contraband) from any port to another belonging to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038726_0008_1012C1C0687400B8"/>
the enemy of the other nation. They may navigate and commerce with full liberty and ſecurity, with their ſhips and merchandiſes, in the countries, ports, and places of the enemies of the two parties, or of the one or the other party, without obſtacles or interruption, and not only paſs directly from the places and ports of the enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovementioned to neutral ports and places, but from every place belonging to an enemy, whether it be or be not ſubject to the ſame juriſdiction, unleſs thoſe places or ports ſhall be really blockaded, beſieged, or inveſted.</p>
            <p>And in caſe, as it often happens, when veſſels ſhall be ſailing for places or ports belonging to an enemy, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that they are blockaded, beſieged, or inveſted, it is agreed that every ſhip which ſhall be found under ſuch a predicament ſhall be turned from that place or port without any part of its cargo being retained or confiſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (unleſs it ſhall be contraband, or it ſhall be proved that the ſaid ſhip, after having been informed of the blockade or inveſtiture, attempted to enter the ſame port) but it ſhall be allowed to go to any other port or place it ſhall think proper. No ſhip of either nation, entered in a port or place before it ſhall have been really blockaded, beſieged, or inveſted by the other, ſhall be prevented from going out with its cargo: If it ſhall be there when the ſaid place ſhall ſurrender, the ſhip and cargo ſhall not be confiſcated, but ſent away to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. To regulate what ſhall be underſtood by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband warlike ſtores, under this denomination ſhall be compriſed powder, ſaltpetre, petards, matches, balls, bullets, bombs, grenades, carcaſſes, pikes, halberts, ſwords, belts, piſtols, ſcabbards, ſaddles, harneſs, cannon, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, with their carriages, and generally all arms and ammunitions of war and utenſils for the uſe of troops.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038726_0009_1012C1C367942420"/>
All the above articles, whenever they ſhall be deſtined for an enemy's port, are declared contraband, and juſtly ſubject to confiſcation: but the ſhip in which they ſhall be laden, as well as the reſt of the cargo, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as free, and ſhall in no manner be vitiated by the contraband merchandiſe, whether they belong to the ſame or different proprietors.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. It is ſtipulated by the preſent treaty, that the free ſhips ſhall equally aſſure the liberty of merchandiſe, and that all things ſhall be deemed free, which are found on board ſhips belonging to the citizens of one of the contracting parties, even though the ſame, or part of it, ſhall belong to the enemies of one of the two; provided, nevertheleſs, that contraband goods are always excepted. It is likewiſe agreed, that this ſame liberty ſhall extend to perſons who may be on board the free ſhip, though they ſhould be enemies of one of the two contracting parties, and they ſhall not be taken from the ſaid free ſhips, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are in a military capacity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and actually in the ſervice of the enemy.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. It is on the contrary agreed, that all property which ſhall be put, by the reſpective citizens, on board ſhips belonging to an enemy of either party, or their ſubjects, ſhall be confiſcated without diſtinction of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe, prohibited or not prohibited, ſo and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as if it belonged to an enemy, with the exception al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of property and effects which ſhall have been put on board the ſaid ſhips before the declaration of war, or even after the ſaid declaration, if at the time of l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ding the party were ignorant of it; ſo that the merchandiſes of citizens of the two parties, whether they be in the number of contraband or not, which as has been already ſaid, ſhall have been put on board a ſhip belonging of an enemy before the war, or even after the ſaid declaration
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038726_0010_1012C1C4F2E09110"/>
of war, in ignorance of it, ſhall not be in any manner ſubject to confiſcation, but ſhall be faithfully and truly given up without delay to the owners claiming them, provided nevertheleſs that they ſhall not be permitted to carry into the enemies ports merchandiſe which ſhall be contraband. The two contracting powers agree, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a term of two months has paſſed from the declaration, their reſpective citizens, in whatever part of the world they may be, ſhall not be at liberty to plead the ignorance mentioned in this article.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. Merchant veſſels belonging to citizens of either of the contracting powers, when they ſhall have a mind to paſs to the port of an enemy of the one or the other, and that their voyage as well as the nature of their cargo, ſhall afford juſt cauſe of ſuſpicion, the ſaid ſhip ſhall be obliged to exhibit at high ſea, as well as in ports and roads, not only their paſſports, but further their certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, proving that theſe goods are not of the claſs of contraband ſpecified in the 13th article of the preſent convention.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. And in order to prevent captures on frivolous ſuſpicions, and the damage thus reſulting, it is agreed, that when one of the two powers ſhall be at war, and the other neutral, the veſſels of the neutral party ſhall be provided with paſſport ſimilar to thoſe ſpecified in the 4th article, ſo that it may thence appear that the parties belongs to a neutral party. Theſe paſſports ſhall be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid for any number of voyages whatever; but they ſhall be renewed every year, if the ſhip returns home within the ſpace of a year. If theſe ſhips are laden, they ſhall be provided not only with the paſſports above-mentioned, but alſo with certificates of the deſcription of thoſe mentioned in the ſame article, ſo that it may be known whether they have on board contraband goods. No other paper ſhall be
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038726_0011_1012C1C7EC65D070"/>
required, all uſages and regulations to the contrary not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding; and if it ſhould appear from theſe certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates that there is not contraband merchandiſe on board, the ſaid ſhips ſhall be left to purſue their deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If, on the contrary, it ſhould appear from theſe certificates that the ſaid ſhips have contraband merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe on board, and the Commander offers to deliver them up, the offer ſhall be accepted, and the ſhip left at liberty to proſecute her voyage, unleſs the quantity of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band goods ſhould be too great to admit of taking on board the ſhip of war or cruiſer; in this caſe the ſhip ſhall be carried into port for the purpoſe of there deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaid goods.</p>
            <p>Should a ſhip be found without the paſſports or the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates above required, the buſineſs ſhall be examined by competent judges or tribunals; and if it ſhould appear from other documents or proofs, admiſſible by the law of nations, that the ſhip belongs to citizens of the neutral power, it ſhall not be condemned, and it ſhall be ſet at liberty with its cargo, contraband goods excepted, and ſhall have leave to proſecute its voyage.</p>
            <p>Should the Captain named in the paſſport, happen to die or be removed, and another ſhall have been appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his place, the ſhip and cargo ſhall be nevertheleſs ſecure, and the paſſport ſhall remain in full force.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. If the veſſels belonging to citizens of the one nation or the other ſhall be met along the coaſt, or on the high ſeas, by any ſhip of war or cruizer belonging to the other, to prevent all diſorder, the ſaid ſhips or cruiſers ſhall keep beyond the reach of cannon ſhot, and ſhall ſend their boat on board the merchant veſſel ſo met with. They ſhall not be allowed to ſend on board more than two or three men to demand from the maſter or Captain of the ſhip the exhibition of his paſſport concerning the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038726_0012_1012C1CCAC1A0618"/>
property of ſaid ſhip, executed agreeable to the form preſcribed in the 4th article, as alſo the certificates above mentioned relative to the cargo. It is expreſsly agreed that the neutral Captain ſhall not be obliged to go on board the viſiting ſhip for the purpoſe of there ſhewing the papers demanded, or for any other informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatever.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. It is expreſsly agreed by the parties, that the above ſtipulations relative to the conduct to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſea by the cruiſers of the belligerent party towards the veſſels of the neutral party ſhall apply only to ſhips ſailing without convoy; and in caſe, when the ſaid ſhips ſhall be convoyed, the intention of the parties being to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all the reſpect due to the protection of the flag hoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on board ſhips of the ſtate, no viſit ſhall be made. But the verbal declaration of the Commander of the eſcort, that the ſhips under his convoy belong to the nation whoſe flag he carries, and that they have not any thing contraband on board, ſhall be taken by the reſpective cruiſers as amply ſufficient. The two parties bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves reciprocally not to admit under protection of their convoys any veſſels carrying contraband merchandiſe deſtined for an enemy.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. In caſe when the ſhips ſhall be taken or ſtopt, under alledged grounds of their carrying any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band articles to the enemy, the captor ſhall give a receipt of the ſhip's papers which he ſhall detain, which receipt ſhall be ſubjoined to a declaratory liſt of the ſaid papers. He ſhall not be permitted to force open the hatches, coffers, cheſts, drawers, bales, &amp;c. found on board ſhips, nor to carry off the ſmalleſt article of the effects, before the cargo has been diſembarked in preſence of the officers compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to make an inventory of the ſaid effects. They cannot in any manner be ſold, exchanged, or alienated,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038726_0013_1012C1CFAC3D39D0"/>
unleſs, after a legal proceſs, the competent judge or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es have paſſed upon the ſaid effects a ſentence of confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (excepting always the ſhip and the other objects that it contains.)</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. In order that the veſſel and the cargo may be watched with care, and in order to prevent miſtakes, it is decreed that the maſter, captain or ſupercargo of the captured ſhip cannot be taken from on board, either while the ſhip is at ſea, after being taken, during the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt it, its cargo, or any thing relative to it.</p>
            <p>In caſe of the ſhip belonging to either party being taken, ſeized, and retained for judgment, its officers, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers and crews ſhall be treated with humanity; they cannot be impriſoned nor robbed of their clothes or pocket money, not exceeding for the captain, ſupercargo, and ſecond, five hundred dollars each, and for the ſailors and paſſengers, one hundred dollars each.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. It is moreover agreed on, that in every caſe the tribunals appointed for prize cauſes in the countries whith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the prizes ſhall be taken, ſhall alone be competent to try them; and every judgment which the tribunal of eith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er party pronounces againſt a ſhip, or merchandiſe, or property reclaimed by the citizens of the other party, the ſentence or decree ſhall make mention of the reaſons or motives which have determined this judgment, of which an authentic copy, as well as of all the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings relative to it, ſhall, on their requiſition, be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without delay to the captain or agent of the ſaid ſhip, after paying the expences.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. And finally, in order more effectually to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the reſpective ſecurity of the citizens of the two contracting parties, and to prevent the injuries to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſhips of war or privateers of either party, all the commanders of ſhips of war or privateers, and all the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038726_0014_1012C1D137D5D2C0"/>
citizens of both parties, ſhall refrain from all violence againſt one another, and from every perſonal inſult. If they act in a contrary manner they ſhall be puniſhed, and bound over in their perſons and properties to give ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and reparation for the damage, with intereſt, of whatever kind the ſaid damage may be.</p>
            <p>To this effect all the captains of privateers, before receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their commiſſions, ſhall become bound before a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judge, to give ſecurity by two reſponſible cautions at leaſt, who ſhall have no intereſt in the ſaid privateer, and whom each, as well as the captain, ſhall engage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividually for the ſum of 7,000 dollars, or 36,820 francs, if the ſaid veſſels carry more than 150 ſailors or ſoldiers, for the ſum of 15,000 dollars, or 73,670 francs, which ſhall ſerve to repair the damage that the ſaid privateers, their officers, or crews, or any of them, ſhall have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted during their cruiſe contrary to the diſpoſitions of the preſent convention, or to the laws and inſtructions which ought to be the rule of their conduct; beſides this, the ſaid commiſſion ſhall be revoked and annulled in every caſe where an aggreſſion has been committed.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. When the ſhips of war of the two contracting parties, or thoſe which their citizens ſhall have armed, ſhall be admitted with their prizes into the ports of either of the two parties, the ſaid public or private veſſels, as well as their prizes, ſhall not be obliged to pay any duties, either to the officers of the place, or to the judges, or to any others. The ſaid prizes entering in the harbours or ports of one of the two parties, ſhall not be arreſted or ſeized, and the officers of the place ſhall not take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the validity of the ſaid prizes, which are to be ſuffered to go out, and be conducted with full freedom and liberty to their ports, by the commiſſions which the captains of the ſaid veſſels ſhall be obliged to ſhew. It is
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038726_0015_1012C1D5AFE14F18"/>
always underſtood, that the ſtipulations of this article ſhall not extend beyond the privileges of the moſt favoured nations.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. All foreign privateers having commiſſions from a State or Prince at war with one or other nation cannot arm their veſſels in the ports of either nation, or diſpoſe of their prizes there, or in any manner exchange them.— They ſhall not be allowed to buy proviſions further than the neceſſary quantity to gain the neareſt port of the State or Prince from whom they ſhall have received their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. It is further agreed that neither of the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting parties ſhall receive pirates in its ports, roads, or cities, and ſhall not permit any of its inhabitants to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, protect, ſupport or conceal them in any manner, but ſhall deliver up to due puniſhment ſuch of its inhabitants as ſhall be guilty of the like acts or crimes: the ſhips of thoſe pirates, as well as their effects and merchandize, ſhall be ſeized wherever they ſhall be diſcovered, and reſtored to their proprietors, agents or factors, duly authorized by them, after having proved their right before judges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to decide reſpecting the property.</p>
            <p>If the ſaid effects have paſſed by ſale into other hands, and the purchaſers were or might be informed, or have ſuſpected, that the ſaid effects were carried away by pirates, they ſhall be equally reſtored.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. Neither of the two nations ſhall interfere in the fiſheries of the other upon its coaſts, nor diſturb it in the exerciſe of the rights which it now has, or may acquire, on the coaſts of Newfoundland, in the Gulf of St. Laurence, or elſewhere on the coaſt of America, or the north of the United States; but the whale and ſeal fiſhery ſhall be free for the two nations in all parts of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:038726_0016_1012C1D73B3D6F90"/>The Convention ſhall be ratified on both ſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in due form, and the ratifications ſhall be exchanged in the ſpace of ſix months, or ſooner if it be poſſible. In faith whereof the reſpective Plenipotentiaries have ſigned the above articles as well in the French as in the Engliſh language, and have placed their ſeals, declaring nevertheleſs that the ſignature in two languages ſhall not be cited as an example, and ſhall not prejudice either of the two parties.</p>
