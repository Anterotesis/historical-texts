            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>We have had Bloodſhed enough. God forgive thoſe who have occaſioned this terrible Deſtruction of the human Species, and ſpread Miſery, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation, for ſo long a Time, in almoſt every Corner of the Globe. The great Succeſs with which the Arms of <hi>Britain</hi> have been bleſſed, puts it in our Power to give Peace to <hi>Europe:</hi> and it is to the Honour of his Majeſty and thoſe who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his Councils, that the Diſtreſſes of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have only enabled him to give the World a Proof of his Moderation; and to ſhew that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to make Peace, keeps Pace with the Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>France</hi> to prolong the War.</p>
            <p>
               <q>As his Majeſty entered into this War, not from Views of Ambition, ſo he does not Wiſh to continue it, from Motives of Reſentment. The Deſire of his Majeſty's Heart is, to ſee a Stop put to the Effuſion of Chriſtian Blood.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What was declared in the above Paragraph of his Majeſty's Speech from the Throne, to our own Parliament, at the Opening of this Seſſion, has ſince that, been notified in Form to our Enemy. The Readineſs of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> to enter into a Treaty, and to give Peace to Chriſtendom, which Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Wolfenbuttle</hi> hath been authorized to communicate to the <hi>French</hi> Miniſter at the <hi>Hague,</hi> will, no Doubt, open the Door for a Negotiation, in a Manner the moſt likely to be embraced by the Court of <hi>Verſailles</hi>; whoſe Diſgraces and Diſtreſſes, (too great to be diſſembled, and too extenſive to be remedied) will diſpoſe them to liſten with At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to every Propoſal of Accommodation, made to them by an Enemy whoſe Sword was unſheathed only to puniſh Perfidy; and whoſe Succeſſes, as appears from their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <p>It is, therefore, to be hoped, and to be believed, that Peace is not at a great Diſtance; and upon this Suppoſition I ſhall beg Leave to offer a few Conſiderations to <hi>you,</hi> as to the Perſons on whom the Fate of this Country depends; Conſiderations which are equally important as they are ſeaſonable; and an Attention to which, before you enter upon any Negotiation, may, perhaps, aſſiſt you (if I may be allowed to ſuppoſe you ſtand in Need of any Aſſiſtance) in directing this Negotiation to ſuch an Iſſue, as may be equally honourable to yourſelves, and uſeful to the Public.</p>
            <p>In this Situation of Affairs, one of the firſt Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relative to the future Negotiation, which, no doubt, muſt occur to you, will be the Choice of thoſe Perſons who are to be truſted with the great Concerns of this Nation as <hi>Plenipotentiaries.</hi> As much will depend upon this Point, I ſhall beg Leave to begin with giving you my Thoughts upon it, and the other Topics on which I propoſe to trouble you will naturally ariſe from each other without obſerving any other <hi>Order,</hi> or Connection, beſides that in which they ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to a Mind intent upon its Subject.</p>
            <p>With regard then to the Choice of <hi>Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries,</hi> I cannot but lament the Difficulties you have to encounter, before you will be able to find ſuch as the Public will have Reaſon to thank you for.—I am not totally unknowing in the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Capacities of many among the great.

But if we have too frequently trifled with our national Concerns, by truſting them in ſuch Hands, I need not ſay that there are Circumſtances at preſent which give us reaſonable Ground for hoping that the ſame Sagacity, and Deſire to ſerve the Public which hath found out, and employed the propereſt Perſons to conduct the Operations of the War, will be exerted to find out the propereſt Perſons (few as there are to be found) to conduct the Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Treaty.</p>
            <p>Very deplorable indeed muſt be the Inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Perſons we ſhall employ, if their Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations for Peace be conducted ſo awkwardly as to rob us of the Advantages we have gained by the War. If we may judge from late Events, <hi>France</hi> ſeems as little to abound with Wiſdom in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, as it doth with Courage and Conduct in the Field. And if the Negotiations at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> in which almoſt all the Advantages of War equally ſucceſsful with the preſent, were given up, be urged as an Inſtance of the ſuperior Dexterity of <hi>French</hi> Politics, it ought to be remembered that this was more owing to our own Diviſions, than to <hi>their</hi> Sagacity, and the Inabilities of our Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> tho' we had no great Reaſon, God knows, to brag of them. What, therefore, may we not expect from a Negotiation to be begun in very different Circumſtances; when there exiſts no Faction whoſe Intereſt it may be to perplex and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat it; and when that national Unanimity to which we, in a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Peace?—However, favourable as theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are, the Choice of ſuch Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as may be likely to conduct the Negotiation, with Dignity, Dexterity and Integrity, becomes a Conſideration which the Public will expect ſhould be weighed with the utmoſt Attention. And, if ſuch Perſons cannot be found amongſt us (which I hope may not be the Caſe) there is a very deſirable Alternative ſtill in your Power. Fix the Scene of Negotiation, where, indeed, for the Honour of our Country, I could wiſh to ſee it fixed. Name no other Plenipotentiaries to conduct the Peace but thoſe Miniſters who directed the War: And a Treaty of <hi>London,</hi> in ſuch Hands, will make ample Amends for our wretched Management at <hi>Utrecht.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let Peace be ever ſo well made; let Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters plan Treaties with the greateſt Sagacity, and Plenipotentiaries negotiate the Articles with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Skill and Dexterity, yet we know from Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Obſervation, that they never can be perpetual, and, moſt commonly, are not laſting. Princes, too frequently, ſeem to own no other Rule of Action, than preſent Convenience; and the Law of Nations is ſeldom appealed to, but to ſanctify Injuſtice, and ſave Appearances. Nor are the poſitive Compacts ſolemnly agreed upon between Nation and Nation, better obſerved. For how ſeldom do we ſee a Treaty religiouſly adhered to, by the Parties whoſe Intereſt it is to break it, and who think they are in ſuch Circumſtances as to be able to break it with Impunity?—If ſuch Infidelity be too common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Princes in general, Experience, long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teaches us, that the Nation with whom we are ſoon to treat, excel us, at leaſt, in this Part of Policy.

               <hi>Gallic Faith</hi> is become proverbial, and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of <hi>France</hi> can reproach her with innumerable Inſtances of a moſt profligate Diſregard to the moſt ſolemn Treaties. And the Reaſon ſeems to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, without ſuppoſing that Nation more perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious than others. The Power, the Populouſneſs, the Extent, the Strength of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, free them from thoſe Apprehenſions which bind the weaker Side to be faithful to it's Engagements; and depending upon the Inability of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, conſidered ſingly, to procure to themſelves Juſtice, this, too frequently, has tempted them to the moſt ſhameful and barefaced Inſtances of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Breach of Faith.</p>
            <p>It well becomes us, therefore, at this Juncture, when the Diſtreſſes of the <hi>French,</hi> we may hope, will oblige them to conſent to Terms of Peace, unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the Intereſt, and diſgraceful to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Monarch, to take every Method in our Power to ſecure the Obſervance of thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions they may make; and to inſiſt upon their giving us ſuch Proofs of their Sincerity, before any Negotiation be entered upon, as may give us ſome Aſſurance that they mean to be more faithful to their future Engagements.</p>

            <p>Full of this favorite Project of <hi>American</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, ſoon after the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> they began to enlarge their Boundaries on that Continent, in direct Violation of the ſolemn Conceſſions they had ſo lately made.</p>
            <p>As long ago as 1720, they ſeized and fortified the moſt important Paſs in <hi>America,</hi> at <hi>Niagara</hi>; in that very Country of the <hi>Five Indian Nations,</hi> from which the 15th Article of the Treaty of <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trecht</hi> had excluded them. The infinite Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of <hi>Niagara</hi> made them leſs ſcrupulous, no Doubt, about Treaties. For by Means of this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation they, in a Manner, became Maſters of the Lakes, and could, at Leiſure extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the <hi>Ohio,</hi> and carry their Chain of Forts and Settlements down to the <hi>Miſſiſippi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Plan of Uſurpation on the Back of our Colonies went on gradually and ſucceſsfully from Year to Year; the <hi>Indians</hi> owned by the Peace of <hi>Utrecht</hi> to be our Subjects, were debauched from our Intereſt, and ſpirited up to maſſacre, and ſcalp the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and in 1731, the Inſolence of the <hi>French</hi> grew to ſuch an Heighth, that they erected their Fort at <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> in a Country indiſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ours; whether conſidered as in the Center of the <hi>five Nations,</hi> or as actually within the Limits of <hi>New-York.</hi> And whoever caſts his Eye upon the Situation of this Fort, in the Map, will ſee how greatly the Poſſeſſion of it facilitated the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the great Object of opening a Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Ocean; and how much it expoſed our moſt valuable Colonies to <hi>Indian</hi> Maſſacres and <hi>French</hi> Invaſions.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be aſked, what was our Miniſtry in <hi>England</hi> employed about, during ſuch Inſtances of

               <hi>French</hi> Perfidy—the Anſwer muſt be, (tho' I wiſh I could draw a Veil over this Period) that our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were then conducted by a Miniſter who was awake, indeed, to every Scheme of Corruption; eager to buy a Borough, or to bribe a Member; but ſlow to every Meaſure of national Importance and Utility. His firſt, his only Object, was to preſerve himſelf in Power; and as, in Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch intereſted and mercenary Views, he had actually engaged this Nation in an Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> (to pull down the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Power of our old and natural Ally) it was no Wonder that he heard unmoved, and ſuffered with Impunity, the <hi>French</hi> Uſurpations in <hi>North-America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us next trace the <hi>French</hi> Infidelity with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> or <hi>Acadia.</hi> Tho' that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince had been yielded to us at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> we had taken very few Steps to ſettle it effectually, till 1749, after the Peace of <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle.</hi> And then the <hi>French</hi> Court gave us a Specimen of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane</hi> worthy indeed, of thoſe whom no Treaty ever bound, in Oppoſition to their Convenience. They began to ſpeak out, and to tell us, nay to inſiſt upon it ſeriouſly in Memorials, that the Country ceded to us under the Name of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> comprehended only the <hi>Peninſula,</hi> and did not extend beyond the <hi>Iſthmus.</hi> Whereas the Charters of King <hi>James</hi> I. to Sir <hi>William Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>; and Sir <hi>William</hi>'s own Map, as old as the Charter, demonſtrate that the <hi>ancient Limits</hi> of the Country ſo named included a vaſt Tract of Land, beyond the <hi>Peninſula,</hi> reaching along the Coaſt till it joined <hi>New England</hi>; and extending up the Country till it was bounded by the South Side of the River <hi>St. Lawrence.</hi> Of ſuch an Extent of Country they had formed a Plan to rob us; hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no Doubt, to find the ſame Supineneſs in the

With this View they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that Commiſſaries might meet to ſettle the Limits, promiſing not to act in <hi>America,</hi> till thoſe Commiſſaries ſhould agree, or the Conferences break up. But how was this Promiſe obſerved? While the Commiſſaries trifled away their Time at <hi>Paris,</hi> the Uſurpations went on in <hi>America</hi>; Incurſions were frequently made into the Peninſula of <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> the Poſſeſſion or which they did not pretend to diſpute with us; Forts were built by them in ſeveral Places, and particularly a moſt important One to command the <hi>Iſthmus</hi>; thus decid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>While the <hi>French</hi> Uſurpations went on ſo inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently in <hi>Nova Scotia</hi>; the Plan was carrying on with equal Perfidy on the Banks of the <hi>Ohio</hi>; a Country, the Inhabitants of which had been in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> above an hundred Years ago; an Alliance frequently renewed; to which alſo we had a Claim as being a Conqueſt of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and from which, therefore, the <hi>French</hi> were excluded by the 15th Article of the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht</hi> above recited. But what avail Treaties when Intereſt comes in Competition? The Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Ohio</hi> was abſolutely neceſſary, that the great Plan of connecting <hi>Canada</hi> with <hi>Louiſiana</hi> might ſucceed: And, therefore, they began their Hoſtilities againſt us, in that Country very ſoon after the Peace of <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle</hi>; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted our Traders, plundered and made them Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; erected Fortreſſes, and eſtabliſhed Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;

            <p>From this Period we may look upon the War as begun. Our Governors in <hi>North-America</hi> had Orders from <hi>England,</hi> to oppoſe the <hi>French</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments by Force of Arms; and, in 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>No Doubt the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters flattered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that <hi>England,</hi> inattentive to the Intereſts of its Colonies for ſo many Years before, and who, ſo lately, had ſubmitted to a Diſadvantageous Peace, would not have the Spirit to oppoſe Force to Force, and do itſelf Juſtice by other Weapons than the Complaints of Lord <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And thus <hi>England,</hi> which, for half a Century, had been waſting its Millions, and laviſhing its Blood, to obtain a Barrier in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which thoſe for whom we conquered it could not defend, or rather did not think it worth while to keep; began the preſent War, a War truly <hi>NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONAL.</hi>

frankly made no Scruple of telling the <hi>Engliſh</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, that this Expedient, which had been deviſed to prevent the Union of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> under one Monarch, would be of little Force, as being inconſiſtent with the fundamental Laws of <hi>France</hi>; by this Declaration giving us a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Inſtance of the Weakneſs, or of the Wickedneſs of our then Miniſters, who could build the Peace of <hi>Europe</hi> on ſo ſandy a Foundation, and accept of Terms which <hi>France</hi> itſelf was honeſt enough to own were not to be kept.</p>
            <p>However, the <hi>Regent</hi> was reſolved to ſupport his Claim to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> in Excluſion to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Branch; and, as the Support and Aſſiſtance of <hi>England</hi> was neceſſary for this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it is not to be wondered at that he ſhould court the Friendſhip of a Nation from whom he had ſo much to expect; and therefore, he was wiſe enough to do us Juſtice, by carrying into Execution, in ſome Degree, the Article relating to <hi>Dunkirk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The perſonal Intereſt of the Regent was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reaſon for this Compliance: But ſucceeding Adminiſtrations in <hi>France</hi> not being influenced by the ſame private Views to adhere to Treaties ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ratified, <hi>Dunkirk</hi> began gradually to riſe from its Ruins; its Port again received Ships; its Trade flouriſhed; <hi>England</hi> ſaw itſelf deprived of this favourite Advantage gained at <hi>Utrecht</hi>; and ſuch was the Aſcendency of <hi>French</hi> Councils over thoſe of this Iſland, at the Period I ſpeak of, that we were actually engaged in Alliances with <hi>France,</hi> while that Nation was thus openly inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, and inſulting us, without Obſtruction, in ſo eſſential an Article. We all remember what paſſed in Parliament in 1733, relating to the Point now before us.—Such was the tame Acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Adminiſtration, that <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> by this Time, ſtood upon our Cuſtom-Houſe Books as a Port<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from whence great Imports were

made; and when an Inquiry concerning this was propoſed in the Houſe of Commons by a great Parliament Man <note n="†" place="bottom">Sir W. Wyndham.</note> ſince dead, the then Miniſter hung his Head, in the Houſe, for Shame. And who could have believed it poſſible, that the ſame Perſon who had been ſo ready to promote a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Inquiry into this Violation of the Peace in 1713, ſhould obſtruct ſuch an Inquiry, when he himſelf was in Power, though the Reaſons for it had become much ſtronger? Who could ſee Him, without Indignation, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut his Eyes to the Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and obſtruct the propoſed Inquiry, by getting from Cardinal <hi>Fleury</hi> (who then governed <hi>France,</hi> and, I bluſh to ſay it, <hi>England</hi> too) a deluſive, miniſterial Letter, promiſing what he knew would not be performed;—and obtained, perhaps, only becauſe the Cardinal was aſſured, that the Breach of the Promiſe would not be reſented.</p>
            <p>While <hi>England</hi> remained ſo averſe to do itſelf Juſtice, no Wonder that <hi>France</hi> improved the Opportunity. At the Time when that <hi>Miniſter</hi> was obliged to retire from Power, the Re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was compleated. For, in a little more than a Year after <note n="‡" place="bottom">The Memorial is dated <hi>July</hi> 1, 1742.</note>, we find a Memorial preſented by Lord <hi>Stair</hi> to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of this Violation of the Peace of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> and urging it as a Reaſon for their joining us againſt <hi>France.</hi> And as it was for the Honour of the new Adminiſtration, that they began with Meaſures ſo ſpirited and national, it is equally remarkable, that the ſame Perſon, who had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. in his own Palace, for his Slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in demoliſhing <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> lived to be again employed by his Country at the Diſtance of near thirty Years, when the Reſtoration of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an Object of national Reſentment.</p>
            <p>The two Nations had not, as yet, begun the late War, when we ſaw, in <hi>One</hi> Inſtance, both a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008585_0025_102F8B225CA21FB8"/>
Proof that <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was again a <hi>Port,</hi> and a Port which may be made Uſe of, to endanger the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Britain.</hi> At the Time I now ſpeak of <note n="†" place="bottom">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 1743-4.</note>, we beheld the Harbour of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> crowded with Tranſports to embark Count <hi>Saxe</hi> and the <hi>Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to invade us. And, if that Invaſion had then taken Effect, from that very <hi>Port</hi> which was to be no <hi>Port</hi> (happily the Winds were contrary to the Fleet from <hi>Breſt</hi>) the infinite Miſchief which this Nation may ſuffer from its Re-eſtabliſhment, would have been fatally experienced.</p>
            <p>Though we have no great Reaſon to brag of the Treaty made at the Concluſion of the laſt War (which I am aſhamed to call a Peace, as it ſettled nothing that was before in Doubt between the two Nations) the Peace of <hi>Utrecht</hi> concerning <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> was, nevertheleſs in its moſt eſſential Part, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to its full Force. I ſay, in its moſt <hi>Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Part</hi>; becauſe, though the 17th Article of the Treaty of <hi>Aix-la-Chapelle</hi> left <hi>Dunkirk</hi> in the State it then was, with Regard to its Fortifications to the Land; the ſame Article revived our Right, to the Demolition of its Port, by ſtipulating <hi>That ancient Treaties are to be obſerved in regard to the Port, and the Works on the Sea Side.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Little or nothing was done between the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Peace, and the breaking out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent War, towards carrying into Execution this freſh Promiſe. On the contrary, the enlarging of the Fortifications of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> is mentioned in his Majeſty's Declaration of War, three Years ago, as one of the freſh Heads of Injury offered to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And whoever reflects upon the Tranſactions, ſince that Period, will ſee that <hi>Dunkirk</hi> is reſtored to its original Importance. Its Privateers have done infinite Miſchief to our Trade; a Squadron of his Majeſty's Navy, in vain blocked up its Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour lately, to prevent the ſailing of <hi>Thurot</hi>'s
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008585_0026_102F8B23F5361DB8"/>
Fleet: and, it is well known, that the long threatened Invaſion of theſe Kindoms, which <hi>France,</hi> in Deſpair, certainly meditated, would have been attempted from this Place, if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their Ships of War by <hi>Hawke,</hi> had not taught them the Abſurdity of invading us in their much celebrated <hi>flat bottom Boats,</hi> which, we may well ſuppoſe, will hardly be tried, when their Fleets, really formidable, have been deſtroyed in the Attempt.</p>
            <p>The above Enumeration of <hi>French</hi> Infidelities, in general, and in particular their Behaviour to <hi>England</hi> with regard to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and with regard to <hi>North-America,</hi> ſo naturally points out the <hi>Expediency</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of the Hints I ſhall now offer, that, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them, I may well hope not to have them ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed as the Reveries of a chimerical <hi>St. Pierre,</hi> but rather attended to, as the ſober Dictates of Prudence, and of a Zeal not altogether devoid of Knowledge.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Then, <hi>my Lord and Sir,</hi> before you enter upon any New Treaty, or liſten to any plauſible Propoſals whatever, inſiſt that Juſtice may be done this Nation, with regard to former Treaties. Shew <hi>France</hi> the ſtrong, the ſolemn Engagement ſhe entered into at <hi>Utrecht</hi> to demoliſh <hi>Dunkirk</hi>; put her in Mind of the amazing Perfidy with which ſhe, from Time to Time, eluded the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that Engagement; and demand <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> Juſtice on that Article, as a preliminary Proof of her Sincerity in the enſuing Negotiation.</p>
            <p>Be not deceived any longer in this Matter. The <hi>French</hi> will, no doubt, aſſure you that the Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> ſhall be an Article in the New Treaty. But let them know, you are not to be <hi>ſo</hi> impoſed upon. They wlll, to be ſure, when this becomes a new Article, reckon it a new Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on their Side, and expect ſomething in return for it,—perhaps <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi> or ſome ſuch Trifle, as they will call it. But tell them with the Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of wiſe Conquerors, that the Demolition of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008585_0027_102F8B27CFD75FC8"/>
               <hi>Dunkirk</hi> is what you are intitled to by Treaties made long ago, and violated; and that it ſhall not be ſo much as mentioned in the inſuing Negotiation, but complied with before that Negotiation ſhall commence.</p>
            <p>Or, admitting that no Conceſſion ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by <hi>France</hi> in the New Treaty, in Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of a new Article to demoliſh <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> place to them, in the ſtrongeſt Light, the unanſwerable Reaſons we have againſt putting any Confidence in them, that ſuch an Article would be better executed, than that in the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht</hi> has been.</p>
            <p>If they refuſe doing us this immediate Juſtice, previous to the Peace; aſk them how they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that we ſhould have any Reliance on their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity to fulfil the New Engagements they may enter into, when they afford us ſo ſtrong, ſo glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Inſtance of Infidelity, in an Article of ſuch Conſequence, made ſo many Years ago? Can you have any Dealings with a Power, who, if he refuſes this, at the very Time he is treating, affords you ſuch manifeſt Proof, that his Word is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon, and that you cannot truſt to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Promiſe ever ſo ſolemnly made?</p>
            <p>Perhaps <hi>France</hi> may think it a Diſgrace to them, to comply with any Thing previous to the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Negotiation. Tell them, that acting honourably, and doing what Juſtice requires, can never be diſgraceful. But if it be a Diſgrace, tell them, with the Spirit of honeſt Men, that we owe it them, for the greater Diſgrace they put, not long ago, upon us, by requiring us to ſend two Peers of this Realm to remain in <hi>France</hi> as <hi>Hoſtages,</hi> till we ſurrendered <hi>Louiſbourg</hi>; an Indignity which I cannot call to Mind without Pain, and which, I always thought, was ſubmitted to without Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:008585_0028_102F8B2A2F089E70"/>It is now our Turn to vindicate the Honour of our Nation; and as <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was put into our Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion before the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> as a Pledge of the <hi>French</hi> Sincerity, and to continue in our Poſſeſſion, till the Demolition ſhould be completed; let ſome ſuch Expedient be now agreed upon; with this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence only, that inſtead of <hi>five Months after the Peace,</hi> the Time fixed, for the Demolition, at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> let no Peace be ſigned, at preſent, till this Right acquired to us by former Treaties, and of which we have been ſo perfidiouſly robbed, be actually carried into full Execution.</p>
            <p>However, if any inſuperable Difficulties ſhould attend the doing ourſelves Juſtice, on this Head, before the Peace; if, for Inſtance, which perhaps may be the Caſe, it ſhould be found that it cannot be complied with, unleſs we conſent to a <hi>Ceſſation of Arms,</hi> during the Time of Negotiation; rather than give <hi>France</hi> that Opportunity of recovering from its Diſtreſſes, and of being protected from the Superiority of our Arms, before we have, finally, obliged them to accept of our own Terms of Peace (which was one Cauſe of the Ruin of our Negotiation at <hi>Utrecht</hi>) I would wave inſiſting upon the Demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> before the Treaty, and think it ſufficient to demand <hi>Hoſtages</hi> from them, as a Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that it ſhall be faithfully complied with, within a limited Time after the Treaty ſhall be concluded. The <hi>Pariſians</hi> had two <hi>Engliſh Milords</hi> to ſtare at, upon the laſt Peace; and I do not ſee why the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of our <hi>Londoners</hi> ſhould not be gratified, in the ſame Way; and Two <hi>Ducs</hi> and <hi>Pairs</hi> of <hi>France</hi> be ſent as Hoſtages to <hi>England,</hi> till <hi>Dunkirk</hi> ceaſe to be a Port.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But though Care ſhould be taken to keep all thoſe Places juſt mentioned; ſomething more muſt be done, or our <hi>American</hi> Colonies will tell you, you

have done <hi>Nothing.</hi> In a Word, you muſt keep <hi>Canada,</hi> otherways you lay the Foundation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther War.</p>
            <p>The Neceſſity of this may be placed in ſo ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a View, as to ſilence the <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and to convince all <hi>Europe,</hi> of the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of our Demand.</p>
            <p>Aſk the <hi>French,</hi> what Security they can give you, if we reſtore <hi>Canada</hi> to them, however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained in its Boundaries, that they will not again begin to extend them at our Expence? If the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht</hi> could not keep them from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, what Reaſon can we have to ſuppoſe the future Treaty will be better obſerved? If the <hi>French</hi> are left at <hi>Montreal,</hi> and the <hi>three Rivers,</hi> can we be certain they will not again croſs the <hi>Champlain Lake,</hi> and attack <hi>Crown-Point?</hi> If the North Side of the River <hi>St. Lawrence</hi> be ſtill theirs, what is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us againſt an Expedition to <hi>Niagara?</hi> Can we flatter ourſelves, that a People, who in full Peace, erected thoſe two Fortreſſes, in direct Violation of their Faith plighted at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> will be reſtrained by any future Treaty, from attempting, alſo in full Peace, to recover them? After having ſeen the <hi>French</hi> carrying on a regular Plan of Uſurpation, in <hi>North America,</hi> for theſe Forty Years paſt, ſhall we be ſo weak as to believe that they will now lay it aſide? No, depend upon it, if the <hi>French</hi> think it worth their while to aſk back that Part of <hi>North America,</hi> which was their own, they mean to take a proper Opportunity, of <hi>Elbowing all our Colonies round about,</hi> and of reſuming the ſame ambitious Views of Enlargment which the moſt ſacred Ties of former Treaties could not reſtrain.</p>
            <p>The Truth of the Matter is, they were tired of <hi>Canada.</hi> The Inclemency of the Climate, the difficult Acceſs to it; and a Trade ſcarcely defray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Expence of the Colony, would long ago have induced them to abandon it, if the Plan of extending its Boundaries, at the Expence of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and of opening its Communication with <hi>Louiſiana</hi> and with the Ocean, had not made them perſevere.—<hi>Canada</hi> itſelf is not worth their aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and if they do deſire to have it reſtored to them, it can only be with a View to repeat the ſame Injuries and Infidelities, to puniſh which, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the preſent War. Unleſs, therefore, we be reſolved, <hi>with our Eyes open,</hi> to expoſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a Repetition of former Encroachments; unleſs we would chooſe to be obliged to keep great Bodies of Troops, in <hi>America,</hi> in full Peace, at an immenſe Expence; we can never conſent to leave the <hi>French</hi> any Footing in <hi>Canada.</hi> If we do not exclude them, <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>entirely</hi> from that Country; we ſhall ſoon find we have done Nothing. Let the Treaty be drawn ever ſo accurately; let the Boundaries between <hi>Canada</hi> and our Colonies be deſcribed ever ſo preciſely, and regulated ever ſo much, in our Favour; what has happened al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, ought to teach us what we may expect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; the future Treaty will be obſerved no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the former have been; Uſurpation and Encroachment will gradually revive; and thus ſhall we have thrown away all our Succeſſes; ſo many Millions will have been expended to no Purpoſe; and the Blood of ſo many Thouſands of our brave Countrymen ſpilt, only to remind us, that though we knew how to conquer, we knew not how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, perhaps, the only Opportunity we ſhall ever have, of putting it out of the Power of <hi>France</hi> to violate its Faith.</p>
            <p>I take it for granted that, in the future Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, the Iſland of <hi>Cape Breton</hi> will follow the Fate of <hi>Quebec:</hi> I ſhall only obſerve with Regard
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008585_0034_102F8B3BC8D9EE20"/>
to it, that though the Harbour and Fortification of <hi>Louiſbourg</hi> be of infinite Service to <hi>France</hi>; it can be of little or no Uſe to <hi>England,</hi> if <hi>Canada</hi> be left to us. It is of Conſequence to <hi>France,</hi> as a Retreat to their Ships fiſhing on the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Banks of <hi>Newfoundland</hi>; and as a Security to the Entrance of the <hi>Gulph</hi> of <hi>St. Laurence.</hi> But the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Newfoundland</hi> itſelf, makes <hi>Louiſbourg</hi> of no Utility to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in the former Reſpect; and <hi>Halifax,</hi> where we have a good Harbour, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers very nearly the latter Purpoſe. Upon this View therefore, may we not hope and expect, that, the Neceſſity of garriſoning <hi>Louiſbourg</hi> having end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Conqueſt of <hi>Quebec,</hi> its Fate will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, without troubling the <hi>French</hi> Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries? Without waiting for a Congreſs, let Orders be forthwith ſent to demoliſh it, ſo as not to leave one Stone upon another, of the Fortifications; to remove the Inhabitants to <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> a better Country; and to leave the Iſland, a bare and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Rock; the State it was in, before the Peace of <hi>Utrecht</hi> gave Leave to <hi>France</hi> to fortify it. If the Right given to the <hi>French</hi> by the 13th Article of the ſame Peace, to fiſh in ſome Parts of thoſe Seas ſhould be continued (and I could wiſh to ſee it continued, as the Refuſal of it would be rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable) let <hi>Cape Breton</hi> unfortified, and ungar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſoned be left open to them; and a few Men of War kept at <hi>Halifax,</hi> will effectually prevent <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſbourg</hi>'s being again made a Place of Strength.</p>
            <p>If you adopt this Meaſure, I ſhould be inclined to think, <hi>France</hi> will ſee that you know your true Intereſts; and that you are reſolved ſteadily to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them. And if they ſhould make any Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances againſt it, tell them they may follow <hi>our</hi> Example, and demoliſh, if they pleaſe, the Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of <hi>Mahon</hi>; which we ſee them poſſeſs

with as great Indifference as we remember the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of its Loſs, with Shame: Which, as being of no Uſe to them they will not deſire to keep, and which, having been kept, by us, at an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, not counterbalanced by its Utility, we ſhall not be very ſanguine about recovering. Or rather tell them, that in demoliſhing <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> before the Peace, we only copy a former Example given us by themſelves, when their Troops were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in diſmantling the Frontier Towns in <hi>Fland<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs,</hi> at the very Time that their Plenipotentiaries at <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi> were conſenting to give them up.</p>
            <p>The Plan which I have had the Honour of ſketch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to you, beſides being ſo reaſonable in itſelf, is perfectly agreeable to that Moderation expreſſed by his Majeſty in his Speech, of <hi>not having entered into the War with Views of Ambition.</hi> The Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Canada,</hi> is no View of Ambition; it is the only Security the <hi>French</hi> can give us, for their future Regard to Treaties. We have made other Conqueſts, of great Importance, our Management of which will give us ſufficient Means of ſhewing our Moderation. And though I ſhall not preſume to give any Opinion about the future Diſpoſal of them, I think, however, I may be allowed to hint, that "the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Guadaloupe,</hi>" an additional Sugar Iſland, when we have ſo many of our own, ought not to be inſiſted upon ſo ſtrenuouſly as to make it a neceſſary Condition of the Peace. And though "<hi>Senegal</hi> and <hi>Goree,</hi>" are of real Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the Slave and Gum Trades, our own <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Settlements have hitherto ſupplied us with Slaves, ſufficient for our <hi>American</hi> Purpoſes: And the Trade for Gum is, perhaps, not of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence enough to make us Amends for the annual Mortality which we already lament, of our brave Countrymen to guard our <hi>African</hi> Conqueſts. The
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008585_0036_102F8B3FDC23C028"/>
People of <hi>England,</hi> therefore, will not, I believe, blame the giving them back, for a valuable Conſideration,—provided <hi>Canada</hi> be left to us.</p>
            <p>To conſider this Affair in its proper Light, it will be neceſſary to reflect on the infinite Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of <hi>North America</hi> to this Country. Our Colonies there contain above a Million of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who are moſtly ſupplied with the Manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Great Britain</hi>; our Trade to them, by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying innumerable Ships, is one great Source of our maritime Strength; by ſupporting our Sugar Iſlands with their Proviſions, and other Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they pour in upon us all the Riches of the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi>; we carry their Rice, and Tobacco, and Fiſh, to all the Markets of <hi>Europe</hi>; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Indigo, and Iron; and the whole Navy of <hi>England</hi> may be equipped, with the Products of <hi>Engliſh America.</hi> And if, notwithſtanding our having loſt ſeveral Branches of Commerce, we formerly enjoyed in <hi>Europe</hi> and to the <hi>Levant,</hi> we have ſtill more Commerce than ever; a greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for our Manufactures, and a vaſt Increaſe of our Shiping; what can this be owing to, but to the Trade to our own <hi>American</hi> Colonies; a Trade which the Succeſſes of this War, will render, every Day, more and more advantageous? If this Matter, then, be conſidered, in the above Light, by thoſe whom I now addreſs, they will make our <hi>North American</hi> Conqueſts, the <hi>ſine qua non</hi> of the Peace, as being the only Method of guarding our <hi>invaluable</hi> Poſſeſſions there, from Uſurpations and Encroachments; and they will look upon every other Conqueſt, we have made, <hi>or may make,</hi> in other Parts of the World, as Inſtruments put into our Hands by Providence, to enable us to ſettle Affairs on the Continent of <hi>Europe,</hi> as advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to our Allies, as <hi>our</hi> Gratitude could wiſh, and as <hi>their</hi> Fidelity doth deſerve.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:008585_0037_102F8B428A8377A0"/>Here, then, let me change the Scene, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſettled our Affairs in <hi>Canada</hi> (would to God they were ſo ſettled at the Peace!) permit me to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh my Plan of Negotiation, by giving my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the Part we ought to act, to obtain a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Settlement of Affairs in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a great Number of Allies can make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves formidable to a common Enemy, during the Operations of the War, they are apt to ruin every Advantage they may have gained, by quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling amongſt themſelves, when they begin their Negotiations for Peace.

But when once they have dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to the Wall, and think themſelves ſure of Victory; the Jealouſies and Suſpicions, which, while the Conteſt depended, had been ſtifled, break out; every one who ſhared in the Fatigue, expects to ſhare in the Spoils; ſeparate Intereſts counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act each other; ſeparate Negotiations are ſet on Foot; till at laſt, by <hi>untimely</hi> and <hi>mercenary</hi> Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they loſe the Fruits of their Victory, and the Object of the common Reſentment is able to make Terms for himſelf <note n="†" place="bottom">The true Hiſtory of the Tranſaction here alluded to, may, poſſibly ſome Time or other, appear; though, as yet, we are perſuaded, the World knows very little of it.</note>. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

even tho' there had not been a Party in <hi>England,</hi> who to gratify their private Reſentments, blew up the Coals of Diſſention) gave the <hi>French</hi> the Means of procuring more favourable Terms of Peace, than they could well have hoped after ſo unſucceſsful a War.</p>
            <p>I have mentioned this with a View to obſerve, that the Circumſtances of the preſent War on the Continent are very different; no ſuch unfortunate Diſunion ſeems poſſible to happen to us though it may happen amongſt the Confederates who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged on the ſame Side with <hi>France,</hi> againſt <hi>Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> and the King of <hi>Pruſſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be collected from more than one Hint dropt in the Courſe of this Letter, that I am no Friend to <hi>Continental Meaſures</hi> in general; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch continental Meaſures as engaged us dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the three laſt Wars, as Principals; when we ſeemed eager to ruin ourſelves, in Support of that <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family whom we now find, with unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled Ingratitude, and incredible Folly, in cloſe Alliance with <hi>France.</hi>— But the <hi>Continental Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> now adopted by <hi>England</hi> were <hi>neceſſary,</hi> both with Regard to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Our Honour and our Intereſt. <hi>Hanover</hi> has been attacked by <hi>France,</hi> on a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel entirely <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and tho' Care was taken, by the Act of Settlement, that <hi>England</hi> ſhould not be involved in Wars on Account of <hi>Hanover</hi>; yet Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, Honour, the Reputation of our Country, every Motive of Generoſity, bound us, not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the innocent Electorate to be ruined for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s <hi>American</hi> Quarrel with <hi>France.</hi> In Regard to our Intereſt, no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſter, however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, in his Attachment to his native Country, could have deviſed the Means of making the beſt Uſe of our <hi>American</hi> Conqueſts, if the <hi>French</hi> could have treated with <hi>Hanover</hi> in their Hands. It was
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:008585_0039_102F8B46E5E6C628"/>
with a View to prevent this, to oppoſe the <hi>French</hi> in their Projects in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Succeſs of which would have been ſo detrimental to <hi>England,</hi> that we <hi>honeſtly</hi> and <hi>wiſely</hi> have formed and have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Army <hi>now</hi> commanded by Prince <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>; and have entered into an Alliance with the King of <hi>Pruſſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' this was a Meaſure of Prudence, it was ſcarcely poſſible for the wiſeſt Stateſmen to foreſee all thoſe great Conſequences which it hath already produced. The Efforts which the <hi>French</hi> have made in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Reſiſtance they have there met with by the Care of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Adminiſtration; have contributed more than perhaps we could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, to our Succeſs in <hi>America,</hi> and other Parts of the World. Full of the Project of conquering <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover, France</hi> ſaw herſelf obliged to engage in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Expences; Armies were to be paid, and maintained in <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> and on the <hi>Rhine</hi>; vaſt Sums were to be advanced to the Court of <hi>Vienna</hi> always as indigent as it is haughty; the ravenous <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> and the degenerate <hi>Swedes,</hi> would not move, unleſs allured by Subſidies; and the Mouth of every hungry <hi>German</hi> Prince was to be ſtopt, with the <hi>Louis D'ors</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> Involved in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences thus enormous, our Enemies have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from ſtrengthening themſelves at Sea, where <hi>England</hi> had moſt Reaſon to dread their becoming ſtrong.</p>
            <p>The infinite Advantages which this Nation hath reaped from the <hi>German</hi> War, are indeed now ſo ſo well underſtood, that we have ſeen the greateſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of this <hi>Meaſure</hi> acknowledge their Miſtake.</p>
            <p>They now confeſs that if we had not reſiſted <hi>France,</hi> in her Projects of <hi>German</hi> Conqueſts, her beſt Troops had not been deſtroyed; her own Coaſts would have been better protected; ſhe would

In a Word, that univerſal Bankruptcy, which hath crowned the Diſtreſſes of <hi>France,</hi> and gives <hi>England</hi> greater Reaſon of Exultation, than any Event of the War, might have been prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is entirely owing to the <hi>German</hi> Part of the War that <hi>France</hi> appears thus low in the political Scale of Strength and Riches; that ſhe is found to be a ſinking Monarchy, nay a Monarchy already ſunk. And, perhaps, it might be an Inquiry worthy of another <hi>Monteſquieu,</hi> to aſſign the <hi>Cauſes of the Riſe and Fall</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy; and to point out thoſe ſilent Principles of Decay which have, in our Times, made ſo rapid a Progreſs, that <hi>France,</hi> in 1712, after upwards of twenty Years, almoſt conſtant War, maintained againſt all <hi>Europe,</hi> was ſtill more reſpectable, and leſs exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than ſhe now appears to be, when the <hi>ſingle</hi> Arm of <hi>Great Britain</hi> is lifted up againſt her, and the War has laſted no more than three or four Years.</p>

            <p>But, if contrary to our Hopes, our Wiſhes, our Endeavours, this ſhould fail; if his <hi>Pruſſian</hi> Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, like a Lion caught in the Toils (after a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance already made, which will hand him down to Poſterity as the greateſt of Men) ſhould at laſt be unable to defend himſelf; let him not deſpair while he is in Alliance with <hi>Britain:</hi> For I would inculcate a Doctrine, which I think will not be

            <p>Perhaps my Notions on this Subject may ſeem to border on Enthuſiaſm; but, however, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be perſuaded, that Things are come to that Paſs in <hi>Germany,</hi> that the Ruin of the King of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> will be ſoon followed by the Ruin of the Proteſtant Religion in the Empire. The blind Zeal of the bigotted <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family will have no Check, if the Head and Protector of the <hi>German</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants be deſtroyed; and the War begun only to wreſt <hi>Sileſia</hi> from him, will, in the End, be found to be a War that will overturn the Liberties and Religion of <hi>Germany.</hi> If, therefore, the noble Perſeverance of the King of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> deſerves the Eſteem of a generous People; if his Fidelity to his Engagements, which has contributed to ſave <hi>Hanover</hi> and to ruin <hi>France,</hi> can demand our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; if the Danger of the only Proteſtant So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign in <hi>Germany,</hi> able to preſerve the Privileges of his Religion from being trampled under Foot, can call forth the warm Support of this Proteſtant Nation; may I not hope, may I not be confident, that our Miniſters will dictate, and our People approve, of Terms of Peace in his Favour, though they ſhould be purchaſed by relinquiſhing ſome of our Conqueſts; while the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Canada</hi> will be ſo reaſonable a Bound to the Demands we may make for ourſelves?</p>

            <p>I have, now, nearly executed my principal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, in the preſent Addreſs; which was to give my Thoughts on the important Buſineſs of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Treaty.

            <p>But amidſt the ſignal Succeſſes of our Arms, which give us ſo reaſonable an Expectation of an honourable Peace, and have exalted our Country to the higheſt Pinnacle of Glory and Reputation abroad—I wiſh it could be ſaid that our <hi>Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was not greatly in Danger of being hurt, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt loſt, at <hi>Home.</hi>—I ſhall beg Leave to take this Occaſion of touching this equally melancholy and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Subject; with a View, not to blame, but to lament; not to bring any railing Accuſation againſt thoſe who are now in Power, but to exhort and to excite them to endeavour, before it be too late, to add to the Services they have done their Country, in ſaving it from the open Attacks of <hi>France,</hi> the ſtill more important Service of ſaving our Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which ſome unhappy Circumſtances of our preſent Situation have already greatly changed, and ſeem to threaten with entire Deſtruction;—Nay, I may ſay, would have actually deſtroyed, if it were not for the good Heart of our gracious Sovereign, who ſcorns to take Advantage.</p>
            <p>Conſiderably above an hundred Millions of Debt, the Sum we muſt be obliged to ſit down with, at the End of the preſent War, is the Burthen which, however immenſe, Experience has taught us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Theory, we ſhall be able to bear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Bankruptcy.</hi> As our Expences have increaſed, we have found, contrary to the Predictions of gloomy Politicians, that our Abilities to bear them have increaſed alſo.—But tho' our Debts be not too great for the Riches of our Country, they are much too great for the Independency of its Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. For, when I conſider the infinite Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the Crown, created by Means of Them, throughout the Kingdom, amongſt all Degrees of

Men; when I reflect on the many Thouſands of Placemen, of every Denomination, who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Collection of the vaſt Variety of Taxes now levied on the Public; and take a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of a far greater Number of Servants of the Crown, both Civil and Military, for whoſe Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſo conſiderable a Share of the public Revenue is ſet apart, too many of whom, I fear, might be tempted to aſſiſt in extending the Influence of the Prerogative to the Prejudice of public Liberty; when I conſider our vaſt Load of Taxes, in this Point of View, I cannot help obſerving the amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Revolution in our Government which this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <hi>Article</hi> has brought about; nor enough lament the unhappy Circumſtances of Affairs, and the Neceſſities of the War which have forced us to an annual Expence, unknown to former Times, and which will almoſt be incredible to Poſterity. I believe I can venture to ſay upon Memory, that the Expences of the War, for all King <hi>William</hi>'s Reign, about 13 Years, were not, at a Medium, above 3 Millions and a half a Year; and Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s, tho' the laſt Years were exorbitant, were little more than 5 Millions.

               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:008585_0047_102F8B5E1F2528E8"/>I am old enough to remember what Uneaſineſs and Jealouſies diſturbed the Minds of all true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, with regard to ſtanding Armies, and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Eſtabliſhments. Principles of Liberty in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and, in particular, Whig Principles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> excited this Uneaſineſs, and produced thoſe Jealouſies, which from Time to Time, have been a fruitful Source of Parliamentary Debate. It was no longer ago than the late King's Time, that the veſting <hi>Courts Martial,</hi> in Time of Peace, with the Power of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing <hi>Mutiny</hi> and <hi>Deſertion</hi> with <hi>Death,</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Houſe of Commons by a ſmall Majority<note n="†" place="bottom">In 1717-18 the Numbers on the Diviſion were 247 to 229.</note>. Nay, that a Court Martial, however limited in its Juriſdiction, was inconſiſtent with the Liberties of a free People, in Time of Peace, was the Doctrine of Whigs in thoſe Days; it was the Doctrine, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, of Sir <hi>Robert Walpole</hi> then in Oppoſition; whoſe remarkable Expreſſion, in this great Debate,
<q>That they who gave the <hi>Power of Blood, gave Blood,</hi> never can be forgotten.</q>
And though afterwards when he became to be a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> he was better reconciled to ſtanding Armies and Mutiny Bills, in Time of Peace, <hi>ſeventeen</hi> Thouſand Men, was all the Army he <hi>durſt</hi> aſk; yet even that Demand produced an <hi>annual</hi> Debate; and the <hi>annual</hi> Reaſon, on which he founded the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his Demand—being the Danger from the Pretender and the Jacobites; was the ſtrongeſt Proof, that even in Sir <hi>R.

<pb n="46" facs="unknown:008585_0048_102F8B5FB03E76C0"/>
is neceſſary: But what I lament is to ſee the Sentiments of the Nation ſo amazingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Proſpect of having a far more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Body of regular Troops, kept up, after the Peace, than any true Lover of his Country in former Times thought, could be allowed without endangering the Conſtitution. Nay, ſo unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably fond are we become of the military Plan, that the Erection of Barracks, which, twenty Years ago, would have ruined any Miniſter who ſhould have ventured to propoſe it, may be propoſed ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by our Miniſters now a-Days, and, upon Trial, be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound to be a favourite Meaſure with our Patriots, and with the Public in general.</p>
            <p>But what I lament as the greateſt Misfortune that can threaten the public Liberty, is to ſee the Eagerneſs with which our Nobility, born to be the Guardians of the Conſtitution againſt Prerogative, ſollicit the Badge of <hi>military</hi> Subjection, not meerly to ſerve their Country, in Times of Danger, which would be commendable, but in Expectation to be continued <hi>Soldiers,</hi> when Tranquility ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and to be under <hi>military Command,</hi> during Life. When I ſee this ſtrange, but melancholy Infatuation, ſo prevalent, I almoſt deſpair of the Conſtitution. If it ſhould go on in Proportion as it has of late, I fear the Time will, at laſt, come, when Independence on the Crown, will be exploded as unfaſhionable. Unleſs another Spirit poſſeſs our Nobility; unleſs they lay aſide their Military Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings; and think that they can ſerve their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try more effectually as Senators than as Soldiers, what can we expect but to ſee, the Syſtem of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Subordination extending itſelf throughout the Kingdom, univerſal Dependence upon Government influencing every Rank of Men, and the Spirit,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:008585_0049_102F8B614D7BACE8"/>
nay, the very Form of the Conſtitution deſtroyed? We have generally beaten the <hi>French,</hi> and always been fooliſh enough to follow their Faſhions; I was in Hopes we ſhould never have taken the Faſhion of <hi>French</hi> Government; but from our numerous Armies, and the military Turn of our Nobility, I am afraid we are running into it as faſt as we can. And, unleſs ſomething can be done, to bring back our Conſtitution to its firſt Principles, we ſhall find that we have triumphed, only to make ourſelves as wretched as our Enemy; that our Conqueſts are but a poor Compenſation for the Loſs of our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; in a Word, that, like <hi>Wolfe,</hi> falling in the Arms of Victory, we are moſt gloriouſly—<hi>undone!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though I have drawn ſo melancholy a Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of the Dangers which threaten us with the Loſs of our Liberties, it is with no other Deſign, than to exhort thoſe who are placed at the Helm, to ſet about the Repairs of our ſhattered Veſſel, as ſoon as ſhe can be brought ſafe into Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. After the Peace is once ſettled, it ought to be the great Object of our Miniſters, to deviſe every Expedient, and to adapt every Plan, that may extricate this unhappy Conſtitution from the Dangers I have deſcribed. Conſidering the low Ebb of <hi>France,</hi> we have ſome Reaſon to hope that when Peace is once reſtored, upon ſolid Terms, it will not ſoon be interrupted. Much, therefore, may be done during thoſe Years of Tranquility; if our Miniſters be diligent and faithful in this great Work of reviving the Conſtitution. The ſacred and inviolable Application of the <hi>Sinking Fund,</hi> which the Increaſe of our Trade, and other Circumſtances, have ſo greatly augmented, and muſt ſtill augment, will operate gradually, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually. Univerſal and unvariable Oeconomy,

muſt be introduced into every Branch of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Revenues of the Kingdom may be vaſtly increaſed by adopting Schemes that will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Frauds, and leſſen the Expence of Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; innumerable unneceſſary Places may be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and exorbitant Perquiſites, in thoſe we leave, may be reſtrained; Attention muſt be had to the Morals and Principles of the Nation, and the Revival of Virtue and of Religion will go Hand in Hand, with the Revival of Liberty. But no Object will deſerve more Attention, than our Military En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments on Conſtitutional Independence. When this War ſhall be over, there will be leſs Reaſon, than ever, for numerous Armies. The Kingdom now happily being united, and Diſaffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Royal Family at an End, we need fear no Rebellions among ourſelves; and Invaſions from <hi>France</hi> are leſs likely than ever. Beſides, by the Care and Perſeverance of ſome Patriots, we have acquired a new internal Strength, a Militia trained up to be uſeful, and conſequently, we may without any Danger to the Public, reduce the Number of our Guards and Garriſons, ſo low, as to deſtroy great Part of the huge Fabrick of Military Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Dependence. But whatever you do, if you mean to reſtore the Conſtitution, you muſt ſecure the Dignity and Independence of Parliament. After paſſing ſuch Laws as may ſtill be neceſſary to preſerve the Freedom of Elections, from Influence of every Sort; to puniſh Bribery both in the <hi>Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> and in the <hi>Elected</hi>; ſomething, perhaps, may ſtill be done by Way of Place-bill, to leſſen Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Influence over Parliaments, without having Recourſe to an <hi>Oliverian</hi> Self-<hi>denying</hi> Ordinance; or to ſo total an Excluſion of Placemen, as was eſtabliſhed, in the original Act of Settlement.</p>

perhaps, this laſt Opportunity of ſaving <hi>Britiſh</hi> Liberty, and Independence, be thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. You, <hi>My Lord,</hi> whoſe Rank, whoſe exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Influence, and perſonal Authority, have given you the Pre-eminence, in public Affairs, as it were by Preſcription; much will depend upon you, in the carrying on this important Work. But when I direct my Addreſs to you, <hi>Sir,</hi> you muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that beſides the general Expectations we have from you, as a Lover of your Country, we have your own repeated Promiſes and Declarations, to make us flatter ourſelves that you will not ſtop ſhort, in your Schemes of national Reformation. Not tutored in the School of Corruption, but liſted, from your earlieſt Years, under the Banner of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm; called into Power, by popular Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtill uniting, the uncommon Characters of <hi>Miniſter</hi> and <hi>Patriot</hi>; Favourite of the Publick, and Servant of the Crown; be not offended, <hi>Sir,</hi> if I remind you, not to diſappoint that Confidence the Public places in your future Endeavours to prop the ſinking Conſtitution. Nor let it ever fall from your Memory, that the Nation expects from your Virtue, your Oeconomy, your Plans for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, during the future Peace, as great Advantages as we have already gained, from your Spirit, your bold Councils, and vigorous Efforts, in carrying on the preſent War.</p>
            <p>Perhaps I grow too warm, on a favourite Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and, therefore, from Schemes which cannot take Effect, till the War be cloſed, let me turn your Attention again, for a little While longer, to the Object immediately before our Eyes—the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Conferences for Peace. And, with Regard to theſe, though I ſuppoſe, they will <hi>begin</hi> before the Winter be over, I think there is ſome Reaſon for being of Opinion that we muſt have another
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:008585_0053_102F8ACFB9623B38"/>
Campaign, before they can be finally cloſed. <hi>France</hi> is too low, to think ſeriouſly of a Peace, without making ſome deſperate Effort. She never would have expoſed her Weakneſs to all <hi>Europe,</hi> by ſo ſhameful and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>umbling a Bankruptcy; She never would have ruined her public Credit, and melted her Plate, the laſt Reſource, when every other has been exhauſted, only to receive Terms from <hi>England.</hi> No, ſhe knows ſhe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, for ever, if ſhe gets no Footing in <hi>Hanover</hi>; and, therefore, we may expect to ſee another At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt made for that Purpoſe. But, if we are not wanting to ourſelves, another Attempt, will end, as unfortunately for her, as the former have done; and her Ruin only be more confirmed. In the mean While, I make no Doubt, the Plenipotentiaries will meet at a Congreſs; but the Events of the Field, muſt regulate the Deliberations of the Cabinet. We, no Doubt, ſhall be <hi>firm</hi> in our Demands, <hi>whatever they are</hi>; and the <hi>French</hi> will endeavour to gain Time, to know whether there is any Likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of obliging us to offer them <hi>better.</hi> In this Situation, then, <hi>France</hi> muſt hear with Terror, that without breaking our national Faith, without injuring private Property, without giving exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Premiums, we have already provided <hi>immenſely</hi> for the Supplies of <hi>another</hi> Year (and Supplies for <hi>Years</hi> may ſtill be had) to meet them;—not in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>; there they are no more;—not on the <hi>Ocean</hi>— the Deſtruction of their Fleets leaves that Empire free to us—but once more, on the Plains of another <hi>Minden,</hi> again to feel and to confeſs the Superiority of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Valour.</p>
            <p>I have only a Particular or two, to add, before I conclude. And I cannot help congratulating the Public, on the Wiſdom of our Manner of Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Negotiation for Peace. I mean to obſerve,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:008585_0054_102F8AD279DCF530"/>
that our Miniſters have happily got rid of a ſet of very <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> or very <hi>pernicious</hi> Gentlemen called <hi>Mediators,</hi> by applying directly to the Enemy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Nothing can be more ridiculous than the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Nuncio, and the Ambaſſador of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Inſignificant</hi> Powers is therefore abſurd; and the Danger of calling in a <hi>powerful</hi> Mediator, who may threaten to declare againſt you, if you do not ſubmit to his <hi>partial</hi> Deciſions, is too obvious to be inſiſted upon. You have done wiſely, therefore, to keep the Negotiation in your own Hands; the Nation, from this Inſtance, has a full Confidence that her Intereſts are ſkilfully conducted; and, therefore, I ſhall only add, another Particular, which however ſubordinate, will, no Doubt, be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to by you; though <hi>ſome late</hi> Negotiators of ours, with <hi>France,</hi> neglected it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French,</hi> by taking the Lead in <hi>Europe</hi> of late, have, of Courſe, been able to introduce their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in all public Negotiations; ſo that, perhaps, the <hi>French</hi> is the only Tongue, by the Channel of which Plenipotentiaries and Miniſters of different Countries, can converſe. But when the Negotiation is to be put into Writing, to be drawn up in that Form which is to be binding upon all the Parties, and ſigned jointly by the treating Powers, neither the Honour, nor the Intereſt of the State, ought to allow us, to accept of the Original Treaty in the <hi>Native Tongue</hi> of our Enemies. The Honour of the Nation forbids this; as it would be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Superiority, to which <hi>Britain,</hi> at no Time, much leſs after ſo glorious a War, ſhould ſubmit; eſpecially as we cannot ſubmit to it, without giving the Enemy a real Advantage, and laying the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

for future Cavils.—Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> in his Letters, boaſts, that by a latent Ambiguity and Nicety in the <hi>French</hi> Stile, he had been able to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit <hi>Don Louis de Haro,</hi> in the Conferences at the <hi>Pyren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note>, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> believed, when they accepted of the Capitulation, was ſoon after interpreted by <hi>France,</hi> as tying them up from acting in any Part of the World; and might have been fatal to this Country, if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to aſſiſt in quelling which the <hi>Dutch</hi> lent us thoſe very Troops, had been ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, as to oblige us, to put our foreign Allies to the Teſt.</p>
            <p>We have no great Reaſon, no more than other Nations, to truſt <hi>Gallic Faith,</hi> as appears from the many Inſtances of their <hi>unp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let us not, therefore, be ſo weak as to give them Room for obtruding upon us, any fallacious Interpretations of the Words, in which they plight their Faith. They are too ready to break it when the Terms are ever ſo clear; and, therefore, let us take Care not to give them that Advantage which ſuperior Skill in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, naturally confers, and which upon ſome future Occaſion, they may improve to our Detriment.

Let the <hi>original and authentic</hi> Copy of the Treaty, therefore, be in a dead Language, the Phraſes of which cannot vary, and whoſe Meaning is equally underſtood by both Parties. We had once a very learned Plenipotentiary in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Time, who, in a Negotiation with <hi>Spain,</hi> when it came to be debated in what Language the Treaty ſhould be made, ludicrouſly enough propoſed to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> who was giving himſelf Airs of Superiority, to treat in the Language of his Maſter's Kingdom of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But, leaving the <hi>Hebrew</hi> for our Divines, I would only have our Negotiators treat in <hi>Latin:</hi> Which ſeemed, as it were by Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to have a Right to be the Language of the Public Law of <hi>Europe</hi>; till ſome late<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inſtances have ſhewn that the <hi>French</hi> was beginning to be ſubſtituted in its Room; by the Lazineſs or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of thoſe who treated. As we are ſanguine in our Hopes of a much better Peace than we had at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> with Regard to the Terms, let it not be worſe than that at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> which preſerved the Old Cuſtom of ſettling the Negotiation in <hi>Latin.</hi> We then had a Biſhop indeed, as Plenipotentiary; but without having Recourſe to the very learned Bench, or chooſing a Plenipotentiary from <hi>Cambridge</hi> (I hope in a little Time one may join the other U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity without giving Offence) the Negotiators at the enſuing Peace, may be accommodated with <hi>Latin</hi> enough for the Purpoſe I mention, at a very moderate Expence—If their Secretary or Chaplain cannot aſſiſt them.</p>
            <p>But when I begin to be ludicrous on ſo ſerious a Subject, it is Time to have done: And my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs has already ſwelled to ſuch a Size as ſurprizes myſelf, as much, as I fear it will tire the Reader. However, the vaſt Variety of Facts and Particulars which naturally offered themſelves to me, and which
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:008585_0057_102F8AD97B1F3160"/>
could not be omitted without hurting the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, and weakning my Argument, will, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, procure Indulgence for ſo long a Pamphlet: And, for the ſame Reaſon, I flatter myſelf, that if I ſhould happen to have been miſtaken in any Thing I advance, to have erred in a Date, or to have miſquoted a Treaty, ſome Allowances will be made to me, as I have been obliged to truſt much to my Memory, for Want of a proper Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſulting many of thoſe Books, which fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Materials I have made uſe of. However, I believe a candid Reader will find no <hi>capital,</hi> at leaſt, no <hi>wilful,</hi> Miſtake.</p>
            <p>I am far from the Vanity of thinking that my Notions on the important Subject of the Peace, are a regular Plan or Syſtem for the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to proceed upon. I throw them out, only as looſe Hints for my <hi>Superiors,</hi> to improve as they may think proper. Should there be any Weight in all, or any of them, you, <hi>My Lord</hi> and <hi>Sir,</hi> will be able to work them into Utility for this Kingdom.

He reflected upon his Youth; and obſerved that the Diſcovery of Truth was very little promoted by pompous Diction and theatrical Emotion, Theſe Inſinuations expoſed him to a ſevere Reply. Mr. PITT, ſtanding up again, ſaid
<q>He would not undertake to determine whether Youth could be juſtly imputed to any Man as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach: But he affirmed, that the Wretch, who, after having ſeen the Conſequences of repeated Errors, continues ſtill to blunder, and whoſe Age has only added Obſtinacy to Stupidity, is ſurely the Object of either Abhorrence or Contempt, and deſerves not that his grey Head ſhould ſecure him from Inſults.
