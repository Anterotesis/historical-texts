         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>RITING is a Talent which, of all Things, I never made any Pretenſions to, and little thought of giving at this Time the Publick an Account of my Practice; but being again importuned thereto, by a great and worthy Phyſician, and having alſo received a Meſſage from a ſuperior Perſon, that an Account of my Succeſs of inoculating the Small-Pox in <hi>New-England</hi> might be grateful, as being of great uſe, and beneficial to the Publick, I eſteem'd it as the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Obligation upon me ſo to do, and in Compliance to that Command I have done it faithfully. If I had propoſed any Advantage to my ſelf, in the Practice here, I ſhould have done it above a Year paſt, at my Arrival in <hi>London,</hi> and not now at my returning home. And I have given this Account with the greater Chearfulneſs, in hope, that my Mite may influence ſome few at leaſt to ſave their Lives this Way, ſeeing, from Time to Time, in the Weekly Bills, Numbers who died of the Small-Pox, and hearing of but few who have had the Benefit of Inoculation, compar'd with the others in the natural Way, notwithſtanding the many and handſome Accounts which have been given the Publick, greatly in Favour of this Practice.</p>
            <p>And it may be of ſome Service, was it only on Account of the great Proportion of Adult Perſons, and others advanced in Years, to whom the Small-Pox, in the natural Way,
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003259_0009_0FF02D342EBA8640"/>has been moſt fatal: And yet from my Experience, I may be allow'd to ſay, that even ſuch have a very fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of paſſing well thro' that Diſtemper by Inoculation.</p>
            <p>I began the Practice indeed from a ſhort Conſideration thereof; for my Children, whoſe Lives were very dear to me, were daily in danger of taking the Infection, by my viſiting the Sick in the natural Way; and although there aroſe ſuch a Cloud of Oppoſers at the Beginning, yet finding my Account in the Succeſs, and eaſy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of my Patients, (with the Encouragement of the good Miniſters) I reſolv'd to carry it on for the ſaving of Lives, not regarding any, or all the Menaces, and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that were made againſt it.</p>
            <p>I have not, in this Practice, left room for any one to cavil, and ſay, that my Experiments have not been fair, and full Proofs, that inoculating the Small-Pox is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Means of moderating that Diſtemper, to the greateſt Demonſtration. This, the warmeſt Oppoſers of that Practice, who have ſeen my fair Trials made, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of; and the only Difficulty of convincing all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is how to make them Eye-witneſſes to a Number ſick of the Small-Pox in both ways of Infection; and this would do it at once, and very much to their Satisfaction in, and Approbation of this Method. And here it ſhould be conſidered how raſhly our Patients, even whole Families together, ruſhed into this Practice, without any Phyſical Preparation, or other needful Proviſion, eſpecially in ſuch a cold Seaſon as <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> being convinced of the Succeſs of this Method: There was no withſtanding them: I muſt inoculate all, without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, they being in danger of having the Diſtemper in the natural way. In <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> indeed, we inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated none, and but few in the Summer Seaſon. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this Practice from the <hi>Levant</hi> comes recommended to be made uſe of in the Winter as the moſt proper Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; yet I did not find it to ſucceed ſo well, and prove ſo gentle with us in the pinching cold, as in the temperate and hotter Seaſons of the Year.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:003259_0010_0FF02D7C5B4F8FD8"/>I have not uſed this Practice only to the healthful and ſtrong, but to the weak and diſeaſed, the aged and the young: Not only to the rich, but have carried it into the houſes of the poor, and laid down whole Families; and tho' thro' my own Hurry in Buſineſs, and their living out of Town, I have been forced to leave them to the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of unexperienced Nurſes, yet they all did well.</p>
            <p>And as to thoſe ſix who died under Inoculation, I would obſerve that Mrs. <hi>Dixwell,</hi> we have great Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, was infected before. Mr. <hi>White,</hi> thro' ſplenetic Deluſions, died rather from Abſtinence than the Small-Pox. Mrs. <hi>Scarbrough</hi> and the <hi>Indian</hi> Girl died of Accidents, by taking cold. Mrs. <hi>Wells</hi> and <hi>Searle</hi> were Perſons worn out with Age and Diſeaſes, and very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe two were infected before. Neither can it be ſaid, that there was one ſound and healthful Perſon amongſt them.</p>
            <p>We met with no ſuch terrible Effects (ſave that Death is terrible in all its Shapes) from the Small-Pox inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, as was common amongſt us in the natural way, <hi>viz.</hi> Purple Spots, Convulſion Fits, bloody Urine, violent Inflammations in the Eyes, Throat, and other Parts, ſcarr'd Faces, ſome who had loſt both Eyes, and, as it has been thought, near an hundred one Eye, with many more melancholy Symptoms too tedious here to enumerate; not to mention Parents being left Childleſs, Children without Parents, and ſometimes Parents and Children's being both carried off, and many Families broken up by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction the Small-Pox made in the natural way. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, we had ſome Reſemblance of thoſe Effects; but in none where it was not evident, that they were infected in the natural way before; and tho' we met with but five or ſix caſes that bordered on, or reſembled more or leſs thoſe Symptoms, yet it would not have been ſtrange had there been ſix times that Number; for in <hi>Boſton,</hi> and in the middle of <hi>Roxbury,</hi> no one knew who were, or who were not infected, before inoculated; and I verily believe that twenty five, if not thirty of my Patients were infected before inoculated: And this Reaſon I can give for every
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:003259_0011_0FF02D38D778C230"/>one's believing ſo, that in all and every one whom I Inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and that had not been expos'd to an infected Air, and which were above one hundred, not any of them had the leaſt Shadow of ſuch Symptoms upon them, thro' the whole Courſe of their Diſtemper. However, I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend this Practice to be carry'd on and manag'd by old Women and Nurſes; no, I would have it carry'd on and manag'd by good Phyſicians and Surgeons, where they are to be had; but rather than the People ſhould be left a Prey to the Small-Pox in the natural Way, let it be manag'd by Nurſes, for I cannot help thinking that even in their Hands, many leſs would die of the Small-Pox by Inoculation, than there does in the natural Way, tho' in the beſt of Hands, and under the beſt of Care.</p>
            <p>And for thoſe that have not yet come into this Practice, for their Aſſiſtance, until they have gain'd better Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I have given ſome ſhort Directions how they may proceed with their Patients, when they begin this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of inoculating the Small-Pox. And if what I have done, in giving this Account, may (with the Labour and Pains which has been taken by many worthy Gentlemen on this Head) contribute to the leading People into a Method for ſaving their Lives, and their Bodies from many other Miſeries that do frequently attend thoſe that have the natural Small-Pox; I ſhall obtain my End, and the World will have the Benefit.</p>
            <p>I ought to apologize, and ask Pardon of my good Friends in <hi>New England,</hi> for this Liberty I have taken, of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing their Names, Ages, and Caſes, without their leave, more eſpecially the young Ladies. And when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how difficult a thing it is, to ſet Truth in a clear Light in this Caſe to the Satisfaction of an unbelieving World; and how much room there wou'd have been left to thoſe who are not willing to believe, and that are Wranglers againſt this Practice, to have ſlighted, and argued againſt the Truth and Validity of theſe Accounts, were it not for thoſe Particulars; for I muſt ſtand or fall by theſe Accounts,: I ſay, when they conſider that it was done for the good of Mankind, they will forgive
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:003259_0012_0FF02D7E160BA188"/>me, and upon that Account only I hope and deſire to be forgiven.</p>
            <p>I do not call upon or exhort the Phyſicians and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons who are already in the Practice, and have uſed their Endeavours to promote it, nor do I pretend to inform or inſtruct them. My Deſign is only to ſtir up thoſe who have not yet come into and uſed this Method, and to lay before the People a fair ſtate of the Diſtemper in both ways of Infection, that they may be appriz'd of the danger in the one, and the reaſonable Expectation they have of doing well in the other. My Reaſonings and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions I ſubmit to thoſe of better Judgment, but as we are rational Creatures, we do, or ſhould delight in acting upon Principles of Reaſon; and thoſe who conſider this Method, and make uſe of it, I think may be ſaid ſo to act.</p>
            <p>I hope the Reader will excuſe me for troubling him with ſome of the Difficulties that I met with. I have been baſely us'd and treated by ſome who were Enemies to this Method, and have ſuffered much in my Reputation and in my Buſineſs too, from the Odiums and Reflections caſt upon me for beginning and carrying on this Practice in <hi>New England</hi>; which ill Uſage I think juſtly intitles me to make the neceſſary Reflections, and relate Matters of Fact in my own Juſtification, and to recommend and do Juſtice to the Method, which was ſo expos'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by their Miſrepreſentations, which have been ſpread abroad in the World; and to ſet things in a good Light, that the World may impartially judge between the Parties (if I may be allow'd the Term) which of the two have acted moſt like Men and Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe who have oppos'd and exclaim'd againſt this Method without due Conſideration of, or knowing ſcarce any thing about it; or thoſe who have conſider'd well, been in the Practice of, and have prov'd by their own Experience, or that have ſeen the good Effects and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it, and from ſuch Reaſons have recommended it to others?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:003259_0013_0FF02D3BC6CD8808"/>Indeed I can eaſily forgive and pity thoſe who thro' Tenderneſs, or in Point of Conſcience, have refuſed the offer'd Mercy, and that have gently appear'd againſt it: Such, with the Aſſiſtance of a Divine, together with the Exerciſe of their own Reaſon upon it, may eaſily get thro' their Difficulties. But for thoſe who out of private Piques, or Views, have exclaim'd and railed againſt it, and who have trumpt up the groundleſs ill Conſequences that would attend or follow it: Such I leave to ſweat it out with juſt Reflection and due Repentance. As for my own Part, I know of no better Way of judging between moral and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral Methods of Medical Practice, than from the good or ill Succeſs that does, or may attend them.</p>
            <p>I have, for Diſtinction ſake, call'd the Small-Pox taken in the Air (only) natural; tho' I know not any Reaſon why that by Inoculation may not be call'd ſo too, for I think the diſtinct, in either Way, to be the moſt genuine Effect of Nature; and the Difference between them ſeems only to be, as in that of improving Plants, the one is propagated by Nature accidentally, and the other by Nature with Induſtry, with Intent to make them better. The one is called wild, the other tame, or improv'd; and as the Ground is good or bad, ſo will the Plant or Fruit be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, more or leſs: So it will be in the Small-Pox tranſplanted. Forgive me this Compariſon, it may not hold good in ſtrict Philoſophy. None of our inoculated Patients afterward took the Small-Pox, tho' they were continually expos'd. I make this Obſervation leſt the Queſtion ſhould be asked, tho' I think it high Time that groundleſs Scruples ſhould be laid aſide.</p>
            <p>There is a large Field open for much to be ſaid by the Ingenious and Learned in Praiſe of this Method, and I hope, good Improvement will be made in, and by it.</p>

Dr. <hi>Mather,</hi> in Compaſſion to the Lives of the People, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd from the Philoſophical Tranſactions of the Royal Society, the Accounts ſent them by Dr. <hi>Timonius</hi> and <hi>Pyllarinus</hi> of inoculating the Small-Pox in the <hi>Levant,</hi> and ſent them to the Practitioners of the Town, for their Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereon.

               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">J</seg>UNE</hi> the 26th, 1721. I inoculated my Son <hi>Thomas,</hi> of about ſix, my Negro Man, <hi>Jack,</hi> thirty ſix, and <hi>Jackey,</hi> two and an half Years old. They all complain'd on the 6th Day; upon the 7th, the two Children were a little hot, dull and ſleepy, <hi>Thomas</hi> (only) had twitchings and ſtarted in his ſleep. The 8th, the Childrens Fevers continued, <hi>Tommy</hi>'s twitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſtartings in ſleep increaſed; and tho' the Fever was gentle and his Senſes bright, yet as the Practice was new, and the Clamour, or rather Rage of the People againſt it ſo violent, that I was put into a very great Fright; and not having any Directions from Dr. <hi>Timonius</hi> and <hi>Pyllarinus</hi> concerning this Practice, I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to have Recourſe to but Patience, and therefore waited upon Nature for a Criſis (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Fears nor the Symptoms abating) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the 9th; when early in the Morning I gave him a Vomit, upon which the Symptoms went off, and the ſame Day, upon him and the black Child, a kind and favourable Small-Pox came out, of about an hundred a piece; after which their Circumſtances became eaſy, our Trouble was over, and they ſoon were well.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:003259_0016_0FF02D81F6168AD8"/>
                  <hi>Jack's</hi> Complaints, in two or three Days were over, and tho' he had but a few Puſtles about one of his Inoculations, I am inclin'd to think he had had the Small-Pox before.</p>
               <p>It was plain and eaſy to ſee, (even in theſe two) with Pleaſure, the difference between ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Small-Pox this way, and that of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it in the natural way.</p>
               <p>And as this Practice was new in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo it muſt needs make a ſtrange Figure in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and more eſpecially ſo when one or two of our learned <hi>Eſculapian</hi> Tribe had made the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery how this Practice wou'd produce the Plague <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe <hi>Timonius</hi> told them that it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen'd that Swellings were produc'd by it in ſome Emunctory of the Body; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they cavilled and ſaid, that Dr. <hi>Mather</hi> had not given a fair Repreſentation from <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Pyllarinus</hi>'s Accounts. I pray'd that they might be read; but Dr. <hi>Douglas,</hi> who own'd them, and had taken them from Dr. <hi>Mather,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to have them read, or even afterwards to lend them to the Governor to read; ſuch was his extraordinary Care, leſt the People, in time, ſhould have been reconcil'd to the Practice, and taken the Benefit of it.</p>
               <p>And upon <hi>July</hi> the 21ſt, 1721, being a third time call'd to an Account for uſing this Practice by ſome Gentlemen (influenced thereto) who bore Authority in <hi>Boſton,</hi> I then having ſeven Perſons more under Inoculation, whoſe Illneſs were not yet come on: I then gave a publick Invitation to the Practitioners of the Town
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003259_0017_0FF02D406B751F40"/>(who were then preſent) to viſit my Patients, who were under that Practice, and to judge of and report their Circumſtances as they found them. But Dr. <hi>Lawrence Dalhonde</hi>'s terrible Account (ſee the Account at the End) that he then gave of that Practice was ſuch, that none of them ſaw Cauſe to accept my Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and viſit my Patients. Inſtead of this, and reporting their Circumſtances juſtly and fairly, as it was their Duty, and the People's Right, for them to have done, ſome of them made it their Buſineſs to invent, collect, and publiſh idle, unjuſt, and ridiculous Stories and Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of the People's Circumſtances under it, and the Practice; tho' none of them had ever been concern'd for, or had ſeen one ſingle Perſon of them in their Illneſs, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Practice, to the end of it, except by Accident, ſave Mr. <hi>White</hi> once or twice, or that knew any thing of their Circumſtances, but that they ſaw them come well and early abroad after their Small-Pox. And not ſatisfy'd with ſuch unjuſt Proceedings in <hi>New-England,</hi> leſt the Truth ſhou'd be made known to <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and that our good Succeſs might influence them to uſe this Practice, <hi>Douglaſs</hi> favour'd them with his pretended wonderful Knowledge of things which he knew little of, as may be ſeen in Dr. <hi>Wagſtaff</hi>'s Book againſt Inoculation.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Dalhonde</hi>'s moſt ſurprizing Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the knowing Part of Mankind now believes as little of them as if he had ſaid that their Heads had dropt off, or that Inoculation had turn'd
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003259_0018_0FF02D84839E21D8"/>Men into Women, or any other ſtrange Tho't that might have come into his Head.</p>
               <p>I have made diligent Enquiry in <hi>England,</hi> but cou'd never meet with any one who had heard of any ſuch Practice in theſe Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> until within theſe five Years paſt, or that believes there ever was, and eſpecially in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the moſt unlikely Place to begin it in; and if began there, the moſt likely Place he could have thought of to have made it publick to the World. So that if he does not get well-atteſted Proofs from Drs. <hi>Helvetius, Bollatio,</hi> and <hi>Barre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> of the Facts, I doubt, for the future, his Affirmation will not have that Credit in the World, as an honeſt Man's ought to have.</p>
               <p>Theſe were ſome of the Oppoſitions and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties I met with in the Beginning of this Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and which was the Means of keeping out hundreds, if not thouſands, from coming into the Practice of Inoculation, which might have ſaved many valuable Lives that were loſt by the Small-Pox in the natural way, as may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appear when the Succeſs in each way is compared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> the 12th, 1721, I inoculated Mr. <hi>Joſhua Cheever,</hi> about 39 Years old. He had upon the 6th and 7th Days ſome light ſhivering and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh Turns, and upon the 8th they went off, the Scarifications being almoſt dried up, ſo that we concluded the Operation had not taken effect.</p>
               <p>On the 9th in the Evening (he being well) a Fire breaking out, he run with others to help put out the Fire, and in labouring at it, got wet
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003259_0019_0FF02D43200AAEB8"/>with Water and Sweat, return'd home very ill and full of pain, and continued ſo all Night; upon viſiting him in the Morning, I found him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſigns of a high Fever, a dry inflam'd Skin, full of Pain, with a hard and quick Pulſe, and I feared he would have had the Confluent Small Pox. He being luſty and ſtrong, I bled him largely, gave him a Vomit, and bliſter'd him, upon which the Symptoms went off, and the Small-Pox came out of a kind diſtinct Sort, and his Pains, and our Fears, were ſoon over, and in a ſhort time he was well.</p>
               <p>His Inoculations never inflam'd &amp; come to run, as is uſual, but dry'd away almoſt from the firſt.</p>
               <p>Until now, I uſed the <hi>Turky</hi> Way of ſcarify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and applying the Nut-ſhell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I ſoon left off, and made an Inciſion thro' the true Skin, and apply'd a Plaiſter over; which I found ſince to be the better Way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> the 14th, I inoculated Mr. <hi>John Helyer,</hi> of about 34, and my Negro, <hi>Moll,</hi> of 37 Years old. Mr. <hi>Helyer</hi> had the Small-Pox at the uſual time, and of a kind diſtinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle, and he ſoon was well. <hi>Moll</hi> had a ſlow Fever a Day or two, and ſome Pain, which both went off, and her Inoculation ſoon dry'd up: I ſuppoſe ſhe had had the Small-Pox before; and the Reaſon why the Negro Man and ſhe was ſo diſorder'd from Inoculation, might be from their being expos'd to the Evening and Morning Air: The Weather being hot, I did not confine them before they complain'd.</p>
               <p n="17">17th, I inoculated my Son <hi>John,</hi> about 13
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003259_0020_0FF02D861B0878A0"/>Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, a ſmall ſprinkling of a kind Sort, and the Symptoms gentle; but upon eating Milk, his Noſe bled, and he appeared feveriſh. I forbad the Milk, and both left him. He being a Lover of Milk, a Day or two after, he had Milk and Water for his Drink, upon which his Noſe bled, and fluſhing Heats return'd: After which, Milk was deny'd him, and the Symptoms went off and never return'd again. In lieu of Milk and Water, he drank Teas, which finiſh'd the Cure, and he was well.</p>
               <p n="19">19th, I inoculated Mr. <hi>John Webb,</hi> about 67, Mr. <hi>Joſeph Webb,</hi> 50, and his Wife 43 Years old. The eldeſt and youngeſt of theſe were weak infirm Perſons, they all had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of the diſtinct Sort. Mr. <hi>John Webb</hi> had an ill turn of Faintneſs and Oppreſſion of Spirits, at the coming out of the Pox; but when they were out, the Symptoms went off, and he, with the other two, paſſed gently thro' the Diſtemper, and ſoon were well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 5th, I inoculated Mr. <hi>Larabee</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Hunt,</hi> each about 30, Mrs. <hi>Eſther Webb,</hi> 19, Mr. <hi>Cheever</hi>'s Lad, 16 Years old. Three of theſe had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of a good diſtinct Sort, their Symptoms gentle, and they ſoon were well. Mrs. <hi>Eſther</hi> nurs'd her Father and Mother thro' the heighth of their Small-Pox, by Inoculation, before ſhe was inoculated; and they having it ſo very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, it was hoped that ſhe had not taken the Infection of them; but we were ſoon convinced of that Error, by her falling ſick and the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003259_0021_0FF02D4674CC76D8"/>out of the Confluent Small-Pox on the 4th or 5th Day after her Inoculation; and it was with a great deal of Care and Pains that ſhe liv'd thro' it. She alſo was reſtor'd to Health in a ſhort time after.</p>
               <p n="12">12th, I inoculated a young Gentlemen under 25 Years old, and much againſt my Inclination, this being the only Inſtance in which I was oblig'd to Secrecy.</p>
               <p>I inoculated Mr. <hi>Edward Langdon,</hi> 25, Mr. <hi>Larabee</hi>'s Servant-Man, about 18 Years old. They all three had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of a diſtinct Sort; the two laſt had but few in Number, and their Symptoms gentle. The young Gentleman had them pretty full, and (near the filling) for two Days, his Fever was brisk; but upon bleeding and the Uſe of an <hi>Anodine,</hi> the Fever went off, and he, with the other two, were ſoon recover'd to Health.</p>
               <p n="22">22d, I inoculated Mr. <hi>Samuel Valentine,</hi> about 19 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of a kind diſtinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle; and he ſoon did well.</p>
               <p n="23">23d, I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Thornton,</hi> about 21 Years old; ſhe had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, an handſome ſprinkling of a diſtinct Sort, and complained much of the Soreneſs; and her Pox continued longer on her than uſual, before they fell off and dry'd away; the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were gentle, and in a little Time ſhe was well.</p>
               <p>I inoculated Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Langdon,</hi> of about 27, my Son <hi>Zabdiel,</hi> 14, Mrs. <hi>Margaret Langdon,</hi> 20, and Mrs. <hi>Joanna Syms</hi> of 15 Years
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003259_0022_0FF02D8A4780D660"/>old. They all had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a very diſtinct Sort, their Symptoms gentle, and they ſoon were well; tho' my Son lay two Nights in an infected Chamber before inoculated.</p>
               <p n="30">30th, I inoculated Mr. <hi>John Colman,</hi> 18 Years old, and Mrs. <hi>Dixwell,</hi> about 37. Mr. <hi>Colman</hi> had a kind and favourable Small-Pox, as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in this Way, and ſoon got well. Mrs. <hi>Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> was a fat Gentlewoman of a tender Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, ſhe came frightened into the Practice, as moſt of the others had done; not only by living near the Infected, but paſſing ſome Days before by a Door wherein lay a Corpſe ready for the Grave, which died of the Confluent Small-Pox, the Stench whereof greatly offended and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed her with Fear of being infected: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe went the uſual Time of nine Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Eruption, and broke out full of a diſtinct Sort; but being of a very moiſt Habit, they fluxed in her Face, about the 7th Day: She had a ſore Throat, was often reſtleſs, and by Turns had a Difficulty of Breathing, her Fever and Thirſt being yet moderate: The 11th, her Pox began to turn; the 13th, her Face became cruſty; and the 14th, the Scabs began to fall off, and ſhe appear'd more comfortable; her Inciſions grew wider, and run plentifully. All this while we were in good Hopes of her doing well. This Afternoon her two Children were brought to her, juſt recovered in the natural way, which gave her great Joy, but put her Spirits into too great a Motion; and the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther changing cool (I apprehend) ſhe took
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003259_0023_0FF02D4ACFED3D70"/>ſome cold, for that Evening ſhe was taken with hyſteric Fits, which held her about two Hours; but upon the Uſe of an <hi>Anodine</hi> and ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tihyſterics, ſhe became quiet, and reſted ſome Hours that Night, and ſeem'd refreſh'd in the Morning, and held it good part of the Day: But the Evening returning, brought on her Fits, together with a new Fever; upon which I bled her and repeated her Bliſters, and uſed many other Means, but to no Effect: The Fits and Fever followed her cloſe until the 17th of Eruption, and 26th from Inoculation, when ſhe died. <hi>Note,</hi> this was the only caſe, wherein we met with Fits in all my Inoculated Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients.</p>
               <p n="31">31ſt, I inoculated Mr. <hi>Samuel Jones,</hi> of about 32, and Mrs. <hi>Waldran</hi> of 35 Years old: The former had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a favourable diſtinct Sort, and was ſoon well. Mrs. <hi>Waldron</hi> ſuffer'd ſome light touches of a feveriſh Diſorder on the 6th and 7th Days, and on the 8th they vaniſh'd. Knowing (thro' her Fears) I had done it the firſt Time but ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I then inoculated her again; which took Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and at the uſual Time produc'd a kind di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Pox, which ſhe eaſily paſs'd thro', and was ſoon well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>September</hi> the 4th, I inoculated Mrs <hi>B—t,</hi> of about 32 Years old, upon a Pimple ſhe had ſcratched off on one Arm, and on the other, where ſhe had prick'd the Skin, ſo as to raiſe a ſmall Drop of Blood: This Inoculation was attended only with ſome feveriſh turns, which upon the 8th Day vaniſhed; and upon the 9th, her Fears being great leſt ſhe
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003259_0024_0FF02D9005AEE908"/>ſhould take it in the natural way, ſhe ſuffer'd me to make the proper Inciſions; after which at the 7th Day, her Fever came on, and the Small Pox came out on the 9th pretty full of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Sort: She had ſomething more of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver than is uſual this way, and about the height of the Diſtemper her <hi>Menſes</hi> came down, which added to her Uneaſineſſes a few Days; but all went over, and ſhe ſoon got well. It was ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reported, that ſhe miſcarry'd; but upon ſtrict Inquiry of the Nurſe, I found it falſe and groundleſs, ſhe not being then with Child.</p>
               <p>I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Dodge,</hi> about 20 Years old, who had nurſed her Siſter, then lying ſick of the Confluent Small-Pox, until the 7th Day from her Eruption: She being terrify'd with the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of her Siſter, I was perſuaded by her Mother and ſelf to inoculate her, which I did, by way of Experiment: She had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, with very little Sickneſs or Pain, and ſcarce an hundred in all: She was ſo ſoon well, it could hardly be ſaid ſhe had been ſick.</p>
               <p n="5">5th, I inoculated Juſtice <hi>Lynde's</hi> Negro Boy, about 17 Years old, he had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of a very kind diſtinct Sort, and ſoon was well.</p>
               <p n="6">6th, I inoculated my three Daughters, <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi> of about 10, <hi>Mary</hi> 8, and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> 4 Years old; the eldeſt had but about 40 or 50, the other two were pretty full in their Faces; and all their Symptoms proving gentle, they ſoon did well.</p>
               <p n="7">7th, I inoculated Mr. <hi>Elias Adams,</hi> about 18 Years of Age, he had the Small-Pox at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003259_0025_0FF02D4DF18F06E8"/>Time, and full of the diſtinct Sort; about the height, he was very reſtleſs and hot; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the uſe of an oily Mixture and two bliſtering Plaiſters, the Symptoms went off, and he got ſoon well.</p>
               <p>I inoculated Mr. <hi>Abiel Walley</hi>'s Negro Girl, about 14 Years old; ſhe had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a kind diſtinct Sort, and was ſoon well.</p>
               <p n="8">8th, I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Pierce,</hi> about 32 Years old; ſhe had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of the diſtinct Sort, and ſoon did well.</p>
               <p n="9">9th, I inoculated Mr. <hi>Thomas Boyſton,</hi> about 31 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Time, and of a kind diſtinct Sort, a little fuller than ordinary this Way; but the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms proved gentle, and he ſoon was well.</p>
               <p>I inoculated Mrs. <hi>N—s,</hi> who had been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Practice for ſome Time before, and had lived in the Way of Infection above a Month; but now, through Hope and Fear, tho' too late, ſhe ſubmitted to it. The 3d Day ſhe fell ſick; the 5th, the Small-Pox appeared, and continued coming out until the 8th or ninth, when ſhe was full of a ſmall, depreſſed, conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Sort, and her Throat was dry and ſore; ſhe had no immediate Signs of Danger until the 16th, (ſhe being, as it might be ſuppoſed, a breeding, and 8 or 9 Weeks gone) when her <hi>Menſes</hi> came down upon her, upon which her Strength failed, and her Spirits ſunk. The 17th, ſhe flooded, and began to talk idly, conceiting ſhe was in the Waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I viſited her about 12 that Night, and found her delirious, extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003259_0026_0FF02D918DD35A38"/>cold, and in a clammy Sweat, and her Pulſe ſo low, that I could hardly be ſenſible ſhe had any at all; I ordered her ſome Drops of Oil of Cinnamon and Liquid <hi>Laudanum</hi> in Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, (expecting little from a weaker Cordial) of which ſhe had given her two or three times that Night. I viſited in the Morning, &amp; found her much revived, and her flooding ſtay'd; there was a ſmall imperfect Subſtance found in the Bed. Afterwards ſhe mended ſlowly, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent Inflammation attending her Eyes, her Face being much ſwell'd, and her Eye-lids cloſed; we were not ſenſible of the Danger, until the ſharp Humour had ulcerated the horney Coat of one Eye the Sight of which ſhe loſt; ſhe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways recovered and did well.</p>
               <p n="11">11th, I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Jane Colman</hi> of about 14, and Mr. <hi>Grafton Feveryear</hi> of about 30 Years old; on both theſe the Small-Pox came out at the uſual Time, of a kind diſtinct Sort, the Symptoms friendly, they ſoon grew well. Mrs. <hi>Jane</hi> had about 50 or 60, Mr. <hi>Feveryear</hi> a good handſome Sprinkling; he had lived in an infected Houſe about a Month before ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated.</p>
               <p n="12">12th, I inoculated Mr. <hi>Daniel Berry</hi>'s Son, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 20, and his Daughter about 16, and Mr. <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> about 22 Years old: Theſe three had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a kind diſtinct Sort, and they ſoon were well.</p>
               <p n="13">13th, I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Margaret Salter,</hi> about 30 Years old, a weakly hyſterical Woman, and often ill; and tho' ſhe had the Small-Pox ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry favourably, as to Number, yet ſhe complain'd
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003259_0027_0FF02D5430B54CA0"/>much of Pain in her Head, and Vapours, which gave me ſome Trouble; but in a ſhort Time thoſe Symptoms went off, and ſhe ſoon was well.</p>
               <p>I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Eliz. Melvin,</hi> about 19 Years old! ſhe had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of a kind diſtinct Sort, and ſoon did well. She liv'd ſome diſtance from me, ſo that I ſaw her but twice after I inoculated her.</p>
               <p n="16">16th, I inoculated Mr. <hi>John Adams</hi> about 35, and Mr. <hi>Jones's</hi> Child, 4 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the Time expected, few in Number, the Symptoms gentle, they ſoon were well. Thro' Neglect, Mr. <hi>Adams</hi>'s Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations inflamed, and became painful for 3 or 4 Days, but were afterwards eaſy, and ſoon healed.</p>
               <p>I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Adams</hi> about 30 and her Daughter about 4 Years old; it had no Effect upon Mrs. <hi>Adams,</hi> which a little ſurprized me; and upon propoſing to inoculate her again, ſhe ſaid ſhe remember'd, when a little Girl, the Small-Pox was in her Father's Family, and ſhe ill, and that there was a Diſpute between the Doctor and Nurſe whether her's was the Small-Pox or not, having but three Puſtles; the Mark of one ſhe ſhewed me. I advis'd her to nurſe her Child, which was now ill, and be out of Fear; and ſhe did ſo. The Child, at the uſual Time, had the Small-Pox pretty full in the Face, and had a conſiderable Fever, attending. I gave it a Vomit, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver work'd, and weaken'd it for the preſent, inſtead of relieving it: The Child continu'd very ill until about the 6th or 7th Day of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003259_0028_0FF02D9692C2DF28"/>Eruption; when the Pock ripen'd, the Fever went off, and it ſoon return'd to Health.</p>
               <p>I inoculated Mr. <hi>Richard Tucker,</hi> about 40 Years old, of a broken Conſtitution; he had the Small Pox at the uſual Time, few in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, good in Kind, the Symptoms gentle, and he ſoon was well.</p>
               <p n="20">20th, I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Eliz. Valentine</hi> about 18, Mr. <hi>Warner</hi> 21, and Mr. <hi>Procter</hi>'s Indian Man 20 Years old; theſe all had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a good diſtinct Sort: The <hi>Indian</hi> had 3 or 4 uneaſy Nights, after which his Reſt return'd, and they were all ſoon well. Mrs. <hi>Valentine</hi> had but very few.</p>
               <p n="21">21ſt, I inoculated Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Ayres</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 62, (he was a Gentleman very Aſthmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal) his Son <hi>Nathaniel Ayres</hi> about 25, &amp; Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Kitt</hi> about 22 Years old; ſhe had been in infected Houſes and was taken down the next Day, had the Small-Pox full of a good Sort: The other two had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a very kind diſtinct Sort, and few in Number. The old Gentleman was in his Cloaths every Day, for his Aſthma ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him uncomfortable in Bed. They all ſoon recover'd and did well.</p>
               <p n="22">22d, I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Woodbury,</hi> about 28 Years old; ſhe had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a kind, diſtinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle, and ſhe ſoon was well.</p>
               <p n="23">23d, I inoculated the Hon. <hi>Thomas Fitch,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq;</abbr> his only Son, about 14 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, few in Number, the Smptoms eaſy, and he ſoon was well.</p>

                  <hi>October</hi> the 6th, I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Eunice Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard,</hi> about 22 Years old; ſhe had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a kind, diſtinct Sort, and was ſoon well.</p>
               <p n="13">13th, I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Hannah Breck</hi> of 16, and <hi>Nathaniel Loring</hi> of 12 Years old; theſe had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a kind, diſtinct Sort, and ſoon were well.</p>
               <p>I ſhould have inoculated theſe, had I been able, laſt Night, with Mr. <hi>Daniel Loring's</hi> eldeſt Son, about 15 Years old, (Brother to <hi>Nathaniel</hi>) who had been ſent into the Country about a Fortnight before to eſcape it in the natural Way; he came home well laſt Evening to be inoculated; in the Night was taken with the Symptoms of the Small-Pox, which this Day brake out of the confluent Sort: He ſoon loſt his Reaſon, and died on the 6th or 7th Day. I mention this Caſe for theſe Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi> Had I inoculated him as was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, few wou'd have believed him infected before; and that it may be ſuppos'd, at leaſt, that the Small-Pox lurks in the Body longer when taken in the natural Way, than when taken in the artificial Way; as has been often obſerv'd, in many Caſes, where People have been but once in the Way of Infection, or that have come from infected Towns or Veſſels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14th, I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Martha Fitch</hi> about 16, and Mrs. <hi>Mary</hi> about 15 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time very favourably, few in Number, the Symptoms plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and they ſoon were well.</p>
               <p n="26">26th, I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Sarah Boylſton,</hi> at <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> of about 26-Years old; ſhe was at Lodgings
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003259_0030_0FF02D99624A1768"/>in the Country to eſcape the Diſtemper: Before her Travail came on, the Small-Pox broke out in the Family; and about two Days after ſhe was deliver'd, her Fear of that being over, ſhe was now diſtreſs'd with the danger of having the Small-Pox in the natural Way. My Brother came to me to adviſe in the Affair, and deſir'd me to go with him to ſee her; accordingly I did, and that prepar'd; and upon both their Requeſts, I inoculated her. A Coach was provided, and, wrapt up in a Bed, ſhe was brought home to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and on the 10th Day broke out with the Small-Pox, of a kind, diſtinct Sort, and paſs'd thro' it without any ſenſible Danger, and ſoon recovered her Health, from lying-in, and having the Small-Pox together.</p>
               <p>At the ſame Time, and at the ſame Houſe I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculated Mrs. <hi>Mary Lane</hi> of 20, and Mrs. <hi>Rebecca Abbot</hi> of 11 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a kind, diſtinct Sort, the Symptoms prov'd eaſy, and they being out of Town, I ſaw them but twice, after Inoculation, before they were well.</p>
               <p>I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Blague</hi>'s Negro Girl, about 5 Years old; ſhe had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, as favourably as any of the reſt, and ſoon got well.</p>
               <p n="30">30th, I inoculated Capt. <hi>John Osborne</hi> about 36, and his Wife about 33, Judge <hi>Davenport</hi>'s Son <hi>John</hi> about 17, Mr. <hi>Caleb Lyman</hi> about 43 and <hi>Suſanna Lyman</hi> about 7 Years old; they all had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time of a fine diſtinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle, and they were ſoon well.</p>

Theſe Gentlemen came from <hi>Roxbury</hi> into <hi>Boſton</hi> to be inoculated, and lay in one Room; and their Recommendation of this Practice, at their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn prov'd to be of great Service to that Town, in carrying the Inhabitants ſoon thro' that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, and in ſaving many Lives, if I may be allow'd to judge from the Succeſs of the different Ways of Infection, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the firſt thirteen men and they chiefly heads of Families who had the Small-Pox in the natural way, ten of them died; and in above 40 Men that were inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at or near the ſame Time, in the ſame Town, not one Man died.</p>
               <p>I inoculated Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Loring</hi>'s only Child about 9 Years old, his Father being much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for him, on Account of the Small-Pox having been very fatal to their Family; he had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, very kindly, few in Number, and he ſoon was well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> the 1ſt, I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Sarah Bromfield</hi> about 25, Mrs. <hi>Mary Bromfield</hi> 23, Mrs. <hi>Cheekley</hi> 24, and Mrs. <hi>Willard</hi>'s Daughter 18 Years old; they all had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a kind, diſtinct Sort, and were ſoon well.</p>

               <p>I inoculated the Reverend Mr. <hi>Ebenezer Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont,</hi> of <hi>Roxbury,</hi> 24 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a kind, diſtinct Sort, few in Number, and he ſoon got well.</p>
               <p n="3">3d, I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Winſlow,</hi> about 21 Years old; ſhe had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of the diſtinct Sort, but pretty full.

               <p n="7">7th, I inoculated Mr. <hi>Ebenezer Holmes,</hi> about 17 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a kind, diſtinct Sort, and was ſoon well.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003259_0037_0FF02D65320BA540"/>ſo much employ'd in <hi>Boſton</hi> and <hi>Roxbury,</hi> when their Sickneſs came on, that when Mr. <hi>Tufts</hi> ſent for me, I could not go to them, and only ſent Directions, with ſome few Medicines, and never ſaw either until they were well, They had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of the favourable Sort, as he gave me the Account ſome time after, when he came to pay his Bill.</p>
               <p n="27">27th, I inoculated Mr. <hi>Francis Foxcroft,</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 30, Mr. <hi>Samuel Danforth</hi> 28, both of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>; and at <hi>Roxbury</hi> the Reverend Mr. <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah Walter,</hi> about 58, and Daughter, 17, his Son, 12, and another Child about 7 Years old, the Reverend Mr. <hi>Thomas Walter</hi>'s Wife 23, Mr. <hi>Harbottle Dorr,</hi> 25, his Siſter <hi>Clemence,</hi> 22, Eight of theſe had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a kind, diſtinct Sort, their Symptoms gentle, and they ſoon were well. Mr. <hi>Walter's</hi> Inoculation had no Effect upon him. He ſaid, when he was a Child he had an Illneſs, with breaking out, but they did not know that it was the Small-Pox. This his Mother told him when alive.</p>
               <p n="28">28th, I inoculated Major <hi>Bowles</hi> of <hi>Roxbury,</hi> about 37 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of the diſtinct and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Kind, and ſoon was well.</p>
               <p>I inoculated Mr. <hi>Varney</hi>'s Negro Boy, about 18 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a kind, diſtinct Sort, and ſoon was well.</p>
               <p n="29">29th, I inoculated, at <hi>Roxbury,</hi> Col. <hi>Joſhua Lamb,</hi> about 45, his Son about 17, his Niece 13, Negro Boy, 15, Mr. <hi>William Bant,</hi> 23, and Mrs. <hi>Morris</hi>'s Girl, 15, Years old. Five of theſe
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003259_0038_0FF02DA455FDC6A8"/>had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of a kind, diſtinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle, and they ſoon were well. Mr. <hi>Bant</hi>'s Inoculation had no Effect upon him: I ſhou'd have inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him again on the 8th or 9th Day, but that a Gentlewoman declar'd that ſhe had ſeen him ſick of the Small-Pox when a Child; his Mother hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been dead ſome time, few remember'd any thing of it.</p>
               <p>I inoculated Mr. <hi>John Pierpont,</hi> about 27 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of a very diſtinct Sort, an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attending his Throat, gave him ſome Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs for three or four Days after Eruption; but upon filling of the Pock the Inflammation went off, and he ſoon recover'd; and did well.</p>
               <p>I inoculated Mr. <hi>Edward Dorr</hi>'s other three Children, one of 9, and one of 7 Years, and the other about 18 Months old, his Servant Man 20, an <hi>Indian</hi> Girl about 17 Years old. Mr. <hi>Dorr</hi> would have had theſe five inoculated when he and the three Children were, but that I refus'd to do it then. But for the Convenience of nurſing, they were put into one Chamber, and for better Stowage, two or three in one Bed, (the End of the Chamber being partition'd off for a private Lodging, in which was laid the <hi>Indian</hi> Girl) and by the time the firſt three were broken out a Day or two, the other five began their Sickneſs. Here was a melancholy Sight indeed; I had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten three or four, but never nine in a Room to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; the poor Children with their ſickneſs and the Winter's Cold, prov'd froward, one cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003259_0039_0FF02D681A64F540"/>another coughing; one wanted Drink, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to do its Needs; one to get up, another to go to Bed, and ſo on; ſo that together with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening and ſhutting the Doors, the gingling of the Warming-pan, Fire-ſhovel and Tongs, there was ſcarce a Minute in the 24 Hours that all was ſtill and quiet. They all had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of the diſtinct Sort: Mr. <hi>Dorr</hi> was full, his Pock inflam'd and his Fever too high: This, with his great Concern for his Children, the continual Noiſe, and Want of Sleep, made the poor Gentleman almoſt diſtracted, which obliged me to bleed him twice, to apply Epiſpaſtics, uſe Anodines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at the turning of the Pock, the Symptoms went off. The <hi>Indian</hi> Girl was taken ill the 7th with a gentle Fever, which continued to the 9th, when the Small-Pox came out upon her of a kind, diſtinct Sort, ſhe having about twenty in her Face, ſo that ſhe was eaſy, and laughed, as I found her half naked, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up in the Bed. The 10th I viſited the Family late in the Evening, and the Nurſe ſaid the <hi>Indian</hi> was very dull, and did not care to ſpeak; I found her very ill, the Pock ſunk in, her Pulſe too frequent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even: I order'd her near a Fire, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Means were uſed to get the Pock out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but to no purpoſe; for ſhe died before Morning. Two of the Children were a little fuller than ordinary, complain'd of Soreneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the other five had it very favourably, and eight of the nine recovered, and did very well. The Small-Pox had broken out in Mr. <hi>Dorr</hi>'s Houſe before any of them were inoculated: Tho' I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003259_0040_0FF02DA72D7659F8"/>the <hi>Indian</hi> Girl was no ways infected before, but was loſt by taking Cold and ſtriking in the Pock. She was a weakly Girl, ſubject to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours breaking out upon her Years before.</p>
               <p n="30">30th, I inoculated Mr. <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> 19, Mr. <hi>John Smith,</hi> 17, Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi> 16, at <hi>Charleſttown</hi>: Mr. <hi>Braſier</hi> about 31, his Wife 35, and four, of their Children, <hi>viz.</hi> one of 8, one of 6, one of 3 Years, and one of nine Months old; Mrs <hi>Wire</hi> about 50, and Son 14, Mr. <hi>Webb</hi>'s two Children, one of 2 Years, and the other 10 Months old, Mrs. <hi>Hendry</hi> 25 Years, and her Child 15 months old; All theſe Fifteen had the Small-Pox at the uſual time, and of a very diſtinct and kind Sort. The three firſt were in <hi>Boſton,</hi> whom I often ſaw, Mr. <hi>John Smith</hi> had but 3 Puſtules that fill'd and turn'd, and but one of them very Fair, ſo that I can't call this a perfect Small-Pox tho' I know not why theſe may not defend him for the Future, as well as if he had had but one or two in the natural way, the other two but very few: The twelve at <hi>Charleſtown</hi> I ſaw but twice in all their Illneſs, I was ſo engaged in <hi>Boſton</hi> and <hi>Roxbury</hi>; however, they all ſoon recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and did well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> the 1ſt, I inoculated Mrs. <hi>Foy</hi> 27, Mrs. <hi>White</hi> 24, and their Negro Boy 6, Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Calf</hi> 16, her Siſter 14, and Capt. <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> 26 Years old; at <hi>Roxbury,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Scarbrough,</hi> Widow, 67, her Son <hi>Joſeph Scarbrough</hi> 34, and Daughter <hi>Bethiah</hi> 22, Mr. <hi>Timothy Parker</hi> 26, Mr. <hi>Stephen Chute</hi> 22, Mr. <hi>Searl</hi>'s Servant Boy 16, Mr. <hi>Scarbrough</hi>'s Man, about 20 Years old. Twelve of theſe had the Small-Pox at the uſual
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003259_0041_0FF02D6B22EC1810"/>Time, and of a diſtinct Kind, the ſix at <hi>Boſton</hi> had each but few, and the Symptoms very gentle: The four Men and the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman at <hi>Roxbury</hi> were fuller, &amp; their Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms a little harſh, <hi>viz.</hi> Pains in their Head, or Bones; ſick, or oppreſs'd at Stomach; and the old Gentlewoman complain'd of being faint: And but little good Reſt, or Sleep, did they get for three or four Days and Nights, four in one Room, and two in another, and but one Nurſe for them all, and ſhe a Toper. But theſe Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms abated as the Pox ripen'd; and as they turn'd, they went off. The Boy had but few in Number, and the Symptoms gentle. All theſe twelve ſoon recover'd, and did well. Mrs. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiah Scarbrough</hi> had her Illneſs begun the 7th Day, a gentle Fever, and ſo continued until the 9th, when her Fever encreaſed, and ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of her Head, Back, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is uſual, and no more; no Pox yet appearing; ſhe had Bliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers order'd, and other Means preſcrib'd to bring out the Pox, and that ſhe ſhould be kept warm in Bed, and ſo I left her that Night. The next Night I found her (unexpectedly, in her Cloaths) upon the Bed, faint and weak, with a faulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, weak, and dangerous Pulſe; and the Nurſe told me her Courſes were upon her, and that ſhe could not keep her in Bed. I did the beſt I could for her, (being late at Night, and no Shop at Hand) but to no Effect; ſhe died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Morning. She had been ſeveral Years, as her Mother and others told me, a very ſickly young Woman, and never well. In ſhort, thro' my great Hurry, ſhe was poorly Doctor'd, and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003259_0042_0FF02DA9F6208970"/>badly Nurs'd, and ſo ſhe died before the Pox came out.</p>
               <p n="2">2d, I inoculated Madam <hi>Davenport</hi> about 40, her little Daughter Mrs. <hi>Lucia</hi> 6, Madam <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> 40, Mr. <hi>Philip Serle,</hi> 61, his Wife 63, their Daughter 24, Mr. <hi>Edmond Wells</hi> 58. his Wife 54, their Daughter 19, their Son 16. Mr. <hi>Elias Monk</hi> 30, and three of his Children, one 6, one 4, and the other 2 Years old; the 3 firſt in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> the other 11 at <hi>Roxbury.</hi> Thoſe three in <hi>Boſton</hi> had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, &amp; of a kind, diſtinct Sort, their Symptoms eaſy, they ſoon were well. Mr. <hi>Serle, Wells</hi>'s Son, <hi>Monk,</hi> and his three Children, had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a very diſtinct Sort, and the Symptoms moderate. Mr. <hi>Wells,</hi> his Daughter, and Mr. <hi>Serle</hi>'s Daughter, had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of the diſtinct Sort, but a little fuller, and their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints greater, <hi>viz.</hi> of Pain and Soreneſs, Want of Reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which at the turning of the Pox, went off; and all theſe nine, in a little Time, recover'd and did well. Mrs. <hi>Wells</hi> was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weakly Gentlewoman, always complaining and of an ill Habit of Body, and ſo very ſple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick as often to be deprived of Reaſon; and for many Years not capable of managing her Family Affairs. She had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of a very diſtinct Sort, and the Symptoms continued moderate for the firſt five Days, ſave that the cold Weather pinched her very much; the 6th, 7th, and 8th Days ſhe was more uneaſy, ſlept but little, grew faint and weaker, the cold Weather affecting her ſtill
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003259_0043_0FF02D6DA4171320"/>more, and the native Heat declining apace; the Pock not filling, ſhe ſunk under it, and died the 9th from Eruption, and the 17th from her Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Mrs. <hi>Serle,</hi> likewiſe, was an ailing old Woman, Hyſterical, Splenetic, and of an ill Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Body; ſhe had the Small-Pox at the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Time, and of a very diſtinct Sort; the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were moderate, though ſhe was often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of one Uneaſineſs or other, as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the Small-Pox, and the cold Weather, likewiſe, affected her much. Thus ſhe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until the Pock fill'd and turn'd, &amp; the Scabs caſt off; one Day a little better, and another worſe; ſometimes up, and other times in Bed: The Perſpirations being ſtopp'd by the cold Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; a Complication of Humours being put in Motion, at laſt fell upon her Bowels. She had a Purging three or four Days, which carried her off. She died the 24th from Eruption, and the 33d from Inoculation. All theſe 11 at <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> had liv'd in the Way of Infection about three Weeks before inoculated.</p>
               <p n="6">6th, I inoculated Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> 25, Mr. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Belcher</hi> about 22, his Brother, 18, Mr. <hi>Joſ. Richards</hi> 22, and Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> 21 Years old; theſe five had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of a good diſtinct Sort, not many in Number, nor were the Symptoms harſh; they complain'd of Soreneſs, and the Weather pinch'd them, but they paſs'd ſoon through it, and did well. Theſe were of <hi>Dedham,</hi> and inoculated at <hi>Roxbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8th, I inoculated, at <hi>Boſton,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Harris</hi> about 22 Years old; ſhe had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of the diſtinct Kind, and a
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003259_0044_0FF02DAD6E707D20"/>pretty handſome Sprinkling; ſhe was very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouriſh and timorous; full of Complaints, when I was abſent; but when preſent, had few or none. She ſoon was well.</p>
               <p>I inoculated, at <hi>Roxbury,</hi> Mr. <hi>Samuel Williams</hi> about 64, his Wife 62, his Son 36, his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 22, Dr. <hi>Elijah Danforth,</hi> 35, and Mr. <hi>Baſs</hi> 27; all theſe had the Small-Pox at the uſual time, and of a kind, diſtinct Sort, and but few in Number. The old Gentleman, thro' the cold Weather, had an Inflammation in his Wriſts, where he was Inoculated, which gave him much Pain, and me ſome Trouble. The Doctor, by the Cold, had a Tumour in the <hi>Axilla,</hi> which came to Suppuration. Except theſe two Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, (which ſoon afterward were cured) they were very favourably dealt with, and ſoon well.</p>
               <p n="9">9th, I inoculated, in <hi>Boſton,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Turell</hi> about 32, and a Negro Boy 10 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of the diſtinct and kind Sort; their Symptoms gentle, they ſoon were well.</p>
               <p n="12">12th, I inoculated, at <hi>Roxbury,</hi> Capt, <hi>Joſeph Mayhew</hi> about 57, and his Grandſon 11 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of a kind, diſtinct Sort; the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms gentle, they ſoon were well.</p>
               <p n="18">18th, I inoculated, at <hi>Roxbury,</hi> Mr. <hi>Samuel Stevens</hi>'s two eldeſt Daughters, one of about 11, and the other 6 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of a kind diſtinct Sort; their Symptoms gentle, they ſoon were well.</p>
               <p n="20">
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:003259_0045_0FF02D70986E1AC8"/>20th, I inoculated, at <hi>Roxbury,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s Maid about 17 Years old; ſhe had been at her Father's ſome Time to eſcape the Infection; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cold, ſhe complain'd of her Head and Bones; they concluding ſhe was taken with the Small-Pox, ſent her back to her Maſter to have it there, and ſhe was put into an infected Room and Bed, and I was deſir'd to take the care of her. After ſhe had been kept warm about 48 Hours, her Complaints were gone, and now, thro' Fear, ſhe wou'd be inoculated; ſhe had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a kind, diſtinct Sort, (about 200 in all) the Symptoms gentle, ſhe ſoon was well.</p>
               <p n="24">24th, I inoculated Capt. <hi>Mayhew</hi>'s Maid about 18 Years old; She had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a kind, diſtinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle, ſhe ſoon was well.</p>
               <p n="26">26th, I inoculated Mr. <hi>Samuel Stevens</hi>'s two other Children, one 4, the other 2 Years old, and Mr. <hi>Barnard</hi>'s Son 4 Years old; they had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a kind, diſtinct Sort, few in Number, and the Symptoms being gentle, they ſoon were well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi> the 28th, 1721-2, I inoculated, at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Madam <hi>Goff</hi> about 45, her Nephew 12, her Maid 27, the Maid's Child 2, their Man 30, Servant Girl 15, and Mr. <hi>Stephen Hall</hi> of <hi>Charlſtown,</hi> about 27; ſix of theſe had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of the diſtinct Sort; and their Smptoms moderate; all theſe ſoon did well. Upon Madam <hi>Goff</hi> it had no Effect; it appear'd afterwards, (by one that remembred) that ſhe had the Small-Pox in her Infancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:003259_0046_0FF02DB01F90CB98"/>
                  <hi>February</hi> the 8th; I inoculated, in <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> Mr. <hi>Kettle</hi> of 26, and his Wife of 23 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a kind, diſtinct Sort, their Symptoms gentle, and they ſoon did well.</p>
               <p n="23">23d, I inoculated, at <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> the Reverend Mr. <hi>Willard</hi> of <hi>Rutland,</hi> 30 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, of a moſt kind, diſtinct Sort, few in Number, and the Symptoms gentle, he ſoon was well.</p>
               <p n="24">24th, I inoculated, at <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Hall</hi> about 22 Years, her Child about 14 Months old, they both had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of the diſtinct Sort: Mrs. <hi>Hall</hi> was ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable, refuſed Management and Medicine, expos'd herſelf in caring for her Child, and took Cold, which brought on new Complaints, <hi>viz.</hi> Pain and a Swelling in her right Thigh; which Swelling continuing, encreas'd her Thigh to a large Bulk, and which ſuppurated, and upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, diſcharged a great Quantity of undigeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pus; upon which ſhe became eaſy, (the Small-Pox being favourable, was now turn'd and gone.) Her Fears prevented me laying open the <hi>Sinus,</hi> I order'd large Poultices of white Bread &amp; Milk, with ſuitable Compreſs &amp; Bandage; to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd once or twice a Day, as the Caſe might require; which Method &amp; ſimple Means alone in ten Days or a Fortnight's Time compaſſed and compleated the Cure. The Child's Symptoms were favourable, &amp; it ſoon was well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 11th, I inoculated Mr. <hi>Samuel Sewall</hi> of about 34, Mrs. <hi>Sewall</hi> 30, &amp; her two Sons, one 10, the other 8, Mr. <hi>Benjamin Woodbridge</hi> 13,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003259_0047_0FF02DD637F4AD30"/>and Mrs. <hi>Joanna Alford</hi> 20 Years old; Mr. <hi>Sewall</hi> was a weakly Gentleman, often ill, and thought by many Conſumptive; &amp; all the other five of tender Conſtitutions. And notwithſtanding the many Difficulties &amp; hard Shifts they were put to, in being remov'd ſome Days after inoculated to an Iſland to have the Small-Pox there, the Particulars too tedious to be related here, but well known in <hi>Boſton,</hi> yet theſe all had the Small-Pox at the uſual Time, and of a diſtinct Sort. Thoſe three who were capable of reflecting on their Treatment, ſuffered twice as much as the other three did; but all their Symptoms proving gentle, they all did well.</p>
               <p>The Small-Pox now leaving us, Inoculation ceas'd; and when it ſhall pleaſe Providence to ſend &amp; ſpread that Diſtemper amongſt us again, may Inoculation revive, be better received, and continued a Bleſſing, in preſerving many more from Miſery, Corruption, &amp; Death.</p>
               <p>There were in the Towns near <hi>Boſton</hi> about 36 Perſons more inoculated, which all did well, <hi>viz.</hi> by Dr. <hi>Roby</hi> about 11, and by Dr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> about 28, which together with my 247, make up the Number of 286, out of which Number died only ſix perſons, notwithſtanding all the Difficulties this Practice laboured under, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Now if there be any one that can give a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Account or Hiſtory of any other Method of Practice that has carried ſuch a Number, of all Ages, Sexes, Conſtitutions, and Colours, and in the worſt Seaſons of the Year, thro' the Small Pox; or, indeed, thro' any other acute Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with better Succeſs, then I will alter my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003259_0048_0FF02DB1A719B078"/>of this; and until then, I ſhall value and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem this Method of inoculating the Small-Pox, as the moſt beneficial and ſucceſsful that ever was diſcover'd to, and practiſed by Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in this World.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1721, and Beginning of 1722. there were, in <hi>Boſton,</hi> 5759 Perſons who had the Small-Pox in the natural Way, out of which Number died 844, (this Account I took from one of our Prints, publiſhed by Authority) ſo that the Proportion that died of the natural Small Pox there, appears to be one in ſix, or between that of ſix &amp; ſeven.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It appears by the foregoing Table, that Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation upon ſix Perſons did not produce the Small-Pox, by Reaſon they had had it before. And that out of 286, ſix died, though they had not all the Small-Pox only by Inoculation, as we have Reaſon to believe, but were ſome of them infected in the natural Way, before Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated. And it further appears by our Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in <hi>New-England,</hi> that if a Number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003259_0050_0FF02DB370A118C0"/>ſhou'd be inoculated, of all Ages and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and even ſome of them living amongſt the Infected and in the worſt Seaſons of the Year, without Exception, as was our caſe, then the Proportion that dies under Inoculation may be one in 46, or thereabout. It is my Opinion, from Reaſon, and as far as I can judge, from Experience too, that a Perſon may be infected in the natural Way, four or five Days, if not longer, before inoculated; and yet go the uſual Time of nine Days before Eruption. And it is further my Opinion, that a Perſon may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Inoculation, if not infected above a Day or two before Inoculated. And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for ſuch my Opinions are as followeth: 1. That the Infection received by Inſpiration does not ſo immediately enter into, and ferment the Blood and other Juices of the Body, as that does which we inoculate, or apply to the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Blood and other Veſſels in the Inciſion. 2. That this inoculated Infection does immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately enter in, and communicate its Leaven like Quality (by the Mouths of the divided Veſſels) to the Maſs of Humours in the Body. And if any there be of that Kind, it will ferment and put them into Motion, and bring the Small-Pox out in about two Thirds of the Time that the Natural uſually does; and that before the deep, ſecret, and hidden Fermentations have had Time to divide and ſubdivide the Particles of that Humour, and by a greater Mixture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave the other Juices, ſo as to produce the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent Sort. I believe alſo that there is a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Particles of Infection, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:003259_0051_0FF02DDB4BF3FF60"/>thoſe in the natural Way, being more volatile, may be more malignant, than thoſe contain'd in the Pus or Matter of the Puſtules: And that if there were no Difference in the Malignity of the Infection; yet as Inoculation communicates the Infection to an Out-ſide and firmer Part of our Body, the Malignity may (being ſtrain'd thro' ſo many minute Veſſels) loſe part of its Force, before it reach the more principal Parts, and that a part of that Infection may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by the Inciſions back again: Whereas in the natural Way, our Noſtrils, Throat, Mouth, Lungs, and Stomach are the firſt Parts infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or thro' which the Infection paſſes, and which are frequently the Parts that moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. And there may be ſomething allow'd me (from Experience) on this Head, when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that amongſt the whole Number that I inoculated, tho' many of them amidſt the ſtifling Heat of Infection, and in the extream hot and cold Weather; yet not above three or four Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons had their Throats very ſore, and their Mouths fill'd, and Noſtrils ſtop'd with the Pock and Scabs, as are common in the natural Way. And I dare appeal to all that have been in this Practice, whether they have met with ſuch a Caſe, except the Perſon has been firſt infected in the natural Way; which, indeed, may be a hard thing to determine, in any Place, where the Small-Pox may have been before the Perſon was inoculated. And yet notwithſtanding what I have ſaid, as to leſſening the Danger of a prior Infection, I would have the utmoſt Care taken to prevent Infection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Inoculation: However, that may be of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003259_0052_0FF02DB960509540"/>in Caſe a Perſon may have been ſo expos'd, either thro' Ignorance, or Neceſſity. There is a ſaying; that one Sort of Small-Pox the Nurſe can't kill the Patient with; and likewiſe another Sort, that all the Phyſicians cannot cure the Patient of. It will be eaſy for any one to gueſs what thoſe two Sorts are, <hi>viz.</hi> the Diſtinct, and the Confluent; theſe two are put in Oppoſition to one another, as being the Extreams of each, <hi>viz.</hi> the beſt and worſt Sort, or Kind of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper. But however favourable the Small-Pox appear to be, there muſt be Care taken of the Sick, and not only in this, but in all acute Diſeaſes; and eſpecially in thoſe call'd Eruptive Fevers, by Reaſon they are more expos'd to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, as taking Cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> flatting, or ſtriking in the Pock, or producing ſome other Symptom, which has coſt many thouſands their Lives: Tho' the Small-Pox, Meaſles, or any other Fever the Patient had, may have ſeem'd very gentle and eaſy; yet with a ſmall Accident they are ſnatch'd away. And who wou'd have tho't it, ſays the Nurſe, if not the Doctor too. But ſo it is, has, and will be, if not thro' great Care, Skill, and Pains, prevented.</p>
               <p>Now Inoculation, at the worſt, is but a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium between the two Extreams, provided it be done according to Art, and the Patient be clear from a prior Infection; I ſay, it prevents the worſt, and generally procures the beſt, or a kind, diſtinct Sort of Small-Pox.</p>
               <p>And pray let us conſider what this Method, in procuring the diſtinct Small-Pox, does prevent; it prevents the confluent, which, in itſelf, is a
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:003259_0053_0FF02DE0A5BA62E0"/>Plague, and that in a high Degree; ſome of the bad Symptoms attending which, are as followeth: Purple Spots, the bloody and parchment Pox, Hemorahages of Blood at the Mouth, Noſe, Fundament, and Privities; Ravings and Deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums; Convulſions, and other Fits; violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations and Swellings in the Eyes and Throat; ſo that they cannot ſee, or ſcarcely breathe, or ſwallow any thing, to keep them from ſtarving. Some looking as black as the Stock, others as white as a Sheet; in ſome, the Pock runs into Bliſters, and the Skin ſtripping off, leaves the Fleſh raw, like Creatures flea'd. Some have a burning, others a ſmarting Pain, as if in the Fire, or ſcalded with boiling Water: Some have inſatiable Thirſts, others greedy Appetites, and will crave Food when dying. Some have been fill'd with loathſome Ulcers; others have had deep, and fiſtulous Ulcers in their Bodies, or in their Limbs or Joints, with Rottenneſs of the Ligaments and Bones: Some who live are Cripples, othets Idiots, and many blind all their Days; beſide the other Deformities it brings upon many, in their Faces, Limbs, or Body, with many more grievous Symptoms, which the World has had too great Experience of, as being the Attendants of that fatal Diſtemper called the Confluent Small-Pox.</p>
               <p>What this Humour of the Small-Pox, in us, is, or when, and how it is communicated to us, the Learned have not yet inform'd us. If from our Parents, then how ſhou'd ſuch as have had the Small-Pox before (and conſequently then have it not in them) give it to their Children's
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:003259_0054_0FF02DBD63B8DDF0"/>Neither are Infants in the Womb freed from that Diſtemper, altho' the Mother have the Small-Pox while the Child is there. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever otherways it may be, this is certain, that as it is a moſt loathſome, painful, and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Diſtemper; ſo Providence has wiſely and mercifully order'd it, that once only, in our Lives, we ſhall be diſtreſs'd by it; &amp; has now, in greater Goodneſs, diſcover'd to us a Way or Method how to moderate that Diſtemper, &amp; to render the Small-Pox, inoculated, no further dangerous than a common intermittent Fever, under the prudent uſe of its ſpecifick Bark. And ſhall not the World gratefully accept, &amp; thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully make uſe of ſuch a Method, (when known) &amp; eſpecially <hi>Great Britain,</hi> which has had ſo much Experience of its good Effects, and that for five Years following? Shall not they come fully into, &amp; take the Benefit of it? And ſhall not the Phyſicians, who are the Medicinal Guides, with the Surgeons, recommend and bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to greater Eſteem &amp; Practice, &amp; ſave (under God) thouſands and ten thouſands by it; &amp; make further Improvements in it; &amp; ſet more vigorouſly about it, when they conſider their great Pattern and Example for it, <hi>viz.</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and wiſeſt of Kings, their Royal Highneſſes the Prince and Princeſs at the Head of it; &amp; that it has been uſed upon their Royal Iſſue with great Succeſs?</p>
               <p>The Small-Pox in the natural Way, has not been leſs fatal to Royal Blood, than it has been to their meaner Subjects; and ſhall not ſuch great Examples, and ſuch great Succeſs, influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:003259_0055_0FF02DE8E60C1CC0"/>the World, give Credit to, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a Practice which is ſo very valuable in it ſelf, as that none other can compare with it?</p>
               <p>When the World has had Experience of the good Effects of this Method, it will no longer remain a Doubt; but it will be made uſe of, and acknowledged to be the moſt certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curative Means to produce the better Sort; &amp; the only preventive Remedy againſt the worſt and confluent Sort.</p>
               <p>And it is, and ſhall be acknowledged, to the Praiſe and Glory of God! that whereas a moſt wild, cruel, fierce, and violent Diſtemper, and which has deſtroy'd Millions of Lives, is now (by that happy Diſcovery made of its Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation) become tractable, ſafe, and gentle.</p>
               <p>And it may be further ſaid of this Practice, that if it were not to ſave the Life of one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Perſon in the Small-Pox, yet inaſmuch as it ſaves from loſs of Eye-ſight, a Senſe &amp; Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament ſo very valuable and dear to us, and from other Deformities, and from abundance of Pain and Miſery to the Sick, and from a great deal of Diſtreſs, Charge, and Trouble to the Well; ſo it would, or ought to be thought, a valuable Practice, by ſome at leaſt.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding we recommend this Method to be ſo very favourable in it ſelf; yet howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there ought and muſt be juſt Allowance given, why ſome are fuller, and have more complaints than others; as ſome may have it, more than others, in the Diſpoſition of their Blood, and other Juices, to produce larger Crops, and to bring on, and ſubject them to
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003259_0056_0FF02DBEEB6705E0"/>more &amp; worſe Complaints than others; and more eſpecially thoſe that come into the Practice loaded or filled with other Diſeaſes, not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ten thouſand Accidents we are expos'd to, more or leſs, each Day we live. And ſhall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation be charg'd with, and anſwer for theſe: No: It ſhou'd rather be conſider'd, how much worſe it might have fared with them, if they had happened to have had it in the natural Way. And tho' it is look'd upon as Criminal, while now the Practice is but young, to uſe it upon infirm, and ſickly Perſons; yet where ſuch Perſons are in Danger of taking the Infection in the natural Way, I think it much more criminal to refuſe ſuch Subjects, and truſt them to the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of a mercileſs Diſtemper, who have a much leſs Chance to get well thro' it, than thoſe who are of a more healthful and ſtronger Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But where they can be preſerv'd from both, I think it highly juſt and neceſſary that they ſhou'd. Women with Child, I wou'd have them to avoid the Small-Pox every way, but if they cannot, let them receive it by Tranſplantation, and it is my opinion that to ſave the fruit, it wou'd be beſt in the middle or later Months than before, and to ſave the Mother, at any time, rather than to have it in the natural Way. I ſhall conclude this whole Account with ſome Directions, which may be of Uſe and Service to the Unexperienced, in managing the inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Small-Pox, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:003259_0057_0FF02DEA6CE44770"/>1 IF the Perſons you wou'd inoculate are of ill Habits of Body, let them be firſt purged, vomited, &amp; bled; one or other of theſe, if not all, as their Circumſtances may require, and repeated, as there may be Occaſion, once, twice, or oftener; and be dieted for ſome Time, and that a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, more or leſs, as you may think proper, after they have done taking Phyſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they may have Time to recruit, and their Bodies to become ſettled before you bring a Diſtemper on them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If they are of healthful Conſtitutions, it may be as well to inoculate them without any previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Preparation; for if they are ever ſo well prepared, yet a ſmall Accident may happen to put them into ſuch Diſorders, or ſuch Symptoms may ariſe, as may call for Bleeding, Vomiting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> although theſe have been uſed but juſt before: And I would obſerve that in all my Number, there was not ten that had any Medicinal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration before the Operation was made upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take your Medicine or Pus from the ripe Puſtules of the Small-Pox, of the diſtinct Kind; either from thoſe in the natural Way, or from the inoculated Sort, provided the Perſon be otherwiſe healthful, and the Matter good. The Time when this Matter is fitteſt to be taken, is uncertain; in ſome it may be on the 9th, others on the 11th, 12th, 13th, or 14th, Day after
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:003259_0058_0FF02DC19B32B908"/>Eruption, and two, three, or four Days after the Pox is turn'd upon them; the beſt is white, even, and thick, and without ſmell. My Way of taking it, is thus: Take a fine cut ſharp Tooth-pick, (which will not put the Perſon in any Fear, as a Lancet will do many) and open the Pock on one ſide, &amp; preſs the Boil, and ſcoop the Matter in your Quill &amp; ſo on: When your Quill is full, empty it into a clean dry Viol, and ſo take what you can, or what you have Occaſion for; which keep cloſe ſtopp'd for Uſe, and in a cool Place, except you are going to uſe it preſently; for Heat ſoon ferments &amp; deſtroys it. And ſo long as it retains its white Colour, and even Conſiſtence, and that without ſmell, you may depend it is good. And when it is otherwiſe, throw it away, waſh your Viol very clean, or take a new one, before you gather any more.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Places I have made choice of to inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in, for the Convenience of dreſſing, are, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the outſide of the Arm above the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, and the inſide of the Leg near, or in the Place where Iſſues are commonly made; and two Inciſions are ſufficient for one Subject. Let the Inciſions be made with a good Lancet thro' the true Skin, (by pinching of it up between your Fingers) a-croſs the Fibres, and about a quarter of an Inch long, ſuch as would receive a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pea in caſe you were to make an Iſſue, and drop one full Drop (after wiping off the Blood) into the Inciſion; or moiſten a ſmall bit of Lint in the Matter, and put that into the Inciſion,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:003259_0059_0FEFDA48C648BFD8"/>applying over it a ſimple Diachylon Plaiſter, and gently bind it on with a Compreſs, Fillet, or Roller, and keep them in the Houſe, and from the Air.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The next, and ſo every Day, dreſs with the ſame Plaiſter, or with Cabbage or Colewort Leaves, in order to digeſt, or bring them to run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sores.</p>
               <p>If at any Time an Inflammation ſhould ariſe in or about the Inciſions, or Pain and Swelling in the Arm-pit or Groin, apply hot Poultices made of white Bread and Milk, to the Sores, (and Swellings, if any there be) twice a day at leaſt; and ſo continue them until the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, Pain, and Swellings go off or diſappear, which, if you keep your Patient warm, will be accompliſh'd ſoon; continue thoſe Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſome Days after, leaſt the Symptoms ſhould return.</p>
               <p n="6">6. After they are inoculated, until the 4th or 5th Day, (unleſs they are ill before) let them eat and drink, ſparingly, ſuch Diet as uſually they did before, and take gentle Exerciſe in their Chamber.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When the Illneſs comes on, be it ſooner or later, with Sickneſs or Shiverings, fluſhing Heats, wandering, or other Pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> keep them war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and from Fleſh and Fiſh of all Sorts, and Cheeſe and Milk too: And if they appear much
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:003259_0060_0FF02DC8D886A408"/>out of Order, put them to Bed, darken the Room, and let them reſt. Now let them take all their Food, as Spoon-meat hot, and Drink aired; and if it be a young Child, it may have a Milk Diet, or Milk in its Pap or Gruel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Let their Drink be Water with a well brown'd Toaſt in it, Barly-Water, or about a Thimbleful of Oatmeal, and four Spoonfuls of Milk boil'd in a Quart of good ſoft Water, or common Teas, as they may beſt ſuit your Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's Palate and Stomach; and ſome may be allow'd good White-Wine in their Drink, more or leſs, as their Stomach may require, ſupporting them with innocent Spoon-Meats, and other Harmleſs Diet, and wait on Nature, obſerving the Indications which ſhe may give you, and act accordingly; that is, if ſhe is oppreſt in any Part, and is not able to help herſelf, aſſiſt her; but if ſhe is not ſo oppreſt, leave her to herſelf, for ſhe is the beſt Phyſician, when able. And if you err, let it be in under, rather than in over-doing, for ſuch Errors are eaſier to reconcile, or be recover'd than the others are.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Their Illneſs does uſually begin on the 6th, ſome few on the 7th Day after Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Small-Pox break out on the 9th; it happens ſometimes to break out on other Days, tho' but ſeldom. If your Patient has been ill two Days, and full of Complaints; as for Inſtance, taken ill on the 6th, and the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:003259_0061_0FF02DEEF13B2A28"/>Pox not out upon the 9th, give a gentle Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, either in the Morning or the Evening: And if the Small-Pox does not come out in 4, 6, or 8 Hours after, and the other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms do not abate, apply ſome bliſtering Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and, if Occaſion, ſome drawing Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the Feet, and renew them daily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Patient is relieved, and the Symptoms are gone off. And for the better coming, and keeping out of the Pox, let them have <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Snake-root, or Sheep's Dung Teas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whiles, or a little Saffron or <hi>Gaſcoine</hi>'s Powder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. If they are hot and thirſty, and the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plentifully of hot Teas, or other cooling ſmall Drinks (as they may crave) does not take off thoſe Symptoms, and there appear Signs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, take away ſome Blood, as the Age and ſtrength of the Patient may admit of, and the Caſe require. You may bleed them, if full of Blood, and the Symptoms urgent, at any Time, <hi>viz.</hi> at the coming out, filling, or turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Pox.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Your chief Care in this Method ſhould be at the beginning of their Sickneſs, to govern the Symptoms (if any bad ones ſhould ariſe) in time, and to ſee that the Small-Pox does well come out; which you may know by the Patient's Eaſe and Quiet (except they are uneaſy by their Soreneſs, which is not to be regarded) in order to accompliſh which, when wanting,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:003259_0062_0FF02DCB9472E0E8"/>your Vomit and bliſtering Plaiſters, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times your Lancet, will be of great Service: But be very careful in your Vomits, leſt they over-work, weaken, and hurt your Patient, and your Reputation too: You had better give the Patient three or four, than one too ſtrong; therefore, if poſſible, be ſure to know your Vomit. Antimonial are better than Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitable Vomits, tho' not ſo ſafe and gentle.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Do not be too free with Anodines, or Pacificks, at the Beginning of the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; more eſpecially, until there be proper Evacuation made: And if your Patient ſhould be attended with more Fever than is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and want Reſt, give a Spoonful of the following oily Mixture, every four or five Hours, ſhaking the Viol well each Time of taking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of Oil of Sweet Almonds, new drawn, and Syrup of Marſh Mallows, of each two or three Ounces, mixt in a Viol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or if your Patient requires ſomething more warm, Cordial, &amp; driving out, give them this, as follows,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of Treacle and Plague Water, of each ſix Drachms; black Cherry Water, Oil of Sweet Almonds, and Syrup of Violets, of each one Ounce; of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Saffron, in Powder, ten Grains; Tincture of Caſtor, one Drachm, mixt in a Viol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the Patient take of this, as there may be Occaſion, ſooner or later in the Diſtemper, at proper Intervals of Time, a ſpoonful, more or leſs, at once, in three, four, or five Hours
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:003259_0063_0FF02DF3B9574A70"/>Time, obſerving to ſhake the Viol each Time of taking. If your Patient nauſeates oily Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, give this in lieu of that above, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take of Milk, or black Cherry Water, three Ounces; Treacle, or Plague Water, one Ounce; compound Piony Water, three Drachms; Diaphoretick Antimony, and <hi>Gaſcoin</hi>'s Powder, each half a Drachm; Loaf Sugar, ſix Drachms, mixt in a Viol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If your Patient wants a Stool, procure one with a Suppoſitory; if too looſe, check or ſtop it; their being a little bound may be well, but their being looſe (except in Infants) may be hurtful.</p>
               <p n="13">13. However, when there is a real Occaſion for Anodines, you muſt give them as in other Diſtempers; but Note, that there is not a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for their common Uſe here, as is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the natural Small-Pox; for this inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Small-Pox does not affect the Brain and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> or corrupt the Blood and other Juices, as the natural commonly does. And in many there is no more Fever than is neceſſary, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Symptoms, that juſtly may require ſuch Medicines. And in others, where there is a Shew of ſuch Symptoms, they may go off at the coming out of the Pox, or at three or four Days after the Pox is out, and never return again, as I have often ſeen.</p>
               <p n="14">14. I have given but few Receipts, or direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to but few Medicines; yet more, I hope, than there will be Occaſion for to make Uſe of in one of twenty Patients in this Method; and becauſe I know there is no Want of Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Small-Pox, they being already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:003259_0064_0FF02DCFA83D3560"/>by others; and that the Phyſician, in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Difficulty, will uſe his own Judgment, and order what he thinks moſt proper to ſuit the Caſe, and help his Patient.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Generally ſpeaking, (if your Patients are of tolerable Habits, and came into the Practice free from a prior Infection) you will have but little to do, after Eruption, but to watch againſt Accidents, and regulate the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Part; and when any new Symptoms do ariſe, make diligent Enquiry, and conſider well from what Cauſe they proceed; if you can find it out, the Remedy may be near at Hand, <hi>viz.</hi> if from any Thing you have preſcribed that did not ſuit the Patient, forbid the further Uſe; and, if neceſſary, order ſomething that may ſet all right: If from a Fault in Nurſing, let that be rectify'd, <hi>viz.</hi> in Meat, Drink, or Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, up or in Bed, too many or too few; and if they have taken cold, nurſe the Part where the Cold began, by adding more Coverings to keep it warm, (be it in one Part of the Body, or other) as well as order ſuitable Diet and proper Medicine.</p>
               <p>Such Rules well obſerved, may ſave you much Trouble, and the Patient much Pain and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his Life too, in many other Diſeaſes, as well as in this of the inoculated Small-Pox.</p>
               <p>There ſhould be great Care taken in inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Medicine be good, and that the Inciſions be made thro' the true Skin, leſt the Operation ſhould prove fruitleſs, and the Patient afterward ſhould take it in the other Way; as two of mine might have done, had I
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:003259_0065_0FF02DF826260978"/>not, in Time, inoculated them again, and ſo prevented that Misfortune.</p>
               <p>In caſe you ſhould have, thro' ill Habits of Body, or the like, any of your Inoculations that will not give way to, and heal with white Bread and Milk, treat them as you would do other common Sores, <hi>viz.</hi> with Fomentations and ſtronger Digeſtives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S this was a melancholy day to Inoculation, in its infancy, that ſo many appear'd (who were ſuppos'd Judges) to oppoſe and condemn it, and the following Print coming out ſo powerful and ſtrong againſt it, which was ſufficient to inflame and ſet almoſt the whole Town and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try againſt me and this Method; and whereas it has been induſtriouſly ſpread abroad, doing Miſchief in the World where it came, I thought it juſt and proper to confront it with my own Account, that it might in ſome Meaſure prevent thoſe ill Effects for the future.</p>

Being ſummoned by Authority to appear at the Town-Houſe in <hi>Boſton,</hi> before the Select-Men of the ſaid Town, to give an Account of what might come to my Knowledge in Relation to the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration called <hi>Inoculation,</hi> lately practiſed in this Town by Dr. <hi>Boylſtone</hi> of this Place.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The firſt Inſtance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>ABout twenty five Years ago I was at <hi>Cremona,</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> Army, where there were thirteen Soldiers upon whom this Operation was performed, of which Operation four died, ſix reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with abundance of Trouble and Care, being ſeiz'd with Parotidal Tumours and a large Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Throat; one of them was open'd, his Diaphragm was found livid, the Glans of the Pancreas tumify'd, and the Caul gangreen'd. On the other three the Operation had no Effect.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Second Inſtance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Year 1701, being in <hi>Flanders,</hi> there was committed to my Care, by Monſieur <hi>Le Duc de Guiche</hi> Col. of Dragoons, one Capt. <hi>Huſſart,</hi> taken ill of the Small-Pox, who told me in theſe very Words, <hi>Ten Years ago I was inoculated five or ſix times, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that curſed Invention's taking Effect upon me; Muſt I then periſh</hi>? He was ſo violently ſeized, that

                               rendition="simple:additions"/>he had ſeveral Ulcers on his Body, eſpecially one on his Arm, which occaſion'd a Lameneſs thereof for Life. It was not the Fault of the Care of the Surgeon, Major of the Regiment, <hi>De Guiche,</hi> and ſeveral other Surgeons who came frequently to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Third Inſtance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At the Battel of <hi>Almanza</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Small-Pox being in the Army, two <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Soldiers had the Operation perform'd upon them; one recover'd, the other receiving no Impreſſion, but ſix Weeks thereafter was ſeiz'd with a Frenzy, ſwelled all over his Body. They not calling to Mind that the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration had been perform'd upon him, believed that he was poiſoned. It was order'd by Dr. <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetius</hi> Phyſician to his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>Orleans, Don Larencio Bollatio, Don Bentura Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rera,</hi> two of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Phyſicians, that the Body ſhould be opened; his Lungs were found ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated, from whence they concluded that it was the Effect of that Corruption which having infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Limphae, did throw it ſelf upon that Vital Part, which occaſion'd his ſudden Death.</p>

                        <p>At a Meeting by Publick Authority in the Town-Houſe of <hi>Boſton,</hi> before His Majeſty's Juſtices of the Peace and the Select-Men; the Practitioners of Phyſick and Surgery being called before them, concerning <hi>Inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> agreed to the following Conclusion.</p>
                        <p>A Reſolve upon a Debate held by the Phyſicians of <hi>Boſton,</hi> concerning Inoculating the Small-Pox, on the twenty firſt Day of <hi>July,</hi> 1721.</p>
                        <p>IT appears by numerous Inſtances, That it has prov'd the Death of many Perſons ſoon after the Operation, and brought Diſtempers upon many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which have in the End prov'd deadly to 'em.</p>
                        <p>That the natural tendency of infuſing ſuch malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Filth in the Maſs of Blood, is to corrupt and putrify it, &amp; if there be not a ſufficient Diſcharge of that Malignity by the Place of Inciſion, or elſewhere, it lays a Foundation for many dangerous Diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>That the Operation tends to ſpread and continue the Infection in a Place longer than it might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be.</p>
                        <p>That the continuing the Operation among us is likely to prove of moſt dangerous Conſequence.</p>
