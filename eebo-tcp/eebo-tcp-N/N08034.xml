            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>HAD the ſovereign Lord of life ſelected for death me, who am ſpeaking to you, inſtead of him who was your paſtor, and my "fellow-laborer, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, in the kingdom and patience of Jeſus Chriſt," he would, I doubt not, have been concerned, that ſuch a providence might have quickened his care in preparing to follow after in his turn. And had he
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010254_0004_0F7E25D900A3D950"/>
been called to preach upon my departure out of the world, as I am upon his, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuppoſe but he would have taken occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from ſuch a diſpenſation to put his hearers in mind of their own end; urging them to conſtant diligence, in the uſe of all means, that they might get and keep themſelves in readineſs for it. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the voice of heaven in the affecting inſtance of mortality we are invited this day to lament before God: And it very loudly and ſolemnly calls to us all. "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." And may the voice of ſo ſtriking an article in the conduct of God not only enter into our ears, but into our hearts! that it may have an abiding good effect upon our lives.</p>
            <p>IN order to this, I ſhall employ your meditations on the well adapted, important words of the wiſe and inſpired Solomon, which have been juſt read to you; taking occaſion from them to conſider death as "the end of all men," and to explain and urge the duty of "laying to heart" this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and affecting truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:010254_0005_0F7E25D96CA7B788"/>
THE wiſe man had been ſpeaking of "the houſe of mourning;" and he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins thereupon the awakening obſervation in the former part of my text, <q>that is the end of all men.</q> His meaning is, that death is the common fate of the whole hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race; that we may all as certainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to die, and to be carried to the grave, as thoſe whoſe funerals we are at any time called to attend.</p>
            <p>ONLY, let it be carefully remembered here, his thus ſpeaking of death, as "the end of all men," is not to be underſtood as favoring the notion of thoſe, who ſuppoſe that death puts a "final period to man's exiſtence." Such an interpretation of his words would be a contradiction, not only to the general doctrine of the Bible, but to the doctrine of this royal preacher himſelf in this very book; which is, that "the ſpirit of a man," when he dies, "goeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards," that is, to God, that God, who, as he ſays, "will bring every work into judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:010254_0006_0F7E25D9D9C52718"/>
HE does not therefore call death "the end of all men," becauſe it puts an end to their being; but becauſe it terminates their ſtate in this world; introducing them into a new and different manner of exiſtence. Death is their "end," not as they ceaſe, by means of it, to be any more at all; but as it deſtroys their preſent mode of life, with all the connections therewith, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances thereon, ſo far as they relate to this lower world.</p>
            <p>THE human ſystem is a moſt curious piece of divine workmanſhip. It conſiſts of two eſſentially different parts, a "body" that is wonderfully put together, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered capable, by means of its various or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization, of a great many valuable purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and a "ſoul" that is furniſhed with powers of a more noble and excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuch as thinking, reaſoning, reflecting, and perceiving both pleaſure and pain, with admirable variety, in kind and degree, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt without end. Between theſe two, though quite different from each other, there is <q>ſo intimate a relation as to conſtitute one perſon, or living agent. And ſuch is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010254_0007_0F7E25DA940E2BA8"/>
their mutual dependance, that the "mind" perceives for the whole body, cares for all its members, and directs all its motions: And, on the other hand, the "corporeal organs" convey to the mind the knowledge of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal objects, and are the fit inſtruments of its active powers.</q> This is our frame, and thus we live in the world. In conſequence of theſe wonderfully formed "bodies" and "ſouls," and the cloſe union there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, we become capable of all thoſe employments and enjoyments, whether bodily or mental, ſecular or religious, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the benefit of life, and in the due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning and regulating of which lies its perfection and glory in this preſent ſtate, and its preparation for the enſuing one. Now death puts an end—to what? To the relation there is between ſoul and body, and their mutual ſubſerviency to each other, and every thing dependant thereon. No more pleaſure is conveyed by the eyes, or ears, or any other of the organs of ſenſation; no more ideas are introduced into the mind from external nature, at leaſt in the uſual way: Nay, the mind itſelf can no longer exert any of its powers by the mediation of the body. There is now an end put to all the labors, buſineſſes,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010254_0008_0F7E25DB50629098"/>
and amuſements of the preſent life; to all the ſatisfactions ariſing from external objects, from friendſhips, from relations, or ſocial communications of any kind; yea, even our very thoughts, depending on the body, do now periſh, together with all our deſires and wiſhes, all our projections and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, whether for ourſelves or others.</p>
            <p>THIS now is the "end" which death brings upon "all men." It at once puts a period to all our pleaſures as well as pains, to all our hopes as well as fears, to all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, diſtinctions, and callings, whether civil or religious.</p>
            <p>PERMIT me here to make a pauſe, and put you in mind of the obligations of love and gratitude you are under to Jeſus Chriſt, thro' who<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is we have the hope of a glorious immortality, notwithſtanding all that death can do to deprive us of life. Though death, which is the common lot of all men, will "end" our being in this preſent ſtate, diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the union between our ſouls and bodies, and rendering us abſolutely incapable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and enjoyment from any thing in this lower world; yet, thanks be to God, it will
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010254_0009_0F7E25DDF6404288"/>
not deſtroy our exiſtence as "living agents." For we are taught, in "the goſpel of the bleſſed God," which has "brought life and immortality to light," that the "ſoul" ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives the funeral of the body, and is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, by means of death, into another ſtate, wherein it exerts its active powers in a new and different way, tho' quite unknown to us at preſent: Nay, we are aſſured in the ſacred books, particularly thoſe of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the "end" which death puts to the relation between our ſouls and bodies, in conſequence of which our bodies are no longer animated with life and activity, but gradually fall to pieces, and crumble into common earth: I ſay, we are aſſured, in the books of revelation, that this diſunion, which death makes, ſhall not laſt always; but that the time is coming, and haſtens apace, when our ſouls and bodies ſhall be again united to exiſt in this union in the eternal world. Says our Savior Jeſus Chriſt, "The hour is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the which all that are in their graves ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and ſhall come forth." And they who have done well, approving themſelves his true diſciples, and faithful followers, ſhall come forth to enjoy an immortal life of happineſs. This
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010254_0010_0F7E25DEDF97D848"/>
is clearly and fully certified to us by the Apoſtle Paul in theſe words, "We look for a Savior, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change our vile body that it may be faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like unto his glorious body." And again, "I his corruptible muſt put on incorruption, and this mortal muſt put on immortality. So when this corruptible ſhall have put on incorruption, and this mortal ſhall have put on immortality, then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying, that is written, death is ſwallowed up in victory. Thanks be to God for Jeſus Chriſt, thro' whom we obtain this victory."</p>
            <p>LEL us, my brethren, relieve our minds under the ſad proſpect of death, and tho "end" it puts to our being in this preſent ſtate, with the hope the goſpel gives us, not only of another manner of exiſtence in our ſouls immediately after death, but of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting again both in ſoul and body, and in a world where there will be "fullneſs of joy" forever. Only, let us take care to behave in the preſent life, ſo as that our future immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality may be this happy and glorious one.</p>
            <p>IT is a thought particularly worthy of our moſt ſerious attention, that our exiſtence in
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010254_0011_0F7E25DF79C058F8"/>
the ſtate that is beyond the grave, and after the general reſurrection, will not be a bleſſed one, unleſs, in this day of our trial, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come qualified, for thoſe employments and enjoyments that will make it ſo. We ſhall all live, 'tis true, notwithſtanding death, in the other world; "for as in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive:" But then, this life will be an happy one to thoſe only, who ſo improve their preſent opportunities, powers and advantages, as to get formed to a meetneſs for the glories of the heavenly world.—</p>
            <p>AND this leads me to explain and urge the duty ſpecified, in the latter part of my text, "the living will lay it to his heart."</p>
            <p>NOT that this is always the truth in point of fact. This cannot be the meaning of the words. One might be ready indeed to think, that ſo common and certain a fate as death would be ſeriouſly conſidered by all; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they have placed before their view a ſtriking example of what will be their own caſe in a very little time, at longeſt. But it is found to be far otherwiſe in experience, and by obſervation. Though we know not
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010254_0012_0F7E25DFD1A866A8"/>
how ſoon our friends and acquaintance may be called to attend our remains to the dark and ſilent grave; yet, we are ſtrangely inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to ſo momentous an event. We do not "lay it to heart;" we are not affected with the conſideration of it, ſo as to "num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our days aright, applying our hearts to wiſdom," the wiſdom of being religious, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nding principally "the one thing needful."</p>
            <p>WHEN therefore the wiſe man ſays, "the living will lay it to heart," his intention is, not to declare what they do in fact; but what they ought to do, and what they will do if they act as is befitting frail, dying creatures.</p>
            <p>"THE living will lay it to heart," that is, they will, if they are wiſe, fix their thoughts upon their "laſt end;" making death the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſubject of their ſerious and ſolemn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. That which is laid to heart engroſſes the attention. The mind is penſive, and in a manner taken up with the object before its view. One's thoughts are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually running this way. If therefore "the end of all men" is what "lies upon our heart," we ſhall, at proper times, eſpecially
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010254_0013_0F7E25E097D6E7C0"/>
when called in the providence of God to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the death of others, turn our thoughts from the things of time and ſenſe, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them in ſerious conſideration of that fatal period which death will put to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of all men, and our own in ſpecial, on this preſent ſtage of action. Not that meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinking on the human frame, as that which will ſhortly come to an "end" here, is all that is intended by "laying death to heart;" but this is one thing meant by it: for, that can never be ſaid, with any propriety or truth, to be "laid to heart," which our minds are not intent upon, ſo as that it is the ſubject of our engaged meditation.</p>
            <p>"THE living will lay it to heart." Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, and the principal one here meant, is, that they will be ſo affected with a ſerious ſenſe of their "end" as to be put upon ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble endeavours to get prepared for it. When any thing of a temporal nature "lies upon our heart," we do not reſt ſatisfied barely with employing our thoughts about it; but are ſo impreſſed with concern, as to be urged on to that method of conduct which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted to the object that engages our ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. And, in this ſenſe, "the living," if
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010254_0014_0F7E25E150266640"/>
they are wiſe, "will lay the end of all men to heart." They wont content themſelves with a ſlight and tranſient conſideration of death, like "a man, who, beholding his face in a glaſs, ſtraitway forgetteth what manner of man he was"; but this ſerious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truth will fill their minds, and excite in them a deep concern; ſuch an one as will be practical, influencing them to a becoming care, in the uſe of all proper means, that they may be fitted for the great event of their dying, and leaving this preſent world.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort, this "laying death to heart," in the ſenſe the wiſe man uſes the phraſe, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſuch an awakened vigorous attention to the affairs of our ſouls and another world, as will be effectual to diſengage us from our ſins, and put us upon "living in all good conſcience towards God." We ſhall, if we are ſuitably affected with "the end of all men," be active in our endeavours to become poſſeſſed of, and daily to improve, every chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian grace; abounding in all thoſe works of righteouſneſs, which, "by Jeſus Chriſt are to the praiſe and glory of God." We ſhall cheriſh no beloved ſin, we ſhall live in the neglect of no known duty; but ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010254_0015_0F7E25E415EC1368"/>
to yield a ſteady, uniform, chearful, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal obedience to the divine precepts. We ſhall, in a word, (for I may not enlarge) make it our earneſt care, that the ſeveral graces of faith, love, humility, meekneſs, patience, contentment, weanedneſs from the world, and reſignation to the divine pleaſure, may have a real exiſtence in us, and diſcover that they have by their being thrown out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to acts, as occaſions may be offered therefor in the conduct of providence, to the glory of God, and our being in a preſent actual meetneſs for the approach of death, and an happy immortality by means of it.</p>
            <p>THIS it is, and this only, that makes it fit and reaſonable, that our hearts ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in thinking upon "the end of all men." If our attention to this ſubject does not awaken a concern in us, and ſuch an one as will influence us to practical endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours that we may be ready for death, it will be to no religious purpoſe. This therefore, if not the only, is the principal ſenſe, in which the inſpired Solomon is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, when he ſays, "the living will lay it to heart," that is, if they act up to their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as reaſonable creatures.</p>

LET me now urge both myſelf and you to this wiſdom of conduct, by making it our great care ſo to think of our "end," as that we may be fitted for a glorious immortality beyond the grave. To be prepared for this, by getting formed in our minds the principles of piety towards God, faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and all the graces and virtues that conſtitute and adorn the chriſtian character, ſhould be our main buſineſs, the chief em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of our lives in this world. And the ſooner we ſet about this important work, the better: Nor ſhould any of us dare to run the venture of procraſtinating in an affair that is ſo nearly connected with our eternal welfare.<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Mayhew, ſome years ago, preached and publiſhed a volume of ſermons, his deſign in which was, to "anſwer the pleas of delaying ſinners," and to "excite them to ſpeed in turning their feet into the path of God's teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies." He has ſaid every thing pertinent to the ſubject, and in a ſerious, pathetic, and yet moſt convincing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It were to be wiſhed, diſcourſes ſo well adapted to put men upon inſtant endeavours that they may become religious, were more generally attended to.</note> Young people eſpecially are apt to be guilty of this ſolly; imagining that age is the time for ſerious thoughtfulneſs, the proper ſeaſon to make preparation for death and the other world. They ſuppoſe the evil day of death to be at a great diſtance, and think it is time enough hereafter to mind
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010254_0017_0F7E25E5882BEF28"/>
their ſouls, and provide for their exiſtence in the future ſtate.—But how knoweſt then, O vain young man, but that an "end" may be ſoon put to your days here on earth? "There are," as we read in the book of Job, "that die in youth." And it is often ſeen to be the truth of fact, that "one dieth in his full ſtrength, being wholly at eaſe and quiet. His breaſts are full of milk, and his bones are moiſtened with marrow." And ſhould any of you be of that number that ſhall be ſelected for death in the prime and vigor of life, what a pitiful excuſe would it be for your neglect of your ſouls, and their everlaſting ſalvation, that you hoped you ſhould have lived till you were "full of days"! Oh! tis perfect madneſs in young people to depend upon life, eſpecially upon life protracted till old age, and ſo to depend upon it as to live thoughtleſs of religion, and take no care to provide for their eternal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in another world. Let me beſeech you to hearken to that advice of pious David to his ſon Solomon, "Thou Solomon, my ſon, know thou the God of thy father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind." And ſuffer your mind to be impreſſed with the powerful motives with
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010254_0018_0F7E25E5DE4AF1A0"/>
which he enforces this advice, in the words that immediately follow, "For the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts. If thou ſeekeſt him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forſakeſt him, he will caſt thee off forever." Be perſuaded alſo to attend to that exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Solomon himſelf, when he had paſſed through the age of youth, and was come to ripeneſs of years; "Remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou ſhalt ſay I have no pleaſure in them."</p>
            <p>MY being thus particular in ſpeaking to young people, upon the preſent occaſion, may be a word in ſeaſon, as they make ſo great a part of this congregation. And I the rather thought there was a propriety in it, as, I know, your now deceaſed paſtor was greatly concerned that your minds might, in early life, be ſavingly impreſſed with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſenſe of God, and the principles of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine chriſtianity. To this end he preached, but a few years ſince, a courſe of excellent ſermons, "exhorting" you, the young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his charge, "to be ſober-minded."
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010254_0019_0F7E25E6902C6568"/>
It was at the deſire of many of you, ſignified to him in writing, that they were printed for your ſpiritual edification. He is now dead; but he ſtill ſpeaks to you, and with great affection and ſolemnity, in theſe diſcourſes. I heartily recommend them to your ſerious, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and conſiderate peruſal. They are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably well adapted to inform your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to awaken your paſſions and, by all the motives that can be fetched from this world or another, to engage your endeavours, to begin a religious courſe of life betimes, and to go on in it all your days. It will be your own fault, if you are not perſuaded, by what you will meet with in them, to make it the grand buſineſs of your life to get formed to a readineſs for the world you are haſtening to.</p>
            <p>AND let this be the care of us all, be our age, ſtation, or condition, what it will. There is nothing we can be urged to that more nearly concerns us. 'Tis an affair of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting importance.</p>
            <p>ARE we any of us conſcious to ourſelves, that we have all along, even to this day, lived thoughtleſs of our "end," neglecting to make
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010254_0020_0F7E25E75A262720"/>
preparation for it? Oh! what a wretched ſtate are we in! And how can we be "at eaſe in Sion," when we know not how ſoon, or ſuddenly, a period may be put to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance on the earth? Suppoſe the holy God ſhould ſpeak to us in the language he did to one in the days of Chriſt, "this night thy ſoul ſhall be required of thee:" O the horror of mind we ſhould be thrown into! When Belſhazzar ſaw "the hand-writing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wall," though in the midſt of his companions, and in the height of mirth and jollity, how was "his countenance changed"! And how did "his thoughts trouble him"! A lively emblem of the awful ſurpriſe thoſe may be ſeized with, who are overtaken by death, while they had no expectation of ſuch an event, and had made no proviſion for it. O how are they confounded, and amazed! What anguiſh filleth their hearts! How cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is the review of their paſt neglects! How tormenting the ſenſe of their loſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities! And how does the reflection on their paſt folly awaken their paſſions, alarm conſcience, and cauſe them to turn upon themſelves with the keeneſt reſentments.</p>
            <p>THERE is not a more pitiable ſight, than that of an unconcerned, ſecure, and ſtupid
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010254_0021_0F7E25E875F59170"/>
ſinner, ſuddenly arreſted by death, and ſent to the place of ſeparate ſpirits in the inviſible ſtate. To be turned out of the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration of our latter end, and, being unprepared for it, to fall under the ſentence of the ſlothful and wicked ſervant, "caſt ye the unprofitable ſervant into outer darkneſs," where there ſhall be "weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth;" what more ſhocking! what more terrible!—Who can expreſs the inſupportable agony of ſuch a poor ſoul! It ſurpaſſes all language! It goes beyond the reach of conception!</p>
            <p>BUT let us turn the proſpect, and ſuppoſe on the other hand, that we have "laid death to heart," have ſo conſidered this "end of all men," as that we have been effectually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to "yield ourſelves up to God" thro' Chriſt, to love him with all our hearts, and to ſerve him with all our might, by a due uſe of our time, powers and talents:—In this view of the matter, how ſafe is our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! What ſecurity may we feel in our thoughts! What peace in our conſciences! What joy in our breaſts! The moſt ſudden aſſault by death would do us no harm, as being prepared for ſuch an event. We
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010254_0022_0F7E25E9185F6CF8"/>
might have confidence towards God, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, or in what manner ſoever, we are called hence. And ſhould the call be ſudden, O how pleaſingly ſhould we be ſurpriſed to perceive, that we were now "in the city of the living God, the heavenly Jeruſalem," aſſociated with the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect; with an innumerable company of angels; with the general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born, which are written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; with Jeſus the mediator of the new-covenant; and with God the judge of all!" And who is able to deſcribe the happineſs of that ſtate we are now in! "Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into man's heart to conceive" of the greatneſs of it.</p>
            <p>NOTHING beyond this can be ſaid to urge upon us the duty of "laying the end of all men to heart." The inſpired books have propoſed no higher motives to excite our hopes, and alarm our fears, that we might be rouſed to action. And if we will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded neither by theſe mercies, nor terrors of the Lord, we muſt reap the fruit of our own folly. No arguments that are more powerful can be uſed with us.</p>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:010254_0023_0F7E25EB83B29820"/>
I HAVE now done with my text; tho', I believe, you expect that I ſhould, before I conclude, take ſome ſpecial notice of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting occaſion which gave riſe to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding diſcourſe from it. And, I freely own, I am in no want of an inclination to do all the honor and juſtice I can to the memory of one ſo richly accompliſhed as Dr. Mayhew is known to have been. Nor will any ſuſpect the truth of what I ſay, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the friendſhip there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. This began upon his firſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a Preacher of the Goſpel, and has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ever ſince with mutual eſteem, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and delight. I will therefore "mourn in ſecret places", God's "putting far from me" ſo good a friend, his "removing ſo dear an acquaintance into darkneſs". This me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly occurrence has, I am ready to think, excited in my breaſt like ſenſations of grief with thoſe which David felt upon the death of his beloved <hi>Jonathan;</hi> and I can, with all ſincerity, lament over him in the pungent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of his afflicted heart, "I am diſtreſſed for thee, my brother JONATHAN; very pleaſant haſt thou been unto me".</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:010254_0024_0F7E25EBF5FD7110"/>
I MAY, having obſerved this, be tho't, in ſome meaſure, qualified to portray his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; tho' in the doing of it, I ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly careful neither to flatter the dead, nor deceive the living: And, I think, I ſo far know myſelf as to be ſure, that I dare not, at ſuch a time as this, and in ſuch a place, attempt a delineation which I did not really believe was right and juſt.</p>
            <p>"THE Father of ſpirits" was pleaſed, in his diſtinguiſhing goodneſs, to favor Dr. Mayhew with ſuperior mental powers. Few ſurpaſſed him either in the quickneſs of his apprehenſion, the clearneſs of his perception, the readineſs of his invention, the brightneſs of his imagination, the comprehenſion of his underſtanding, or the ſoundneſs of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And, together with theſe gifts of God, he was endowed with a ſingular great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, fortitude of ſpirit, and yet ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and benevolence of temper: all which, being enlarged and ſtrengthened by a good education, and the opportunity of free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with men and books, ſoon qualified him to make a conſiderable figure in the world; as he was hereby enabled to ſpeak and write with that freedom of thought, that
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010254_0025_0F7E25ECA2797080"/>
juſtneſs of method, that ſtrength of argument, that facility of expreſſion, that livelineſs of fancy, that purity of diction, and that appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent concern for the good of mankind, which procured him a name, both here and abroad, which will be remembered with honor long after his body is crumbled into duſt. It was this that made way for his correſpondence beyond the great waters, which was daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing: And, had the wiſdom of God ſeen fit to have continued him in life, it might have been of great ſervice to his country as well as himſelf, if we may judge from what it has already been.</p>
            <p>HE was eminently a friend to liberty both civil and religious.<note n="*" place="bottom">His firſt printed diſcourſes were upon the ſubject of LIBERTY. His view in them was, to aſſert and maintain the RIGHT OF PRIVATE JUDGMENT. Few have wrote more copiouſly, more elegantly, or more forceably upon this intereſting point. If, in ſome inſtances, the Dr's imagination got the better of his judgment, betraying him into too warm and ſatyrical expreſſions, the candid will be diſpoſed to make all due allowances, conſidering his inexperience of the world, being then in his youthful days. It was this performance that firſt ſpread his ſame, and rendered him conſpicuous as a writer, both here and abroad.</note> And if his zeal, at any time, betrayed him into too great a ſeverity of expreſſion, it was againſt the attempts of thoſe who would make ſlaves either of men's ſouls
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010254_0026_0F7E25ED515F1520"/>
or bodies. He nobly claimed that which he eſteemed equally the right of others, the liberty of thinking for himſelf: And he made uſe of all proper helps in order to his thinking right. He freely conſulted the writings of men of all perſuaſions, not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to read the works of ſyſtematical divines, and metaphyſical ſchoolmen; tho' he paid no regard to any thing he found in them, but in ſubſerviency to the ſacred books of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Theſe he firmly adhered to, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the revelations of God; making them the one only rule of his religious faith. "What ſaith the ſcripture"? was his grand enquiry; and, as his ſentiments as a chriſtian and divine were the reſult therefrom, he had the honeſty and reſolution to preach and publiſh the truth in Chriſt, according to the apprehenſion he had formed of it. If he differed from ſome others in a few points<note n="†" place="bottom">Two or three years ago a pamphlet appeared among us, under the name of an obſcure perſon without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, wrote either by himſelf, or a certain offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious lay-gentleman of his acquaintance, aſhamed or afraid to be known as its author, in which the Dr. was repreſented as an <hi>enemy to the atonement by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The real writer of that piece, whoever he was, knew little of the Dr, or the true meaning of his works. He might as well have taxed any miniſter in the Town or Province upon this head: for there was not one, to my knowledge, that was more firm and ſteady <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010254_0027_0F7E25EEA5411818"/>
they differed as much from him: Nor had they, on this account, any greater right to judge him, than he had to judge them; tho' he did not preſume to do this, as he tho't, with exact truth and juſtice, that we have all one common Lord to whom we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, and by whoſe judgment ONLY we ſhall either ſtand or fall in the coming great day of tryal.</p>
            <p>HE was an avowed enemy to all human eſtabliſhments in religion, eſpecially the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of meer ceremonial rites as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to chriſtian communion. And as he eſteemed this a direct uſurpation of that right which is proper only to Jeſus Chriſt, the only ſupreme head of the chriſtian church, it may be an excuſe for him, if he has ever expreſſed himſelf with too great a degree of aſperity upon this head.</p>
            <p>IT was highly offenſive to him, when he perceived in any an evident breach of truſt; eſpecially, if the truſt related to the things of religion and another world. And as he had upon his mind a clear and full conviction, in common with many others, that this breach of truſt was juſtly chargeable upon a certain
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010254_0028_0F7E25EF06570430"/>
reſpectable ſociety at home, tho' they might be led into it thro' repeated miſinformations from their correſpondents here; it was this that gave riſe to the ſeveral pieces he wrote upon this ſubject; in which he honored him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſerved theſe churches, and prevented the application of much of that charity for the propagation of Epiſcopacy, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the propagation of chriſtianity. He has received acknowledgments from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land on account of theſe writings, and from ſome of the Epiſcopal perſwaſion, who were fully with him in his ſentiments upon the main point he had in view.</p>
            <p>BESIDES what has been ſaid, thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Dr. muſt have obſerved that manlineſs of Spirit, that friendlineſs of diſpoſition, that freedom and chearfulneſs of temper, which rendered him agreable to thoſe who had the opportunity of converſing with him. They muſt alſo have ſeen his amiable behaviour in the ſeveral relations of life. As a huſband, how faithful and kind! As a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how tender and affectionate! As a Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how juſt and equal! knowing that he had a maſter in heaven. As a friend, how true to his profeſſions! with what confidence
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010254_0029_0F7E25EF9016FCF0"/>
to be truſted in! As a neighbour, how ready to all the offices of love and goodneſs! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being deficient, he rather exceeded in the acts of his liberality and charity. As a miniſter, how diligent, how laborious, how ſkilful! making it his care to contrive his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes ſo as to inform the mind and touch the heart, ſo as at once to entertain and profit both the learned and the illiterate, the polite and leſs cultivated hearer. Few were able to compoſe their ſermons with ſo much eaſe, and yet ſo much pertinence; and few preached with greater conſtancy, or took occaſion more frequently from occurrences in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of providence to make what he ſaid ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and profitable to his hearers.</p>
            <p>BUT what is more than all that has been offered, he was, in the judgment of thoſe who beſt knew him, a man of real piety and true devotion, an upright ſincere diſciple and ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt. Was it proper to mention the time, manner and circumſtances of his becoming poſſeſſed of that faith in God and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, which purified his heart, and became in him an habitual pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful principle of virtuous action, I doubt not but even thoſe would entertain a good
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010254_0030_0F7E25F292158440"/>
opinion of him as a real chriſtian, who may have been greatly wanting in their candor and charity towards him, becauſe, in ſome points, his tho'ts did not agree with their's. I have abundant reaſon to believe, from what I know of him, that it was his great endeavour to live in all good conſcience towards God and man. And ſhould I appeal to you, the people of his charge, you would all, I doubt not, riſe up and declare his approbation and practice of the "things that were true, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, juſt, pure, lovely and of good report". You would appear as witneſſes and ſay, that he had been to you "an example in word, in converſation, in charity, in faith, in purity", and in all thoſe other virtues which adorn the chriſtian's and the miniſter's character: Not that he was without his imperfections and failings. I know he had them, and he knew it too; and every one elſe knows that he has many infirmities, who, in any tolerable degree, knows himſelf. But he was uniform and ſteady in his regards to the religion of Jeſus; not placing it in "tythes of mint, annice and cummin", but the practice of "the weightier matters of the law, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, mercy and faith": Tho', after all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of "truſting that he was righteous", in
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010254_0031_0F7E25F40DBE8A18"/>
the ſenſe of rigorous law, he eſteemed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf "an unprofitable ſervant", and had his dependance on the mercy of God, thro' the mediation of the only Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. In this temper he lived, and in the ſame tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I believe, he would have died, had it pleaſed the alwiſe, righteous and holy Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of the world to have permitted the free uſe of his reaſonable powers. And he is now, as to his ſoul or ſpirit, we charitably believe, in that inviſible world, which was the great object of his hope, and where he will be happy without any mixture of evil forever.</p>
            <p>YOU, his dear relatives, entertain this tho't of him; and while this is your faith, how can you indulge to immoderate grief? Weep you may, but it ought to be for yourſelves, not for him, who is beyond the reach of ſin and ſorrow, and has enter'd into the joy of his Lord.</p>
            <p>WE heartily ſympathiſe with you all; wiſhing you the ſupports of grace, and the conſolations of God which are not ſmall.</p>
            <p>

IT is, in ſpecial, our hearts deſire, that the amiable perſon, left in ſolitary widow-hood by the death of a moſt tender huſband, may be comforted of God in this day of her trouble. Her caſe is pitiable. We could not blame her, if, in the agonies of her grief, ſhe ſhould break forth in thoſe affecting words, "have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O my friends! For the hand of the Lord has touched me." 'Tis recorded of the bleſſed Jeſus, that he "wept" over his dead friend Lazarus; and he will not take it amiſs, ſhould the paſſion of grief be ſtirred in you, and vent itſelf in tears, upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of him who was "the deſire of your eyes", and with whom you lived ſo happily, while it pleaſed God to continue you together.

God", pity your diſtreſſed caſe, and ſend you help and comfort "from his holy dwelling place"! And let "all the congregation ſay, Amen"; and, I doubt not, but they will do it with their whole hearts.</p>
            <p>WE unite alſo in our prayers to the God of heaven for the Children, ſo early in life, bereaved of their earthly father. Wherein could the holy God have more nearly touched them? What greater outward good could he have taken from them? What a guide would he have been to their childhood and youth? How careful would he have been of their education? Eſpecially, that they might have been fitted to be bleſſings in the world, and to do worthily in their generation? But, if their earthly parent would have been good to them, how much more will their father in heaven concern himſelf for their welfare; taking them under his ſpecial guidance, even to death? Their ſollicitous mother may hope that he will, and it is our ardent prayer that he would: and ſhe may be encouraged in her hope, and we in our prayer, from the thought, that God has been pleaſed to make himſelf known under that endearing title, "the father of orphans", the God with
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010254_0034_0F7E25F59157A2E0"/>
whom "the fatherleſs find mercy".—I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear recommending theſe orphan-children to the compaſſionate regards of you, the people of God in this place; nor can I ſuppoſe but you will be ready to ſhew them kindneſs in the Lord. I bear you record, you were kindly affectioned to their departed father; making diſcoveries of it in ſutable acts of benevolence.—Remember, I beſeech you, theſe dear parts of himſelf he has left behind him; and "to do them good forget not; for with ſuch ſacrifices God will be well pleaſed".</p>
            <p>SUFFER me now to leave with the flock of Chriſt, in this place, the following advice; which, if received in love, and duly practiſed upon, may, by the divine bleſſing, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to you.</p>
            <p>CONSIDER the death of your paſtor as bro't about, in all its circumſtances, under the over-ruling agency of the alwiſe, righteous, holy and merciful Sovereign of heaven and earth. And let this thought compoſe you to ſilence and ſubmiſſion. Be ſtill, and know that he is God. Let none dare, ſo much as in their hearts, to "find fault" with him, or
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:010254_0035_0F7E25F681717DD8"/>
to ſay unto him "what doeſt thou"?—What he has done is the effect of alwiſe counſel.—It is beſt as it is; for God has done it. And "who can mend the work which his hand has wrought"?</p>
            <p>INQUIRE each one of you, wherein you may have had an hand in bringing this evil upon yourſelves. It may be ſome of you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained too exalted thoughts of him, placing an undue dependance on his gifts and talents. In this caſe, God might be diſpleaſed.—It may be, ſome of you, inſtead of being wro't upon by the inſtructions, counſels and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which God diſpenſed to you by the mouth of his ſervant, ſtopped your ears, and hardened your hearts, and are to this day going on in your treſpaſſes: ſhould it be thus with any of you, you have infinite reaſon to turn upon yourſelves with the keeneſt reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. You have ſlighted, to an high degree of guilt, the miniſtry God was pleaſed to ſet up among you, and it may be in anger to ſuch of you that he has taken it from you. You cannot therefore better improve this providence than by humbling yourſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and betaking yourſelves to his mercy thro' Chriſt for pardon, in the exerciſe of a deep repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:010254_0036_0F7E25F8B65777F0"/>
AND you ſhould all remember "how you have received, and heard". Often call to mind the great truths, relating to your ſouls, and your everlaſting ſalvation, which have been ſo ſeriouſly and preſſingly delivered to you from this deſk, that you may ſtill reap ſpiritual advantage from them. "I beſeech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that, as you have received, of your deceaſed paſtor, how ye ought to walk, ſo ye would abound more and more". "Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leſt, being led away with the error of the wicked, ye fall from your ſtedfaſtneſs": But "grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt". "My beloved brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt, immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; forasmuch as you have been taught, and know, that your labor is not in vain in the Lord".</p>
            <p>AND as you are now as ſheep without a ſhepherd, it is the hearty prayer of all your friends, that you may not be ſcattered; that God would keep you united in love, and in his own time, which is the beſt, direct and lead you into the choice of another paſtor, who ſhall long live to be a bleſſing to you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:010254_0037_0F7E25F99FA7A340"/>
"BRETHREN, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them that are ſanctified".</p>
            <p>I HAVE only to ſay, as Dr. Mayhew was a friend to theſe churches, and their able advocate; eſpecially in regard of that "liberty wherewith our Lord Jeſus Chriſt has made them free": As he was a friend to the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and has exerted his powers to my knowledge in defence of its reputation and intereſt: And as he was a friend to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in general, entertaining an high opinion of the more ſpecial errand upon which our progenitors came over into this then deſolate wilderneſs, and has vigorouſly laid himſelf out in opposing any deſigns that might have been formed to ſubvert it:—His death, in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of his days, and height of his uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may juſtly be eſteemed a great and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic loſs, calling for univerſal lamentation.</p>
            <p>WE may reaſonably cry to God for help, when men of ſuch importance are taken out of the world. And we have great encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement to do ſo, as with him is "the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of the ſpirit". He can raiſe up, qualify
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:010254_0038_0F7E25FAA439F4D0"/>
and ſpirit others to ſupply their place, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his cauſe, and do yet more worthily for him, in their day and generation. Let us reſt our ſouls on God as the alone all-ſufficient ſource of all good.</p>
            <p>"Now to him who only hath immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, dwelling in light, which no man can approach to, whom no man hath ſeen, or can ſee; of whom, thro' whom, and to whom are all things: to him be given all glory and honor, dominion and bleſſing, by all creatures in heaven and earth, forever and ever.</p>
