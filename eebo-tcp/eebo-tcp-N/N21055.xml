            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>OF all the fooliſh actions a perſon can commit, I think that of making an apology for a voluntary error, is the moſt ridiculous; therefore, tho' I have taken up my pen to write a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, I am utterly at a loſs what to ſay.</p>
                  <p>If it is true that "Good wine needs no buſh, and a good play no Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue," then muſt it be equally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that a good book requires no preface—and this aſſertion acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be true, in what an awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:027654_0004_0FD567CB50B3F488"/>
predicament do I ſtand, ſince to publiſh this work without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, will be tacitly to infer, that it is good and needs no recommendation, and ſo be deſervedly cenſured as a conceited ſcribler.</p>
                  <p>Should I write a preface and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the performance, confeſs it has innumerable faults, and requeſt the reader's pity and patience, I not only prepoſſeſs them againſt it, but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge myſelf an idiot, for ſuffering it to meet the public eye, in ſuch an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate. What then am I to ſay, or how fill up thoſe few pages neceſſary to be placed at the beginning of a book?</p>
                  <p>Shall I tell the reader my deſign in publiſhing theſe volumes? I will; It was an anxious deſire to ſee all my dear country-women as truly amiable as they are univerſally acknowledged beautiful; it was a wiſh to convince
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:027654_0005_0FD56795545B6918"/>
them that true happineſs can never be met with in the temple of diſſipation and folly, ſhe flies the glare of faſhion, and the midnight revel, and dwells on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the heart conſcious of performing its duty, and is the conſtant compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe, who, content with the ſtation in which it has pleaſed Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to place them, entirely free from envy or malice, make it their whole ſtudy to cultivate thoſe amiable virtues which will render them at once beloved, admired and eſteemed, by all who know them.</p>
                  <p>Whether I have executed this deſign well or ill, muſt be hereafter deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, not only by thoſe partial friends whoſe kind encouragement prompted me to ſubmit theſe pages to the inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the public: but, a-well-a-day for me, I muſt alſo be judged by ſome ſage critic, who, "with ſpectacle on noſe, and pouch by's ſide," with
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:027654_0006_0FD567CCC9F8AC60"/>
lengthened viſage and contemptuous ſmile, ſits down to review the literary productions of a <hi>woman.</hi> He turns over a few pages, and then
<q>
                        <l>Catching the Author at ſome that or therefore,</l>
                        <l>At once condemne her without why or wherefore,</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, alas! what may not be my fate? whoſe education, as a female, was neceſſarily circumſcribed, whoſe little knowledge has been ſimply gleaned from pure nature, and who, on a ſubject of ſuch importance, write as I feel, with enthuſiaſm.</p>
                  <p>I have taken the liberty of placing a poem at the beginning of the work, which was publiſhed ſome few years ſince in the novel Victoria, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parents utterly forbid their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters reading any of that ſpecies of writing, I thought I ſhould readily be excuſed for introducing it here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="v" facs="unknown:027654_0007_0FD5679703179488"/>
I muſt confeſs, I have neither ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient conceit or fortitude to enable me to hear, unmoved, the deciſion of <hi>judicious</hi> criticiſm; yet, conſcious that I never wrote a line that would convey a wrong idea to the head, or a corrupt wiſh to the heart, I ſit down ſatiſfied with the purity of my intentions, and leave it to the happy envied claſs of mortals, who have received a liberal education, to write with that taſte and elegance which can only be acquired by a thorough knowledge of the claſſics.</p>

                  <head>HISTORY OF MENTORIA.</head>
                  <p>MENTORIA, or rather Helena Aſkham, was the only child of a brave ſoldier, who, though born to move in but an humble ſphere, had courage, magnanimity, and fortitude, that might have become a ſtaff officer, but he never roſe to higher rankthan a ſerjeant, in which ſtation he acquitted himſelf with ſo much honor that he was univerſally eſteemed by his ſuperiors, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by his equals. He was, at an early age, married to the daughter of a reputable tradeſman, who preferring the hardſhips of war, to a ſeparation from her huſband, reſolutely followed him to every campaign. It was at the frege of Quebec, that our gallant veteran was wounded and left dead on the field: his faithful partner, unable to ſupport the ſhocking tidings which were abruptly conveyed to her, fell into premature labour, and in giving birth to a female infant, rendered up her own life.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Dormer was acquainted with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, and determined to protect the poor little orphan—ordered it to be provided with a nurſe; and when he wrote to England, informed his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Lady Winworth, of the charge he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027654_0016_0FD567D81CCEE890"/>
requeſting ſhe would permit the little He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena to be ſent over to be educated with her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Her ladyſhip acquieſced, and Helena ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſafe in England, when only two years old, and was immediately admitted into the nurſery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the little Winworths, and as ſhe grew up enjoyed with them the benefit of a polite and liberal education.</p>
                  <p>The young Lord Winworth, as he advanced towards manhood, could not behold the young orphan without ſome emotions of tenderneſs, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena was pleaſing in her perſon, and elegant in her manners, but ſhe was endowed with diſcernment and ſenſe far ſuperior to the generality of young women of her age. She poſſeſſed ſenſibility enough to be unable to liſten with coldneſs and inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ardent profeſſions of a young noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who to the advantages of birth and fortune, added a prepoſſeſſing figure, and every polite ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment—but ſhe knew that he was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly young, and that, in all probability, however eager at that time to enter into indiſſoluble engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he would hereafter repent his precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, and regret that he had not matched with one more ſuitable in rank and fortune. She alſo reflected that ſhe ſhould, by accepting him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint the hopes of his mother, and prove her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ungrateful to a woman who had ever treated; her with maternal tenderneſs, "And ſhall I,"
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027654_0017_0FD567A30EB22178"/>
ſaid ſhe, <q>for the gratification of a paſſion which has perhaps aroſe from childiſh fondneſs, and only gains ſtrength by not being oppoſed, entail on myſelf the anger of my beſt benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and lay myſelf open to the ſneers of the world, by matching ſo far above my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nay, will not my huſband be laughed at for raiſing a poor orphan to his rank and title. I am determined to ſtifle this riſing paſſion, and to inform my Lady of the unfortunate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of her ſon.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This judicious reſolution ſhe immediately put in execution. Lady Winworth liſtened to her with a mixture of ſurpriſe and admiration. "My dear Helena," ſaid ſhe, "you ſhall never want a friend while I exiſt. This generous conduct has rendered you more amiable than ever. My ſon is but a boy, I will ſend him abroad, and in all human probability a few years ſpent at ſome of the gayeſt Courts in Europe, will entirely era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this youthful <hi>penchant."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the young gentleman was informed of his mother's deſire that he ſhould travel, he flew to Helena, and earneſtly entreated her to conſent to a private marriage before his departure. She laughed at his importunity, though her little heart was ready to rebel, and ſhe ſound to laugh (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever repugnant to her feelings) was the only way
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027654_0018_0FD567D98AF505F0"/>
to avoid an affecting interview. Her mirth piqued him, "You do not love me, Helena," ſaid he. "I never told you I did, my Lord." "But your looks, your actions, have contributed to make me think you did." "Why, my good Lord," ſaid ſhe ſmiling, "I do love you moſt affectionately, and wiſh for nothing more than to ſee you happy." "Then why not conſent to our immediate union?" cried he eagerly." Becauſe I love you as a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hope to ſee you, when you return, married to ſome lady of birth, merit, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and to figure as bride-maid on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion." "Unaccountable girl," ſaid he, peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, "then only promiſe me to remain ſingle till my return." "Indeed I ſhall not, my Lord, for I have no intention to wear a willow garland; and ſure I am, that ſhould I make ſuch a promiſe, we ſhould both repent it before the year was out." "Nay, Madam," ſaid he, angrily, "if you are of ſo light a diſpoſition—" "It is even ſo," cried ſhe, with affected vivacity, "therefore, as you are warned, pray beware, and think no more of ſo trifling and inconſtant a character."</p>
                  <p>When Helena retired to her own apartment, ſhe gave free vent to her feelings; and in order to avoid the pain of parting, requeſted permiſſion of Lady Winworth, to pay a viſit to a young lady, who lived ſome miles from town. The old Lady ſaw the propriety of her requeſt, and immediately
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027654_0019_0FD567A52DA98B70"/>
granted it. She therefore departed the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leaving only a card, wiſhing his lordſhip health and much pleaſure in the courſe of his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels. So ſtriking a proof of her indifference in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed his reſentment, and he left England with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of thoſe pangs which he imagined he ſhould ſuffer when ſeparated form his Helena.</p>
                  <p>The event proved that Helena was right; for when Lord Winworth returned, he brought with him a bride, lovely, amiable, and his equal in rank and fortune. When his lordſhip left Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he took with him a young gentleman, as a travelling companion; this gentleman did not ſee Helena previous to his departure, but at his return, charmed with her innocent vivacity and judicious conduct, requeſted permiſſion to pay his addreſſes; which was immediately granted, and on their union he was preſented with a poſt under govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he enjoyed till his death.</p>
                  <p>Helena being then left in rather ſtraitened cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, was requeſted to become governeſs to the daughters of Lord Winworth; ſhe conſented, on condition that they might be permitted to retire with her into the country. His lordſhip purchaſed a eſtate in Wales, and thither ſhe retired with her young charge.</p>
                  <p>On the death of his wife, Lord Winworth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:027654_0020_0FD567DB17A75FC8"/>
her to bring his girls to town, and become their conductor in public, as ſhe had been their preceptreſs in private: but this ſhe reſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed.</p>
                  <p>On the ſeparation of the young ladies from their kind, almoſt materna. end, they requeſted a continued correſpondence might be kept up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. Mentoria was the appellation they had ever given her, and under this name was the correſpondence commenced.</p>
                  <p>As her letters are interſperſed with entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tales appoſite to the ſubjects on which ſhe wrote, I have avoided giving any of the young ladies' letters, as they would only prove an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption to the general deſign.</p>

I miſs the dear lively ſallies of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude, and the innocent prattle of Letitia: but though I ſo ſeverely feel the privation of your beloved ſociety, I am not ſo ſelfiſh as to wiſh you again in the ſhades of Cambray.

                     <p>Though ſeparated from you, I ſhall, as you deſire, ſtill continue your preceptreſs, and ſhall not at any time ſcruple to tell you of your faults; for partial as I am to your virtues, I am by no means blind to thoſe errors to which human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ever ſubject, and which, if not timely era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated,

will gain an aſcendancy over your mind, and entirely hide thoſe amiable qualities, which at preſent form the moſt ſtriking traits in your character.</p>
                     <p>And to begin—I feel myſelf greatly hurt and offended by the letter I received from Gertrude, ſince your arrival in London. When it was firſt delivered into my hands, a joyful ſenſation dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed itſelf over my heart, and while reading the tender expreſſions of grateful affection that ſeemed to flow ſpontaneous from your pen, it expanded with pleaſure; but when I came to theſe words, "My father received us with great affection, and has been very bountiful in preſents, cloaths, pocket-money, &amp;c. but yet for all that, my dear Madam, I cannot feel that perfect affection for him, which I know I ought. He has a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny peculiarities, ſome of them by no means plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and my ſiſters all agree, he is very much of the Baſhaw."</p>
                     <p>Good Heavens! ſaid I, and is this all the fruit I am likely to reap from the pains I have taken to inſtil into the minds of thoſe dear girls a juſt idea of what is meant by the words, Filial Duty. That the very firſt letter I receive ſhould point at the little foibles of a parent, who they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge received them with affection, and has been extremely bountiful to them. Believe me,

my dear children, if you wiſh to paſs through life with any degree of pleaſure to yourſelves, you muſt early learn to ſubmit, without murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the will of your father; be blind to his errors, or if they are ſo glaring that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid ſeeing them, never expoſe them, or ſuffer others to ſpeak diſreſpectfully of him in your preſence.</p>
                     <p>You muſt ſacrifice your own wiſhes to his, you muſt ſtudy his happineſs and eaſe, and in ſo doing will moſt aſſuredly promote your own.</p>
                     <p>You no doubt remember the amiable Mrs. Railton, who favored me with her company for a few weeks laſt ſummer. I yeſterday received news of her death, and as I am certain example is ever more efficacious than precept, I will give you a ſlight ſketch of her hiſtory, as a model by which every young woman who wiſhes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote her own felicity, will regulate her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
                     <p>Mr. George Campbell was the youngeſt ſon of a wealthy baronet, who having ſeveral livings in his gift, beſides good intereſt at Court, brought him up to the church, with the ſanguine expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one day ſeeing him a biſhop.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="unknown:027654_0024_0FD567E0D655F0F8"/>
Unfortunately for George, before he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his twenty-third year he became attached to a young lady, who had every requiſite to render the married ſtate happy, but money—and money being the old gentleman's darling idol, he conſequently thought ſhe poſſeſſed no requiſite worthy the wife of his ſon; but George was too far engaged to retreat with honor, he therefore told his father, he was reſolved upon the union, and in a few days preſented his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Louiſa to entreat his bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>When Sir James found they were really mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, he thought it was in vain to fly in a paſſion, he received them cordially, and gave them, an univerſal invitation to his houſe, but in his heart he never forgave them. The livings were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of to other people, and at his death he left the whole of his eſtates to his eldeſt ſon.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Campbell had only a curacy of about eighty pounds a year, and as regular as the year came round, his wife preſented him with a child. Poverty took up her habitation among them, and he bitterly regretted having, by an act of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, not only brought on himſelf his father's diſpleaſure, but involved an amiable woman, whom he loved, in a ſcene of penury and diſtreſs. Theſe reflections ſour'd his diſpoſition, he became peeviſh and moroſe, nay ſometimes went ſo far, as
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:027654_0025_0FD567A8C9EE2510"/>
to reproach his wife as the cauſe of his abject ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Campbell took great care to inſtil into the minds of her children the reſpect and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion due from them to their father. "My dear children," ſhe would often ſay, "be aſſured, a breach of filial duty is ever attended with regret, and in general with miſfortune."</p>
                     <p>Louiſa was the eldeſt of five children, ſhe was mild, meek, and affectionate. She attentively liſtened to the precepts of her mother, and laid them up in her heart as an ineſtimable treaſure. Mr. Campbell's temper grew ſo extremely bad, that not only his wife, but his children came in for a ſhare of his ill-humour. Louiſa, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, was ſure to be wrong, in whatever ſhe ſaid or did, and it was ſeldom ſhe was favoured with a kind or affectionate word, yet her manners were ſo amiable and her form ſo lovely, that though ſhe laboured under the diſadvantages of a narrow education and extreme poverty, her company was courted by ſome of the genteeleſt families in the village, but in compliance with her father's ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humour, ſhe was ſeldom allowed to ſtir from home.</p>
                     <p>When Louiſa had reached her ſeventeenth year, Lady Mary Campbell, a diſtant relation of her
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:027654_0026_0FD567E28E2425D0"/>
father's came on a viſit to a family who reſided in the ſame village, Louiſa's good qualities were reſounded to Lady Mary from every mouth, and all unanimouſly agreed it was a pity ſo lovely a girl ſhould be buried in obſcurity and loſt for want of a proper education.</p>
                     <p>Lady Mary was naturally of a humane diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe expreſſed a deſire to ſee Miſs Campbell, and when introduced to her, finding her even ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to what ſhe had been taught to expect, made her an offer of going with her to London.</p>
                     <p>This was a propoſal, too much to Louiſa's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to be refuſed; the invitation was accepted, and the viſit prolonged for three years, during which time Louiſa had an opportunity of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving herſelf in the ornamental as well as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful branches of education.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Campbell, who had for many years la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured under an evident decline, was now ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned home by that power, who had been pleaſed in this life to try her with long and heavy afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Lady Mary carried Louiſa to receive the dying bleſſing, and pay the laſt duties to her ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mother.—That finiſhed, ſhe propoſed her return to London. The lovely girl, penetrated with gratitude for the many favours ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and tenderly attached to her generous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactreſs,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:027654_0027_0FD567AD46D84220"/>
with difficulty reſtrained her tears, while ſhe thus addreſſed her—</p>
                     <p>"Think me not ungrateful, dear Madam, if I beg to remain with any father; my brothers and ſiſters are engaged in learning occupations which may enable them to paſs through life with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and without reproach. I cannot leave my father in this ſolitude after ſo recent an afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: he has been for many years uſed to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitting attention and tenderneſs of my excellent mother, I muſt not ſuffer him too ſeverely to feel her loſs, but endeavour, as far as in my power, by affection and aſſiduity, to ſupply her place."</p>
                     <p>"And can you, my dear Louiſa, ſaid her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip, ſo eaſily forego the eaſe and plenty you have enjoyed with me, to live a life of penury and labour, and that for a man, who, though he is your father, I muſt ſay, does not deſerve ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention—did he not always treat you with unme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited harſhneſs?"</p>
                     <p>"Hold, my dear Madam," ſaid Louiſa, if, as you think, my father has not behaved to me with the kindneſs of a parent, it by on means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſes me from my duty to him; had he a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand errors he is my father ſtill; as ſuch I am called upon by nature and religion to do every
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027654_0028_0FD567E4CAF12D90"/>
thing in my power to render his life comfortable; if my endeavours to pleaſe can awaken his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall think myſelf amply repaid; if not, the conſciouſneſs, of having performed my duty, will give me a ſatiſfaction which no future event can ever rob me of."</p>
                     <p>It was in vain Lady Mary urged her to return—the lovely. elegant, accompliſhed Louiſa, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a low roofed manſion, ſcanty meals, and attendance on a ſick peeviſh father, to the lofty apartments, plenteous table, and variety of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhe might have enjoyed with Lady Mary. She attended him to the laſt, and by her tender ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude and affection ſmoothed the down-hill of his life, and cheared and comforted him in the moſt painful illneſs by her unaffected piety; he was moved by her filial duty, all the father ruſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſoul, he bleſſed her with his parting breath, and expired in her arms.</p>
                     <p>You may, perhaps, enquire, what benefit Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa reaped from this rigid performance of her duty? The queſtion is eaſily anſwered. She gained a contented happy mind, ſerenity dwelt in her heart and chearfulneſs beamed from her eyes.</p>
                     <p>She had a genteel competency left her at Lady Mary's death, married a deſerving man, and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:027654_0029_0FD567AFA7717150"/>
ſhone as conſpicuouſly in the characters of a wife and mother, as ſhe had done as a daughter—ſhe lived beloved by all and died univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted.</p>
                     <p>Be wiſe, my dear children, follow Louiſa's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſo ſhall your lives be happy and your laſt moments peace.</p>

                     <p>I AM ſorry, my dear ladies to be under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable neceſſity of again taking up my pen to reprove,</p>
                     <p>Your letters to me of late, have arrived ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and when they do arrive, are ſo ſhort, ſo filled with dreſs, viſits, and parties of pleaſure, that I almoſt doubt whether ſome demon has not imitated your hand-writing, to impoſe upon me; for I can find no veſtige of thoſe ſentiments I ſo anxiouſly ſtrove to inculcate in your minds while in the ſhades of Cambray: from the tenor of your letters, I ſhould imagine you live entirely in a crowd, if ſo, you certainly have no time to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to thoſe improvements I ſo ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to you not to neglect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="unknown:027654_0030_0FD567E722174798"/>
You ſeem alſo to have taken an unaccountable diſlike to Mrs. Clairville. You ſay your father is a great deal too partial to her; this appears to me the evident effect of envy or jealouſy; your father being perfectly ſenſible of that lady's merit, and conſcious that her ſituation in his family is rather humiliating, by treating her with uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reſpect, ſhews the goodneſs of his heart, and ſets an example which I ſhould rejoice to find my dear girls would follow.</p>
                     <p>Another thing which ſeriouſly alarms me for your future happineſs is, to find you have your friends and ſecrets, and form little cotteries, of which neither your father nor Mrs. Clairville have any knowledge; believe me, you cannot be too cautious in the choice of your intimates, many a girl, whoſe intentions have been perfectly inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, has loſt her reputation, by aſſociating with women whoſe levity has rendered their characters ſuſpicious. You cannot find in the whole circle of your acquaintance, a friend ſo ſincere as your natural parent, to him you may without reſerve, communicate every wiſh of your hearts, for truſt me when I ſay, every thought you would heſitate to reveal to a parent, muſt be totally improper to be harboured in your boſom. Perhaps you will tell me, that having no mother, there are ſome emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart, which the natural timidity and delicacy of your ſex would render it extremely painful to communicate to a father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="unknown:027654_0031_0FD567B457311E58"/>
As I am ſenſible of the truth of this aſſertion, I muſt recommend to you to choſe a friend from among thoſe moſt eſteemed by your father, let her be ſome years older than yourſelf, (for age, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, learn experience in the arts of the world) and by her advice, ſhe may, in ſome meaſure guard you from falling a prey to the diſſimulation of many pretendens to love or friendſhip, who will aſſume the ſemblance of attachment, to draw the unſuſpecting youthful heart into improper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, which too often terminate in their ruin.</p>
                     <p>A numerous acquaintance is, in general, of dangerous conſequence to young women, as it is impoſſible but in a multiplicity of characters there may be ſome, whoſe converſation and example it would be improper to follow, and ſuch is the frail ſtate of human nature, that bad habits are eaſily contracted, and can ſeldom if ever be eradicated. A girl juſt entering the ſtate of womanhood eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if ſhe is poſſeſſed of any perſonal or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal accompliſhments, and of an open ingenuous temper is ſurrounded with innumerable dangers; her reputation is of as delicate a texture, and may be as eaſily injured, as the faireſt bloſſom; the malignant whiſperings of envy, or the peſtiferous breath of ſlander, may in an inſtant blaſt it; it will droop under the keen eye of ſuſpicion, and too often thoſe who moſt pretend to admire its ſweets, will rudely pluck it from its parent ſtalk,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:027654_0032_0FD524451591D9C0"/>
deprive it of all its beauties, then throw it from them like a loathſome weed, leave it to periſh unpitied and unregarded, and to be trod to the earth by every unfeeling paſſenger, who may perhaps caſt on it a look of contempt, and cry, "Behold the once lovely."</p>
                     <p>There are many women in the world lovely in their perſons, elegant and engaging in their manners, who are yet very improper connections for girls, who wiſh to preſerve their reputation unſullied; of this deſcription I greatly fear your favorite Matilda is—the ſtrong diſlike ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes at the idea of your bringing either your father or Mrs. Clairville to ſee her, convinces me there muſt'be ſomething in her character which ſhe would not like to have diſcovered. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it was at a public ball you firſt formed an acquaintance with her; that a gentleman intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her to you, and chance afterwards led you in a morning excurſion to ride by her little <hi>chateau;</hi> you confeſs ſhe lives in an elegant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that ſhe is highly accompliſhed, and yet is always by herſelf. Would any woman of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and fortune, do you think, live thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe, have no female friends to aſſociate with, no little chearful parties to enliven her ſolitude, and when ſhe went into public, would ſhe go only accompanied by gentlemen? You ſay there is an air of myſtery about her; and, believe me, if
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:027654_0033_0FD567B58B01EEA0"/>
that myſtery was developed, it would diſcover nothing to her advantage. Let me intreat my dear girls to drop the acquaintance, or inform your father of it: if after a proper enquiry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her character, he ſhould approve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of your viſits, I ſhall be happy to find you have ſo agreeable a member added to your ſociety, and ſeverely blame myſelf for having judged ſo harſhly.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould not have ſo many fears concerning your intimacy with Matilda, had I not, ſome years ago, known a very amiable girl, who entirely forfeited her good name, and in the end her life, by aſſociating with a woman of light cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
                     <p>Harriet Harding had the miſfortune to loſe her mother when very young, and at a very early age took upon herſelf the choice of her own acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. She had been at the play one night, when a lady in the ſame box had ſhewn her many civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and at parting gave her a card, and begged to have the honour of ſeeing her.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Harding had remarked what paſſed, and on returning home, warned his daughter againſt forming any acquaintance with her, as ſhe was a woman publicly kept by a man of faſhion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="unknown:027654_0034_0FD567E9AD8EF6C0"/>
Harriet was giddy, thoughtleſs and fond of pleaſure; chance threw her again in the way of Amelia, and ſhe entirely forgot her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's injunction. A ſtrict intimacy enſued, ſhe was frequent in her viſits to Amelia, often went with her into public, and was charmed with the incenſe of flattery that was offered to her by the men. Mr. Harding had buſineſs which called him to a diſtant part of England, Harriet was left miſtreſs of her own actions, and choſe this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to go with Amelia on an excurſion in the country; in this excurſion they were attended by the gentleman who kept Amelia, and one of his friends, who was particular in his attentions to Harriet; the time flew on the wings of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and when they returned to town, (Mr. Harding being ſtill abſent) it was propoſed ſhe ſhould accompany the party to a maſquerade.</p>
                     <p>Harriet was a ſtranger to this ſort of amuſement, her ſpirits were exhilerated—ſhe did not think of leaving it till a late hour, and when ſhe mentioned going home Amelia was not to be found. The gentleman who had been her protector all the evening, begged permiſſion to ſee her home, ſhe conſented, and at the hour of five in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived at her father's houſe; a ſervant who had aroſe carly to perform ſome particular work let her in, and the gentleman followed her up ſtairs. She was ſurpriſed, but could not he ſo
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027654_0035_0FD567B74A8730C0"/>
rude as to tell him to leave the houſe; but how was her ſurpriſe increaſed, when throwing aſide his maſk and domino, he proceeded to take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties ſhe had ever been uſed to think of with abhorrence. Unable to defend herſelf from his inſults, ſhe ſhrieked aloud, and in a moment her father, who had returned the evening before, burſt into the room—her ſhame and terror over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came her, and ſhe fainted; an explanation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued between the father and the gentleman who had inſulted her, who ſhocked at the impropriety of his behaviour aſked Mr. Harding's pardon, and ſtaying till Harriet was recovered, gave her this advice at parting.</p>
                     <p>"I truſt, my dear young lady, this will be a warning to you in future, how you chooſe your intimates. Amelia is a woman ſo publicly known, that it was next to impoſſible for you not to have been acquainted with the lightneſs of her charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I am now fully convinced that you are a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of ſtrict honour, but, believe me, till this day I always thought you a girl who had either no reputation to loſe, or paid very little attention to ſo material a concern. I am ſorry to ſay there are numbers of perſons, of both ſexes, who have ſeen you with Amelia, who think the ſame, and whom it will be a very difficult matter to convince to the contrary; let me beg of you to break off a connection ſo derogatory to your honor, and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:027654_0036_0FD567EADAABBA70"/>
by the future propriety of your conduct regain that reputation, which your intimacy with ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous woman has conſiderably injured."</p>
                     <p>Harriet could anſwer only with her tears, which flowed plenteouſly, not only at hearing theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable truths, but from the reflection, that when the ſtranger was gone ſhe had ſtill her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's anger to endure; had this been all, Harriet might have thought herſelf happy, as by her fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture behaviour ſhe might have hoped to regain his confidence and favour, but the heedleſs girl too ſoon found, that not only her father watched her actions with a ſuſpicious eye, but all her female friends received her viſits with coldneſs, forbore to return them, and in a ſhort time entirely dropped her acquaintance; to add to her morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, a young gentleman who had for ſome time addreſſed her on an honourable ſcore, broke off the connection, and ſhe found herſelf as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary and as much neglected as though ſhe lived in a deſert."</p>
                     <p>"The conſequence was, that on her father's deceaſe, which happened ſoon after, finding her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without ſociety, ſhe renewed her intimacy with Amelia, and from being accuſtomed to an intimate acquaintance with vice in others, ſhe ſunk ſo low as to practiſe; it herſelf, without compunction or remorſe; till overtaken by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:027654_0037_0FD567BAD4F5A578"/>
and want (the ſure attendants on riot and intemperance) ſhe ſunk to an early grave, a victim to her own folly."</p>
                     <p>You ſee, my dear girls, Harriet was not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of a depraved inclination, ſhe ſhrunk with horror from the firſt approach of vice; her attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Amelia was founded on a love of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſhe enjoyed every luxury while with her, led a life of indolence, and was continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving preſents of ſomething to decorate her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; theſe were indulgences ſhe could not enjoy at home, for though Mr. Harding was a very ſubſtantial tradeſman, he would by no means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his daughter to launch into extravagance, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in her houſekeeping, dreſs, or pleaſure—he wiſhed to ſee every hour uſefully employed, and as youth in general are much more found of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure than employment, Harriet was delighted with the acquaintance of a woman in whoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ſhe could enjoy the one in its utmoſt extent, without ever hearing of the other.</p>
                     <p>I know my dear girls will tell me, there is no danger of Matilda drawing them into any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ſcenes, by gratifying their deſire of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, ſince their father indulgently allows them to enjoy every pleaſurable amuſement the metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis affords. But you are totally unacquainted with the world, there are a thouſand ways by which

an artful woman may ſteal upon the undeſigning heart, a thouſand ways by which ſhe may lead them to deſtruction. Be wiſe then, my ſweet young friends, and drop this acquaintance, before you feel any of its diſagreeable conſequences.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall in ſome future letter give you a few hints concerning the proper uſe of time, certain that however harſh you may for a moment think my reproofs, the native goodneſs of your hearts, will convince you they are meant ſolely for your good, and that you have not a more affectionate friend than</p>

<pb n="39" facs="unknown:027654_0039_0FD567BC5B184398"/>
to account for ſo many lovely, amiable women entailing miſery upon themſelves and their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than by the romantic ideas they entertain of love and friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>Love, my dear children, is a noble, generous paſſion, and when kept under the guidance of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, exalts and elevates the human ſoul; but the juvenile mind is apt to miſtake a tranſient like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or a ſudden impulſe of gratified vanity, for love; and many a girl from at firſt being pleaſed with the company of thoſe who indiſcriminately offer the incenſe of adulation to every young fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male begins to fancy one more particular than the reſt, and that one is undoubtedly deſigned to be her huſband. From the moment this idea takes place, Miſs is moſt violently in love, ſleeping or waking the dear youth is continnally in her thoughts, ſhe lives but in his preſence, when he is abſent ſhe only exiſts. She unboſoms herſelf to ſome dear girl nearly of her own age, and ſhe being her friend and confidant, the ſecret is to be kept inviolable. For want of ſome laudable purſuit to employ her time and engage her attention, ſhe indulges her fooliſh <hi>penchant,</hi> which originated firſt in vanity and was afterwards nurſed by fancy, till at length ſhe is in reality attached to a man, who perhaps never entertained a ſerious thought of her; he marries ſome other woman, and Miſs is left to ſigh at her hard late, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:027654_0040_0FD567EE9389B580"/>
of the perfidy of mankind, and indulge in a luxury of delicate ideal miſery. Nor is this all, her dear and faithful friend betrays her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to all the Miſſes of her acquaintance, who (though perhaps guilty of the ſame folly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) will not ſcruple to laugh at what they will term, her indiſcreet and fooliſh conduct.</p>
                     <p>Though ſuch a ſituation is certainly ſufficiently mortifying, yet it is by no means the worſt that may happen. A girl who imagines ſhe muſt be in love with the firſt man who ſays a few civil things to her, lays herſelf open to the deſigns of the object of her ideal paſſion, who if he ſhould happen to be an artful man, may take advantage of her partiality and credulity, to draw her into indiſſoluble engagements, which is in general the caſe when there is a fortune in the way, or where that charm is wanting, to plunge her into infamy.</p>
                     <p>I once knew a girl, who, poſſeſſed of every advantage which could be derived from wealth, beauty, honorable relations, and a polite liberal education, at the early age of eighteen fell a victim to a romantic paſſion, and in the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when ſhe ſacrificed the regard of her friends the hopes of future advancement in life, in ſhort, every thing that was valuable, ſhe fancied ſhe had done a praiſe-worthy action, by evincing her
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:027654_0041_0FD567BE0C18D510"/>
conſtancy and diſintereſted attachment to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of her firſt love.</p>
                     <p>Belinda Dormer went to the ſame ſchool with me, we contracted a great friendſhip for each other, and when the holidays ſeparated us, by calling each to her reſpective home, we trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up every little incident in our memories, whether of pain or pleaſure, that when we met we might exchange confidence, and live over our pleaſures, or ſoothe the remembrance of our lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle uneaſineſſes by participation.</p>
                     <p>Bell was a lovely brown girl, elegant in her form, accompliſhed in her manners, and lively in her diſpoſition; her heart was tender and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate, without the leaſt tincture of art or affectation, good-natured, eaſy, and credulous. She left ſchool at the age of ſeventeen, and was uſhered into the world, prepared to admire her, for ſhe was reputed heireſs to an immenſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. The Chriſtmas before ſhe was taken home, during the holidays, her father gave a hall in honor of her birth-day, a young officer, whoſe only recommendation was an handſome perſon and polite addreſs, and who depended on Mr. Dormer for father advancement in the army, requeſted the honor of her hand, and in the courſe of the evening danced himſelf ſo far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her eſteem, that ſhe implicitly believed him,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:027654_0042_0FD567F0129FEDD8"/>
when he told her ſhe was the lovelieſt creature in the world, and that he ſhould be miſerable if ſhe did not ſuffer him to hope he was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indifferent to her.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Dormer had placed great confidence in this young man, he had taken him from a ſtate of abject penury, placed him at a genteel academy, and when he imagined him capable of diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his duty, as became a man of honor and a ſoldier, purchaſed him an enſign's commiſſion in a regiment going to America, where he raiſed himſelf to the rank of captain, and was now juſt returned to England. Mr. Dormer ever intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the friend and patron of young Horton, but never dreamt of his aſpiring to his daughter, he therefore gave him a general invitation to his houſe, nor once thought but that his gratitude and honor would be ſufficient to prevent his forming any improper deſigns on the perſon or fortune of Belinda, beſides he was near ten years older than Miſs Dormer, and therefore there was no fear of an attachment taking place between them.</p>
                     <p>But Horton was an artful ambitious man, he long had wiſhed to enjoy the benefits of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent fortune, and looked on Belinda as the perſon by whoſe aſſiſtance he could obtain ſo deſirable an acquiſition. He had always been
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:027654_0043_0FD567BF4AEFD5D0"/>
ſucceſsful with the ladies, but the true ſtate of his finances being generally known, he found it impoſſible to ſucceed in any matrimonial ſcheme, except it was with the innocent and unſuſpicious, and Belinda was exactly ſuited for his purpoſe. He flattered, ſwore, knelt, wept, and acted every extravagance, till the ſimple girl made ſome confeſſions in his favor, he then prevailed on her to keep her partiality a ſecret from her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for he knew that her parents deſigned her for the bride of a young nobleman, who was at at that time abroad. He expatiated on the folly and cruelty of parents chooſing partners for their children, and launched out in praiſe of diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted love, talked of the union of ſouls, and a deal of ſoft ſentimental nonſenſe, about a life of uninterruped felicity with the object of her own choice, though ſhe was to live in the meaneſt cottage.</p>
                     <p>When Belinda returned to ſchool, ſhe fancied herſelf as much in love as it was poſſible for any ſentimental heroine to be, and declared, for her ſweet Horton ſhe would be coutent to relinquiſh all the elegancies and indulgencies to which ſhe had ever been a cuſtomed, and live upon the coarſeſt viands, in an obſcure manſion. It was in vain I endeavoured to argue my young friend out of theſe ridiculous notions, ſhe remained
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:027654_0044_0FD567F189A803F0"/>
fixed in her determination, to marry Horton or not marry at all.</p>
                     <p>Unfortunately for Belinda, at that time I had as chimerical ideas of friendſhip as ſhe had of love, and ſhould have ſuppoſed it an inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble breach of confidence, to diſcover her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to her mother, though it would have been the beſt proof of real friendſhip I could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have given her.</p>
                     <p>She was taken from ſchool with a deſign of being introduced to Lord Gaymore; ſhe went home one day, had a meeting with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton the next, and the third morning by five o'clock ſet off in a chaiſe and four to Scotland, without having even ſeen the perſon her parents ſo earneſtly wiſhed her to be united with.</p>
                     <p>When they returned, Mr. Dormer, though highly offended at the raſh conduct of Belinda, and the black ingratitude of Horton, forgave them, and ſettled an handſome annuity on her, but told them the bulk of his fortune was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed on Lord Gaymore, (who was the neareſt male relation) in caſe of her refuſal of him.</p>
                     <p>Belinda was ſoon ſettled, and I took an early opportunity to viſit her; I ſound her, according to her own words, "ſuperlatively happy! Her
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:027654_0045_0FD567C241CF64E8"/>
Horton was the kindeſt beſt of huſbands, her home was a paradiſe, ſhe would not be Lady Gaymore for the world! What was affluence? Nothing when put in competition with love and Horton." But this was the language of ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
                     <p>I called on her again in about ſix months. I found her fitting in extreme diſhabille, her face was pale, her eyes ſunk, and as ſhe penſively leaned her head upon her hand a tear now and then ſtole down her cheek. I aſked tenderly the cauſe of her ſorrow. "Oh! my friend," ſaid ſhe, "I have undone myſelf! Horton is no longer the attentive tender huſband." I, ſmiling, told her, that ſhe muſt not expect the ſolicitude of the lover to laſt for life, but be content with the more calm and laſting eſteem of a friend.</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" replied Belinda, "I have no friend, I find, too late, my violent attachment to Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton was the romantic whim of a lively imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that the union of ſouls, the ſimilarity of ſentiment, which I had vainly thought would make the fetters of Hymen eaſy, and even delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, exiſted only in my ideas. Horton has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe, good nature, or politeneſs at home, though he appears to poſſeſs thoſe amiable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſo eminently abroad. He is extravagant, vain, and too fond of his own perſon, to be long
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:027654_0046_0FD567F4A3D54378"/>
attached to any woman, except his paſſion is excited by intereſted motives; he has not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled to own, it was the hope of poſſeſſing my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune alone induced him to addreſs me, and that had he known the eſtate was entailed on Lord Gaymore, he never would have troubled himſelf to make love to a puny, baby-faced girl, when there were ſo many fine women who would have thought themſelves honoured by his notice. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, continued ſhe, redoubling her tears, he ſeldom comes home but I am inſulted with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of the many women of faſhion who make him advances, and I am debarred of every inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent amuſement, ſtinted in my dreſs, and almoſt kept without pocket-money, that he may appear with elegance in company, and have plenty of money to la viſh in expenſive pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>I was greatly chagrined to find my dear young friend had really ſuch juſt cauſe for complaint, but endeavoured to comfort her, and lead her to hope, that by conſtant affection, attention, and good-humour, ſhe might recal her wanderer, and awaken in his boſom reciprocal tenderneſs. But I found by her reply, theſe were fallacious hopes.</p>
                     <p>She had been to viſit her parents, and had there formed an acquaintance with Lord Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Unfortunately the ill-fated Belinda diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:027654_0047_0FD567C30FA09C40"/>
this once dreaded nobleman to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of every real virtue, of which Horton had aſſumed the ſemblance; his perſon was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, without being effeminate, his heart glowed with humanity and benevolence; he was a man of refined ſenſe and ſtrict honor, with a mind enlightened and expanded by a liberal education and a thorough knowledge of the world. Belinda ſaw him, and acknowledged the full value of the happineſs ſhe had voluntarily caſt from her.</p>
                     <p>I warned her againſt making compariſons to the diſparagement of her huſband; and hinted the folly and danger of ſuffering any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſtand higher in her eſteem. She acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the truth of my remarks, ſaid ſhe would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be patient and content, but ſhe greatly feared ſhe had loſt ſight of happineſs for ever. And ſo indeed it proved, for though at the death of her father ſhe received a very handſome legacy, ſo great was Horton's extravagance, that it was preſently gone, laviſhed away on the worſt of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for the moſt infamous purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>Belinda had children very faſt, and before ſhe was thirty years old was left a widow with eight helpleſs children, to ſtruggle with the accumulated evils of poverty, contempt, and a broken heart—Horton's extravagance having obliged her to ſell her annuity, ſhe had no reſource but to accept a
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:027654_0048_0FD567F777450470"/>
ſmall yearly allowance from Lord Gaymore, who was then married, and allowed her a hundred pounds a year, for the education of her eldeſt boy, to whom he was god-father.</p>
                     <p>I will leave you my dear girls to imagine the pain and mortification of ſuch a dependence, and while you pity Belinda's miſfortune, cautiouſly avoid her errors! I ſhall renew the ſubject next poſt, till when and ever believe the your friend,</p>

                     <p>AS my ſubject is love, my dear children may perhaps once think an old woman enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining; but when they find my intention is only to expoſe the dangers which are attendant on that paſſion, inſtead of following the example of more juvenile ſcribblers, by expatiating on its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, you will throw down my letter in a pet. But I ſhall not let this deter me from following my intended plan, and endeavouring to convince you that there cannot be a more critical period in the whole courſe of your lives, than that in which you are ſurrounded by lovers; nor can there be any thing of more dangerous tendency than a young woman ſuffering a lover to approach her
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:027654_0049_0FD567C48E164ED8"/>
in a clandeſtine manner, or encourage addreſſes which ſhe has any reaſon to think her parents or friends would diſapprove; ſuch a conduct is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attended with diſagreeable conſequences.</p>
                     <p>I have a collection of letters in my poſſeſſion, which I think might well be termed a ſchool for lovers, and will, I am certain, be of more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in convincing you of the impropriety of clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine marriages, than a whole ſheet of dull precepts. I have ſent them for your peruſal, and by way of preface, ſhall give you an account of the means by which I became poſſeſſed of them.</p>
                     <p>A favourite ſervant of your grand-mother a who had been my nurſe, had married a reputable tradeſman, but, through unavoidable miſfortunes, they were reduced, and the huſband thrown into priſon. Martha lived in an obſcure lodging, and had been for ſome months extremely ill. My lady encouraged me in going to ſee her, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying her little preſents.</p>
                     <p>One day my lady was gone out to dinner, the ſervants were all in the kitchen, and I took that opportunity of going out unobſerved to viſit Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha. Charmed with the idea of going by myſelf (for I uſually had a ſervant with me) I tripped nimbly along, in my way laying out my whole ſtock of pocket money, which amounted to five
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:027654_0050_0FD567F84E0BE6C8"/>
ſhillings, in tea, ſugar and biſcuits, for my nurſe. As I went up ſtairs to Martha's apartment, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in a ſmall back room, the door of which was taken off the hinges, a tall well-made man, in an old ruſty black coat, his face pale and meagre, his arms folded upon his boſom, his eyes fixed ſeemingly on the floor, but inſtead of the vacant inanimate ſtare, there was a mixture of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and deſpair depicted in them. Curioſity prompted me to draw near the door of the room; at the farther and, on a bundle of ſtraw, the only furniture the wretched apartment afforded, ſat a woman, whoſe features told ſhe had once been lovely; on her lap lay an infant aſleep, beſide her ſat a fine boy, who, with a piteous accent was aſking for bread; the woman paid no attention to his entreaties, but with her eyes fixed on the youngeſt child, appeared like miſery perſonified. Young as I was, I felt my heart greatly afflicted at this ſcene, and running haſtily up ſtairs into Martha's room, unable to articulate a word, I burſt into tears. Martha aſtoniſhed at the agony I was in, tenderly inquired the cauſe. I told her what I had ſeen. "Alas! my dear child," ſaid ſhe, "thoſe people are in more diſtreſs than it is poſſible for you to conceive; they have lodged in this houſe about ſix weeks, in which time I am certain they have had nothing to ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and children but what they could raiſe from the ſale of a few cloaths; they are now a fortnight
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:027654_0051_0FD567FAB769EDA8"/>
in arrears for rent, and the inhuman landlord has taken the door off the hinges, and the windows out of the frames, to oblige them to quit the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Alas, poor ſouls, they have no means of procuring another ſhelter from nocturnal dews, when they relinguiſh this. I have not ſeen him ſtir out theſe two days paſt, and am apt to think in that time they have had no food except a ſlice of bread and meat which I gave the eldeſt child yeſterday.</p>
                     <p>How at that moment did I regret my money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſpent, five ſhillings appeared to me a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which might preſerve theſe unfortunate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; however, I had not even a ſingle halfpenny, nor could I bear the thought of taking from Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha any part of what I had given her. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haſtily bade her good bye, and flew rather than walked home, inquired for the houſe-keeper, related the afflicting ſituation of the family, and requeſted the loan of half a guinea. The houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper was an unfeeling, mercenary woman, ſhe never heard a tale of diſtreſs but ſhe imagined it fictitious, nor would ſhe ever beſtow any relief, leſt the object relieved ſhould be an impoſtor. She refuſed my requeſt. I then had recourſe to the nurſery maid, but could borrow no more than one ſhilling.</p>
                     <p>With this trifle I eagerly returned to the poor
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:027654_0052_0FD567FD408E41F8"/>
ſufferers, entered the apartment, and under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of kiſſing the infant, dropped the ſhilling into the mother's lap. The exclamation which broke from her, when ſhe ſaw the money, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me ſhe was a foreigner; and the demeanour of the man was vaſtly above the common rank of people.</p>
                     <p>Unfortunately my Lady did not return from her viſit till after ſupper, ſo that I was not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſet up to ſee her; but though I retired to bed I could not ſleep, my mind had been too much agitated, and the ſtarving family had left ſuch an impreſſion on it, that the moment I cloſed my eyes they were preſent to my imagination. Early in the morning I ſtole to Lady Winworth's chamber, told my little ſtory, and on my knees intreated ſome money to carry to them.</p>
                     <p>Her Ladyſhip, though from infancy nurſed in the lap of eaſe and affluence, had an heart over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing with compaſſion towards her ſuffering fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures; ſhe gave me two guineas, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the footman immediately to attend me.</p>
                     <p>I cannot deſcribe the joy that expanded my heart as I proceeded to G— Street. The maſter of the houſe was juſt riſen, and was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſhop. I aſked for the foreign gentleman. <hi>Gentleman,</hi> returned he with a ſneer, the French
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:027654_0053_0FD567FF94343208"/>
beggar I ſuppoſe you mean, I don't know where he is, I turned them out laſt night; people who cannot afford to pay for their lodgings, muſt lay where and how they can. Cruel inhuman wretch, ſaid I, and turned from him with every mark of abhorrence.</p>
                     <p>It was yet early, the morning was inviting, and I thought a walk in the fields might cheer me after my recent diſappointment; however, I previouſly determined every inquiry ſhould be made after the poor foreigner and his family.</p>
                     <p>Croſſing a field in the vicinity of Mary-le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, the voice of a child crying caught my ear, I turned my head, and ſaw at a little diſtance, ſeated on a log of wood, the very perſon I had been ſeeking, one child was in his arms, the other ſtood by him, his wife lay on the ground. I ran to him, ſpoke to him, bade him take hope, and put the two guineas in his hand—he looked at the money, then at me. Angel of mercy, ſaid he, with a deep ſigh, it is too late, my Agnes has left me. I ſaw his intellects were diſordered and ſhuddered with horror. Thinking the wife would be better able to take care of the money, I ſtooped in order to awaken her—I called her, ſhe moved not—I took hold of her hand, it was dreadfully cold; ſhe is in a ſit, ſaid I, and raiſed her head upon my knee, Never, oh! never,

my beloved girls, will the ſpectacle that preſented itſelf to my eyes, be baniſhed from my memory. Her eyes were partly cloſed, her mouth half open, her lips black—Death had that night re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed her from a world of miſery. I ſhrieked and fainted. When I recovered I found myſelf in my dear Lady's arms, who told me, the body of the poor young woman was taken care of, that the man was quite diſtracted and entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to give any account of himſelf, though from an unfiniſhed letter, addreſſed to the Marchioneſs Savillion, which was found in the woman's pocket they had reaſon to ſuppoſe they were of a good family.</p>
                     <p>The man ſurvived his wife but a few days, my Lady took care of the children.</p>
                     <p>About ſix months after I was ſent to a convent near Paris, in order to finiſh my education, and perfect myſelf in the French language. Among a number of boarders who reſided at the convent, I was particularly noticed by one, who was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the title of St. Auguſtina; ſhe was of a weakly conſtitution, and often confined to her bed, when ſhe was always pleaſed if I would work or read beſide her. One day ſhe gave me her keys, and deſired me to unlock a cabinet and take out a curious piece of needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work which ſhe ſaid had been executed by a once
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:027654_0055_0FD568042866E540"/>
loved friend. As I took the work from the drawer, a miniature picture attracted my notice; methought I knew the features; I took it up to examine it more minutely, and immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected the intereſting countenance of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Agnes. Upon inquiry I found I was right in my conjecture; St. Auguſtina was the Marchioneſs Savillion, whom Lady Winworth had made numerous fruitleſs inquiries after. She had been the friend and companion of Agnes, but had married and left the convent where they both boarded juſt before that young lady, and her laſt pathetic letters never reached her till it was too late to adminiſter relief; the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had ſince loſt her huſband and two fine children, by fire, which accident had ſo impaired her health and depreſſed her ſpirits, that ſhe had retired from the world, and meant to ſpend the remainder of her days in the convent where ſhe had paſſed her youth. She ſhewed me all Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes's letters, and before I left France ſuffered me to take copies of them.</p>

I know you will blame me, I know you will bid me endeavour to conquer my grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſion, and call in reaſon to my aſſiſtance. Alas! what power has reaſon over the heart torn by contending paſſions? Duty bids me ſtifle my ſighs, and bend my thoughts and wiſhes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Count, love triumphs over duty, and I can only think of Vieurville.</p>
                     <p>The day after you left our convent, Madamoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle Vieurville requeſted me to attend her to the parlour, where her brother and lover waited to ſee her. "You muſt go, Agnes, ſaid ſhe, or my brother will be quite at a loſs how to amuſe
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:027654_0057_0FD5680A1C4B83D8"/>
himſelf, while I converſe with Montroſe." I was eaſily perſuaded, and on entering the parlour, was ſtruck with the noble mein and elegant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of young Vieurville; we chatted for ſome time on indifferent ſubjects, his vivacity and wit, (through which it was eaſy to diſcover a fund of good ſenſe) delighted me, and when I retired with Mademoiſelle, I could not help expreſſing my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; he is a charming young man indeed, ſaid ſhe, and had I not known that you were on the point of marriage, I ſhould not have ventured to introduce him to you, for fear you might loſe your heart; for you muſt know (continued ſhe, paying no regard to the viſible emotion which I am certain agitated my features) that Louis is to be married the ſame day that I am, to a beautiful Spaniſh lady, who is expected in Paris next month. Has he ever ſeen his intended bride? ſaid I, affecting indifference. Oh! no, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, but if Donna Clara be but half as lovely as her picture repreſents her, he muſt inevitably fall in love. It is odd, ſaid I, that he ſhould conſent to marry a woman he has never ſeen. I dare ſay it appears ſo to you, replied Mademoiſelle, but when I ſhall tell you how it came about, your wonder will ceaſe.</p>
                     <p>My mother was the only daughter of an ancient wealthy Spaniſh family, and eloped with my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:027654_0058_0FD5680B2F4B3D20"/>
from a convent, where ſhe was placed for education. The match was very unequal; her father was irreconcilably offended, and would never ſuffer her to be named in his preſence.</p>
                     <p>My mother was tenderly beloved by her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who, at the old nobleman's deceaſe, paid her a handſome fortune, and vowed their families ſhould ever live in the ſtricteſt amity.</p>
                     <p>My uncle was married to a woman of whom he was paſſionately fond, and when, in giving birth to Donna Clara, ſhe departed this world, he took a ſolemn oath that no other woman ſhould ever ſupply her place, but that the whole of his future life ſhould be devoted to the care of his daughter. My mother at that time lying in of a ſon, the two infants were contracted to each other, and my brother, at his uncle's deceaſe, is to inherit the eſtate and titles devolving to him from his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father. My uncle is expected to bring his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Paris this winter, when the marriage is to be completed, and I ſhall be delivered from this horrid convent.</p>
                     <p>I cannot deſcribe my feelings during Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle's recital. I know not what could be the cauſe of my agitation, but I could hardly reſtrain my tears, while I remained in her apartment. When I retired, I began to take my heart to taſk,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:027654_0059_0FD5680CE1B14650"/>
and determined to repel a riſing paſſion, which had thus ſuddenly taken poſſeſſion of it: I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore making any compariſon between my intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lord and young Vieurville, and determined never to ſee the latter again; but the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanquiſhed theſe good reſolutions.</p>
                     <p>I was but juſt ariſen, when one of the lay-ſiſters informed me a gentleman requeſted a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments converſation. Imagining it to be either the Count, or ſome meſſenger from my father, I repaired without heſitation to the parlour. Judge of my ſurpriſe when I found myſelf in the preſence of Monſieur Vieurville. Suppoſing the nun had made a miſtake in calling mé inſtead of Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle, his ſiſter, I was going to retire, when he intreated me to ſtop, aſſured me there was no miſtake, and taking my hand, led me to a chair, and ſeated himſelf beſide me.</p>
                     <p>I come, deareſt Madam, ſaid he, to entreat a few moments ſerious attention from you, and a candid anſwer to a queſtion, which though abrupt in its nature, yet from the circumſtances which we both at preſent are in, demands an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit reply. My ſiſter has informed me, that your parents deſign you for the wife of Count de la Rue; however preſumptuous the ſuppoſition may be, I cannot imagine your heart has any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the intended union. My heart, Sir,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:027654_0060_0FD5680E0D1D6430"/>
replied I, will ever follow the dictates of duty, and rejoice in ratifying any engagement which I am certain will give my parents ſo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>But was that heart left to make its free choice, would it then have ſelected the Count as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of its deareſt affection?</p>
                     <p>I know not, Monſieur, what authority you have to make theſe enquiries, nor do I think myſelf obliged to anſwer them.</p>
                     <p>I roſe to quit the parlour—lovely Agnes, ſaid he, catching my hand, I know I have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brupt, but let my ſituation plead my excuſe. You no doubt have heard from my ſiſter, that I am deſigned the huſband of a woman I have never ſeen; till yeſterday I ever believed my heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſceptible of the power of beauty, and imagined I might be as happy with Donna Clara as any other woman, but I am now convinced, that indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference only proceeded from the want of a proper object to call forth the affections of my heart. I have ſeen the lovely object who has that power, I feel my boſom glow with new and unutterable ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and though I would have married Clara had I continued in a ſtate of indifference; I will never wed her now, my heart is firmly attached to another. You, adorable Agnes, are the only
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:027654_0061_0FD5681202655B88"/>
woman who ever gave my heart a ſingle pain, or taught it to throb with rapture; if your affections are already engaged, I will condemn myſelf to eternal ſilence, but if you will grant me one ray of hope that you are not altogether indifferent to my ſuit, the world ſhall not tempt me to enter into any engagement with Donna Clara.</p>
                     <p>Oh! my beloved Auguſtina, at that moment reaſon, honour, fortitude, forſook me, enchanted with the convincing proof he offered to give me of inviolable attachment, I ſuffered him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my partiality. I thought not on the irrepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able injury I ſhould do Vieurville's family, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the duty I owed my parents, the reſpect I owed myſelf, and confeſſed that he alone was the maſter of my affections.</p>
                     <p>I ſee your anger, my dear friend, I hear you blame my imprudence; ſhall I loſe your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Auguſtina, will you chaſe the imprudent Agnes from your boſom! Alas! If you do, where will ſhe find another reſting place? The thought overpowers me, I can write no more.</p>

                     <p>EIGHT months of my novitiate is paſt, and I have never heard of Vieurville. But what is Vieurville to me? Am I not going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the world and all its pleaſures; am I not going to devote my future life to my maker? Auguſtina, are not my thoughts free, and though my body is immured within the walls of a cloiſter, may not my fancy wander, free as air, to Vieurville. Oh! the tortures of ſuſpence! Could I but know where he was, could I but be ſatiſfied he ſtill remembers Agnes, methinks I could be content. Write to me, my friend, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to calm my mind; tell me, Auguſtina, when I have thrown off the trappings which mark a child of vanity, will not ſweet peace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit my boſom, when ſimplicity has attired my perſon? And when the irrevocable vow has paſt my lips, will not my perturbed ſpirits be huſhed to reſt, and all my ſoul be rapt in religious har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Oh! no, no, my ſweet friend, the maſſy doors that cloſe on us poor captives, cannot ſhut out the buſy meddling paſſions, or ſtifle the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings we receive from nature. The ſimplicity of our habit is not an index of the purity of our mind, nor is the kneeling poſture, or lifted eye, true indications of the fervor of religion! Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtina,

hypocriſy may dwell in a convent, ſo may love, hatred, jealouſy, and deſpair. And is an heart agitated by theſe contending paſſions, a ſit ſacrifice to be offered at the throne of grace?

                     <p>AUGUSTINA, you will tremble when you receive this, you will think it a meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous act to drive from your heart the remembrance of Agnes de Romani; but if thou haſt any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining gleam of compaſſion in thy gentle boſom,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:027654_0066_0FD5681DE68FDF38"/>
oh give it way, renounce not thy unhappy friend, but chear her with one forgiving line.</p>
                     <p>I have ſeen Vieurville, I have forfeited my vows, left the convent, and become a fugitive and an exile, my brain is diſtracted when I think what I have ſuffered this laſt fourteen days, nor can all my huſband's tenderneſs ſoothe me. My pulſe throbs, my veins are ſcorched with heat—I muſt throw aſide my pen, my eyes are dim. Auguſtina, thy dying friend lifts up her ſoul in prayers for thy happineſs.</p>
                     <p>After three weeks being confined to my bed, I am at length permitted to addreſs the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate friend of my youth. Raiſed from the confines of the grave, I once more pour forth my ſoul into the boſom of Auguſtina. I will now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to give you ſome regular account of the proceedings of laſt month. Alas! my friend, my heart will bleed afreſh as I trace the painful ſcenes, painful they will ever be to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, for I have drawn inevitable ruin on the man my ſoul doated on.</p>
                     <p>As I had never heard any tidings of Vieur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, from the time I was taken from the convent, with a deſign of being married to the Count, till within three days of the time when my novitiate was expired, I began to look on my profeſſion as
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:027654_0067_0FD5681F66F534A0"/>
inevitable, and endeavoured to bring myſelf to think of it with calmneſs, but ſtill corroding thoughts would ſometimes intrude, and overturn my beſt reſolutions. My only wiſh was to hear whether Vieurville was alive or dead, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was married to my rival; but theſe were particulars I was never able to diſcover, as his father and family had quitted Paris ſoon after my return to the convent.</p>
                     <p>There remained but three days now before I was to take the veil, and I endeavoured to fortify my mind againſt the awful day, with every argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reaſon or religion could ſupply. I was buſy in reflecting on the change a few ſhort hours would make, when one of our boarders aſked me to accompany her to the grate; I complied, and we amuſed ourſelves ſometime in chatting to two Engliſh ladies, who were in the parlour; the ladies were juſt preparing to leave the convent, when a violent ringing at the gate alarmed us; the portreſs ran to open it, and in a moment Vieurville ruſhed into the parlour. I know not what I ſaid or whether I ſpoke at all—a ſudden miſt obſcured my ſight and I fell to the ground; when I recovered, my friend, the boarder, told me, that ſeeing the impetuoſity of my lover, ſhe had adviſed him to leave the convent, and if he had any thing particular to communicate, to do it by letter, and incloſe it to her. Her friendly
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:027654_0068_0FD568210F030868"/>
ſoothing greatly contributed to calm my ſpirits, and as none of the ſiſterhood had ſeen Vieurville, they all remained ignorant of the interview.</p>
                     <p>In about three hours I received a letter, in which he told me, nothing but abſolute force ſhould ſo long have kept him from me; that he had been detained in Spain by various ſtratagems, but having at laſt eluded the vigilance of his guards, he hurried to Paris, where he preſently learnt the ſacrifice I was about to make, he urged my leaving the convent and being united to him by the moſt indiſſoluble bonds; and ſaid, he made no doubt but my father would be eaſily led to forgive us. I ſhewed the letter to my young friend, ſhe joined the perſuaſions of Vieur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, and ſaid ſhe would undertake to manage my eſcape on the very morning on which I was to become profeſt.</p>
                     <p>I wrote to my dear Vieurville, and my friend encloſed it in one from herſelf, directing him in what manner to proceed. That very evening Edella, (which was the name of my friend) was ſeized with a violent indiſpoſition, which would have made a dupe of even me, had I not been in the ſecret. She continued ill all night, and the next day when ſhe deſired the abbeſs to ſend to a relation ſhe had about ſeven miles from Paris, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting ſhe would ſend her coach for her the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:027654_0069_0FD56823AB67A220"/>
enſuing morning at eleven o'clock, as ſhe thought a few days ſpent in the country, would be of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſervice to her. Vieurville was ordered to ſend a carriage at nine, and it being the laſt morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my novitiate, I deſired not be diſturbed till it was time for me to enter the chapel. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt I knew would be complied with, as it would be ſuppoſed, I wiſhed for time for meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Accordingly I early left my cell, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Edella's apartment, dreſſed myſelf in ſome of her cloaths, and put on a long black hood which would pull over the face; thus attired, I waited anxiouſly for a ring at the gate and gueſſing it was the coach, hurried down ſtairs, and ſo prevented the portreſs from coming up to call Edella. I met ſeveral of the nuns as I paſſed from her apartment to the door, but they neither ſpoke to me, nor attempted to ſtop me. I got out of the convent unſuſpected, and in leſs than an hour was in a place of ſafety, where a prieſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately united me to my dear Vieurville. My firſt deſire was that we ſhould fly to my father for his protection, intreat his pardon and bleſſing, and through his interceſſion be again received into the church, from whence I was certain we ſhould be excommunicated. It was midnight when I arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at my father's, he had been returned from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris near four hours, whither he had rapaired to ſee me take the veil, and was then, overcome with fatigue and diſappointment, juſt retired to
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:027654_0070_0FD5682842D21B60"/>
reſt. I would not permit the ſervant to inform his maſter that I was come home, but following him up ſtairs, threw myſelf on my knees by his bed-ſide. He ſtarted at ſeeing me, fury flaſhed from his eyes, and graſping my hand with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he cried, Agnes, ungrateful girl, why are you here? With tremulous accents, I in a few words told him I was married, and intreated his pardon and friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>Oh! never ſhall I forget his anſwer, twas aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, 'twas more than nature could ſupport. He ſpurned me from him, he curſed me, and impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the wrath of heaven on his head if ever he forgave me. "I will not, ſaid he, precipitate your impending fate, by betraying you to the eccleſiaſtical powers; go haſten to leave France, and if you can be happy oppreſſed by the weight of a father's curſe, may you be ſo!—Hence, begone, you offend my ſight."</p>
                     <p>Vieurville forced me out of the room. During the time of my petitioning for pardon, my mother had aroſe, ſhe followed me down ſtairs, bleſſed me, and promiſed to uſe her intereſt with my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to effect a reconciliation. She gave me all the caſh ſhe poſſeſſed and ſome jewels that had been preſented me by a relation. When I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her for the laſt time, it ſeemed like rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul and body aſunder; but hope, that ſweet
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:027654_0071_0FD56829115C7540"/>
ſoother of the human mind, bore me up, and I flattered myſelf we ſhould one day meet again.</p>
                     <p>When we left my father's houſe, we ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward immediately for Calais, and from thence embarked for Dover, where, overcome by agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fatigue, I was ſeized with a ſever which brought me to the verge of the grave. During my illneſs Vieurville wrote to his father, and we now anxiouſly await the arrival of an anſwer. Oh! may it be propitious, but my ſad heart preſages I ſhall never more know happineſs: For myſelf, I could have borne it patiently, but when I think I have involved my dear Vieurville in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, my brain ſickens and almoſt madneſs enſues.</p>

Donna Clara had conceived a paſſion for her couſin, and from the time of his leaving Spain, fell into a profound melancholy, and when ſhe heard of his marriage, the agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her ſpirits became too much for her weak frame to ſupport, and a rapid decline carried her an early victim to the grave. Vieurville is diſinherited, diſowned, and loaded with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's anger; but will you believe it, my friend, he ſtill loves the woman who has brought thoſe miſfortunes upon him; but that love, that warm mutual affection that ſubſiſts between us ſerves only to heighten our miſery—for oh! what tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can compare to that of ſeeing the object we love overwhelmed with diſtreſs we have not the power to mitigate?—</p>

I am a mother, Auguſtina, but far from feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſport when claſping my infant to my heart, methinks his innocent eyes reproach me with bringing him into the world, when his only birth-right is wretchedneſs. Poverty, with hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard countenance, and famine, with cold grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand, have taken up their abode in our dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Muſt I write it, muſt the daughter of de Romani tell her friend, ſhe is in want of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the common neceſſaries of life!—Oh! bitter reflection, hard, hard taſk, Agnes muſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit charity of her friend Auguſtina!—And, alas! my friend, unleſs relief comes ſoon, we muſt periſh! for in this ſtrange land what can we do? We cannot work, and (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the known humanity of the Britiſh nation) we are aſhamed to beg.</p>
                     <p>Oh! how blind are the dictates of paſſion! how erroneous are its judgments! may none of my ſex henceforth liſten to its deluſive argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but by adhering to the precepts of reaſon, avoid the miſeries of.</p>

                     <p>IF ever this reaches the hand of my ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Auguſtina Savillion, enquire for my children, and be to them a mother; intreat the Marquis to take them under his protection, for a few ſhort days will render them orphans. We have paſſed from one degree of wretchedneſs to another, till a bundle of ſtraw, a dry cruſt, and a few rags that cover our emaciated frames, are the whole of our worldly poſſeſſions, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe my affliction, ſix weeks ſince I brought into the world another child of ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Gracious heaven! could words convey to my Auguſtina the extent of my miſery, could ſhe but for a moment, even in idea, experience my ſufferings;—but may the beneficent power that rules the world avert from her even the ſhadow of ſuch afflictions, may my bittereſt enemy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver experience the pangs that at preſent harrow up my ſoul.</p>
                     <p>I am a mother, I hear the darling of my heart, the child of my boſom aſking for food, and have it not to give him. I am a wife, and ſee my adored, my almoſt idolized huſband, ſinking under the complicated evils of famine,

grief and ſickneſs, yet have neither comfort or conſolations to offer. Let the wife, the mother, judge of my tortures, they are agonies that may be felt, but cannot be deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>Auguſtina, this is the laſt time I ſhall ever addreſs you; this night the wretched Agnes muſt lay her head upon the earth, with no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy but the ſkies. Oh! my children, Oh! my beloved Vieurville, thy mother, thy wife has murdered thee.</p>

                  <p>THE ſun was ſunk beneath the weſtern hills, his parting beams made the horizon flame with burniſhed gold, and darted on the topmoſt branches of the lofty trees of a neighbouring ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. Autumn had not put off her pleaſing robe, nor had the gentle zephyr forſook the plain to give place to his rude brother Boreas. The ground was ſtrewed with leaves of various hues, the ripened fruit hung on the bending trees, and fields of waving golden grain render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſcene delightful.</p>
                  <p>Marian and Lydia having finiſhed their daily taſk, ſet aſide their wheels with alacrity, and tying on their ſtraw bonnets, prepared to enjoy the beauties of the evening, by rambling over the adjacent fields and meadows.</p>

They were innocent and ſprightly as the young fawn that lightly bounds over the verdant lawn; ſmiling youth and roſy health glowed upon their cheeks, and ſparkled in their eyes; their wiſhes untaught by art or luxury to ſtray beyond the bounds which ſimple nature has marked out, were eaſily ſupplied; they aroſe each morn with the feathered choriſters, and chearfully purſued their daily labour; the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was their time for mirth. Innocence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided over all their pleaſures, and meek-eyed content on downy pinions hovered over their homely couch, ſweetening their quiet ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
                  <p>Their cottage was ſituated in a pleaſant val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, on the borders of Wales; it was plain and rural, it contained every neceſſary, but no ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities; ſimplicity had decorated it, and the neatneſs of its furniture rendered it more pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ruſtic inhabitants than the moſt ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous palace.</p>
                  <p>Here Marian and Lydia, by their chearfulneſs and induſtry, enlivened the declining hours of their mother Dorcas.</p>
                  <p>Beware, ſaid the careful mother, beware, my children, tarry not too long, leſt the evening damps ſhould impair your health, and rob your mother of her only comforts.</p>
                  <p>

The ſiſters departed, and as they wandered over the fields, in the innocent gaiety of their hearts, carroled forth their ſongs in wild, untu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored, but melodious notes.</p>
                  <p>Sir George Lovemore had arrived a few days before at Gwinfred-Hall, to viſit a maiden aunt, whoſe unlimited fortune demanded this mark of reſpect, for the virtues of her mind, or the ſweetneſs of her manner he was totally unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. Mrs. Gwinfred's unaffected pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, good-humour, and amiable diſpoſition, were things totally diſregarded by the young liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, though the viſit was profeſſedly made to her, yet he ſpent but a ſmall ſhare of his time in her company. He was continually rambling from one place to another, making viſits to thoſe neighbouring gentlemen whoſe opinions and manners moſt ſuited with his own. He was this evening returning from a viſit to the Earl of Landaff, he was ſeated in an elegant phaeton, drawn by four beautiful bays, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were in their beſt travelling liveries, which were green faced with buff, and ſuperbly trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with gold lace, they proceeded ſlowly, the animals ſeeming to partake of their maſter's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence.</p>
                  <p>Marian and Lydia had wandered to the road, and were juſt croſſing it with an intent to enter
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:027654_0079_0FD5683EFB91C568"/>
a ſmall wood on the other ſide, when this mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent equipage impeded their way. They had never before ſeen any thing half ſo grand—they ſtopped involuntarily to admire it as it paſſed; the wind had blown off Marian's bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, her luxuriant brown hair falling in ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets over her face and neck, ſerved as a ſhade to heighten but not obſcure her charms.</p>
                  <p>Sir George caught a glimpſe of her perſon, and in her little white jacket, ſimple, unadorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe appeared to him like a wood nymph; her form was delicate, her ſtature rather below the middling ſize. He alighted from his phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and offering his hand to Marian, ſaid he would aſſiſt her in croſſing the road; he ſeized her unreluctant hand, he gazed earneſtly upon her face, and felt in a moment his heart was captivated by this ruſtic faſcinating beauty; the modeſt inobtruſive charms of Lydia were unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, he called her ſiſter by a thouſand divine appellations, which, as they had never heard them before, at once excited their wonder and their fears.</p>
                  <p>Leave us, good Sir, ſaid Lydia, for we muſt return home, and ſhould our mother ſee you, ſhe would be angry with us; beſides, Sir, we country maidens are not uſed to converſe with ſuch grand folks, and mayhap you will laugh
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:027654_0080_0FD568404E4B12A8"/>
at our ſimplicity. They then dropped their curtſies, and wiſhing him a good night, would have left him, but he ſtopped Marian, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted rudely to ſalute her; ſhe ſhrieked, ſtruggled, and at length freeing herſelf from his hold, caught her ſiſter's hand, and darting acroſs the field, they were preſently out of ſight.</p>
                  <p>Sir George gazed after them for a moment, then, aſcending his carriage, determined in his own mind to attempt the ſeduction of Marian. He made no doubt but ſhe would again walk the ſame way, and reſolved every night to ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble out in hopes of meeting her.</p>
                  <p>The ſiſters ſlackened not their pace till they arrived within ſight of their mother's cottage. Dorcas, uneaſy at their long ſtay, had walked forth to meet them; their haſte and confuſion alarmed her. Tell me, my children, ſaid ſhe, why are you thus agitated? Has any thing frightened you, or has any of the low-bred clowns inſulted you? Why would you walk ſo late?</p>
                  <p>Dear mother, cried Lydia, a gentleman ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped us, and was ſo rude to my ſiſter.</p>
                  <p>Not very rude, ſaid Marian, interrupting her, he only wanted to kiſs me, and I ran away from him. But you cannot think what a fine gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:027654_0081_0FD56841C996B258"/>
he was, ſo handſome, and he had ſuch a pretty thing to ride in; dear, dear, how I ſhould like to ride in ſuch an one.</p>
                  <p>I am ſurpriſed, Marian, ſaid Dorcas, grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to hear you talk thus; it becomes not a girl of your humble ſtation to ſpeak in ſuch rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the beauty of a gentleman, or the grandeur of his equipage, much leſs to form wiſhes to be indulged by riding in it.</p>
                  <p>Why ſurely, dear mother, ſaid ſhe, it is no harm to wiſh.</p>
                  <p>It is wrong, my dear child (replied the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mother) very wrong to form wiſhes which we are certain, from the ſituation in which it has pleaſed Providence to place us, can never be laudably gratified. You know, Marian, 'tis impoſſible you can ever poſſeſs a ſplendid equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page.</p>
                  <p>Oh! dear, ſaid Marian, I do not think ſo; mayhap the fine gentleman may be in love with me; I am ſure he called me by many pretty names.</p>
                  <p>Dorcas ſhook her head, and ſighed. And how, ſaid ſhe, looking mournfully at Marian, how has vanity found entrance in a heart I had hoped was the ſeat of innocence and content.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="unknown:027654_0082_0FD56845800E34B8"/>
Don't be angry with my ſiſter, dear mother, ſaid Lydia, to be ſure the gentleman did talk a great deal about beauty and goddeſſes, but I dare ſay he meant nothing.</p>
                  <p>That's nothing but envy, ſaid Marian, peev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly, becauſe he did not ſay any thing to you. For of what uſe would it be to him to ſay I was the lovelieſt girl he ever ſaw, if he did not think ſo; that would be fibbing for fibbing's ſake.</p>
                  <p>Dorcas ſmiled at her ſimplicity, while ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted that thoſe ſparks of vanity which had ever lain dormant, had by flattery been blown into a flame. They entered the cottage, and ſat down to a rural ſupper of milk and fruit; during the repaſt Marian could think nor ſpeak of aught beſide the gentleman.</p>
                  <p>Lydia was ſilent, and Dorcas now and then ſighed profoundly, while a tear fell as ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted in her thoughts to occurrences long ſince paſt; when they had finiſhed their temperate meal, ſhe thus addreſſed her daughters.</p>
                  <p>My dear children, ſaid ſhe, you have often heard me ſay, that you loſt your father when you were quite infants: in that I told you truth; he is loſt, irreparably loſt to you and me, but it was not death that tore him from us. I
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:027654_0083_0FD5684651D619E0"/>
have ever avoided mentioning any of the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of my paſt life, leſt it ſhould pain your gentle affectionate hearts, but I find now the hour is arrived when the mother's ſorrows ſhall ſerve as a warning to the daughters, to teach them to avoid thoſe ſhoals and quickſands on which were wrecked her happineſs and peace.</p>
                  <p>Liſten attentively, and while you weep over my miſfortunes, let the errors which brought them on me ſink deep in your hearts; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they were the cauſe of your mother's ruin, and ſhun them through the courſe of your own lives as you would any poiſonous or obnoxious reptile.</p>

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF DORCAS. PART II.</head>
                  <p>I WAS the only daughter of a farmer in the Weſt of England. He in his youth, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and fidelity, ſo well recommended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the favour of the nobleman, of whom at that time he rented a farm, that he made him ſteward of all his eſtates, which were ſituated in that country.</p>
                  <p>I had the miſfortune to loſe my mother before I had ſeen ſixteen years; ſhe was a woman of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary piety, ſhe had early inculcated in my mind a love of religion and virtue, and taught me that humility, charity, and chearful content were the true marks of Chriſtianity.—Had I never ſuffered thoſe excellent precepts to depart from my mind, I ſhould never have experienced the many miſeries which have ſince marked my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy life.</p>
                  <p>During the life of this worthy parent I lived ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely retired, ſhe ſuperintended my education,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:027654_0085_0FD5684BD1FD3980"/>
which was ſuch as might render me a uſeful mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſociety, but ſhe beſtowed very little time on the ſhewy accompliſhments which are ſet ſo high a price on in the preſent age, and which, though they are certainly neceſſary to finiſh the education of a gentlewoman, are very immaterial to thoſe who expect to move but in the middle ſphere.</p>
                  <p>After my mother's deceaſe I took the entire charge of my father's family upon me, did the honours of his table, received and entertained all his viſitants, and made frequent excurſions abroad; I was thoughtleſs, vain, and giddy. I never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard the voice of adulation, which now aſſailed my ears from almoſt every man with whom I converſed. I liſtened to it eagerly, and like my ſimple Marian placed an implicit faith in all they ſaid.</p>
                  <p>My heart was full of ſenſibility, and being deprived of my mother, whom I had ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and loved as a friend, I began to look round for ſome female object on whom to ſettle thoſe affectionate feelings, to whom I might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſom all my little inquietudes, conſult and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with on trifling embaraſſments and vexations, which at that time I conſidered as ſerious troubles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="unknown:027654_0086_0FD5684EC357F118"/>
Unfortunately for me, the Earl of S—to whom my father was ſteward, at that time came into the country, and brought with him his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Lady Laura S—and a young gentleman whom I ſhall call Melfont, he was the ſecond ſon of a noble family, and though then only nineteen years old, had obtained the rank of captain in the army; his fortune was large, having inherited his mother's jointure, but he had choſen the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of arms, as he thought the character of a good ſoldier increaſed the dignity of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
                  <p>Lady Laura was nearly of my own age, chance one evening threw me in her way, as I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my father, and though fortune had placed ſo great a diſtance between us, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed a friendſhip for me, which highly gratified my vanity and delighted my father, as he thought it would contribute to my future advancement in life.—But alas! my children, it was the ſource from whence I might trace all my miſfortunes.</p>
                  <p>Lady Laura was lovely in her perſon, and gentle in her manners, ſhe poſſeſſed a ſuſceptible heart, and I thought her the pattern of all female perfection; but in this I was woefully deceived. She had that ſelfiſh principle inherent in her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which made her prefer her own happineſs
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:027654_0087_0FD56850154A8408"/>
to that of the hole world beſide; however, this was an error which I did not diſcover till ſhe had brought inevitable ruin on me, and unfeelingly triumphed in the miſery ſhe had occaſioned.</p>
                  <p>From the evening of our firſt interview ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually formed pretences to call at my father's, and at length, by the Earl's permiſſion invited me to paſs a few weeks with her at Seymour Caſtle. My father joyfully conſented to my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the proffered honour, and the day being appointed, Lady Laura herſelf came in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot to fetch me.</p>
                  <p>It was near dinner time when I arrived, I felt myſelf rather abaſhed on being preſented to the Earl, and conſcious of my inferiority, my face glowed with confuſion. Lord S—was a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and truly worthy nobleman; he ſaid many obliging things to me, which in ſome meaſure encouraged me, and I began to look and ſpeak with a tolerable degree of freedom, when being informed that dinner was ſerved, the Earl led me into the dining room and preſented me to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Melfont.</p>
                  <p>All my confuſion now returned. I bluſhed, trembled, and hardly knew how I behaved dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dinner, I had never before converſed with a man ſo well-bred, polite, and agreeable as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:027654_0088_0FD524407990D4E8"/>
Melfont. I wiſhed to appear engaging, and conſcious of my own inſignificance, ſhrunk as it were into nothing, and a thouſand times wiſhed myſelf at home again. All day I was uneaſy and diſſatisfied with myſelf, every accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Lady Laura diſplayed, made me regret not poſſeſſing the ſame, that I might equally with her contribute to the amuſement and ſhare the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of Melfont.</p>
                  <p>In the courſe of a few days my conſtraint gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually decreaſed, the polite freedom with which I was treated by Lady Laura, and the pointed attentions I experienced from Melfont, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to raiſe me in my own eſteem, and I became chearful and happy.</p>
                  <p>As I had ever been accuſtomed to early riſing, I was in general up ſome hours ſooner than Lady Laura, and uſually ſpent the time till breakfaſt in the garden, ſometimes with a book, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with my work. Melfont had frequently joined me in theſe little morning excurſions, and I believe it was the pleaſure I experienced in his company, which made me ſo often repeat them. At firſt he was polite, unconſtrained and chearful, but he ſoon grew thoughtful, penſive, and even abſent. I ſaw the change with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret; I almoſt unknown to myſelf ſhared his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:027654_0089_0FD56857CB327480"/>
and whenever he ſighed involuntarily, echoed his ſighs reſponſively.</p>
                  <p>At length I aſſumed courage to enquire the cauſe of his melancholy; he heſitated for a few moments, and then in faultering accents decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf my lover, at the ſame time ſaying, he had not the leaſt hope of ever being happy, conjured me to forget him, preſſed my hand to his lips, and left me with precipitation.</p>
                  <p>I now diſcovered the ſtate of my own heart, I felt the greateſt ſatiſfaction in the knowledge of being beloved; but my affliction was great when I reflected he had ſaid an inſurmountable barrier was placed between us. I was weak enough to ſhed tears, and could hardly ſummon compoſure enough to attend Lady Laura, at the uſual hour of breakfaſt—though I was conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that the indulging an hopeleſs paſſion would entail laſting miſery upon me, I never once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſubdue it, or ſtifle emotions which my own reaſon told me were improper and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in a young perſon in my humble ſtation; though I am certain, had I when I firſt diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my growing partiality for Melfont, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately left Seymour Caſtle, returned home, and by entering with avidity into all my uſual avocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſtrove to baniſh him from my mind, and cautiouſly avoided all opportunities of ſeeing or

converſing with him, I ſhould ſoon have conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the predeliction, and regained my uſual tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, but I wanted reſolution to fly the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a man whoſe preſence I fancied conſtituted my chief happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Solitude is the nurſe of youthful paſſion—in this I was fully indulged at Seymour Caſtle, being allowed to paſs my time in a manner moſt ſuitable to my own inclination, whilſt Lady Laura was engaged with her ſeveral maſters, who yet daily attended her. I had at the ſame time contracted a habit of reading for ſeveral hours in the day, and unfortunately in the late Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs's library met with ſeveral novels, a ſort of reading with which my dear girls are totally unacquainted; theſe books ſerved only to ſoften my mind and encreaſe my paſſion, ſo that by never attempting to repel it in its firſt approach, it in time gained an entire aſcendency over my heart, formed a part of my exiſtence, twined round the chords of life, and can be extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by the hand of death.</p>
                  <p>Here Dorcas pauſed to give vent to her tears; Marian wept with her; Lydia threw her arms round her mother's neck, and kiſſing off the drops as they fell upon her cheeks, vowed that no action of hers ſhould ever increaſe the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:027654_0091_0FD5685A8983B310"/>
which already weighed down her too ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible heart. They then retired for the night, Lydia to the ſoft repoſe that ever attends youth and innocence; Marian to reflect on the fine things Sir George had ſaid, and Dorcas to weep over paſt afflictions.</p>

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF DORCAS CONTINUED. PART II.</head>
                  <p>THE ſun had juſt darted his rays upon the diſtant mountains, the dew ſtill glittered on the waving graſs, when Dorcas forſook her reſtleſs couch, and ſummoned her daughters to their daily labour, having paid their adoration to the divine diſpoſer of all things, and partook of a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> breakfaſt, ſhe again continued her recital.</p>
                  <p>For ſeveral mornings after the explanation I mentioned, I repaired as uſual to the garden, but Melfont did not join me, indeed he ſeemed particularly ſtudious to avoid every opportunity of converſing with me without a third perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent. I was extremely uneaſy at this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, I imagined he ſuppoſed me too much his
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:027654_0093_0FD5685E979AE860"/>
inferior to be made the honorable partner of his fortune, and in my heart I thanked him for that honor, which prevented his ſoliciting me on other terms; yet the viſible conſtraint he put upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in attempting to appear chearful, pained me exceſſively; I became abſent, melancholy and dejected.</p>
                  <p>Lady Laura frequently interrogated me in her lively manner on the cauſe of my altered dipoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and one morning when Melfont was in the room, ſhe jocularly ſaid, "Why, my good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin Charles, what in the name of wonder poſſeſſes you to be ſo dull, one would think ſome enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prevailed at Seymour Caſtle, and that the very air was infections, here is my lively Dory, metamorphoſed into muſing melancholy; and you, my late giddy couſin become the grave ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timental philoſopher. I verily believe a certain blind deity has been buſy with you, come hither, Charles, let me ſee where the arrow entered, is the wound deep?"</p>
                  <p>Melfont anſwered rather peeviſhy, and left the room. I felt my face glow and my heart throbbed violently, Lady Laura ſaw my emotion, "Poor dear, ſaid he, did it fall in love, and had it no hope; well, well, never mind it, 'twas all invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary I'll be ſworn."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="unknown:027654_0094_0FD5685FDE90A948"/>
Oh! Lady Laura, ſaid I, deſpiſe me not for my weakneſs.—I could ſay no more, tears burſt from my eyes, and I hid my face with my hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief.</p>
                  <p>"My dear Dory, ſaid ſhe, taking my hand, I did not mean to pain your gentle heart, I have long ſeen the tenderneſs ſubſiſting between my couſin and you, and aſſure you it has given me peculiar pleaſure; but my ſweet little friend, you muſt be rather cautious to guard your ſecret, for ſhould my father diſcover it, he will uſe every method to prevent an union between you ever tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, for Charles Melfont is deſigned by him the huſband of your Laura."</p>
                  <p>Had I been tranſfixed by lightning, my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance could not have expreſſed more horror and ſurprize. I felt in a moment that I muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a monſter of ingratitude in the eyes of the Earl, when he ſhould find I had thus, though unintentionally counteracted his deſigns, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his daughter's future ſettlement. I told Lady Laura, after what I had juſt heard, I ſhould think myſelf unpardonable to remain any longer at Seymour Caſtle, or ever ſuffer Melfont to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain me again in the character of a lover. I requeſted her to ſuffer me to return home, and ſaid, I would, if poſſible, avoid ever ſeeing him again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="unknown:027654_0095_0FD56861B2E82A60"/>
She laughed at what ſhe called my delicate ſcruples, and told me, ſhe had in her own mind planned out future ſchemes of happineſs for us all; for to tell you the truth, ſaid ſhe, I have no great inclination to Charles, being engaged both by inclination and ſolemn promiſes, to a young man of no great fortune, though of a good family; he is at preſent only an enſign in the guards, ſo that I am certain my father will never conſent to our union; but you know, my dear Dory, if you accept Melfont, I can then avow my choice openly, and you will at once render yourſelf happy, and confer an obligation on your friend.</p>
                  <p>In this manner did the artful Laura work on my feelings, and at length won Melfont over to her party. We were frequently witneſſes to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interviews between her lover and herſelf, and in a ſhort time ſo far forgot what was due to our parents, and to our own intereſt and honor, that we not only planned her eſcape but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied her flight, and the ſame ceremony united Lady Laura to Mr. Walſh, and your mother to Melfont.</p>
                  <p>When we returned to Seymour Caſtle we found it a ſeat of tumult and confuſion; the Earl refuſed us admittance, and my father, irritated at my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to his patron and benefactor, would not ſuffer me to enter his habitation, nor did I from
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:027654_0096_0FD56862CC8AD890"/>
that unhappy day ever ſee him; my behaviour had made ſuch an impreſſion on his mind, that he fell into a deep melancholy, which ſoon put a period to his exiſtence; the whole of his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were left to his neareſt male relation, and my name was only mentioned in the will, that he might reprobate my ingratitude.</p>
                  <p>I can truly ſay, the affliction I felt when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of his deceaſe, proceeded ſolely from the reflection, that I deſerved his anger, and had not ſeen him or endeavoured to gain his pardon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death.</p>
                  <p>The anguiſh of my heart was beyond expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the unremitting tenderneſs which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced from my huſband ſoon huſhed my griefs to reſt, and I became tranquil, and even happy.—Alas! this ſcene of ſerene pleaſure was not long to laſt; it fleeted away like a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and like a paſſing ſhadow left no trace behind.</p>
                  <p>One year of connubial love was paſt, when you, my beloved girls, were in one day uſhered into the world. Melfont was diſappointed, he had hoped for a boy, as his family had never been reconciled to what they termed ſo diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate a match, he imagined ſuch an event might in ſome meaſure have conciliated their regard,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:027654_0097_0FD56865D2CE1640"/>
but the birth of my daughters fruſtrated theſe hopes; however he ſtill continued the kind at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive huſband.</p>
                  <p>I lived extremely retired, conſoling myſelf for the loſs of every pleaſure which a perſon of my age might wiſh to enjoy, in Melfont's affection; and while that continued I had no wiſh ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.</p>
                  <p>Lady Laura frequently viſited me; her father had never forgiven her precipitate marriage, nor did he ever give her any fortune.</p>
                  <p>Walſh had married more from the hope of aggrandizing himſelf than from any affection he felt for her Ladyſhip. When he found theſe hopes were illuſive he threw off the maſk, and treated her with contempt and unkindneſs, by which means he rendered her life extremely wretched.</p>
                  <p>She ſaw the love and harmony which ſubſiſted between your father and me, and from that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of envy which hates to ſee happineſs in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther family, which it cannot enjoy at home, ſhe determined to undermine my felicity, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me as completely wretched as herſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="unknown:027654_0098_0FD568680AA451C8"/>
There is a caprice in the heart of man, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a depravity in their natures, which leads them to neglect and deſpiſe a woman totally in their power, and purſue with avidity thoſe who by almoſt inſurmountable obſtacles, are placed at a diſtance from them. This was exactly the caſe with Melfont. When Lady Laura was offered to him by her father, when wealth and honor would have attended his acceptance of her, he rejected her—but now, irrevocably united to me, and Laura the wife of another, he began to feel a paſſion for her, and to wiſh he had not marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo precipitately.</p>
                  <p>This paſſion was at firſt admitted into his boſom under the maſk of pity, he would liſten to the frequent complaints ſhe made of her hard fate, ſoothe her diſtreſs, and offer every conſolation in his power.</p>
                  <p>For ſome time I joined him in endeavouring to alleviate the ſorrows of the unhappy Laura; but at length his attentions to her became too pointed to eſcape the penetrating eye of watchful ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and I was unable to ſtifle that jealouſy which I had long ſtrove to ſuppreſs.</p>
                  <p>However afflicted I might be, at the viſible al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in your father's manner, I ſuffered no complaint to break forth, but nurſed my corrod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:027654_0099_0FD568680F171538"/>
ſorrows in ſilence and ſolitude; in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence I endeavoured to appear chearful, though my heart was almoſt broken by his unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Two years had paſſed in this dreadful manner, when Mr. Walſh died, and Lady Laura be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a blooming widow. Lord S—, her father, was at that time upon the continent, therefore ſhe had no opportunity to make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate perſonal application to him for reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</p>
                  <p>Lady Laura had long treated me with a cool hauteur, ſhe now no longer wore even the ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of politeneſs, but whenever ſhe came to the houſe, would either not ſpeak to me at all, or treat me with the moſt cruel diſreſpect. I ventured to complain to Melfont of her ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous behaviour, when his anſwer ſtruck me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dumb with ſorrow and aſtoniſhment.</p>
                  <p>I am ſurpriſed, Madam, ſaid he, that you ſhould complain to me in this manner, what right have you to expect particular attention from a woman of Lady Laura's diſtinction, I think ſhe does you too much honor by condeſcending to enter the houſe where you live. You ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Dory, you are only my miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="unknown:027654_0100_0FD56872CFB5C250"/>
Your miſtreſs, Melfont?</p>
                  <p>Yes, ſurely; you know I was under age when the ceremony was performed. I have never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced you to my family as my wife, nor have they ever conſidered you as ſuch."</p>
                  <p>I heard no more, a cold damp came over me, I ſhuddered and fell lifeleſs to the floor.—When I recovered, I found your cruel father had left me, in that ſtate of inſenſibility, to the care of the ſervants. I gave free vent to my ſorrows in a flood of tears, and then ſummoning all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude I could to my aſſiſtance, called for pen and ink, and wrote a letter to Melfont, a copy of which I have preſerved.</p>

                  <p>When I had finiſhed this letter I ordered a chaiſe and four, and bidding the ſervant put up a few things, took you, my beloved girls, and deſiring the letter might be delivered to your father when he came home, which I knew would not be till late at night, ſet off full ſpeed to Dover.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="unknown:027654_0102_0FD56870124B8090"/>
We travelled all night, and was lucky enough to arrive juſt as a packet was ſailing for Calais, I immediately embarked, a few hours wafted us acroſs the channel, and I then travelled with as much ſpeed as poſſible to Paris. It was late when I arrived, and being greatly fatigued with my journey, I determined to ſtay till the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before I waited on the Earl. I took an haſty ſupper and retired, in hope to recruit my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted frame by ſleep.</p>
                  <p>The next morning I aroſe early, and dreſſing myſelf, took my dear children in my hand, and repaired to the Earl's. I was with difficulty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and when I entered the room where his Lordſhip was at breakfaſt, my agitation was ſo great I could ſcarcely ſtand.</p>
                  <p>Dorcas! ſaid his Lordſhip, ſtarting from his ſeat.</p>
                  <p>Oh! my Lord, ſaid I, (throwing myſelf at his feet, and preſenting my girls to him) behold a miſerable woman and two helpleſs infants, who without your aſſiſting hand muſt be plunged in infamy and inevitable ruin.</p>
                  <p>Riſe, Dorcas, ſaid his Lordſhip, explain your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, your agitation at preſent deranges your ideas.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="unknown:027654_0103_0FD56869B2F1F248"/>
I then in a few words told him, that Melfont had diſowned me for his wife, and that I was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he meant to marry Lady Laura.</p>
                  <p>Heaven forbid, ſaid the Earl, that my poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated girl ſhould add ſuch an heinous offence againſt humanity, to the catalogue of her former crimes. Oh! Dorcas, her undutiful behaviour has been like a viper preying upon my heart; and to increaſe my affliction, I have been told ſhe has diſhonored even the man for whom ſhe forſook her father's protection. But this will be an act to make honor and humanity bluſh. Be comforted, continued he, for the ſake of theſe poor inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, I will not ſuffer your wrongs to paſs unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed or unredreſſed. Cheared by theſe kind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions I returned to my lodgings, with a heart conſiderably lightened, and was deſired to call on the Earl again in about ten days, when he ſhould have had time to conſult what was beſt to be done. On the appointed morning I repaired to the Earl, I found him ſeated at a table writing, a letter lay unfolded before him.</p>
                  <p>Dorcas, ſaid he, (riſing and leading me to a ſeat) I have received letters from England ſince I ſaw you.</p>
                  <p>Do they mention me, my Lord?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="unknown:027654_0104_0FD5687427FA67D0"/>
Yes, they ſay you have long led a very diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute life, and that you have eloped from your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with a young officer, and taken with you a quantity of money and jewels.</p>
                  <p>Heaven forgive them, ſaid I, and burſt into tears.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all, my poor girl, continued the Earl, you have worſe trials than this to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>Then I hope God will give me fortitude to ſupport them, ſaid I, but indeed my heart is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt broke already. However, my Lord, let me know the worſt, and I will endeavour to bear it with patience.</p>
                  <p>Melfont is married to Lady Laura.</p>
                  <p>Cruel Melfont, how have I deſerved this inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man uſage.</p>
                  <p>After you left me the other day, ſaid the Earl, I ſent a meſſenger expreſs to endeavour to procure a certificate of your marriage, and to take a letter to Laura, promiſing pardon and forgetfulneſs of all that was paſt if ſhe would not marry Melfont, but in caſe ſhe choſe to follow the bent of her own depraved inclination, to never aſſure the title of
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:027654_0105_0FD568758A322738"/>
my daughter again, for from that moment I would diſown her. My meſſenger returned yeſterday, and informs me, it is impoſſible to procure a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, as the clergyman who married you was dead, and that the day after you left England, Melfont publicly eſpouſed Lady Laura.</p>
                  <p>Merciful heaven, ſaid I, (ſinking on my knees) to your care I commit my dear injured children. Oh! ſuffer them not to be puniſhed for the ſins of their parents; make me the object of thy wrath for my diſobedience and ingratitude, but Oh! of thy infinite mercy avert the ſhafts of keen adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity from the boſom of my beloved girls.</p>
                  <p>The Earl was affected, he dropped a tear in compaſſion to my anguiſh, and promiſed to be my protector. The next day he gave me a deed, in which he ſettled this cottage and its appendages, with one hundred pounds a year, on me during my life, and to be continued to my children as long as they by their conduct ſhould merit his protection. I remained in France a few days, juſt to recruit my ſtrength and ſpirits, and then ſet forward for this place, where I have lived now ſeventeen years, endeavouring to form the minds of my children in ſuch a manner, that the follies which occaſioned their mother misfortunes might never find entrance in their hearts.</p>

Oh! Marian, liſten not to the voice of adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtifle every riſing ambitious thought, be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, be innocent, and be happy.</p>

                     <head>MARIAN AND LYDIA CONTINUED. PART IV.</head>
                     <p>MARIAN liſtened attentively to the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recital of her mother's ſorrow, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſyllable ſunk deep into the heart of Lydia. I will daily think of your diſtreſſes, my dear mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid ſhe, and they will ſerve as a ſhield to my heart, and render it invulnerable to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of vanity or the illuſion of paſſion.</p>
                     <p>And is my father living? ſaid Marian.</p>
                     <p>I know not, replied her mother, but if he is, he can never be any thing to you, he has renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us all.</p>
                     <p>It was inhuman, my dear mother, to deprive us
<pb n="04" facs="unknown:027654_0110_0FD5687E8C455B80"/>
of that rank in life, we were born to fill, and which I flatter myſelf we ſhould not have diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
                     <p>Fooliſh Marian, ſaid the anxious mother, why regret the loſs of ſuch a trifle: be virtuous, my child, you will then elevate the moſt humiliating ſtation, and riſe ſuperior to thoſe whoſe only boaſt is wealth and titles, to render them the envy of the blind miſguided multitude. Virtue alone is true nobility; content is real happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Lydia's heart reſponſive echoed her mother's ſentiments—Marian ſighed and was ſilent.</p>
                     <p>The moon in majeſtic ſplendor illumined the ſky, and darted her ſilver beams through the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent elms that ſhaded Dorcas's cottage. The ſiſters were feated by the door, and in obedience to their mother's command, were pouring forth their thankſgiving to the giver of all bleſſing in an evening hymn. They had juſt finiſhed when a ruſtling among the buſhes made them ſtart; a beautiful pointer ran into the cottage, and in a moment a ſervant in livery appeared, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the way to Gwinfred-Hall. Dorcas directed him which way to go. He ſaid he was weary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted a drop of water, and leave to reſt. Lydia went to fetch him ſome cyder, Dorcas moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="05" facs="unknown:027654_0111_0FD56881E8D8E4D8"/>
the door, and ſilently admired the beauty of the ſpangled firmament.</p>
                     <p>The man ſeized the opportunity, and delivered to the lovely unſuſpecting Marian a letter from Sir George Lovemore.</p>
                     <p>Love and ambition had already taught her art, ſhe haſtily took the offered letter, and hid it in her boſom. Alas! ſimple maid, you there foſtered a ſerpent, whoſe ſubtle poiſon tainted your very heart. The ſervant having completed his errand retired, and Marian found means to peruſe her letter;—it abounded with profeſſions of love, vows of everlaſting fidelity, and encomiums on her beauty. She read it with rapture, and though ſo recently warned of the duplicity of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved every ſyllable it contained. In concluſion, he ſolicited a private interview the next morning, in the field adjoining her mother's cottage. Marian pauſed at this requeſt, heſitated—read the letter again and reſolved to comply.</p>
                     <p>During ſupper ſhe was thoughtful and abſent, and when the uſual hour of reſt arrived, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with an anxious perturbed mind; ſleep was a ſtranger to her eyes, and ſeveral times ſhe almoſt reſolved to ſhew the letter to Lydia, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt her to accompany her—But then Sir
<pb n="06" facs="unknown:027654_0112_0FD56883CFB2CC80"/>
George had deſired her to come alone, he might be offended and ſhe might never ſee him again. Vanity alſo pleaded, he might marry her, raiſe her to an exalted ſtation, and ſhould his views be otherwiſe than honorable, ſhe certainly had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to withſtand his ſolicitations.</p>
                     <p>In this manner did ſhe wear out the tedious night, at five o'clock ſhe ſtole ſoftly from the ſide of her innocent ſleeping ſiſter, and with as little noiſe as poſſible opened the door that led into the fields. Aurora had but faintly ſtreaked the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſkies with mingled gold and purple, when the ill-fated Marian met her lover.</p>
                     <p>He thanked her for her condeſcention, told her his whole happineſs depended on her, and urged her immediate flight with him to London.</p>
                     <p>Marian heſitated, her mother, her ſiſter, hung heavy at her heart.</p>
                     <p>Sir George was an adept in the art of ſeduction, he talked of gaiety, ſplendor and pleaſure, ſwore ſhe was born to grace the firſt ſtation, declared it was a crime to bury ſo much beauty and ſweetneſs in a deſart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="07" facs="unknown:027654_0113_0FD5688581444B88"/>
Marian's reaſon was not convinced, but her vanity was awakened and her ſenſes dazzled, what wonder then that her ſcruples were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by Sir George's artful perſuaſions. She left the manſion of peace and innocence, and in a chaiſe which he had prepared for the purpoſe, hurried as faſt as four horſes would carry her to the ſeat of diſſipation and folly.</p>
                     <p>Marian dropped a tear as ſhe took a laſt look at the cottage, but Sir George kiſſed it off, and the reflection which had cauſed it to ſtart was inſtantly baniſhed from her mind.</p>
                     <p>Lydia on awakening miſſed her ſiſter, and haſtily riſing, ran into her mother's apartment, vexed that Marian ſhould have been the firſt to bid her good morning. I am not uſed to be ſuch a ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, my dear mother, ſaid ſhe, but my ſiſter has received your bleſſing before me this morning. I have not ſeen your ſiſter, ſaid Dorcas, but as it is a fine morning, ſhe has, no doubt, rambled out to enjoy its ſweets; go, my beloved Lydia and ſeek her.</p>
                     <p>Lydia left her mother, and ſought her ſiſter in the fields and woods; echo a thouſand times repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the name as ſhe called her dear Marian; at length fatigued and diſpirited, ſhe was returning
<pb n="08" facs="unknown:027654_0114_0FD5688816265960"/>
home, when ſhe met a ſhepherd, who early attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſheep, that way, and demanded of him whether he had ſeen her ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>He had ſeen her, he ſaw her enter the chaiſe with Sir George, he ſaw them drive off.</p>
                     <p>Lydia heard the heart-rending tidings, ſhe would have wept, but tears refuſed their relief; ſhe ſighed, raiſed her hands to heaven in an ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of grief, and ſunk lifeleſs upon the ground. The ſhepherd was frightened, nor did he uſe any method to reſtore her, but ran backward and forward, looking wildly round him, and calling aloud for help. A young gentleman who had been that morning out a ſhooting, heard the voice of terror, and haſtened to the ſpot where the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Lydia lay. Her charms were not of the daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zling ſort, but the more her features were examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the more they intereſted the beholder. The gentleman when he firſt raiſed her from the ground, felt only for her as he would for any other woman in diſtreſs; but when he looked attentively on her face, and beheld her lovely though inanimate fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he felt an irreſiſtible impulſe to defend her not only from her preſent uneaſineſs, but to ſhield her for ever from pain and affliction. He carried her to a ſpring, and bathed her temples with water, ſhe opened her expreſſive blue eyes, Oh! my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſiſter, ſaid ſhe, and freeing herſelf from the
<pb n="09" facs="unknown:027654_0115_0FD56889E70F7748"/>
arms of her deliverer, covered her face with her hands, and gave free vent to her tears.</p>
                     <p>Have you loſt your ſiſter, my ſweet maid, ſaid the ſtranger.</p>
                     <p>Alas! Sir, replied Lydia, I fear my poor Marian is worſe than dead. A gentleman has found means to enſnare her innocent unſuſpecting heart, and ſhe has this morning left her only friends to truſt the promiſes of one ſhe never ſaw till three days ſince. I know not how to return to my poor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with theſe fatal tidings, I fear it will go near to break an heart already oppreſſed with woes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt too heavy to be borne. "But God temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wind to the ſhorn lamb," continued ſhe, raiſing her eyes to heaven, and no doubt will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire her with fortitude to bear, without repining, this heavieſt of his trials.</p>
                     <p>The ſtranger reverenced her ſorrow, he took her paſſive hand, drew it under his arm, and ſo proceeded ſilently along towards Dorcas's cottage; he attempted not to interrupt her grief, but now and then a tear ſtole down his manly cheeks, and a reſponſive ſigh anſwered hers.</p>
                     <p>When they arrived at the cottage Dorcas met them at the door; Lydia flew towards her, fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her arms round her neck, and dropping her
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:027654_0116_0FD5688B4ABEEE48"/>
head on her boſom, ſobbed aloud.</p>
                     <p>Oh! my beloved, ſaid Dorcas, tell me, has any accident happened to your ſiſter?</p>
                     <p>She is gone, ſaid Lydia.</p>
                     <p>What, forever? cried the fond mother eagerly.</p>
                     <p>Oh! my dear mother, ſhe is loſt to us; that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman whom we met—</p>
                     <p>Enough, ſaid Dorcas, I fully underſtand the extent of my miſfortune; my Marian is diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, plunged in infamy; but I will not renounce her, ſhe is my child. Oh! heavens, none but a parent can judge of the anguiſh that now har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows up my ſoul. But, my ſweet Lydia, will you forſake your mother in her old age, will you leave her grey hairs to ſink in ſorrow to the grave, without a friend to chear her laſt moments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gentle hand of filial love to cloſe her dying eyes.</p>
                     <p>Oh! no, cried Lydia, dropping on her knees, never, never; when I forſake my honor'd mother, may heaven regardleſs hear me when I pray, may I be caſt out to ſickneſs, pain and poverty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a friend to pity or relieve me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="unknown:027654_0117_0FD5688CF32287C8"/>
Dorcas embraced her, and the ſtranger endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to diſſipate the drops of humanity which were gathering in her eyes. Lydia by degrees became more compoſed, and informed her mother of the obligations ſhe was under to the gentleman who had accompanied her home.</p>
                     <p>Oh! Sir, ſaid Dorcas, you are my friend and benefactor, had I loſt my Lydia I had loſt my all; but ſay, by what name ſhall I remember you in my prayers?</p>
                     <p>They call me Renfew, Earl of Landaff, ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>Dorcas ſtarted and turned pale—the Earl continued,</p>
                     <p>Your ſorrow has awakened in my breaſt every feeling of humanity, and if it is in my power to be of any ſervice to you, command me, and I will exert it to the utmoſt.</p>
                     <p>Alas! my dear Marian! ſaid Dorcas.</p>
                     <p>I underſtand you, replied the Earl, and wiſh I could reſtore her to you, but as that is not in my power, teach me by ſome other means to promote your happineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="unknown:027654_0118_0FD56891A81EE3A8"/>
My Lord, ſaid Dorcas, there is but one way to give the leaſt ſatisfaction to this afflicted heart; leave the cottage immediately, nor ever attempt again to ſee or converſe with Lydia.</p>
                     <p>And why this cruel reſtriction?</p>
                     <p>Time, my Lord, perhaps may inform you with my reaſons for acting thus. At preſent I cannot alledge the true cauſe, and will never ſtoop to a mean equivocation to excuſe an action, which I am ſenſible is perfectly right.</p>
                     <p>The Earl was piqued, he bowed and left the cottage.</p>
                     <p>Lydia, ſaid Dorcas, if you love your mother, you will avoid the Earl of Landaff.</p>
                     <p>He is generous and humane, ſaid Lydia,</p>
                     <p>Truſt not to appearances, replied her mother, when you ſhall learn a tale which I could tell you, you will then, like me, tremble at the name of Renfew.</p>
                     <p>Peace, with the ſpeed of a courier, now fled from the manſion of Dorcas, affliction uſurped her place, and with ſolemn pace each night walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſolitary Lydia over thoſe fields and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027654_0119_0FD5688ED19B4F18"/>
meadows where ſhe once had cheerfully tripped with her beloved Marian.</p>
                     <p>In one of theſe melancholy excurſions ſhe was accoſted by the Earl of Landaff; ſhe would have fled, but he prevented her, and in the moſt elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent language true love could inſpire, told her how dear ſhe was to him, and how cruel he thought her mother, in refuſing him the pleaſure of her converſation.</p>
                     <p>My mother, replied Lydia, can be actuated by no motive but a wiſh to promote my happineſs. I eſteem you, my Lord, I ſhall ever remember you with gratitude, but my mother has forbid me to hold any converſation with you. Adieu, Sir, I often think of you, but will never have any intercourſe with you.</p>
                     <p>Stay, my ſweet Lydia, ſaid the Earl, only ſay you do not hate me. I ſwear, dear maid, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns are honorable, and if you will put yourſelf under my protection, a private marriage ſhall convince you how ſincere my profeſſions are.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, replied Lydia, though I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge myſelf honored by this declaration, I muſt decline accepting your offer; I know my rank in life is far beneath what would be expected in the bride of Landaff, but humble as I am, I will
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027654_0120_0FD56894211062D0"/>
never become the wife of a man who would be aſhamed publicly to own me as ſuch; nor will I ever clandeſtinely converſe with a perſon whom my mother has forbid me to ſee. My ſiſter, I fear, by her diſobedience, has rendered herſelf miſerable, nor will I, by a like conduct, increaſe the affliction of my dear venerable parent.</p>
                     <p>Landaff expatiated on the many advantages attending wealth and ſplendor; Lydia heard him with ſilent contempt. He told her his only wiſh was, to make her happy.</p>
                     <p>That is impoſſible, my Lord, ſaid ſhe, the heart of Lydia never can know happineſs while her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in affliction, and her ſiſter, perhaps, a miſerable wanderer, expoſed to all the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, want and infamy can entail on a fallen woman.</p>
                     <p>All farther perſuaſion was of no effect, Lydia continued firm in her reſolution of not leaving her mother, and fearful of again meeting the importunate Earl, avoided for ſome time her favorite walk, confined herſelf to the narrow limits of their garden, and devoted her time entirely to comfort and chear her afflicted parent.</p>
                     <p>The Earl finding no hope of ſucceſs in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lydia from her duty, and having too much
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:027654_0121_0FD56895D5BEF888"/>
regard for virtue to force himſelf into their ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, with an intent to rob them of their only treaſure, repaired to London, thinking time and abſence would effectually baniſh her from his memory.</p>
                     <p>We will now leave Lydia, following her uſual innocent avocations, and return to Marian, who was emerged in the vortex of faſhionable folly.</p>
                     <p>When Sir George perſuaded the unſuſpecting Marian to leave her home, and truſt to his honor for protection, ſhe had no doubt but his deſign was to marry her; he had never told her ſo indeed, but ſurely he could mean nothing leſs—he had declared he loved her, and did not men always marry the women they loved? Thus with fallacious hopes did ſhe quiet each riſing fear, and by painting to herſelf the pleaſure her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſiſter would experience when they ſhould embrace her as Lady Lovemore, entirely oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the pain ſhe felt in reflecting on the unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs they would ſuffer when her flight ſhould be diſcovered.</p>
                     <p>Sir George had never formed an idea of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her his wife, he ſaw ſhe was beautiful, he felt he loved her, and thought by laviſhing on her
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:027654_0122_0FD56897612E2018"/>
riches and finery, to which ſhe had hitherto been unaccuſtomed, to enſnare and lead her an eaſy victim to be ſacrificed at the ſhrine of vice. To this end he forbore taking any liberty during their journey which might alarm her, treated her with reſpect and tender attention, and when they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in London placed her in an elegant lodging, with proper ſervants to wait on her, and left her to ruminate at leiſure on the change in her ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>The female attendant who was immediately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the perſon of Marian, was a girl who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly fallen a prey to the arts of Sir George, and now only enjoyed his bounty for reducing other hapleſs females to the horrid level with herſelf. She was wretched in the loſs of her own virtue, and like the ſpoiler of mankind, exulted in every opportunity of robbing others of that bleſſing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could no longer enjoy. She treated the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Marian with the moſt profound reſpect, led her through a ſuit of ſuperb apartments and told her, if ſhe could think of any thing that would add to the elegance or beauty of the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhe need only mention her wiſhes to have them complied with. She next diſplayed a variety of elegant female apparel, toys, jewels, and other things proper to catch the attention of inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced youth, and kindle the glowing ſeeds of vanity into a flame that might conſume her.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027654_0123_0FD5689A24B42DE0"/>
She deſcanted on the beauty, gallantry and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of Sir George, nor left the poor bewildered girl, 'till ſhe had ſeen her in bed, and faſt locked in the embraces of Morpheus.</p>
                     <p>Sophia, for that was the name of Marian's attendant, had learnt the part ſhe was to act from an old woman, to whom Sir George had wrote the day before he left Gwinfred-Hall. She knew it would not be prudent to give the artleſs girl any time for reflection, or to ſuffer her thoughts to recur to the friends ſhe had left in Wales. She therefore entered her apartment at an earlier hour than is cuſtomary for town-bred ladies to riſe; ſhe was ſtill aſleep.</p>
                     <p>Sophia watched the moment of awaking, and hurrying her to riſe, prevented the intruſion of buſy or perplexing thoughts. She was attired in a faſhionable undreſs, and before ſhe had time ſufficiently to admire either herſelf or the beauty of the breakfaſt apparatus, Sir George was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</p>
                     <p>Marian was now hurried from one ſcene of diſſipation to another for ſeveral days, ſhe was introduced to a large circle of thoſe unhappy women, who purchaſe eaſe and luxury at the price of honor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="unknown:027654_0124_0FD5689B47BDCBD8"/>
She was charmed with the gaiety of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and the vivacity of their converſation. Their precepts, their example, corrupted her heart, and ſhe began to think a life of licentious love (falſly termed a life of liberty) was alone a life of happineſs—She forgot her afflicted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forgot her innocent affectionate ſiſter, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got every precept of virtue and religion, and fell a voluntary ſacrifice to Sir George.</p>
                     <p>For many months folly wore the 'ſemblance of pleaſure, and riot and intemperance were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for felicity. But alas! the wretched Marian too late awoke to a ſenſe of her miſerable ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Sir George, attracted by a newer face, forſook her; refuſed her pecuniary aſſiſtance, and even had the unfeeling villainy to betray her into the power of one of his libertine companions.</p>
                     <p>At firſt her grief was violent, but ſhe had been taught a method to ſtifle the emotions of her heart by drowning her reaſon in repeated draughts of ſtrong liquors. She was ſoon loſt to every ſenſe of ſhame, and from being once the admiration of the croud wherever ſhe moved, became an object of contempt, and ſunk to the horrid ſtate of common proſtitution.</p>

                     <head>MARIAN AND LYDIA. PART V.</head>
                     <p>IT was a cold evening in autumn, the wind was bleak, the rain fell heavily, when pinched with famine and ſhivering with the chilling blaſts, Marian wandered, unfriended and unpitied, round Berkley-Square.—She had ſeveral times eſſayed to ſtop the paſſengers, and intreat charity, but there was yet a ſpark of pride remained unſubdued, which made the ſupplication appear too humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                     <p>She drew near a door where a carriage was wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—Major Renfew came from the houſe, and entered it; by the light of a flambeau, which ſhone on her face, he diſcovered Marian—her features were yet lovely, though pale, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marked by the oppreſſive finger of poverty. The Major bockoned her forward—Who are you ſaid he, ſurveying her with a ſcrutinizing eye, and why does your countenance wear this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of miſery?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="unknown:027654_0126_0FD5689F566CB518"/>
Alas! replied Marian, it is the true index of my heart! I am the daughter of folly and infamy, but though I own my puniſhment juſt, I cannot bear it without complaining—I cannot ſtarve in ſilence!</p>
                     <p>Various were the emotions that agitated the heart of Major Renfew while he gazed on the face of Marian; at firſt he felt ſomething like huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſtirring in his boſom, but at the ſecond glance it was a more lively emotion, he gave her a guinea, and appointing her to meet him at ten o'clock, at a houſe he mentioned, drove off to pay ſome viſits of ceremony.</p>
                     <p>Marian felt a warm glow of gratitude play round her heart, ſhe could have knelt and kiſſed the hand that had thus ſeaſonably adminiſtered relief. She waited impatiently for the hour of ten, when ſhe might thank her benefactor as ſhe ought.</p>
                     <p>Major Renfew was a man of gallantry, he had been ſome years ſeparated from his wife, and indulged himſelf in frequent caſual intrigues, which did no great honor either to the brilliancy of his taſte, or the goodneſs of his heart.</p>
                     <p>The beauty of Marian, though greatly impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by intemperance, was yet ſtriking; the Major
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:027654_0127_0FD568A05EC49E10"/>
at that time was without a favorite, and from the prepoſſeſſion he felt in his boſom towards our poor wanderer, he determined to raiſe her from the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſtate to which ſhe was reduced, to the <hi>honorable</hi> ſtation of his miſtreſs; he therefore diſpatched his viſits as quick as poſſible, and repaired to the place of appointment.</p>
                     <p>Marian met him at the door of the apartment, he gave her his hand, ſhe raiſed it to her lips, and attempted to ſpeak, but words were refuſed, a guſh of ſilent tears more eloquently ſpoke her ſoul's meaning—the Major was moved, he made her ſit down, and placing himſelf beſide her, began to unfold the deſigns he had formed in her favour.</p>
                     <p>Alas! Sir, ſaid Marian mournfully, I had hoped you would have taken me from this life of ſhame, indeed I am ſick of what is termed pleaſure, I long to ſink into peaceful obſcurity, and having juſt ſufficient to ſupply the wants of nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent my paſt miſdeeds, and wait with patience the appointed hour of reſt. I know not why it is, but I feel I never can return your generoſity in the way you require, and therefore dare not hope for farther favours.</p>
                     <p>Nay, my dear girl, ſaid the Major, this is affectation; come ſhake off this gloom which your
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027654_0128_0FD568A1D07CA848"/>
misfortunes have occaſioned to envelope your mind—what, though I am an old man, I will teach you to love me.</p>
                     <p>Oh! Sir, replied Marian, you have taught me that already, there is nothing which I ſhould think too hard to perform, to convince you of the grateful affections of my heart. But I had hoped this ſinking fragile frame never would have known pollution more.</p>
                     <p>The Major endeavoured to calm the perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her ſpirits, and preſſed her to partake of ſome excellent champaigne which he had ordered with the ſupper. Marian was thoughtful, eat little, and frequently turned her head to hide the ſtarting tears.</p>
                     <p>Supper removed he renewed his ſolicitations, ſhe ſunk on her knees, and with uplifted hands entreated him to grant her relief on other terms, or ſuffer her to leave him, and again tempt the miſeries of her hard deſtiny. He was deaf to her prayers, he attributed them to art—he raiſed her from the ground, and proceeded to unwarrantable liberties—ſhe made a violent effort, and ſpringing from his arms, cried, Oh! Dorcas, dear unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py mother, why did I leave you,—then ruſhing out of the room, ran precipitately into the ſtreet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="unknown:027654_0129_0FD568A34C3AB4F0"/>
The exclamation which ſhe made had thrown the Major into a ſtupor of aſtoniſhment, every faculty was ſuſpended, nor could he recover ſufficient recollection to endeavour to ſtop her—a thouſand paſt occurrences ruſhed upon his mind, and he remained immoveable, his eyes rivetted to the door through which ſhe had paſſed.</p>
                     <p>At length recovering from his ſurpriſe, he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a ſmall ſhagreen caſe which lay on the floor, and during her ſtruggles had dropped from Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's boſom. He took it up, with emotion opened it, and the portrait of Dorcas met his eyes. The caſe dropped from his unnerved hand, he groaned and fell ſenſeleſs to the floor, the noiſe of his fall brought up a ſervant of the houſe, proper remedies were applied and ſoon reſtored him to a keen ſenſe of his paſt guilt and treachery to Dorcas, for Major Renfew was the perjured huſband whom Dorcas had concealed under the name of Melfont.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thought that ſtruck him was the horrid crime he had ſo nearly perpetrated; the next was what was become of his poor ruined child—His continual ravings for his Marian, his dear loſt daughter, and the evident incoherence of his diſcourſe led the ſervants to believe he was ſeized with a ſudden fit of inſanity, and in that belief conveyed him home.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="unknown:027654_0130_0FD568A6521009E8"/>
The horror that dwelt upon his mind, and the violent agitation brought on a fever, and before morning he was inſenſible to all that paſſed about him. Before reaſon entirely forſook him, he was viſited by the Earl of Landaff, who was his nephew, to him he unfolded the dreadful tale, conjuring him to try every poſſible method to diſcover the unhappy wanderer.</p>
                     <p>Oh! ſaid he in an agony, "ſhe knelt and prayed, my child entreated me, with ſtreaming eyes, to ſnatch her from infamy, and I would not hear her,—ſeek her Landaff, find her, ſave her from periſhing for want." The remembrance was too acute, and his ſenſes, which were before wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, took their flight—but ſtill his fancy was haunted by the image of Dorcas and Marian, and his agonies became dreadful, even to thoſe who attended him.</p>
                     <p>Every enquiry after the hapleſs Marian was fruitleſs, and the miſerable Renfew, when a turn of his diſorder reſtored him to reaſon, found that there was no hope of recovering the poor wanderer—</p>
                     <p>The picture diſcovered to the Earl of Landaff that Dorcas was the mother and Lydia the ſiſter of the woman who had cauſed ſuch anxious emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his uncle's boſom, but how Lydia and

Marian ſhould be the daughters of Major Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>few appeared to him an inexplicable riddle. His uncle ſoon unravelled the myſtery, and received ſome conſolation from hearing that Dorcas was living, and that he might hope to embrace one innocent child, in his Lydia.</p>
                     <p>He determined to ſeek Dorcas in her ſolitude, and acknowledge her to the world as his firſt and only true affianced wife; but fearing to alarm her by too abrupt an appearance, he addreſſed her firſt by letter.</p>

                           <p>Oh! Dorcas, cruel as my conduct was to you, my puniſhment, I truſt, has been equal to my fault—alas! the crimes of the father have been viſited upon the child.

with anguiſh of heart, and relieved her not, but drove her from me, drove her again upon the mercileſs world, expoſed to all the miſeries of want!—But my old tough heart will not burſt, though it ſwells and throbs at the remembrance of that dreadful evening.</p>

                     <p>From the day of Marian's elopement pleaſure had been a ſtranger to the heart of Dorcas, nor could all the duteous tenderneſs of Lydia diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the anxiety ſhe felt for the fate of Marian from her maternal breaſt. Nor did joy now ſparkle in the eye of Lydia, the tear of ſorrow had quenched their luſtre, and like a canker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm had fed upon her cheek, and ſtole from

thence the bluſhing roſe.

                     <p>'TWAS night, a chearful fire illumined their little cottage, but ſorrow ſtill ſat heavy on the heart of Dorcas—the wind blew, the cold rain beat againſt the caſement; and where now is my poor Marian? ſaid ſhe, ſighing deeply.</p>
                     <p>I will ſing you your favorite hymn, ſaid Lydia, kiſſing off a tear as it fell on her mother's cheek, and ſtruggling to ſuppreſs its ſympathiſing ſiſter that trembled in her own eye.</p>
                     <p>She took up her guitar, ſhe wiſhed to divert her mother's attention from the painful reflections which then occupied her thoughts; ſhe paſſed her fingers acroſs the ſtrings, the tones were diſcordant, it is not in tune, ſaid ſhe. Alas! my dear Lydia, replied her mother, it is our minds that are not harmonized. She underſtood the meaning of her mother's words, but, making no anſwer, began to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:027654_0135_0FD568AF0DC0C468"/>
ſing an evening hymn of thanks. The ſudden trampling of a horſe interrupted her, a loud rapping at the door alarmed them—Lydia opened the door, a ſervant entered. Dorcas looked earneſtly at him; he threw aſide his rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coat, ſhe knew the livery, and inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized an old and favorite ſervant of Major Renfew.</p>
                     <p>Simon, ſaid ſhe, turning pale and riſing as ſhe ſpoke, why are you here?</p>
                     <p>My dear honored lady, I come from my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who repents his injurious treatment of you, and comes to do you juſtice; but let this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpeak for him.</p>
                     <p>And where is Lady Laura, ſaid Dorcas, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the letter.</p>
                     <p>She left my maſter ſome years ſince, and now leads a life of ſhame.</p>
                     <p>Poor miſguided Laura, ſaid Dorcas, as ſhe broke the ſeal.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe read the firſt lines joy lightened up her features, and a tranſient glow of pleaſure paſſed acroſs her face; but as ſhe proceeded her hands trembled, her countenance aſſumed a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027654_0136_0FD568B0371B9310"/>
hue, and large drops of unutterable anguiſh, chaſed each other down her cheeks—the letter fell to the ground, ſhe claſped her hands and raiſed her eyes towards heaven.</p>
                     <p>Omnipotent power, ſaid ſhe, teach me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe tidings as I ought, thy mercies and thy judgments go hand in hand. Oh! make me thankful for the one and ſubmiſſive to the other. Thou haſt mingled thy judgments and thy boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in my cup of life; leſt while receiving only benefits I ſhould forget the ſource from whence thoſe mercies flow. Lydia, continued ſhe, you will receive a father's bleſſing, but my poor Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian is loſt for ever.</p>
                     <p>Two days after Major Renfew had diſpatched the letter to Dorcas, he ſet forward for Wales, accompanied by the Earl of Landaff; it was nearly the cloſe of the third day, they had arrived within a few miles of the cottage, and had ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened their pace, that a ſervant might have time to inform Dorcas of their near approach. The Major's boſom was agitated by the moſt painful ſenſations, the Earl was animated by hope. The road was ſolitary, ſkirted on one ſide by a thick wood, from whence they ſeveral times imagined they heard a voice of complaint, the Major ſtopped his horſe and ſtood in the attitude of liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="unknown:027654_0137_0FD568B2C6127568"/>
Ah! woe is me, ſaid the voice, I can get no farther, I muſt e'en periſh here.</p>
                     <p>Landaff diſmounted inſtantly and ruſhed into the wood, the Major would have followed but a ſudden pang ſeized him, he reſpired with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and was forced to ſupport himſelf again a tree. In a few moments Landaff returned, a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male reſted on his arm, her emaciated frame but ſlenderly ſheltered from the inclemencies of the weather, by a tattered gown; her hair looſe and diſhevelled, her feet bare and bleeding from wounds ſhe had received from ſharp ſtones, as ſhe walked. Here is a ſight of miſery, ſaid the Earl.</p>
                     <p>The Major looked at the unhappy girl, and through the ſhade which extreme want, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and even diſordered reaſon had caſt over her countenance, inſtantly diſcovered the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Marian.</p>
                     <p>Merciful heaven, he exclaimed, it is my child.</p>
                     <p>Have you a child, ſaid Marian, catching at his laſt words, then for pity's ſake don't forſake her. I had a father once, I had a lover too, but you ſee how it is with me now, I am poor, very
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:027654_0138_0FD568B558FAB2F8"/>
wretched, and I ſometimes think not quite in my right ſenſes. I have a mother who lives ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where here about, I have travelled a long way in hopes to find her, but I know not how it is, I have eat ſo little, and wept ſo much, I was obliged to ſit down and reſt. Do but ſee how my poor feet bleed.</p>
                     <p>Oh! my dear child, cried the Major, you make my heart bleed drop for drop with them; but I am going to your mother's, and will ſhew you the way.</p>
                     <p>You are a man, ſaid ſhe, and I dare not truſt you; they are all hard-hearted, cruel and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous. I once, continued ſhe; looking ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly in the Major's face, I once met a man, but 'tis a long time ſince, who looked and ſpoke as you do, only not quite ſo ſorrowful—I was miſerable then, and he promiſed to be my friend, but he did not mean it; he uſed me very cruelly, I hardly know how I got from him, and have been wandering about ever ſince, ſometimes one cold ſtone, ſometimes another has been my pillow. I bear it as well as I can, we all muſt ſuffer according to our offences.</p>
                     <p>Dear lunatic, ſaid the Major, what a leſſon doſt thou teach thy father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="33" facs="unknown:027654_0139_0FD568B6C9A29D20"/>
That is true, ſaid ſhe, you have a child, if it is a daughter, bring her to me, and I will teach her ſuch a leſſon—I have it here (laying her hand on her heart) it can never be eraſed but by the hand of death. Oh! I would tell her ſuch tales of men, would teach her to beware their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, to ſhut herſelf in retirement, to pray for humility. Oh! fye upon it, fye upon it, 'tis a bad world, but I'll to my mother, for I am ſick, heart-ſick of its follies.</p>
                     <p>She then darted precipitately into the wood, but had not proceeded many ſteps, when over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with fatigue, long faſting, and the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her diſordered ſpirits, ſhe ſunk under the complicated evils, and fell fainting to the ground.</p>
                     <p>Renfew was too much abſorbed in his own feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be able to give any orders concerning his unhappy daughter, and could only exclaim, "Theſe are thy works, oh vice; look, old Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>few, behold the ruin of thy child, and remember 'tis the reward of thy own ingratitude, perfidy and cruelty."</p>
                     <p>Landaff aſſiſted the ſervants in raiſing Marian, and being then but a ſhort diſtance from the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, perſuaded his uncle to ride forward, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by one ſervant, while he followed with
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027654_0140_0FD568BA704062F0"/>
the other two ſupporting Marian between them. And is this the peace offering I ſhall carry to my afflicted Dorcas, a daughter murdered by the inhumanity of a father, ſaid the Major as he proceeded.</p>
                     <p>Dorcas had been liſtening to every paſſing breeze, and counting the minutes, chiding their tardy progreſs. The ſound of horſes feet caught her ear, ſhe met her repentant Renfew at the door, threw herſelf into his arms, and fainted. Lydia knelt and received a father's bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>Words are too languid to deſcribe the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcene, ſuffice it to ſay, for Marian was for a moment forgot, for a moment they were all happy; but they were awakened from this dream of bliſs by the approach of Landaff.</p>
                     <p>Lydia ſtarted as ſhe drew near the door, Renfew ſtruck his forehead with his hand, and burſting from the embraces of Dorcas, ruſhed out of the room.</p>
                     <p>Marian was beginning to recover her ſenſes as they entered the cottage. Lydia thought it was a ſtranger, poor and ſickly, and as ſhe lent her arm to aſſiſt in leading her in, a tear fell in compaſſion to her weakneſs and apparent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027654_0141_0FD568BE21165640"/>
Marian ſunk into a chair, folded her arms round Lydia's waiſt, and gazing at her for a moment, recollection and reaſon at once returned, ſhe dropped her head on her boſom and cried, it is indeed my ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>The voice was familiar to Dorcas. That voice ſhould be the voice of Marian, ſaid ſhe, but alas! the form retains no traces of my once lovely innocent child.</p>
                     <p>Innocence and peace are fled together, ſaid Marian, grant me but pardon and let me die at your feet; ſhe ſunk upon her knees, Lydia knelt beſide her; the afflicted mother wept over her, bleſſed and forgave her.</p>
                     <p>Enough, ſaid Marian, this was the only prayer I dared to offer at the throne of grace ſince I left my home, and became acquainted with guilt and miſery; how it has pleaſed heaven to direct me to you I know not. I have ſome faint recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an horrid dream, but all things ſeem fading from my memory, an icy chillneſs hangs about my heart, I feel the ſprings of life are quite exhauſted.</p>
                     <p>Oh! ſpare her, ſpare my child, merciful heaven, cried Dorcas, ſinking on her knees.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="unknown:027654_0142_0FD568BF099863F0"/>
It cannot be, ſaid the expiring ſufferer, I die, but a mother's bleſſing ſoftens even the agonies of death, Oh! had I but deſerved it.</p>
                     <p>She raiſed her hands and eyes in a fervent though inarticulate ejaculation to heaven, and uttering a piercing groan expired.</p>
                     <p>Renfew heard the groan, he heard the cries of Dorcas and Lydia—"And is ſhe dead, ſaid he, ruſhing in and catching the pale corſe in his arms, Oh! Marian! Marian! why ſhouldeſt thou pay the forfeit of thy father's crimes? But tell me, continued he, who was her ſeducer; who plunged my child into this abyſs of miſery; teach me where to find him, that with his heart's blood I may waſh out the ſtain he has entailed upon the name of Renfew."</p>
                     <p>Forbear, ſaid Dorcas, laying her hand upon his arm, while a beam of mingled piety and fortitude illumined her countenance, forbear, the hand of heaven is in it, accept its juſt chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with humility, and remembering only thine own offences, blot from thy memory the offences of others.</p>
                     <p>Renfew turned from her, folded his arms upon his boſom, and was ſilent.</p>

A few days after the ill-fated Marian was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to her parent earth, when Renfew, Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, and Lydia removed to the ſeat of the Earl of Landaff, where in a ſhort time ſhe reaped the full reward of her filial duty and unremitting tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to her mother, by becoming the bride of that young nobleman. She was the bleſſing of her parents, the pride and honor of her huſband, the friend and preceptreſs of her children, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid an hundred fold the pleaſure ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to Dorcas's boſom by ſhewing the ſame duty and affection to her.</p>
                     <p>Major Renfew purchaſed the cottage where his wife and children had lived ſo many years, and kept it in conſtant repair; in the garden he had two ſmall temples erected, one was almoſt hid from the eye, by thick ſpreading cypreſs and yew trees, round whoſe branches twined the deadly night-ſhade, and baleful ivy; within was a tomb of black marble, over which ſtood Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity weeping; on the front of the monument was the following inſcription:</p>

                     <p>The other temple was built of white marble, ſurrounded by the moſt beautiful flowering ſhrubs and evergreens; within was Peace and Proſperity, ſhowering their favors on filial piety; above ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered an Angel with a crown of gold in her hands, round which was this heavenly promiſe:

                     <p>STILL am I to complain of the ſhortneſs of your letters, and receive the trifling excuſe, that you have no time. Fye, my dear girls, I am aſhamed to read ſo very childiſh an apology, your want of time muſt proceed from your own bad management, for ſurely no rational being will give more to the purſuit of amuſement than what might juſt ſerve to give a zeſt to retirement; and, believe me, you will find retirement alone the ſource of true happineſs, and promoter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry—and on the contrary, an eager purſuit of faſhionable folly, which ſeduces you under the ſemblance of pleaſure, always tends to debilitate the faculties of the mind, and lead you into habits of idleneſs and indolence at once prejudicial to your tranquillity and intereſt, not only your tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, but what is of far more conſequence, your ſpiritual intereſt.</p>

friend, who regards you with a tenderneſs nearly maternal; tell me, and tell me truly, I entreat, how much time you can ſpare to devote each day to the Creator and giver of all good? Ah! my young friends, I fear but a little, very little por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is allotted for that ſervice; yet truſt me it is a ſervice which cannot be neglected but by the ungrateful and unthinking. Is there one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your lives that paſſes unmarked by his bleſſings? Have you not health, chearfulneſs, friends, and the moſt valuable of all bleſſings, the power to dry the tear of affliction, to comfort the widow, protect the orphan, releaſe the poor debtor, and perform all the good works of peace and mercy?</p>
                     <p>How ſhould your hearts overflow with gratitude to that God, who thus bountifully ſpreads around you the means of happineſs, do not then my dear children, throw the bleſſing from you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſquandering your time, and trifling with your health 'till the firſt is nearly ſpent, and the latter irretrievably ruined, and you will awaken too late to a juſt ſenſe of your error, when your mind, evervated by the weakneſs of your frame, vainly ſhall endeavour in the few remaining years to regain thoſe ſources of mental delight which ever ſlow from a proper exertion of the reaſoning faculties.</p>
                     <p>

When you were with me, was there ever a day too long? I hear you readily anſwer no. Every moment was fully and pleaſantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; true, but had we not always time for reading, writing, muſic, drawing, needle-work, and every other amuſing or uſeful employment. And did we ever, my dear girls, riſe from the ſweets of repoſe, or retire to our chambers at night, without remembering our duty to him through whoſe mercy alone we enjoyed all thoſe bleſſings? and certain I am, you were at that time as happy as it was poſſible for young people to be; you were blithe as the woodlark, bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Hebe, and innocent as the dove, who tries his new fledged wings in little circles round its mother's neſt.</p>
                     <p>Think not, my young friends, that I wiſh to deprive you of innocent amuſement, far from it. In the ſphere where it has pleaſed providence to place you, it is certainly right that you ſhould partake in moderation of all the diverſions of the metropolis; but if thoſe diverſions are too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repeated, they loſe their effect, and you return from them weary, diſguſted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>But how different are the pleaſures ariſing from the amuſement to be found within ourſelves. The purſuit of either of the fine arts, the ſtudy

of nature, in all her varieties and beauties, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of chriſtianity, the delights ariſing from benevolence—here are inexhauſtible ſources of entertainment, rational ſublime pleaſure, that the farther you purſue it, the more enchanting ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the proſpect, new charms ariſe to your aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed view; and though the joys of youth tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiently fleet away, you will ſtill have pleaſures within your reach, that can render old age not only eaſy to yourſelf, but delightful to others.</p>
                     <p>I am no ſtranger to the many enticements youth and inexperience meet with in the gay world to allure them from the paths of reaſon. I myſelf ſpent my youth in London, but it was my lot to be placed in a family, where nothing was deemed pleaſure, however ſpecious its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, that was not ſanctioned by reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Your grandmother, my dear girls, was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man remarkable for the elogance of her manners and the chearfulneſs of her diſpoſition; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me ſhe was as truly pious as a primitive chriſtian. Surrounded with affluence, ſhe was humble, benevolent, tender hearted, and eaſy of acceſs to the meaneſt petitioner. In affliction reſigned, patient and uncomplaining.</p>

She paid a ſtrict attention to her domeſtic affairs, attended perſonally to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and education of her children, never ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an hour to paſs unemployed, or a day without paying her devotion to her maker.</p>
                     <p>This is an example I could wiſh you to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as it cannot ſail of making you as truly happy, as it is poſſible for human nature to be.</p>

                     <p>AND ſo you really feel yourſelves mightily offended becauſe your father thinks of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond marriage, when you ſhould rather rejoice to find he has choſen ſo amiable a woman as Mrs. Clairville.</p>
                     <p>You are to conſider that it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable in a few years you will all of you be ſettled in a matrimonial way, and then how extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable will your father find himſelf, after being ſo long accuſtomed to the ſociety of an amiable woman, to feel himſelf at once deprived of it, how ſolitary would be his houſe, how pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive his breakfaſt hours.</p>
                     <p>But you cry, you do not like a ſtep-mother. Can you ſuppoſe that Mrs. Clairville will aſſume any improper authority over you when ſhe becomes Lady Winworth?—</p>

Believe me, my children, while you behave with tenderneſs and propriety towards her, ſhe will never appear otherwiſe than your friend and companion. Beſides, you ſhould reflect that your father having diſcharged his duty towards you, by giving you a liberal education, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining unmarried till you have attained to years of maturity, has now an undoubted right to pleaſe himſelf, and chuſe a companion ſuited to his age and diſpoſition.—And ſhall you, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his affection, whoſe happineſs he has ſo much ſtudied, whoſe felicity is the firſt wiſh of his heart, ſhall you ungratefully murmur at his choice, and by your diſcontent embitter the life of him it is your duty to love and reverence.</p>
                     <p>No, no.—I think my dear girls know too well the many obligations they are under to this dear father, to attempt any thing which would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to his happineſs. Conſider, my dear girls, how much it will be your intereſt to endeavour to conciliate the affection and eſteem of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom your father thinks proper to place in ſo reſpectable a ſituation. You muſt regard her as the repreſentative of your deceaſed parent, and by tender aſſiduity and attention, make her your ſincere friend; ſuch a conduct will make you dearer than ever <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

utmoſt of your power you have performed your duty.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps you may tell me, there is no actual duty due to a ſtep-mother. I confeſs it is not ſo much a duty incumbent for you to obey the commands or ſubmit implicitly to the will of any but your natural parent, but remember my fair friends, if you voluntarily perform an exalted action, where perhaps it was not expected, and could not be demanded, how much more will it redound to your honor, than the ſimple diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of an obligation.</p>
                     <p>I am ſenſible that many young women have been rendered extremely unhappy by their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's chooſing ſecond wives, but then it has been the error of judgment in his choice; where paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion has ſo blinded him that he could not diſcover the faults of the perſon who had attracted his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Perhaps ſhe has been ignorant, ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, illiberal, or fantaſtic; nay, it has been the unhappy fate of ſome girls to have for a ſtep-mother, a perſon in whom all thoſe diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able circumſtances are combined. But what a different choice has your father made, Mrs. Clair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville is elegant, accompliſhed, gentle and unaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming. She will render your father's evening of life like the parting rays of a mild autumn day, where though we cannot but ſee the viſible

approach of winter, there is ſuch a ſoft ſerenity, ſuch various beauties ſcattered over the proſpect, that the reflecting mind cannot but prefer it to the more gaudy tints that embelliſh the appearance of ſpring.</p>
                     <p>Your own felicity too may be augmented by this union, as I am certain, however vanity or folly may for a moment miſlead your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you will all ſincerely rejoice in an event that will ultimately tend to inſure the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined pleaſure to ſo good, ſo valuable a father, as Lord Winworth, by uniting him to a woman, whoſe highly cultivated underſtanding renders her at once the chearful rational companion, and the diſintereſted friend.</p>
                     <p>You may remember, my dear girls, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind you thought me, when I poſitively refuſed to accompany you to London; perhaps you may now perceive the juſtice of that refuſal. Had I complied with the polite invitation of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yielded my own better judgment to your preſſing entreaties, I ſhould have undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly long ago forfeited, in your opinion, all right to your affection.</p>
                     <p>Some years before Lord Winworth beheld your truly amiable mother, he ſo far humbled himſelf as to make me a tender of his hand and fortune. I
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:027654_0154_0FD568D74E31B678"/>
will not dwell on the reaſon that urged me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe an offer ſo very far above my deſerts, leaſt my dear Miſs Winworths ſhould think I boaſted of my great fortitude and reſolution; believe me, it was only an exertion of reaſon, and I felt amply compenſated for all I ſuffered in this ſelf-denial, (for I will not deny that my heart pleaded ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in your father's favor) by the reflection that I had acted with honour and propriety, and evinced the ſincerity of my gratitude to my dear benefactreſs.</p>
                     <p>Affections that have been deeply impreſſed on our hearts in extreme youth, are often revived again at the remote period of mature age, and I feared to loſe the friendſhip of my young friends, by awakening in the boſom of their father the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs he once honored me with, by profeſſing—.</p>
                     <p>Before I drop this ſubject, I will give you two inſtances that have fell under my own immediate knowledge, to ſhew you how very poſſible it is for an obſtinate miſjudging child to trifle away both her own and father's happineſs, by being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully blind to the merits of his ſecond wife; and alſo ſhew how truly amiable the daughter muſt appear, who makes the tranquillity of her parent her chief ſtudy; and if her own peace is in ſome meaſure interrupted by the caprice of a ſtep mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhe will ſeek in reſignation, piety and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, a ſweet conſolation and comfort.</p>

Celia Markham had the miſfortune to loſe her mother at the early age of twelve. Mr. Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was doatingly fond of his daughter, he placed his chief felicity in the hope of one day ſeeing her the moſt amiable, accompliſhed and happy girl in England.</p>
                     <p>He had placed her at an eminent boarding ſchool, but he knew too much of the world to ſuppoſe, a girl of her volatile diſpoſition, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when ſhe was lovely in her perſon, and reputed heireſs to a large fortune, could be ſo ſafe any where as under the immediate protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a father. He had no female relation whom he could with propriety invite to his houſe, and he thought he could not do his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a more acceptable ſervice, than by chooſing the amiable Miſs Nelſon to preſide in the place of her departed mother.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Nelſon was at that time upwards of thirty, ſhe had rendered herſelf univerſally beloved and reſpected by all who knew her, for the innate goodneſs of her heart was conſpicuous in every action. She had received a moſt liberal education, and her mental endowments were far ſuperior to the generality of what is termed accompliſhed women—yet ſo timid and unaſſuming in her manners, that thoſe with whom ſhe converſed by
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:027654_0156_0FD568DA153DBA98"/>
degrees diſcovered her excellencies, and after ſome years acquaintance would be daily finding ſomething new to admire. She had by the moſt exemplary conduct as a daughter, convinced the world what might be expected from her as a wife and mother. She was uniformly humane, pious and gentle; in perſon attractive, and in manners elegantly ſimple.</p>
                     <p>Such was the woman whom Mr. Markham thought would help to form the manners, culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the underſtanding, and direct the ſtudies of his darling Celia.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Markham no ſooner was informed of her father's intended union, than ſhe conceived the moſt violent and ill founded diſlike toward the innocent object of his affection.</p>
                     <p>As Celia was ſo young, Mr. Markham never had an idea of conſulting her on his propoſed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, having therefore obtained from Miſs Nel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon leave to name an early day for the ceremony, he wrote to his daughter an affectionate letter, informing her how much he had ſtudied her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in providing her ſo amiable a friend and preceptreſs, at the ſame time requeſting her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs to prepare her to be preſent at the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="unknown:027654_0157_0FD568E1904B10F8"/>
Celia was a girl of high ſpirits, her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding had remained entirely uncultivated, while large ſums had been expended on the far leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſuperficial accompliſhments of muſic, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, drawing, and fancy works. Religion ſhe knew but by name; it is true, there were prayers read twice a-day in the ſchool, and ſhe went with the other ladies regularly to church twice every Sunday, but there it reſted. There had been no pains taken to inſtil into her mind a true knowledge of what religion meant; ſhe had not been taught that to keep her paſſions under the controul of reaſon, to ſubmit, without repining, to the will of thoſe whom heaven had placed over her; to be meek, merciful, and juſt, and let every action of her life be a continued work of gratitude to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and good will to her fellow creatures, was to follow the precepts of true piety.</p>
                     <p>She had been early taught to value herſelf, upon the trifling advantages of birth and fortune, for ſhe ſaw the viſible difference between the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and reſpect paid by her governeſs and the teachers to herſelf and thoſe young ladies who had neither of thoſe advantages to recommend them.</p>
                     <p>She was naturally vain, and that vanity was augmented by the conſtant adulation which ſhe daily received from thoſe girls, whoſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

of ſpirit induced them to cringe to her ſuperior wealth.</p>
                     <p>From conſtantly contemplating thoſe fancied endowments, ſhe began to imagine ſhe was born for univerſal ſway, had ſettled it in her own mind, that in a few years ſhe ſhould be called home to preſide at her father's table, have the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the family, and partake of all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable pleaſures with which the metropolis abounds.</p>
                     <p>How great then was her diſappointment when ſhe found all theſe pleaſing expectations at once fruſtrated—when ſhe found ſhe was to be ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a child, and under the controul of the moſt dreaded of all characters, a ſtep-mother.—</p>
                     <p>She knew Miſs Nelſon, but far from admiring her amiable qualities, ſhe had conſidered her as a dull, preciſe, inſipid old maid. She had no idea that chearfulneſs and unaffected piety conſtantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited the ſame breaſt, nor could ſhe conceive that rational converſation, ſtudy, uſeful employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and innocent amuſement, could amply di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſify the ſcene, and be a ſource of tranquil hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs without the aid of public entertainments, dreſs, parade and folly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="unknown:027654_0159_0FD568E341487208"/>
It may be eaſily conceived, that two tempers ſo diametrically oppoſite would never agree.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Markham had ſeen theſe erroneous traits in his daughter's diſpoſition, but he flattered himſelf, the amiable example and condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behaviour of Miſs Nelſon would ſo far ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate on her temper, as to make her love and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to imitate her virtues.</p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible to deſcribe the rage and grief that diſplayed itſelf in the countenance of Celia, on the receipt of her father's letters, regarding only what ſhe fooliſhly imagined would be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to her own happineſs. She gave vent to her paſſion in the moſt unbecoming terms, called her father cruel, unjuſt and unfeeling, and vowed ſhe would die ſooner than call Miſs Nelſon mother. "I will go to the wedding, ſaid ſhe, becauſe that woman ſhall not have a moment's happineſs of which it is in my power to deprive her."</p>
                     <p>With this <hi>laudable</hi> reſolution ſhe ſat forward for her father's houſe, where upon being tenderly embraced by him, inſtead of returning a cordial ſalute, and wiſhing him joy, ſhe turned her face from him and burſting into tears, (which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded more from paſſion than ſenſibility) ſaid ſhe was ſorry to find her dear mother was ſo ſoon forgot.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="unknown:027654_0160_0FD568DE016EED98"/>
Not forgot, my beloved; replied Mr. Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, for I have ſought a woman who is her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-part in every amiable quality.</p>
                     <p>They then proceeded to church, where, after the ceremony was performed, tears and ſullen curt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys were all the gratulations Celia offered to her new mother.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Markham was naturally a woman of great ſenſibility ſhe attributed Celia's melancholy to a cauſe that did honour to her own heart, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of taking offence, endeavoured to ſoothe and entertain her during the whole day. But alas! the gentle Mrs. Markham knew not the difficulty of the taſk ſhe had undertaken. She had known Celia ſome years before her mother's death, and always thought her an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, lively girl, and judging of her diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition by that of her parents, imagined there would be no difficulty in modelling her accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her own wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>But theſe fallacious hopes were ſoon no more. Celia from the day of her father's marriage took every opportunity in her power to thwart and vex her mother-in-law.</p>
                     <p>Though Mrs. Markham was a woman of too much ſenſe, to let the caprice of ſuch a girl ruffle
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:027654_0161_0FD568E61847F140"/>
the uncommon ſerenity of her temper, yet was it totally impoſſible for a woman of her exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſenſibility, to enjoy any tolerable degree of happineſs while ſhe ſaw the darling child of the man ſhe loved and eſteemed of ſo froward and perverſe a diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>Celia was volatile, and thoughtleſs to exceſs, fond of company, and ſo entirely unqualified to amuſe or entertain herſelf, that the moſt improper ſociety was preferred to being alone. Her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law was of too grave and rational a turn to afford her any pleaſure by her converſation, and to read or work required ſo much attention, that ſhe termed it fatigue.</p>
                     <p>It was with infinite regret that Mr. Markham diſcovered the little felicity he was like to enjoy in this ſecond union. He ſaw the child of his tendereſt affection reſtleſs and diſcontented; he ſaw with anguiſh the many fruitleſs endeavours of Mrs. Markham to reclaim and make her purſue the direct road to happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Whenever the tender attention of this amiable woman lead her to remonſtrate with Celia on the impropriety of her conduct, and the miſerable waſte of her time, the petulant girl would burſt into tears, and cry, "Oh! that my dear mother was living, I ſhould not then be treated thus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:027654_0162_0FD568E08369D720"/>
and abridged of every innocent pleaſure, by a woman, who having ſtolen from me my dear father's affections, now uſurps and undue authority over both him and me."</p>
                     <p>Theſe continual diſputes greatly embittered Mrs. Markham's life.—Mr. Markham was at a loſs how to conduct himſelf ſo as to give pain to neither wife or daughter. In ſhort, the whole family was unhappy from the capricious beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of her, whoſe chief ſtudy ſhould have been to promote their felicity.</p>
                     <p>Celia had her friends, her parties, and her ſecrets, in which Mrs. Markham was not allowed to participate; the conſequence was, that ſhe at a very early age had her lovers alſo.</p>
                     <p>Among the many candidates for her favor was a Captain Parſlow, he was a man of no fortune, ignorant, conceited, and a complete coxcomb. He ſoon diſcovered the weakneſs of Celia, he flattered her foibles, took her part againſt her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law, and, in ſhort, ſo far won on the fooliſh thoughtleſs girl, that ſhe conſented to elope with him, and take a trip to Scotland.</p>
                     <p>By the dropping of a letter Mrs. Markham diſcovered the plan; ſhe talked to Celia in the accents of friendſhip and ſend ſolicitude but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:027654_0163_0FD568EA7492B998"/>
in return, only impertinence and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Markham thought it her duty to acquaint her huſband with the diſcovery ſhe had made. Grieved to the ſoul, he ſent for his daughter, and in the moſt pathetic terms entreated her to deſiſt from ſo fatal a ſtep.</p>
                     <p>The artful Celia thought this was the time to alienate her father's affections from his wife—ſhe poſitively denied the whole charge, and declared ſhe believed it muſt be a contrivance of Mrs. Markham';; begged if her dear father thought her capable of ſuch imprudence, he would ſend her abroad, and ſhut her in a convent. "I know, continued ſhe, with well diſſembled tears, that you have been taught to conſider your poor girl as an abandoned wretch, who conſulted only her own happineſs, but indeed, indeed my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved father, you have been deceived. I am not the guilty creature you think me. But, alas! I have long ſeen my preſence is a bar to your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, ſend me from you, then, dear Sir; ſince it is impoſſible we can both enjoy content, let me be the victim, and may your felicity be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded."</p>
                     <p>This artful ſpeech had the deſired effect, and Mr. Markham believing his daughter perfectly
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:027654_0164_0FD568EC21230840"/>
innocent, began to treat the woman with coolneſs whom he imagined had attempted to create diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention between him and his only child.</p>
                     <p>Celia ſaw ſhe had now completely made her mother-in-law unhappy, and exulted in her cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, adding inſult to the already poignant ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the patient and amiable Mrs. Markham.</p>
                     <p>But Celia had not ſufficient art to elude or evade the ſolicitude of her admirer. Parſlow ſtill continued his devoirs, and Miſs Markham liſtened to his flattery and received his aſſiduities with too much pleaſure to give any room for deſpair; in a ſhort time ſhe eloped. Her father was amazed, and how much was his aſtoniſhment increaſed when the following letter was put into his hand.</p>

                     <p>The feelings of a father on the receipt of ſuch a letter are more eaſily conceived than deſcribed. He had long conſidered his innocent wife as a perſon who bad diſturbed the peace of his family, and now that he imagined himſelf convinced of her unjuſt conduct towards his daughter, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure knew no bounds; rage, invective, and bitter reproach, were all the gentle, meek, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complaining ſufferer received from a huſband
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:027654_0166_0FD568F27B192298"/>
who once fondly eſteemed her. But though Mrs. Markham complained not the diſtreſs of her mind preyed upon her delicate frame, ſhe ſank under this unexpected miſfortune, and a rapid decline in a few months put a period to her exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time Celia and her huſband had been received and forgiven by Mr. Markham; but, alas! that too indulgent father ſoon diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that in the loſs of his wife, he had been bereft of every earthly comfort; his daughter ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther triumphed in, than endeavoured to ſoothe his melancholy—ſhe threw out the moſt illiberal cenſures on the memory of the deceaſed Mrs. Markham, and having no longer any particular end to attain by pretending violent affection to her father, ſhe at firſt began to flight and at length totally neglected him.</p>
                     <p>He felt, acutely felt, her unkindneſs, but ſtill his affection led him to laviſh immenſe ſums to ſupport the extravagance of herſelf and huſband 'till unable any longer to keep them from ruin, he gave up all but about one hundred pounds a year, with which he retired into the country, and ended his days in what he called <hi>peaceful obſcurity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to the laſt his prayers were offered at the throne of grace for his ungrateful child—but alas!

Celia, by her own conduct counteracted the effects of thoſe pious prayers. Neglected, nay deſpiſed, by her huſband, ſhe launched into every ſpecies of diſſipation, and was in a few years reduced to a ſtate of abſolute penury, where remorſe is not the leaſt painful of her many heavy afflictions, all which ſhe has brought on herſelf by an illiberal obſtinate conduct; for had ſhe rightly conſidered the virtues and amiable deportment of Mrs. Markham, ſhe might have contributed to the felicity of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and, in the end, ultimately inſured her own.</p>

                     <head>LETTER VIII. FROM THE SAME TO THE SAME.</head>
                     <p>I HAVE taken up my pen, without farther preface to proceed on my promiſed ſtory, and ſhall leave my dear Miſs Winworths to apply the moral themſelves; ſenſible that they do not went ſenſe to diſcover right from wrong, and ſincerely hoping they will not let folly, vanity, or illiberal prejudices miſlead their judgment.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Oſborne was left a widower at a very early age, with only one daughter, named Serena, who, when ſhe had the miſfortune to loſe her mother, was ſcarcely three years old. She inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by the death of her mother, a genteel inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and was reputed heireſs to her father's fortune, which was not inconſiderable.</p>
                     <p>Not long after this melancholy event Mr. Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore, being on a viſit to a friend in the country, became acquainted with Miſs Withers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="unknown:027654_0170_0FD568FAD1550300"/>
She was, it muſt be confeſſed, beautiful in the extreme, but that acknowledged, and there was not another favorable circumſtance to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in her behalf. She was the daughter of a man who enjoyed in a country town, a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and lucrative poſt under government; his wife had brought him four or five thouſand pounds, which had been accumulated by her father, who regarded not the cries of the fatherleſs, or the tears of the widow.</p>
                     <p>This woman's education had been ſuch as might be expected for the child of a poor petty-fogging lawyer, who by dint of chicanery and dirty em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, was ſcraping a little ſordid droſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and thought by leaving her a fortune, he left her every neceſſary recommendation to ſecure her advancement in life; the conſequence was, that to the moſt illiberal contracted ideas and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate ignorance, ſhe added the pride and ſelf conceit of a firſt-rate woman of faſhion; ſhe was extravagantly fond of dreſs, parade, and ſhow; but had no idea of any difference being neceſſary between the education of a gentlewoman, and that of a tradeſman's or farmer's daughter.</p>
                     <p>Brought up under ſuch a mother, with ſuch confined notions, Miſs Withers had been táught to believe that the good houſewife and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:027654_0171_0FD568FC92B97CD0"/>
woman, were one and the ſame thing. She perfectly underſtood the art of cookery, pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling preſerving, and all the long &amp;c's. neceſſary to form a complete houſe-keeper.</p>
                     <p>She could work tent-ſtitch, tambour, and croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitch, make all her father's, and indeed, all the family linen, knew the cheapeſt ways of going to market, how to ſcold and keep her ſervants in order; in ſhort, had been brought up as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete <hi>Mrs. Notable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to the fine arts ſhe was a perfect ſtranger. Muſic, dancing, or drawing, had no charms for her, nor had ſhe the leaſt idea of the pleaſures reſulting from a well informed, elegantly culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated mind. Haughty, yet mean; ignorant, yet obſtinate in her opinion, however abſurd, and deaf to the voice of conviction.</p>
                     <p>She had been educated in the ſtricteſt principles of methodiſm, yet was ſhe of no fixed religion, having been wearied in her youth by being too rigidly obliged to conform to her parents man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; ſhe contracted a diſlike to her religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and at the time Mr. Oſborne firſt ſaw her, was of no particular ſect whatever.</p>
                     <p>She had, by the death of her mother, who had
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:027654_0172_0FD568FE09686AB0"/>
been extremely anxious to make her dear Jemima a fortune, juſt come to the poſſeſſion of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, and was ſo inſinuating in her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that ſhe was univerſally well received in all companies, and called one of the beſt kind of girls in the world.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Oſborne was captivated with her lovely perſon and ſpecious manners, and having made propoſals to her guardians, was accepted, and the lady, in due time, became Mrs. Oſborne.</p>
                     <p>She had from the firſt of her acquaintance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a violent attachment to the little Serena, I ſay pretended, becauſe I have been ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſhe regarded her with an eye of envy and ill-nature from the moment ſhe became her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law.</p>
                     <p>In about twelve months Mrs. Oſborne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her huſband with a little girl, and ſolemnly declared, at the time of her birth, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for her to love any child better than ſhe did Serena; and that it ſhould be her chief ſtudy to make no difference between the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                     <p>This was a declaration I, who was preſent, was by no means pleaſed with, as I knew it was
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:027654_0173_0FD569030D785188"/>
not in nature for a woman to love another child ſo well as her own offſpring—and though a ſtrong ſenſe of duty, and a naturally compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate heart, might lead a woman to treat with the utmoſt tenderneſs, a girl, deprived of her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parent, and thrown, as it were, on her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; yet it was impoſſible but inclination muſt lead her to give the preference to her own child.</p>
                     <p>As Serena and Jemima (the name of her little half-ſiſter) grew up, light and ſhade could not be more oppoſite than their diſpoſitions. Serena was ſenſible, volatile, and chearful, of a bright genius, fond of the purſuit of knowledge, yet meek, mild and innocent as it was poſſible for a human being to be.</p>
                     <p>Jemima was ſullen, proud, obſtinate, and ſo ſtupid, that it was not in the power of any maſters whatever to cultivate a mind rendered impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable by nature.</p>
                     <p>The excellencies which diſcovered themſelves in the mind and diſpoſition of Serena were ſo many faults in the eyes of Mrs. Oſborne, nor did ſhe fail to aggravate every error to which her vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latility, or thoughtleſs innocence might betray her, into crimes, ſo that by degrees her father's affection
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:027654_0174_0FD569072A7C8A88"/>
became alienated from her, and it was almoſt impoſſible for the poor girl to ſpeak, move, or look ſo as not to give offence. As ſhe advanced towards womanhood, her troubles increaſed—her high ſenſe of her religious duties was termed hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy—her ſtrong ſenſibility, art; and her fine taſte, and brilliant genius, follies, which would in the end lead her to ruin.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe had attained the age of ſixteen, the bequeſt of a large fortune obliged her father to viſit Jamaica; he reſolved to take his family with him, and had not been there long before Mrs. Oſborne was ſeized with one of thoſe fevers inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the climate.</p>
                     <p>Tenderly and with the utmoſt care did Serena watch over her for many months when the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had left her in a weak emaciated ſtate, did ſhe never quit her bed-ſide, adminiſtering every medicine, nor ever taking reſt except what ſhe procured at intervals on a matraſs in the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. And what was the return ſhe received? Pettiſhneſs diſcontent, and repining. Frequently did Mrs. Oſborne aſk, if ſhe was brought to that ſtrange place to be murdered—if it was intended ſhe ſhould be poiſoned—and whether Serena did not know that the doctor deſigned to kill her; and theſe expreſſions were not the effect of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:027654_0175_0FD569040CA6CCD0"/>
but ſpoken with a coolneſs and aſperity that tore the heart of the mild affectionate girl to whom they were addreſſed.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Oſborne at length recovered, when it pleaſed heaven to take her huſband from her, and ſhe was left involved in a diſagreeable law ſuit, which was finally terminated to her diſadvantage, ſhe was caſt with coſts of ſuit, and returned to England with little more than five hundred pounds remaining.</p>
                     <p>Now it was that Serena ſhewed herſelf to be the amiable girl I had ever thought her.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe received her fortune, ſhe ſettled an handſome annuity on Mrs. Oſborne, and divided the reſidue between Jemima and herſelf; though at her father's death ſhe had been, by their arts, deprived of any advantage from his fortune, the whole being by will left to Mrs. Oſborne and her daughter, but providence had ordained that they were not to enjoy it.</p>
                     <p>To the laſt hour that ſhe remained with her mother-in-law, ſhe ſtudied her happineſs only, though I have been informed it was ſeldom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that ſhe received even the ſmalleſt token of approbation. Her ſociety was circumſcribed, her
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:027654_0176_0FD569058B4BCCC8"/>
amuſements abridged, her moſt innocent actions cenſured, and the gaiety of her heart conſtrued into levity, and reprimanded at vice; nay, after the alteration in their circumſtances, ſhe was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to perform the moſt menial offices: in ſhort, my dear girls, her education had been confined, her genius cramped, and had ſhe not been a girl of an uncommon good heart, her diſpoſition muſt have been totally perverted by the conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint ſhe lived under and the ſeverity with which ſhe was treated; while Jemima was indulged in idleneſs, her fault gloſſed over, and her perverſe haughty diſpoſition called laudable pride. Yet did I never hear that Serena ever uſed an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming expreſſion to her mother, or made any complaint of unkindneſs.</p>
                     <p>She has been now for ſome years married to a deſerving man, and ſtill continues to treat Mrs. Oſborne with the higheſt reſpect, and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with affection, though the ingratitude of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mima often appears, by her unkind neglect of a ſiſter who ſacrificed her own intereſt to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and happineſs of her mother.</p>
                     <p>Serena, though happy in her matrimonial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, is not in affluent circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>Jemima is lately married to a man of large for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and removed to a diſtant part of England,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:027654_0177_0FD5690A40169540"/>
where, ſhe can ſeldom find time to write to her ſiſter, and when ſhe does ſo far condeſcend, it is with ſuch apparent careleſſneſs, coldneſs, and diſtance, that the warm heart of Serena is chilled by the peruſal of her letters; yet will I venture to affirm Serena the happier woman of the two.</p>
                     <p>I happened to mention one day the unmerited treatment ſhe had received, not only from them, but from her other relations; and mark, my dear girls, the anſwer I received.</p>
                     <p>"Were I to ſay their unkindneſs did not give me pain, I ſhould be guilty of falſehood, becauſe I have that warm affection in my heart, which expands it with brotherly love towards all my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures, and never yet breathed a wiſh to the diſadvantage of a ſingle individual. I mourn their afflictions, and rejoice in their proſperity. I am therefore, conſcious of not deſerving their unkindneſs, and wrapt in the integrity of my own heart, from my ſoul pity the boſom that can har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour malice or ill will towards any one."</p>
                     <p>Thus, my dear Miſs Winworths, you ſee how much our own happineſs depends on our ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly cultivating ſuch philanthropy of temper as may lead us to regard ourſelves but as ſecondary
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:027654_0178_0FD5690CAC49E018"/>
objects; the felicity we promote for others will return with double force to our own boſoms, and conſcious of having always regarded our fellow creatures as ourſelves, we can look up with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to that good providence who will never forſake the children of obedience.</p>

                     <p>N. B. Soon after this laſt letter Lord Winworth was married to Mrs. Clairville, and the young ladies conducting themſelves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the advice of their amiable friend, Mentoria, found in the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made Lady Winworth, every engaging quality that could be deſired, to form the polite agreeable companion, the affectionate parent, and ſincere friend. The correſpondence between Mentoria and her pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils was continued for many years, but as the publication of the whole would render this work too extenſive, beſides occaſion unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary repetitions.

                     <head>LETTER IX. MENTORIA TO MISS G. WINWORTH.</head>
                     <p>I ADDRESS myſelf ſingly to you, my dear Gertrude, becauſe the delicacy of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation demands my ſerious attention, and calls up all my tenderneſs.</p>
                     <p>I am inexpreſſibly pleaſed to find you have made choice of ſo worthy a man as Sir Arthur Fitzgerald, and that your father approves the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your ſelection</p>
                     <p>I think you have acted like a woman of ſenſe and prudence, and I make no doubt but you will preſerve the ſame propriety of conduct when a wife, as has evidently characteriſed you while ſingle.</p>
                     <p>I admire that real delicacy which impelled you to give an immediate diſmiſſion to all thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders who ſolicited your hand without being able to influence your heart in their favor. There
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:027654_0180_0FD5690F68E24730"/>
cannot be a more deſpicable paſſion than that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable thirſt for admiration, which leads a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to encourage indiſcriminately the forward advances of every coxcomb, who ſhall pay them the incenſe of flattery, and be continually ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lures to attract adulation, however in their hearts they may deſpiſe the perſon who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it.</p>
                     <p>I am ſenſible, my dear Gertrude will pardon me, if anxious for her future happineſs, I venture to give her my advice and opinion for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her felicity in the married ſtate; it has often been remarked, that a heart is much eaſier gained than kept, and, believe me, it is a very judicious obſervation.</p>
                     <p>There requires more care, attention, and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude, from the wife to the huſband, than from the miſtreſs to her adoring lover. The lover be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ſeldom with you, ſees you only in part, it is natural to ſuppoſe you would neither appear before him in a ſlatternly dreſs, or with a peeviſh aſpect. Your clothes will be always put on with neatneſs, and your face dreſſed in ſmiles. On the contrary, the huſband being always in your company, has an opportunity of diſcovering every little defect or blemiſh in your perſon, manners, or diſpoſition, and the chief ſtudy of a wife ſhould
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:027654_0181_0FD56910C9779968"/>
be to guard againſt every thing that might create diſtaſte, or excite diſguſt.</p>
                     <p>And in the firſt place let me recommend a moſt ſcrupulous regard to delicacy and neatneſs.</p>
                     <p>Many young women fooliſhly imagine, as ſoon as they are married, they have a right to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and laugh at an indelicate alluſion, but from this fault, the native purity of your mind will, I am certain, preſerve you, ſince nothing but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ignorance or levity could lead any woman to liſten with apparent pleaſure, to an improper tale, or ill timed jeſt.</p>
                     <p>There are too many men, nay, even among thoſe who call themſelves gentlemen, who will not ſcruple to ſhock a woman's ears with conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of this kind; but the look of marked diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and ſilent contempt, will never fail to ſilence them, unleſs they are either brutes or fools, and to ſuch there is no fear of your being expoſed.</p>
                     <p>The next thing is neatneſs in your perſon and dreſs and an equanimity of temper to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved towards your huſband, and your ſervants;—nothing degrades a gentlewoman more than her ſuffering her temper to be ſo far ruffled as to uſe improper language to her dependants, nor can
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:027654_0182_0FD56914CA6B6F48"/>
any thing be more diſguſting to a man of ſenſe than to ſee his wife give way to ſudden ſtarts of paſſion.</p>
                     <p>To every relation and friend of your huſband, ſhew a polite attention and marked preference; ſhew him, that to be related to, or eſteemed by him, is a ſufficient claim upon your regard—whatever be his errors, confine the knowledge of them to your own boſom, and endeavour, by the mideſt perſuaſions, to lead him to the path of rectitude. Diſcretion muſt direct you as to the proper ſeaſon to offer your advice and opinions, ſince men in general are ſo tenacious of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, that they ſtart from every thing that has the leaſt appearance of controul or oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Never atttempt to reſtrain his pleaſures; if he ſhould be fond of company, diſſipation and expenſive amuſements, be it your ſtudy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach his mind from thoſe purſuits, by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to render his home delightful, let your face be ever arrayed in ſmiles at his approach, form a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of thoſe he loves and eſteems moſt, exert your various abilities to charm and entertain him, and believe me, he who conſtantly meets chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and ſmiles at home, will ſeldom wiſh to ſeek abroad for pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Above all things never ſuffer any perſon to ſpeak diſreſpectfully of him in your preſence, and
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:027654_0183_0FD569168CB50958"/>
guard your heart from the leaſt approach of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy; ſhould there even be occaſion for ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, be careful not to let him ſee you have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his diſhonorable conduct, and never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any one, more eſpecially a <hi>man,</hi> to hear you complain.</p>
                     <p>Avoid reproaches, they in general increaſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than alleviate the diſtreſs; if patient ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the mild remonſtrance of an afflicted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complaining ſpirit, will not work a reformation, reproach and diſcontent will have no effect.</p>
                     <p>You muſt not be above attending to his intereſt ſo far as may lead you to inſpect the expences of your family; have ſtated and regular times for examining your houſe-keeper's accounts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatiſfied that your trades-people are regularly paid, and do not let trifles put you aſide from this very neceſſary point.</p>
                     <p>Let your own expences be regulated by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence void of parſimony, and ſuffer not a paſſion for finery, and a wiſh to eclipſe your acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, prompt you to overſtep your income, or deprive you of the inexpreſſible pleaſure of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving indigent merit.</p>
                     <p>Though I would not have you ſacrifice too largely at the ſhrine of that idol, faſhion, I would
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:027654_0184_0FD5691793ADEEF0"/>
have you follow her ſo far as may make your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance alway deſerve the appellation of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly neat; nor muſt you confine this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance only to your going abroad or receiving com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at home; though you were to be in the country for months, and ſee none but your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and ſervants, never neglect the real neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duties of the toilet, it is a reſpect due to him, it ſhews a wiſh to appear agreeable in his eyes, and that you prefer his approbation to that of all the world beſide.</p>
                     <p>There is one more circumſtance I muſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, although a thorough knowledge of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition renders it almoſt unneceſſary; yet I have ſeen ſo many couples made inexpreſſibly miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by it, that I cannot reſiſt my inclination to warn you of ſo dangerous a conduct.</p>
                     <p>Never permit any man, however clothed with the maſk of friendſhip, to treat you with fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity. There are many freedoms, which to a girl may be perfectly innocent, and yet become almoſt crimes when offered to, or received by a married woman.</p>
                     <p>A married woman ſhould never ſuffer a man to entertain her in a ſtrain of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>antry, a preſſure of the hand is an affront, and an attempt at a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute (except where the nearneſs of the relation
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:027654_0185_0FD5691919616BD8"/>
authoriſes ſuch a liberty) is, and ſhould be reſented as an inſult.</p>
                     <p>There is a decent gravity of manner that will at once excite admiration and reſpect, and yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all improper familiarity, nor can any thing be more ridiculous, than to ſee the miſtreſs of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, perhaps the mother of four or five children, affecting a giddy flirting carriage, that would be hardly excuſable in a girl of ſixteen—it may, in ſome inſtances, proceed from an innocent gaiety of heart, but it hardly ever fails of degenerating into levity and imprudence, always lays a woman open to inſult, of which ſhe cannot complain, becauſe ſhe evidently invited it; and too often ends in the total loſs of honor, happineſs, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Be chearful, condeſcending, and polite to all, but let there ever be that dignity in your manner which may keep <hi>impertinent fools,</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning villains</hi> at a proper diſtance.</p>
                     <p>Pardon the length of this epiſtle, and believe it proceeds from a friend who loves you. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me affectionately to your dear ſiſters.—Adieu, may every bleſſing be your portion here and hereafter.</p>

                     <head>LETTER X. MENTORIA TO LADY FITZGERALD.</head>
                     <p>THE news that you were ſafe in bed, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a daughter, my dear Gertrude, will, believe me, give as much ſatiſfaction to my heart, as any ſublunary pleaſure poſſibly can; and, weak as I am, tottering as it were on the very brink of a vaſt eternity, I cannot reſiſt the deſire I feel, of once more writing to my beloved pupils, for in addreſſing Lady Fitzgerald, I ſuppoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo writing to her ſiſters.</p>
                     <p>But firſt a few words to yourſelf, in regard to this dear, this precious little charge, with which it has pleaſed heaven to entruſt you. May it ever be impreſſed on your mind that the future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or miſery of this child depends greatly on the treatment ſhe receives during her puerile years.</p>
                     <p>Let not a too great fondneſs prompt you, by extreme indulgence, to enervate the faculties of
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:027654_0187_0FD5691CF0C248D8"/>
her ſoul, or pervert her diſpoſition, and by ſo doing render her totally unfit to bear the many inconveniences and croſſes ſhe muſt neceſſarily meet with in her paſſage through life.</p>
                     <p>And on the contrary, do not, by an ill-judged ſeverity, drive her to mean ſubterfuges, falſhoods and deceit, through fear of your anger.—Many an amiable girl has been totally ruined by ſuch treatment; it leads them to fear but not love their parents, it prompts them to make companions of their ſervants, and often ends in the entire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of their principles.</p>
                     <p>Teach her to fear to diſoblige you, but let it be through fear of loſing your affection, not from the apprehenſion of puniſhment. Do not be too anxious to have your child praiſed for an early progreſs in her education; a young mind ſhould not be loaded, it ſpoils the memory, and often occaſions a diſlike to ſtudy in more advanced life, beſides, children accuſtomed to hear themſelves commended are apt to think themſelves ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wife and accompliſhed before their education is well begun.</p>
                     <p>Do not encourage her in a love of finery, or ſuffer her to be told ſhe is handſome, they will both be very pernicious to her future tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="unknown:027654_0188_0FD5691E5FAFDCB8"/>
There is one thing which parents are very apt, not only to do themſelves, but to ſuffer their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to do the ſame; that is, when any little maſter viſits at the houſe nearly of miſs's age, ſhe is told that he is her little huſband, and that ſhe muſt hold up her head and behave like a woman, or ſhe will never be married,</p>
                     <p>Thus is the idea of love and lovers introduced into ther little hearts, before they are capable of underſtanding what the word means.</p>
                     <p>This is, to me, the moſt fooliſh conduct in the world, and nothing would offend me ſo ſoon, as having ſuch ridiculous things ſaid to any child in whoſe education and future proſpects I was any ways concerned. Teach them the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween right and wrong, and convince their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by pointing out the real way to promote their own happineſs, and merit the regard and eſteem of their friends.</p>
                     <p>Do not introduce your girl too early into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, it will give her a taſte for diſſipation: in proper time let her partake in moderation of all the amuſements of the metropolis, ſo as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the bad effects of curioſity ungratified; but at the ſame time accuſtom her to find reſources within herſelf, that may, at all times, enable her to baniſh that monſter <hi>Ennui.</hi>

Truſt not the cultivation of her mental fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, or the forming of her moral character, to any one but yourſelf; and as ſhe advances towards womanhood make her your friend and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: let the diſtance between mother and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be forgot, and by treating her with a degree of confidence that flatters her ſelf-conſequence, encourage her to make your boſom the repoſitory of all her ſecrets, and be ready to apply to your better jugment to direct all her actions.</p>
                     <p>I am certain there would not be half the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies committed by girls in general, if they were not kept at ſuch an awful diſtance by their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that fearing either ridicule or reproof, they dare not entruſt them with their little plans and diſappointments, and relying either on the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſome one as inexperienced as themſelves, or to the ſuggeſtions of their own ſimple hearts, they involve themſelves in troubles, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger their peace of mind and ruin their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſo it will ever be while mothers forget they have ever been girls themſelves, and make no allowance for the volatility of youth, and the innocent impulſes of a heart unburthened by the cares of the world.</p>
                     <p>I have written much more than I intended, but the ſubject intereſted me, and there is yet another which dwells ſtill nearer my heart, that is, my
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:027654_0190_0FD5692480C29868"/>
beloved Gertrude, the neceſſity there is of giving your child a proper ſenſe of the high advantages of early piety, but this muſt not be done by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to ſay long prayers, of which ſhe cannot comprehend the meaning, or by making her read books of dull theology.</p>
                     <p>It is example, my dear friend, muſt teach her the true principles of the Chriſtian Religion; let her ſee you in the act of devotion, let her curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be awakened, and then, as you anſwer her queſtions lead her by degrees to love, worſhip and adore the Almighty giver of all good; convince her of her dependence on his bounty for food, raiment, and all the bleſſings of life; teach her to place her whole confidence in his mercy, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive even the ſmalleſt bleſſing with gratitude, and to bow under the heavieſt affliction with patience and humility.</p>
                     <p>But above all things, mind that your example does not contradict you precept. What confidence can a child place in the religion of its parent, when the parent lives in direct oppoſition to the principles of that religion.</p>
                     <p>Oh! my dear friend, this is the one thing needful! this the heavenly comforter, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports us through life, and will cheer us in the hour of death!</p>

Our duty is plainly marked and ſo eaſy, that when we do not perform it, we take more pains to court miſery, than would ſuffice to make us truly happy. What can be more eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended even by the meaneſt underſtanding. <hi>"Do juſtly, love mercy, and walk humbly."</hi>

                  <p>But in the preſent refined age, if an induſtrious tradeſman can afford to give his daughter, five hundred pounds, it is immediately ſettled by Mamma, that Miſs muſt be <hi>genteelly</hi> educated</p>
                  <p>Accordingly ſhe is at an early age ſent to a boar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-ſchool, where ſhe learns to jabber bad French, and worſe Engliſh; the old-faſhion ſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler, and uſeful plain-work are neglected, and ſhe is inſtructed how to work fillagree, make
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:027654_0193_0FD5692B3A6DF648"/>
wafer work, daub ſattin, and work ill proportioned figures in cloth, which in due time are curiouſly mounted, and hung round to ornament the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the fond but ill judging parents.</p>
                  <p>Add to theſe accompliſhments the very faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able one of jingling the keys of the harpſichord, with great velocity, though perhaps out of time and out of tune.</p>
                  <p>Imagine Miſs juſt returned, at the age of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, her mind puffed up with vanity, and her head well ſtored with ſenſibility, and all the delicate feelings to be gleaned from a circulating library, the contents of which ſhe has eagerly and indiſcriminately peruſed, without any one taking the pains to direct her judgment or correct her taſte.</p>
                  <p>We will ſuppoſe her lovely in her perſon, and attractive in her manners, ſhe comes home, and is idolized by her too partial mother, and ſpoken of by her father with pride and exultation; but alas! ſhe is too fine a lady to pay any attention to the domeſtic concerns of the family.</p>
                  <p>In this fooliſh idea ſhe is indulged by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who thinks her dear girl's beauty, ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and accompliſhments, will undoubtedly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her a match far ſuperior to her preſent ſtation,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:027654_0194_0FD5692DAE4E3B98"/>
and ſhe will have no occaſion to be a good houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife.</p>
                  <p>But theſe ſanguine wiſhes are ſeldom if ever realized, and we will ſuppoſe her married to a man who is juſt entered into a genteel and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving line of buſineſs; her friends think it a good match, her fortune is an acquiſition to her huſband and they enter the career of life with all the hopes of permanent happineſs which peace plenty can inſpire.</p>
                  <p>But what a wretched figure does this elegant accompliſhed girl make, as miſtreſs of a family; her ſervants cheat and laugh at her, her acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance blame her, and perhaps ſhe may incur even the cenſure of her huſband, for paying no more attention to matters which ſo nearly concern his intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Has ſhe children, ſhe knows not how to make or mend their clothes, ſhe is always ſurrounded with difficulties, from which ſhe knows not how to extricate herſelf, and aſhamed to confeſs her ignorance to any one who could inſtruct her in the point ſhe requires, ſhe becomes peeviſh and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiſfied, neglects even thoſe accompliſhments which ſhe formerly ſtrove ſo hard to attain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes negligent in her dreſs, careleſs in her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſinks into a very blank in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="unknown:027654_0195_0FD5244A371BA698"/>
Her huſband diſappointed in not ſeeing that order and regularity at home which he had once fondly hoped, no longer finds any charms in her ſociety, and ſeeks to forget his diſappointment either in the bottle, or at the gaming table, both equally deſtructive; and ſhe fees inevitable ruin approaching, without the ſmalleſt power to ward off the blow.</p>
                  <p>Nor can the whole univerſe preſent us with an object more truly deſerving our pity, than ſuch a woman in a ſtate of penury! She is at a loſs how to perform even the neceſſary duties of life, ſhe cannot exert herſelf to obtain even a ſingle meal for herſelf or children; ſhe pines in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, regretting her uſeleſs education, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that the ſums ſo expended, had been laid by to encreaſe her fortune, and ſhe herſelf had been only inſtructed in thoſe things, which would have tended ultimately to render her a uſeful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable member of ſociety.</p>
                  <p>But how widely different is the lot of the happy girl, whoſe parents have, not only by precept but example, implanted in her mind the great neceſſity of rendering herſelf uſeful, before ſhe can be eſteemed valuable—who perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands how to manage her family, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late her ſervants—who to affability and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and induſtry, oeconomy and piety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="unknown:027654_0196_0FD5693050208E28"/>
Such a woman when ſhe marries, however ſmall her fortune, brings to her huſband an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible fund of treaſure. She is not aſhamed to inveſtigate even the minuteſt concerns of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; her expences are regulated by the ſtricteſt rules of frugality void of parſimony, with one hand ſhe ſecures her huſband's intereſt, and with the other diſpenſes to the ſons and daughters of poverty, the overplus of thoſe bleſſings which her own prudence has helped to ſecure to herſelf.</p>
                  <p>She is always ſtrictly neat in her apparel, but entirely free from ſhew or finery; her whole family is regular, uniform and decent, her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants reſpect her, her huſband idolizes her, and her children look up to her as their friend and benefactreſs, from whoſe bright example they may learn the road to happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Should even miſfortune overtake her, ſhe is ſtill chearful, ſtill unembarraſſed, without a murmur ſhe condeſcends to perform even the meaneſt offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for herſelf, her huſband, and children; ſhe exerts her utmoſt abilities to retrieve the proſperity they had unfortunately loſt, ſhe ſhares her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands care, and alleviates his concern—and ſhould their honeſt efforts to regain their former ſtate of affluence fail, ſhe ſets down perfectly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the reflection that ſhe had diſcharged, to
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:027654_0197_0FD56931EB928A80"/>
the utmoſt of her power, the duties of that ſtation, in which it pleaſed Heaven to place her.</p>
                  <p>Yet, think not I mean entirely to ſet aſide thoſe accompliſhments, which when kept under proper regulations, certainly tend to make the female character more irreſiſtibly charming.</p>
                  <p>There are a certain claſs of women to whom theſe accompliſhments are abſolutely neceſſary, to their filling their reſpective characters with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.</p>
                  <p>A woman of independent fortune may with ſafety indulge her taſte for muſic, drawing, &amp;c. but, in the name of common ſenſe, what has a girl to do with the fine arts, who, perhaps, after ſhe leaves ſchool, has neither time or opportunity to purſue thoſe ſtudies, unleſs by ſo doing, ſhe neglects ſome more uſeful employment.</p>
                  <p>I acknowledge that it is not impoſſible for the uſeful and ornamental branches of education to be combined; nay, that it is even natural for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of ſenſe and diſcretion to endeavour to blend them in ſuch a manner, as to render them only as ſoils to each other, and the woman who ſtudies to unite in herſelf, the attentive houſewife, the good mother, affectionate wife, well-informed companion, and accompliſhed woman, is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:027654_0198_0FD5693445558638"/>
a character deſerving eſteem and veneration, we look upon her almoſt as a being of a ſuperior order, and ſhe is at once beloved, admired and reſpected by both ſexes.</p>
                  <p>As ſo much of the happineſs of mankind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the females connected in their families, I have expatiated on the neceſſity of young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being brought up in the practice of every domeſtic virtue, more largely than I at firſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſince not only the riſing generation, but ages yet unborn ſhall venerate or execrate our memories, according to the advice and example we give our children.</p>
                  <p>If the daughters of the preſent age are ſuffered to remain totally ignorant of the domeſtic regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neceſſary to be obſerved in every family, what are we to expect in the next generation, but that the ruin which has already begun to ſhew itſelf in our moſt capital cities, will ſpread itſelf all over the kingdom, and ſink it at laſt in one univerſal ſtate of bankruptcy.</p>
                  <p>More, much more than we ſhould at firſt be led to imagine, depends on the education of the female world. What ruin, what inevitable deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation may not an idle diſſipated woman bring on thoſe who may unfortunately be attached to her perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="unknown:027654_0199_0FD56935C0029428"/>
And on the contrary, how does a ſenſible, virtuous, well-informed female, exalt and ennoble the thoughts of all who converſe with her.</p>
                  <p>Were every parent of my opinion they would firſt, by example, plant the ſeeds of genuine worth in the breaſt of their daughters, and by the tendereſt care and mildeſt precept, cultivate each budding virtue, 'till they bloſſomed in full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, then ornamenting them with the elegant accompliſhments neceſſary to complete the female character, render them at once the pride and glory of their country.</p>

                  <head>URGANDA AND FATIMA, AN EASTERN TALE.</head>
                  <p>IN one of the moſt beautiful vallies that lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the borders of the Eaſt lived Zegdad, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive ſhepherd. He had but one child, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been early deprived of his wife, he laviſhed his whole ſtock of tenderneſs of Fatima.</p>
                  <p>Though fortune had not been laviſh of her gifts to the father of Fatima, yet he wanted not the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries or comforts of life—his cottage was clean, and furniſhed with every thing uſeful; his fields ſupplied them with food; his flock with raiment.</p>
                  <p>Fatima was coarſe in her perſon, but ſhe was chearfull and good-natured—ſhe roſe each morn with the feathered ſongſters, and chearfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the duties of her ſtation; her whole ſtudy was to pleaſe her father, and a ſmile from Zeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad was at any time, ample recompence for the ſevereſt fatigue, and like a cordial ſerved to revive her drooping ſpirits. She would aſſiſt, unaſked, in the moſt laborious employments, and when the labour of the day was paſt, ſhe would lightly
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:027654_0201_0FD569395BCCA748"/>
trip over the green turf, with her young compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, while her father played on the flagelet. The mind of Fatima was calm as the delights of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</p>
                  <p>One day her father ſent her to the grand Vizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's, with fruit for his favorite—ſhe was conducted by an eunuch into the garden, where the beautiful Semira was repoſing on a bed of roſes, clad in all the pomp of eaſtern magnificence, while two ſlaves were fanning her to reſt.</p>
                  <p>Fatima had never before ſeen aught but ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city—ſhe was filled with wonder and aſtoniſhment at the ſurpriſing beauty and grandeur of Semira, and as ſhe gazed, envy and diſcontent crept into her hitherto guileleſs heart.</p>
                  <p>She returned home with a mind totally altered to what it was. Her rural paſtimes no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligted her—labour was now a trouble—ſhe had been a witneſs to the eaſe and indolence of Semira. If at any time ſhe caught a glimpſe of her perſon in the ſtream, ſhe turned from it with diſguſt. Her days were joyleſs, and her nights ſpent in bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her unhappy lot.</p>
                  <p>One evening, deaf to the ſolicitations of her young companions, ſhe retired to a thick grove,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:027654_0202_0FD5693AC8C992A0"/>
and inattentive to the ſound of the flagelet, thus gave vent to her ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Oh! wretched Fatima, unhappy maid! Why was I born to know ſo hard a fate—to eat the bread of labour, to ſleep upon a ruſhy couch, while Semira is ſurrounded with ſplendor, is ſerved by kneeling ſlaves, and ſleeps on a bed of down! Why has nature denied me thoſe raviſhing beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it has ſo bountifully laviſhed on her, her eyes are bright as the ſtars, her lips like half blown roſes, her hand and arm like poliſhed ivory. Oh! why was I not lovely as Semira, and favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to the grand Vizier—in this low abject ſtate my being is intolerable, I will no longer endure it but in but in yon limpid ſtream loſe the remembrance of myſelf and Semira.</p>
                  <p>At this moment the Fairy Urganda ſtood before her.</p>
                  <p>"Thy complaints are juſt, Oh! Fatima (ſaid ſhe) and if thou wilt relinquiſh thy home, and forſake thy father, thou ſhalt enjoy the utmoſt extent of thy wiſhes."</p>
                  <p>Fatima eagerly complied with the offered terms and the Fairy immediately ſprinkled her with wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at the ſame time pronouncing ſome myſtic words,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:027654_0203_0FD5693DCB584048"/>
when ſhe was transformed into a virgin of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent beauty, and found herſelf in the garden of a palace belonging to the grand Vizier.</p>
                  <p>The lovely Semira had the day before offended her Lord, and was no longer a favorite. Fatima attracted the notice of the Vizier—he ordered her to be led into ſplendid apartments, clothed with coſtly robes, adorned with jewels, and appointed ſlaves to wait on her, and comply with all-her wiſhes—and Fatima ſupplied the place of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded Semira.</p>
                  <p>She now thought herſelf the happieſt among the happy; but the Vizier was paſſionate, capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, jealous, and extremely cruel, and it was not long before the diſappointed Fatima diſcovered that to be favorite to the grand Vizier, was to live only in ſplendid ſlavery.</p>
                  <p>"But though (ſaid ſhe often to herſelf) though the grand Vizier's favorite is miſerable, how ſuperlatively happy muſt be the favorite Sultana of my Lord the Emperor! Oh! could I but attain that envied ſtation, how ſoon ſhould the imperious Vizier ſuffer for his barbarity to me."</p>
                  <p>Again did the boſom of Fatima ſuffer all the miſeries of diſcontent—the vaulted roofs, ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gardens, and rich preſents of the Vizier, no
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:027654_0204_0FD5693F5285F568"/>
longer charmed her. She ſighed for the enſigns of royalty, and her pillow was nightly bedewed with her tears.</p>
                  <p>One evening ſhe retired to an arbour, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the garden, and throwing herſelf on the hanks where ſhe had firſt ſeen Semira, thus poured forth her complaints.</p>
                  <p>"How wretched is the fate of Fatima— condemned to drag a hated being with a man who ſtudies only his own gratification, and expects me to be the ſlave of his caprice and paſſion. Oh! could I but get from this deteſted place, I would fly to my Lord the Emperor, and bow myſelf low in the duſt before him. My charms might captivate his royal heart, and I might reign the Empreſs of the Eaſt."</p>
                  <p>As ſhe ſpoke theſe words, a ſudden light enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the arbour, and the Fairy Urganda again ſtood before her.</p>
                  <p>"Beautiful Fatima, ſaid ſhe, forbear your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, the prophet permits you to enjoy your wiſh, then riſe and follow me."</p>
                  <p>The Fairy led her to the Emperor's palace, and placed her among a number of beautiful ſlaves,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:027654_0205_0FD5694188984588"/>
from among which the Emperor was next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to chuſe a favorite.</p>
                  <p>In the morning the Emperor paſſed through the apartment, and his choice fell on Fatima. She was cloathed in the enſigns of royalty, led in ſtate to the moſque, and in a few hours heard her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf proclaimed Empreſs of the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>But Fatima had, to the idea of royalty, annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ideas of youth and beauty, how ſurpriſed was ſhe then to find the Emperor, old, ugly, and deformed in his perſon, moroſe in his diſpoſition, and jealous in the extreme—ſhe ſhrunk from his embraces with horror, and contracted ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled an averſion to him, that not all the ſplendor that awaited her could in the ſmalleſt degree com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for the many tedious hours ſhe was obliged to devote to him.</p>
                  <p>Among the ſlaves that attended on Fatima, was the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Zynina, who had long, with envious eyes, beheld the love of the Emperor beſtowed on others, and only watched an opportunity to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate herſelf in his favor, by rendering him ſome piece of ſervice. To this end ſhe cultivated the friendſhip of the new Queen, and by degrees drew from her the reaſon of her tears and dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="unknown:027654_0206_0FD5695C8C66DDA0"/>
This intelligence was inſtantly conveyed to the Emperor, with the addition of Fatima's heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dedicated to another. Oſmin willing to be convinced of the truth of Zynina's declaration, deſired to be concealed in an apartment adjoining the Queen's, where he might eaſily overhear any thing that paſſed between her and the deceitful ſlave, who immediately returned to her miſtreſs, and artfully renewed the converſation.</p>
                  <p>Fatima, glad to unburthen her almoſt burſting heart, confeſſed her ſettled averſion to her Lord, and that death itſelf would be preferable to her preſent ſituation. "Then death be thy portion," cried the enraged Emperor, furiouſly ruſhing into the apartment, and lifting his glittering ſcimitar.</p>
                  <p>Fatima fell upon her knees, and, in an agony of terror exclaimed, "O that I was an humble cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tager, and had never known the pangs that wait on greatneſs."</p>
                  <p>At that moment ſhe found herſelf clad in her former homely apparel, ſtanding at the door of her father's cottage, when the Fairy appeared and thus addreſſed her.</p>
                  <p>"Fatima, I have ſhewn you the vanity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wiſhes, learn from hence to be content with the allotments of Providence. Whatever be your ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation

The man who lives only for himſelf, is, in my opinion, a monſter of ingratitude; his life is one continued blank, except marked by ſome act of inhumanity. If we muſt reckon that day loſt in which we perform no good action, what muſt we think of a life paſſed in a continued ſeries of ſtupid inattention to the diſtreſſes or injuries of our fellow creatures.</p>
                  <p>Hail! heaven-born charity! bright reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent virtue; whoſe dazzling rays hide from the accuſing angel multitudes of offences, bleſſed is the heart thou doſt inhabit, happy is the man whoſe actions are guided by thee.</p>
                  <p>By charity I do not mean the merely ſharing with thoſe that need the ſuperabundant gifts of fortune, though 'tis certainly our duty to allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the misfortunes of others, yet by ſo doing we do not fully diſcharge the duties of chriſtianity. Charity is that benevolence of heart, that meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, which leads us to judge favorably of the actions of others, never to propagate a ſtory to the injury of a neighbour's character, but to ſtand forward the champion of innocence, and to defend thoſe, whom envy, malice, or revenge, have aſperſed. Conſcious of its own rectitude, ſuſpects not the integrity of another; ever ready to pour the balm of conſolation into the heart wounded by ſorrow; envies no perſon's ſuperior

                  <p>Yet there are people in the world whoſe chief pleaſure conſiſts in villifying and aſperſing the characters even of their beſt friends, and ſorry I am to ſay, thoſe characters are too frequently found among the fair ſex. Would they but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that while depreſſing the merits of another, they do not increaſe their own, but rather attract notice, and lead their acquaintance narrowly to ſcrutinize the conduct of a woman, who is ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere upon their errors, it would certainly, in ſome meaſure, ſtop the unbounded licence they give their tongues.</p>
                  <p>I do not know a more hateful character than He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiſſa, ſhe has indulged this evil propenſity 'till it has become a part of her nature, and ſhe could no more entertain you for a few hours without a tale of ſcandal than ſhe could walk over the glaſſy ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the ocean.

<pb n="104" facs="unknown:027654_0210_0FD569492126E488"/>
exult in the miſery the occaſions; under the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſemblance of friendſhip, ſhe will ſteal upon the unſuſpecting heart, and after being treated with unbounded confidence, like the ungrateful ſerpent, ſting the breaſt that harbours her!</p>
                  <p>She was, when very young, by the treachery of a near relation, thrown into a diſtreſſing ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from which the bounty and generoſity of a widow lady relieved her; not ſatisfied with merely adminiſtering to her preſent wants, ſhe took her into her family, and made her companion to her daughter.</p>
                  <p>The innocent Anna conceived a ſincere friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for her, and for many years they lived like ſiſters; innumerable were the favours heaped on Hecatiſſa, who remained with the family; till a worthy man, attracted by her perſon and ſpecious manner, made honorable propoſals and married her.</p>
                  <p>Hecatiſſa might now have been the happieſt woman breathing—her huſband was generous, humane, friendly, and good-natured to exceſs. He preſented her to his family, who received her cordially, and the poor eaſy good man thought he had inſured his own felicity, but Hecatiſſa ſoon ſhone forth in her own proper character.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="unknown:027654_0211_0FD5694A8B38D168"/>
She planted diſſention in her huſband's family, aſſumed an unbecoming authority over all his actions, and by her artful aſcendancy contracted his heart, and made him treat with diſreſpect the very family who had ſheltered her unprotected youth! Her vile inſinuations were aimed at the character of Anna, nor was ſhe the only object of her malice; every woman who poſſeſſed ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior endowments of perſon or mind, was to her a fit ſubject for ſlander. She wiſhed no perſon to be more fortunate or happy than herſelf, ſhe liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to every malicious tale with avidity, repeated them with pleaſure, and aggravated every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which had the leaſt appearance of vice or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. She would ſtoop to ſuch meanneſs, that rather than not compaſs a favorite point, ſhe would tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with ſervants, to obtain the ſecrets of a family.</p>
                  <p>She was once on a viſit at the houſe of Serena, ſhe found her beloved by her ſervants, reſpected by her friends, and tenderly eſteemed by her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Vexed to ſee how ſuperior ſhe was in every reſpect to herſelf, ſhe eagerly watched for ſome opportunity to leſſen her merit. She wreſted the moſt innocent and even laudable actions into guilt, ſhe poiſoned the minds of her ſervants, and tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her reputation aſſuming the appearance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and virtue, ſhe endeavoured to throw on Serena the odium of every vice which deformed her own character.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="unknown:027654_0212_0FD5694DAF369BE0"/>
But Serena was not long inveloped in the cloud Hecatiſſa had ſpread over her; ſhe continued in the regular diſcharge of the duties of her ſtation, paid no regard to the malicious ſlanders ſhe daily heard, but, pitying the woman who could ſo far forget truth and juſtice as to blacken the character of one ſhe profeſſed a friendſhip for, treated her with the ſilent contempt her conduct merited.</p>
                  <p>No ſenſible perſon will ſcruple to affirm that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiſſa is miſerable. Hated and deſpiſed by all her acquaintance, her ſociety is ſhunned like the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and though by her conſummate art ſhe ſtill impoſes upon her huſband, and retains his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, her diſcontent and ill-nature prevent her reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any pleaſure in his company; ſhe is jealous, peeviſh and uneaſy; in ſhort ſhe has ſuch a legion of torments in her own boſom, that ſhe often applies to a comforting cordial to raiſe her depreſſed ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>However deſpicable the character of Hecatiſſa may appear that of Prudelia is equally ſo. Prudelia is a woman who pays the niceſt regard to propriety and decorum, ſhe is ever prying into her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's conduct, and if their actions do not exactly agree with her ſcrupulous notions of rectitude, ſhe heſitates not to conclude them abandoned and loſt to every ſenſe of virtue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="unknown:027654_0213_0FD5694F0A7BC6E0"/>
Albert and Julia had been married near four years, during which time they had lived in mutual love and confidence, when their ill-fortune took them to live in the ſame ſtreet with Prudelia. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert followed the ſea, of conſequence Julia was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten left for months together the guardian of her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, the miſtreſs of her own actions. She was lively in her diſpoſition, but her heart was the ſeat of pure innocence.</p>
                  <p>Albert was gone his accuſtomed voyage, when Prudelia undertook to ſcrutinize the conduct of Julia.</p>
                  <p>Prudelia had viſited her, ſhe had been a witneſs to the innocent gaiety of her temper, ſhe had even pretended to admire her vivacity and good-humor, but ſhe whiſpered among her friends, that ſhe thought it was highly improper for a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man like her, whoſe huſband was from home, to receive ſo much company, or be ſo frequent in her viſits abroad. She watched every movement of Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a, was informed of all her viſitors names, knew what time they came and went and even what hours ſhe retired to reſt and aroſe.</p>
                  <p>Julia was a woman of nice feelings, ſhe was tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of honor; and the bare idea of that honor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuſpected was extremely painful to her. She was uneaſy at the watchful eye Prudelia kept upon her
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:027654_0214_0FD5695088866F20"/>
actions, not that ſhe feared to have them ſrcutinized, but becauſe ſhe did not think herſelf obliged to be accountable for her conduct to any perſon but her huſband. She therefore grew diſtant and reſerved, and whenever Prudelia called on her, gave little or no anſwer to her many artful queſtions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning where ſhe had been, or how ſhe had ſpent her time.</p>
                  <p>About this time a brother of Julia's failed in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, he retired to a houſe in the environs of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, to avoid the importunity of his creditors.</p>
                  <p>Julia was tenderly attached to her brother, ſhe exerted every power to ſerve his diſtreſſed family, and even parted with her plate, and ſome other valuables, to raiſe money to ſupply the preſent exigence.</p>
                  <p>The attorney who had the care of ſettling her brother's affairs, was frequently with her for an hour or two together, and often ſhe went away with him in a coach, and was abſent for ſeveral days, as the buſineſs which employed ſo large a ſhare of her time, required ſecreſy, ſhe never mentioned it to Prudelia nor did ſhe when going out ever tell the ſervant where ſhe was to be found.</p>
                  <p>One morning the attorney had breakfaſted with her and ſhe was gone with him to her brother,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:027654_0215_0FD56953A98E6D80"/>
when Albert unexpectedly returned. The ſervant could give no account where her miſtreſs was, and Prudelia who had ſeen him return, came over to invite him to dine with her family.</p>
                  <p>I am ſorry my Julia is from home, ſaid he, but there was no poſſibility of her thinking to ſee me to day, as I am returned at leaſt ſix weeks before the time appointed.</p>
                  <p>Why yes, replied Prudelia, with a ſignificant look, I fancy you will be a very unexpected gueſt.</p>
                  <p>It will be an agreeable ſurprize though, ſaid Albert.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps ſo, ſaid, Prudelia ſmiling, contempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly.</p>
                  <p>The ſmile, the ſignificant look, alarmed Albert, have you any reaſon to think otherways, madam, ſaid he? Surely Julia will be pleaſed with my return.</p>
                  <p>Oh! moſt certainly ſhe will, replied ſhe, ſmiling again; but, no doubt, ſhe would have liked a little more warning of your arrival.</p>
                  <p>By heavens, madam, ſaid Albert, your words diſtreſs me beyond meaſure, you cannot mean to glance an aſperſion at the character of Julia, and
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:027654_0216_0FD56955569090C8"/>
yet what other motive can you have for thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous ſmiles. Tell me, dear madam, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe ambiguous looks; but hold, if it is any thing to Julia's diſadvantage I ſhall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it though uttered by an angel.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, Sir, (ſaid Prudelia, aſſuming a ſerious countenance, in which was blended a mixture of pity and anger) far be it from me to injure the reputation of any woman, or ever interfere between man and wife, you are united for life, and 'tis therefore your duty to bear with each others foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as well as you can.</p>
                  <p>My Julia has no foibles, replied Albert, or it ſhe has I never diſcovered them.</p>
                  <p>I do not pretend to ſay ſhe has, my good friend, but I wiſh ſhe would come home.</p>
                  <p>Albert joined the wiſh, and the day paſſed on without much farther converſation.</p>
                  <p>As the evening advanced he grew uneaſy, and when the clock ſtruck ten, he exclaimed impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, where can ſhe be?</p>
                  <p>Patience, my good Sir, ſaid the artful Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delia, you may not perhaps ſee her theſe two or three hours.</p>
                  <p>Julia was not uſed to keep ſuch late hours, ſaid he penſively.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="unknown:027654_0217_0FD569568D0C7058"/>
Oh! that is nothing, new connections form new manners ſhe is never home much earlier, nay, 'tis very likely ſhe may not be at home to night.</p>
                  <p>You ſeem to be aiming at ſomething, madam, ſaid Albert, for heaven's ſake ſpeak out, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from this torture of ſuſpence.</p>
                  <p>This was the favourable moment for the vile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary—ſhe prefaced her ſcandalous tale, with the ſorrow ſhe felt at being obliged to give his worthy heart ſo much pain, ſaid, had Julia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in any tolerable time, ſhe would have kept the affair to herſelf, but as ſhe found he already began to ſuſpect ſomething was amiſs, ſhe thought it was beſt he ſhould be informed of the whole, that he might take his meaſures accordingly.</p>
                  <p>She then informed him, that during his abſcence Julia's extravagance had known no bounds—that ſhe had paid no regard to her reputation—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the conſtant viſits of one particular gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and made frequent excurſions into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with him, where ſhe ſtaid for ſeveral days, that to ſupply her extravagance and that of her para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, ſhe had parted with her watch, plate, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther valuables, and concluded with ſaying, her heart bled to think ſo worthy a man ſhould be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a woman who knew ſo little how to value her good fortune.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="unknown:027654_0218_0FD56958087A9BC8"/>
Albert liſtened with every mark of horror and aſtoniſhment, at length (ſtarting from his ſeat and ſtamping his foot with vehemence) he cried, 'tis every ſyllable as falſe as hell, my Julia can never have betrayed the honor I truſted to her care, or abuſed the confidence I repoſed in her.</p>
                  <p>'Tis well, Sir, replied Prudelia, with a look of offended pride, you doubt my veracity, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you will find the whole neighbourhood are acquainted with her errors, as well as I am<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay call your own ſervant, ſhe can aſſert the truth of what I ſay.</p>
                  <p>The ſervant was called, ſhe confirmed the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tale, and Albert vowed to be revenged on his innocent wife.</p>
                  <p>Prudelia had judged rightly, Julia did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn that night, and though Albert went home, and retired to his apartment, he never attempted to lye down, but traverſed the room in the utmoſt agitation of ſpirits during the whole night.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time Julia was enjoying, with her brother's family, the moſt exquiſite ſatisfaction. His failure was occaſioned by remittances arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in proper time for him to make good ſome obligations he had entered into, the money Julia had raiſed for him, had prevented immediate
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:027654_0219_0FD5695B8D2B46E0"/>
bankruptcy, and that day ſeveral ſhips had arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with remittances, which would again enable him to appear among his friends with credit.</p>
                  <p>The whole family were together at his lodgings, and a ſmile of tranquillity ſat on every counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.—How very happy I ſhould be, ſaid Julia, looking round her, if my Albert was joined in this loved company, I ſhould then, at one view, behold all that is moſt dear to me on earth.</p>
                  <p>When ſupper was over, the evening was far advanced, Julia propoſed ſtaying with them all night, and walking home in the cool of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>She retired to reſt with a heart lightened of its cares, offered up a prayer for her Albert's ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſunk into an undiſturbed ſlumber, little thinking the miſeries that awaited her in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>At ſix o'clock ſhe aroſe, and kiſſing her little ſleeping niece, who had been her bed-fellow, ſtole ſoftly down ſtairs, and walked leiſurely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards home, enjoying the freſhneſs of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſhe walked thro' the park, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating on the happy change in her brother's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="unknown:027654_0220_0FD5244BDA22B068"/>
It was near eight o'clock when ſhe arrived at her own door. My maſter is come home, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid the maid, as ſhe opened it.</p>
                  <p>Home, cried Julia, in an accent of joyful ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and running eagerly up ſtairs, opened the door of his apartment, and would have thrown herſelf into his arms, but he puſhed her from him with violence, and cried by heavens, this affected joy ſhall not cover your guilt; then looking at her ſternly, he added, how have you paſſed this night, degenerate ungrateful Julia?</p>
                  <p>Julia had never been addreſſed by Albert before but in a voice of the moſt ſoothing tenderneſs. She ſtaggered to the neareſt chair, and faintly exclaiming, what a horrid change is this, and burſt into a violent flood of tears.</p>
                  <p>Albert had never ſeen his Julia weep before, but his heart wept with her, but he now took her ſurprize for a token of guilt, and imputed her tears to the effects of art. He therefore regarded them not, but walked about the room in ſullen ſilence.</p>
                  <p>Oh! heavens, ſaid Julia, what have I done to deſerve this; tell me, Albert, how have I forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your affection?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="unknown:027654_0221_0FD5695EEAAD2BC0"/>
By betraying my honor, ſaid he fiercely, by becoming an abandoned wanton.</p>
                  <p>Heaven is my witneſs, I have done neither, ſaid ſhe, ſinknig on her knees, Oh! Albert, kill me inſtantly, but do not ſuſpect my fidelity. I will bleſs you with my laſt breath, and dying, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, I never entertained even a thought to the prejudice of your honor, or the purity of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I bear to you.</p>
                  <p>Curſed diſſembler, ſaid the enraged Albert, and he ſpurned her from him with his foot. She ſhrieked and fell, her head ſtruck the bed-poſt, and the blood guſhed in a torrent from her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
                  <p>Merciful heaven, cried he, I have murdered her. He caught her from the ground, but found neither ſenſe nor breath remained. Frantic, he rang the bell for a ſervant, and ſent for imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>A ſurgeon examined her head, the ſkull was fractured. After the wound was dreſſed ſhe open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her eyes, and fixed them upon her huſband.</p>
                  <p>Albert, ſaid ſhe, I know not who has poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your mind, or how you could ſuſpect the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Julia. Believe me, I am innocent, in my
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:027654_0222_0FD569608D9785D0"/>
cabinet you will find papers, that will unravel any ſeeming myſtery in my late conduct. I die, but dying bleſs you, for all your kindneſs to me. Ah! my love, 'tis not the wound I received on my head, but that which you inflicted on my heart, that terminates my exiſtence! I loved you too well, Albert, to feel the privation of your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and live; my heart unprepared to meet your unkindneſs ſunk under it, ſtruggled and broke.</p>
                  <p>She attempted to throw her arms round his neck, but nature was exhauſted; ſhe could only ſay, Oh! bleſs him heaven—and her ſpirit took its flight to the regions of eternal day.</p>
                  <p>Albert's diſtreſs was too great for deſcription, when he ſound he had by his blind paſſion, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the exiſtence of an innocent, valuable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom he loved with the moſt fervent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A deep melancholy ſeized him, nor could all the attentions of his friends rouſe him from the torpid ſtupor he had ſunk into, he grew worſe and worſe, and ended his days in a mad-houſe.</p>
                  <p>As there are too many Prudelia's in the world, we cannot be too cautious how we believe a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent aſſertion, or give way to ſuſpicion and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy.</p>
