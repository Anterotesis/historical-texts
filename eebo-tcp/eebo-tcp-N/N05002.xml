            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>NINE Weeks ago I arrived here from from <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> and ere now I thought to have had the Pleasure of seeing you and my other dear Friends in <hi>New-England.</hi> This was the Reason why you have not heard from me before: But as
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006269_0003_0000000000000000"/>
Providence seems to point out to me another Course<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I cannot omit this Opportunity of send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you a short Account of my late Excursion to <hi>Bermuda.</hi> I suppose you have heard of our safe and pleasant Passage: We were but nine Days I think on board, and I do not remember that I heard one single Oath from Land to Land. As we went round the West Part of the Island, in order to come into the Harbour, I was very much struck with the Variety of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Prospects of Landskips it afforded. The Scene was quite new, and quite different from any I had ever beheld before; and tho' I have been here so long, yet it appears very delightful to me still. Immediately upon my Arrival se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral received me in a plain, artless, free Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and desired me to expound the very first Evening. I readily complied, and continued so doing for several Days; and was so pleased with the Heartiness and Attention of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Pleasantness of the Island, that I could not help thinking I was got among my Friends in some Part of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> or the Clothiers Country in <hi>Gloucestershire</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>â€”One Mr. <hi>Holyday,</hi> a Clergyman of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> received me with open Heart and Arms. The first Lord's Day after my Arrival, I read Prayers, and preached in two of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Churches, and the longer I staid, the more kindly he behaved to me. The two other Church-Clergy chose to keep at a Distance:
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006269_0004_0000000000000000"/>
But one Mr. <hi>Paul,</hi> an aged Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, was very free to let me have the Use of his Meeting-house, which being pretty large, and lying in a central Part of the Island, I preached in it to very large Auditories for eight <hi>Sundays</hi> successively. His Excellency the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was pleased to come and hear me when I preached in Town, and tho' he thought proper (I suppose for fear of disobliging at Home) to prohibit my preaching any more in the Churches; yet, with most of the Council, and principal Gentlemen of the Island, he treated me with great Respect, and invited me more than once to dine with him. I have now preached near seventy times in all. On the Week Days chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at private Houses up and down, in different Parts of the Island, sometimes within, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without Doors, to larger Assemblies (as they tell me) than were ever seen upon any Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion on this Island before. The longer I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued here, the larger the Auditories grew. The Word was frequently attended with a divine Power, and many have been brought under promsing Convictions, which I trust will issue in sound and saving Conversions. When I preached my Farewell Sermon last Lord's Day in the Meeting-House, we had a most solemn Season. It much resembled the Appearances that we had sometimes at Mr. <hi>Webb</hi>'s, and the other Meeting-houses, seven or eight Years agoe at <hi>Boston.</hi> Tho I have been used to such fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006269_0005_0000000000000000"/>
Partings, yet the People's Weeping almost unmann'd me. Since then I have received many Tokens of their Love, and am furnished with a Variety of Stock for my Sea Store. God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I have promised to visit them once more. For indeed <hi>Bermuda</hi>'s People are dear to me. I have spent nine happy Weeks among them, and was never so little opposed during so long a Stay in any one fresh Place where I have been since my first coming out into the World. Indeed many I hear were prejudiced against me before I came. But what cannot God do? He has the Hearts of all in his Hands, and when our Ways please Him, can make our Enemies be at Peace with us. My being at <hi>Bermuda</hi> hath been also blessed in some Measure to the restoring my bodily Health. The Air, particularly to a Stranger, is quite salubrious, at least I have found it to be so. You know in what a weak State I was when I left <hi>Boston.</hi> Blessed be God I can preach daily; and tho' I think when I lay my Hand upon my Stomach, I can say, <hi>Hic haeret lethalis arundo</hi>; yet I am as well as a worn-out Pilgrim can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be on this Side Eternity. In a few Days I hope to embark in the Brigantine Betsy, Captain <hi>Esteen,</hi> bound for England. Letters from thence inform me of the Spread of the Gospel. Thither I think the Providence of God calls me, tho' I hope to return in a short Season to my beloved <hi>America</hi> again. Till then Farewel, dear <hi>Bermuda</hi>;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006269_0006_0000000000000000"/>
Farewel all my dear Friends on the different Parts of the Continent! Follow me, Oh follow me with your Prayers. Hold up your Hands in my Behalf, and by the Grace of God I will go on fighting. Oh that I may die in the Field! At present this is the Language of my heart;</p>
            <l>A chearful and submissive Mind,</l>
            <l>That Life and all Things casts behind,</l>
            <l>Springs forth obedient at thy Call;</l>
            <l>A Heart that no Desire can move,</l>
            <l>But still t' adore, obey and love,</l>
            <l>Give me, my Lord, my Life, my All.</l>
            <p>You, Rev. Sir, I am persuaded, will not be unmindful of me. As the Lord enables, you, and all my dear Friends, shall ever be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered by,</p>
