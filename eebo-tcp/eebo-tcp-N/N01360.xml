            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Martyrdom,</hi> is ONE thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to <hi>Dying Daily.</hi> We ought to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that we may be call'd unto, the Death of a <hi>Martyr,</hi> in bearing a Teſtimony to the Truths of God: That we may not <hi>Love our Lives unto the Death,</hi> nor hold them till they may terminate in a <hi>Natural Death.</hi> Suppoſing that we may be put upon <hi>Dying</hi> by the <hi>Fist of Wickedneſs,</hi> for our Diſpoſition to <hi>Live Godlily,</hi> we muſt have a mind that ſhall be <hi>daily Reſolved</hi> for it. To <hi>Die Daily,</hi> is to be in a <hi>Daily</hi> and fixed Reſolution, to undergo whate<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver <hi>Sufferings,</hi> our Fidelity to the King<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom

XX. 24. <hi>None of theſe things move me, neither is my Life precious to me, ſo that I may but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh my Courſe with Joy.</hi> But then, If the <hi>Lord of our Life</hi> put us upon <hi>Dying</hi> only in the way of His <hi>Common Providence,</hi> and in the manner and method of Nature in its Decays; This is <hi>Daily</hi>; and Readily, and Willingly to be ſubmitted to. We ought every Day, to keep in a <hi>Dying Frame</hi>; Ready and Willing to Entertain our <hi>Death</hi> with all poſſible <hi>Reſignation,</hi> if <hi>this</hi> be the Day, which the Lord of our Life has ordered for it. Our <hi>Daily Frame</hi> ſhould be this;
<q>Lord, <hi>My Life</hi> is entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at thy Diſpoſe; And if thou wilt have <hi>this Day,</hi> to be the <hi>Day of my Death,</hi> I will not Rebel againſt thy <hi>Order. Thy Will be done!</hi>

ready to Draw off, whenever His Great <hi>Commander</hi> ſhall give the word for it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. To Die Daily, is to <hi>Do Daily</hi> thoſe Things, which muſt be done, by every one that would Hope to <hi>Die Safely. Dying Daily,</hi> is Living in a <hi>Daily preparation for Death.</hi> It is demanded of us; Mat. XXIV. 44. <hi>Be ye Ready.</hi> We <hi>prepare for Death,</hi> and ſo for the Coming of our Saviour to Raiſe us from the Dead, by Doing thoſe Things, of which the Divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle tells us, <hi>They are the things that accom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany Salvation.</hi> To <hi>Do</hi> ſuch Things <hi>Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that ſo our <hi>Death</hi> whenever it comes may find us <hi>prepared</hi> for it, this is to <hi>Die Daily.</hi> My Hearers, I now demand of you, the greateſt Attention, that ever you gave to any thing in the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Oh! Hearken to me, that God may hearken to you another Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There muſt be firſt, an <hi>Habitual pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>paration</hi> for Death. And one who <hi>Die Daily,</hi> is one who is <hi>Daily doing</hi> of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards <hi>this</hi> preparation: <hi>Daily</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving ſome Good Strokes at the Work which muſt be done, by all that would
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001617_0014_0FB3E736DA507EF8"/>
propoſe to <hi>Die</hi> in Good Terms with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. You ſhall have it ſet before you. One Thing is this. He that would be <hi>prepared</hi> for Death, muſt be <hi>Righteous.</hi> We read, Prov. XIV. 32. It is the <hi>Righteous</hi> who has <hi>Hope in his Death.</hi> At our <hi>Death,</hi> we are in an <hi>Hopeleſs,</hi> Undone, Forlorn plight, if we are not furniſhed with a perfect and ſpotleſs <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> wherein we may ſtand before the Judgment Seat of God. We cannot obtain ſuch a <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> but by Accepting of, and Relying on, that <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> which our Saviour has in His <hi>Obedience</hi> as our <hi>Surety</hi> unto God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for us. Well then; We muſt by <hi>faith</hi> make our <hi>Daily Flight</hi> unto the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God.</hi> It muſt be our <hi>Daily</hi> courſe, Thankfully, Joyfully, Heartily to <hi>Receive the Righteouſneſs</hi> of the Bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, as the <hi>Free Gift</hi> of God, that we may lead it as our Title to Everlaſting Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. It muſt be our <hi>Daily</hi> care that we do not continue under the <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin, &amp; the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of God, but preſent before God, the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our Bleſſed Jeſus, for our <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Thus it is to <hi>Dy Daily.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Thing is this. He that wou'd be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001617_0015_0FB3E738443364C8"/>
               <hi>prepared</hi> for Death, muſt be <hi>Holy.</hi> We read, Heb, XII 14. <hi>Without Holineſs, no man ſhall ſee the Lord. Holineſs,</hi> will be the <hi>Mark</hi> by which all that at their <hi>Death,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the <hi>Strait Gate,</hi> will be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which Lies in a mind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed with a principle of <hi>Grace</hi> infuſed into it: <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which Lies in an Heart principled with the predominant <hi>Love</hi> of God: <hi>Wo</hi> to us, if we are Strangers to this! Well then; It muſt be our <hi>Daily</hi> Study to get our <hi>Enmity</hi> to God all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued. We muſt be <hi>Daily</hi> Learning to Fear <hi>God,</hi> &amp; Prize <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; Hate <hi>Sin,</hi> and perfect <hi>Holineſs in the Fear of God.</hi> We muſt be <hi>Daily</hi> Labouring to get the <hi>Image</hi> of Satan melted out of our Souls, and the <hi>Image</hi> of our Saviour gaining and growing in us. This is to <hi>Die Daily.</hi> A Third Thing is this. He that would be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Death, muſt be able to give up a <hi>Good Account</hi> unto God, in the Judgment that comes after Death. We read, Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> XIV. 12. <hi>Every one of us. ſhall give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of himſelf unto God.</hi> There is a <hi>Work</hi> which our Lord has aſſigned us to do in the World. Our <hi>Work</hi> is, To render &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001617_0016_0FB3E73A8A139318"/>
               <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> unto God. We ſhall after <hi>Death,</hi> be called to an <hi>Account</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our <hi>Work.</hi> It muſt then be our <hi>Daily</hi> Concern, by <hi>Repentance</hi> to get the pardon of all our Miſcarriages about the <hi>Work</hi> of God; and by <hi>Diligence</hi> in this <hi>Work,</hi> to be capable of <hi>Giving up our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with Joy, and not with Grief.</hi> This 'tis to <hi>Die Daily.</hi> We have a Term of <hi>Time</hi> allow'd unto us up on Earth; A <hi>Time,</hi> which Flies away like the <hi>Shadow</hi> of a <hi>Bird</hi> upon the Wing; which is the Chaldee Parapraſe, for, <hi>Our Dayes are as the Shadow.</hi> We ſhall after <hi>Death,</hi> be called to an Account how we have ſpent our <hi>Time.</hi> It muſt then be our <hi>Daily</hi> Concern, to Lay out our <hi>Time</hi> in ſuch Purpoſes, and Actions, that we may not be thunder ſtruck from our Judge, with, O <hi>Slothful, and Wicked Servant!</hi> This is to <hi>Die Daily.</hi> We are betruſted with <hi>Talents</hi> from our Lord. We are <hi>Talented</hi> with various <hi>Bleſſings</hi>; with Opportunities to <hi>Do Good.</hi> After <hi>Death,</hi> our <hi>Talents</hi> muſt be Accounted for; how much, how well, we have improved them. It muſt be our <hi>Daily</hi> Concern, To Glorify God with all our Talents; To project, and purſue all
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001617_0017_0FB3E73B48942EA8"/>
imaginable wayes for the Glorifying of Him. This 'tis to <hi>Die Daily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, there muſt be likewiſe an <hi>Actual preparation</hi> for Death, And one who <hi>Dies Daily,</hi> is one who is <hi>Daily doing</hi> of ſomething towards this preparation alſo. To be <hi>Actually prepared</hi> for Death, is to be <hi>Daily</hi> imployed in ſuch points of a <hi>Godly Life</hi> as are pleaſing to God. It is in a <hi>Daily Exerciſe</hi> to <hi>keep a Conſcience void of offence.</hi> It is in a <hi>Daily</hi> compliance with the Famous Direction, <hi>Be thou in the Fear of the Lord all the Day long.</hi> We read in Luke XII. 43. <hi>Bleſſed is that Servant, whom his Lord when He cometh, ſhall find ſo Doing.</hi> To be <hi>Actually prepared</hi> for Death, is to be <hi>Daily doing</hi> of that, which if our <hi>Death</hi> ſhould come <hi>this Day</hi> unto us, it would be no Damage unto us, to be found <hi>ſo doing.</hi> My Fellow Travellers; Keep your <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> for Heaven ſo fair and clear, that the Approach of <hi>Death</hi> may not make you <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid with any amazement.</hi> Keep your Souls in ſuch an <hi>Heavenly Frame,</hi> that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of <hi>Death</hi> may not find you indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for a <hi>Tranſlation</hi> to a Better World. Be <hi>Daily</hi> Engaged in ſuch <hi>Services,</hi> that it
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001617_0018_0FB3E73E1AE4F2E0"/>
may be no Diſadvantage for you, to be found ſo Engaged. This 'tis to <hi>Die Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> One thing more: <hi>Every Night</hi> a man who <hi>Dies daily,</hi> will beſtow ſome Thoughts on that Queſtion, <hi>If I Die this Night, is all well with me? If I Die this Night, am I ſure of a Better Life!</hi>
               <q>Do I fall Aſleep this <hi>Night</hi> in the Arms of a Faithful Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</q>
               <hi>Non prius in dulcem declinent Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Somnum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. We are to <hi>Die Daily,</hi> by <hi>Dying to the World every Day,</hi> and becoming <hi>Dead</hi> in reſpect of our Worldly Inclinations. To <hi>Die Daily,</hi> is to proceed <hi>every Day</hi> in the Work of <hi>Mortification</hi> to the <hi>World: Every Day</hi> to be at that Work; Gal. VI. 14. <hi>I am crucified unto the World.</hi> A man who <hi>Dies Daily,</hi> is one who has in him ſuch Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of this World, as <hi>Dying Men</hi> uſe to have. Come to a <hi>Dying Man,</hi> and ask him, <hi>How this World appears to him?</hi> His Anſwer will be;

               </q>
To <hi>Die Daily,</hi> is to Live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Force of ſuch Sentiments; To <hi>Think</hi> of <hi>this World,</hi> as <hi>Dying Men</hi> do, and <hi>Live</hi> in this World as <hi>Dying Men</hi> wiſh to have done. But then, there is this in it: A <hi>Death</hi> upon our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions for <hi>this World.</hi> It is true, And, Oh! When ſhall we have the <hi>Skill</hi> to place things in their due <hi>Subordination! O thou glorious and liberal Giver of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Do thou give this Wiſdom unto us!</hi>— I would ſay, it is true, So far as the Enjoyments of <hi>this world,</hi> may be <hi>Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi> unto God, we are to Love them, and Seek them: So far as the <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of God will direct us to do ſo, we are to Love and Seek the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of <hi>this world.</hi> There is the <hi>Love of God</hi> in it, when we mind <hi>this world</hi> but in a Subordination unto GOD.

This <hi>Dying to the World,</hi> is the ſame with the <hi>Dying to Sin,</hi> which is required of us: For our Sin lies in Departing from <hi>God,</hi> both to and for the <hi>World.</hi> A <hi>Death,</hi> A <hi>Death,</hi> upon our Diſpoſitions, for <hi>this world</hi>; This is a Thing to be <hi>Daily</hi> maintained, a thing to be <hi>Daily</hi> ſtudied; And therein, we are to <hi>Die Daily.</hi> The <hi>Dead,</hi> how are they Diſpoſed for <hi>this world</hi>?

               <hi>God</hi> has not done with us, when we have done with <hi>this World.</hi> We ſhall Exiſt, &amp; our longeſt Exiſtence will be in <hi>another world.</hi> In <hi>Dying Daily,</hi> we ſhall do that thing; 2 Cor. IV. 18. <hi>Look not unto the things which are ſeen, and are Temporal, but unto the things which are not ſeen, and are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</hi> But let us a little <hi>Enquire</hi>; For the Glorious Redeemer, who is the <hi>True Witneſs, and the Deliverer of Souls,</hi> has En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled us to anſwer the Enquiry; <hi>What will there be after Death?</hi> We are informed; Heb. IX. 27. <hi>After Death, the Judgment.</hi> And now I will tell you, What it is to <hi>Die Daily?</hi> it is to have <hi>Daily,</hi> and Serious, and Solemn Thoughts on the <hi>Judgment</hi> which is to come <hi>After Death. Every Day</hi> to think ſuitably on the <hi>Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is, to <hi>Die Daily.</hi> It ſhould be a Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conſideration with us; 'Am I Ready to appear before the <hi>Judgment-Seat of the Glorious Lord!</hi> What I am now adoing, will it be <hi>Approved,</hi> or will it be <hi>Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> from the <hi>Judgment-Seat</hi> of the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God? <hi>What ſhall I do, when God riſes up, and when He viſits, what ſhall I anſwer Him?</hi> We ſhould be awakened <hi>Every

Day</hi> to <hi>Fear God, and keep His Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> from this Conſideration; <hi>God will bring every work into Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well; but what follows upon the <hi>Judgment?</hi> We are informed; Matth. XXV. 46. Either <hi>Everlaſting Puniſhment,</hi> or, <hi>Life Eternal.</hi> And now I will again tell you, What it is to <hi>Die Daily,</hi> It is <hi>Every Day</hi> to Look <hi>Downward</hi> into the <hi>Hell,</hi> which the <hi>Wicked, and all they that forget God</hi> ſhall be turned into: To be driven by that horrible Spectacle, unto the JESUS, who <hi>delivers from the Wrath to come</hi>; To Conſider, Oh! <hi>Who can dwell in a Conſuming Fire and in Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Burnings?</hi> And, <hi>What a Fearful thing it is, to fall into the Hands of the Living God!</hi> It is <hi>Every Day</hi> to Look <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pward,</hi> unto the <hi>Heaven,</hi> where JESUS <hi>Sits at the Right Hand of God:</hi> To be Quickened from the View of the <hi>Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi> there ſet before us, in <hi>Runing the Race</hi> which is here ſet before us: To Conſider, <hi>Oh! the Glory, and Honour, and Immortality of the Eternal Life,</hi> which by <hi>patient continuance in well-doing,</hi> I ſhall

            </p>
            <p>And, my Brethren, let me aſſure you, Thus to <hi>Die Daily,</hi> will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the <hi>Bitterneſs of Death.</hi> We ſhall not <hi>Live</hi> the leſs while, for ſo <hi>Dying Daily.</hi> It will not <hi>Haſten</hi> our <hi>Death:</hi> But it will <hi>Sweeten</hi> it. Thus to <hi>Dy Daily,</hi> is the way to <hi>Live Wiſely</hi>; To Live Piouſly, Watchfully, Fruitfully. Yea, Tis the Way to <hi>Live Eternally.</hi>
