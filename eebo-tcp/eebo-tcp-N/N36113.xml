            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TWO days after you left my houſe, Mr. <hi>Camber</hi> and myſelf, after providing ourſelves with proviſions, began our journey, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to penetrate the Weſtern Wilderneſs as far as prudence and ſafety would permit. We travelled for thirteen days in a weſterly direction, without meeting any thing uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or worthy deſcription, except a very great variety of birds and wild beaſts, which would frequently ſtart before us—and, as we had our muſkets, contributed not a little to our amuſement and ſupport. The land we found exceedingly rich and fertile, every where well watered, and the variety of berries, nuts, ground-nuts, &amp;c. afforded a very comfortable living.</p>
            <p>ON the 14th day of our travels, while we were obſerving a high hill, at the foot of which, ran a beautiful ſtream, which paſſing into a ſmall plain, after a few windings, loſt

itſelf in a thicket—and obſerving the agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pictureſque proſpect, which preſented itſelf on all ſides, we were ſurpriſed at the ſound of a voice, which ſeemed at no great diſtance.</p>
            <p>AT firſt we were uncertain whether the voice was an human one, or that of ſome bird; as many extraordinary ones inhabited theſe wilds. After liſtening ſome time, the voice ceaſed and we then determined to proceed up the hill, from whence, we judged, the ſound to come; that we might, if poſſible, discover what voice it was that ſo much aſtoniſhed us. Accordingly, croſſing the brook, we proceeded up the hill; and having arrived near the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, we again diſtinctly heard a voice ſinging in our own language, a mournful ſong. When the voice ceaſed, we obſerved a ſmall foot path, which we followed; and arriving at the top of the hill, paſſing round a large rock, then thro a thicket of buſhes, at the end of which, was a large opening: Upon our arrival here, to our inexpreſſible amazement, we beheld a beautiful young Lady! ſitting near the mouth of a cave!—She, not obſerving us, began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to ſing. We now attempted to approach her; when a dog, which we had not before obſerved, ſprung up and began to bark at us; at which ſhe ſtarted up, and ſeeing us, gave a ſcream and ſwooned away. We ran to her aſſiſtance, and having lifted her up, ſhe ſoon recovered; and looking wild at us, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>m whence are you?—We deſired her to be under no uneaſineſs—told her we were travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:047150_0004_10225300128A3740"/>
—that we came only to view the country; but that in all our travels, we had not met with any thing that had ſurpriſed us ſo much, as her extraordinary appearance, in a place which we imagined totally unfrequented.</p>
            <p>AFTER a little converſation, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced her of our peaceable diſpoſitions, and that we intended her no injury, ſhe invited us into the cave, when ſhe refreſhed us with ſome ground-nuts, a kind of apples, ſome Indian cake, and excellent water.—We found her to be an agreeable, ſenſible Lady; and after ſome converſation, we requeſted to know who ſhe was, and how ſhe came to this place. She very readily complied with this requeſt, and began her ſtory as follows:—</p>
            <p>"STRANGERS, your appearance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, entitle you to my confidence; and, tho my ſtory cannot be very intereſting or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining—yet it may poſſibly excite your pity, while it gratifies your curioſity.</p>
            <p>"I WAS born near <hi>Albany,</hi> in the year 1760<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—My father was a man of ſome conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and of conſiderable eſtate in the place where he lived.—I was his only child, and had I continued with him, poſſibly, I might have been happy. In the fifteenth year of my age, my father received into his family a young Gentleman of education, as his clerk: This young man, by his eaſy politeneſs—his good ſenſe, and agreeable manners, ſoon gained the eſteem of all the family.—He had not been long with us, before he conceived an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate paſſion for me; and, as he had frequent:
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:047150_0005_1022536DA17A82C8"/>
opportunities of converſing with me—his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating addreſs, added to a ſenſible, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging converſation, ſoon found way to my heart: He quickly perceived that I was not indifferent to him—and took occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his paſſion; which he did with ſo much ardour, and yet, with ſo much modeſty, that I readily acknowledged a mutual attachment.</p>
            <p>AFTER this, we ſpent together many happy evenings, vowing mutual love, and fondly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating future happineſs. We were how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever obliged to conceal our attachment from my father; who, as he was exceſſively eager in purſuit of riches, we had no reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he would countenance our loves, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to my marriage with a man deſtitute of fortune.</p>
            <p>IT happened, one evening, as we were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing by ourſelves in a little garden, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining our houſe, that we were overheard by my father; who, either ſuſpected our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to each other, or from ſome other motives, had purpoſely concealed himſelf in this place, where he knew we uſually walked. Next morning, my father, with an angry countenance, upbraided my lover with treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly engaging his daughter's affections— and after calling him many hard names, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed him, with peremptory order never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to enter his houſe. It was in vain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate; he inſiſted on being obeyed—and ordered me to my chamber, where he confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me. My lover then wrote to my father, ſtating to him our ſituation—requeſted leave
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:047150_0006_1022536F35E21CF8"/>
to addreſs me, and informed him of our mutual engagements, with the reaſon for not ſooner conſulting him. To this, my father ordered the young Gentleman to trouble him no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his impertinence, nor ever to think of any further connection with me. By means, however, of an old ſervant, long attached to my lover, we found means to carry on a correſpondence—and, in about a month after, we contrived matters, that I had an interview with my lover: I then agreed to quit my fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's houſe, and retire into the country, to ſee whether my abſence would not ſoften his heart —and induce him to conſent to my happineſs. I therefore packed up ſome clothes, and other things, and left my father's houſe in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the tenth of May, 1777, and retired ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral miles into the country, to a little hut, where my lover left me, and went in diſguiſe, to ſee what effect my abſence had upon my father. In five days he returned, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that, my father, enraged at my elope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had hired ſeveral men to ſearch the country, in purſuit of us; and that he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened vengeance to us both—and declared, that he would be the death of the man who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off his daughter. Thunder-ſtruck at this account, I knew not what to do—to attempt a reconciliation with my father was vain— or if poſſible to be effected, my lover muſt be ſacrificed to it, which would make me inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portably unhappy. In order to elude the ſearch of thoſe who were in purſuit of us, we propoſed to move further into the country,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:047150_0007_102253717B06C378"/>
and there to wait till time ſhould calm my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's rage, or effectually cool his reſentment.</p>
            <p>WE accordingly left the hut, and travelled at an eaſy rate, for four days, determining to avoid being taken.—But, O! how ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the horrid ſcene that followed?—To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the evening of the fourth day, we were ſurrounded and made priſoners, by a party of Indians!—who led us about two miles, and then barbarouſly murdered my lover! cutting and mangling him in the moſt inhuman man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner! then, after tying him to a ſtake, they kindled a fire round him! and, while he burnt, they ran round, ſinging and dancing! rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their brutal cruelty!! I was at a few rods diſtance during this tranſaction! and this ſcene had well nigh deprived me of life. I fainted away, and lay ſome time motionleſs on the ground:—When I recovered my ſenſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I perceived that my guard had joined his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, ſome of whom were ſeated round in rings, and others continued ſinging and danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Seeing them all engaged, I withdrew by degrees, into the buſhes, and being out of ſight, I got up and ſtood for about an hour:— I then ſat down by the ſide of a tree, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome by fatigue, and the ſight I had ſeen, I either fainted or fell aſleep, and knew nothing till the next morning, about ſeven o'clock. 'Tis impoſſible for me to deſcribe my feelings—or for you to conceive a ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more wretched than mine, at this time.— Surrounded, as I ſuppoſed, on all ſides with danger, I knew not what to do, without a
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:047150_0008_1022537411BBDB20"/>
guide to direct, or friend to protect me. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten I was upon the point of returning, and endeavouring to find, and deliver myſelf a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to thoſe Indians, to whoſe cruelty I had ſo lately been a witneſs; and, had I then ſeen them, I certainly ſhould have delivered myſelf into there power. At length I got up, and after walking ſome time, I reſolved to ſeek ſome place of ſhelter, where I might be ſecure from ſtorms by day, and from beaſts by night; where I might dwell till a period ſhould be put to my miſerable exiſtence.</p>
            <p>WITH this view, I wandered about for fourteen days, without knowing whither I went. By day, the ſpontaneous produce of the earth ſupplied me with food—by night the ground was my couch, and the canopy of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven my only covering. In the afternoon of the fifteenth day I was ſurpriſed at ſeeing a man, of a gigantic figure, walking towards me—to run I knew would be vain, and no leſs vain to attempt to hide. He ſoon came up with me, and accoſted me in a language I did not underſtand, and after ſurveying me for ſome time, he took me by the hand, and led me to his cave; having entered, pointed to a ſtone ſeat on which I ſat down; he then gave me to eat ſome nuts and ſome Indian cake, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, he ſtretched himſelf out on a long ſtone, covered with ſkins, which he uſed as a bed, and ſeveral times motioned to me to lay myſelf beſide him. I declined his offer, and at length he roſe in a paſſion, and went into another apartment of the cave, and brought
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:047150_0009_1022537649EBDF08"/>
forth a ſword and hatchet. He then motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, that I muſt either accept of his bed, or expect death for my obſtinacy. I ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined his offer, and was reſolved to die rather than comply with his deſire. He then brought a walnut bark, and having bound me, pointing towards the eaſt, intimating that he left me till morning, to conſider his propoſal; he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his bed, and, happily for me, he ſoon fell aſleep. Having the liberty of my teeth, I ſoon made out to bite the bark in two, with which he had bound me, by which I found means to liberate myſelf while he continued ſleeping. As I conſidered this as the only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity I ſhould have of freeing my ſelf from him—as I expected that he would uſe violence when he waked, to make me partake of his bed, and, as I knew I could not eſcape him by flight, I did not long deliberate—but took up the hatchet he had brought, and ſummoning reſolution, I, with three blows, effectually put an end to his exiſtence.</p>
            <p>I THEN cut off his head, and next day, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut him in quarters, drew him out of the cave, about half a mile diſtance; when after covering him with leaves and buſhes, returned to this place. I now found myſelf alone, in the poſſeſſion of this cave, in which are ſeveral apartments. I here found a kind of Indian corn, which I planted, and have yearly raiſed a ſmall quantity. I here contented myſelf as well as my wretched ſituation would permit— here have I exiſted for nine long years, in all which time this faithful Dog, which I found in the cave, has been my only companion, and

you are the only human beings, who ever heard me tell my tale."</p>
            <p>HERE ſhe finiſhed her narration, and, after ſhedding a plentiful ſhower of tears, and a little converſation, ſhe requeſted us to take reſt, which requeſt we willingly complied with.</p>
            <p>NEXT morning ſhe conducted us thro' the cave, in which were four apartments, one of which appeared pretty deep in the earth, in which was a ſpring of excellent water—in the other three were nothing very remarkable, except four ſkulls, which we ſuppoſed were or perſons murdered by the owner of the cave, or of his former companions. We found alſo three hatchets, four bows, and ſeveral arrows, one large tinder box, one ſword, one old gun, and a number of ſkins of dead beaſts, and a few clothes. The bows, ſome arrows, the ſword, and one hatchet, we brought, away, which are now in my poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>AFTER continuing in the cave five days, we propoſed returning home, and requeſted the Lady to accompany us. At firſt ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to quit her cave; but after ſome perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhe conſented.</p>
            <p>"GENTLEMEN, ſaid ſhe, I truſt myſelf to your protection—I have no reaſon to queſtion your good intentions, and willingly believe, from my ſmall acquaintance with you, that you will not ſeek to heap affliction upon a weak woman, already borne down with miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery and ſorrow."</p>
            <p>WE together left the cave, on the morning of the ſixth day after our arrival in it, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling

the way we went, arrived at my houſe in ſeventeen days. After reſting about a week, we accompanied the Lady, agreeable to her deſire, to her father's houſe— The old man did not at firſt recognize his daughter, but being told who ſhe was, he looked at her for ſome time, and them tenderly embraced her, crying, "<hi>0 ! my child, my long loſt child! I do once more ſold thee in my arms!</hi>" He then fainted away. We with difficulty brought him to life; but the ſcene had overcome him; he opened his eyes, and being a little recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, requeſted to know where ſhe had lived ſo long, and what had happened to her, ſince her leaving his houſe. We deſired him to wait till he ſhould be better recovered, but he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be ſatisfied immediately, obſerving that he had but a few moments to live. She then briefly related what had happened to her, and the tragical death of her lover.— He ſeemed much affected, and when ſhe had finiſhed, he took her by the hand, and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately ſqueezed it, acknowledging he had been unjuſtly cruel to her, and aſked her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, and attempted to ſay ſomething more —but immediately fainted; all our endeavors to recover him were in vain, he lay about ſeven hours, and then expired.</p>
            <p>HE left a handſome fortune to his daughter, who, notwithſtanding his cruelty, was deeply affected at his ſudden and unexpected death.
