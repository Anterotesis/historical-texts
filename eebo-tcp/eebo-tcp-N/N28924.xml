            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>—THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL BE IN EVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LASTING REMEMBRANCE.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>TO be remembered with affection, and deſcend to poſterity with applauſe, is a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar honor allotted to the righteous. Thoſe who have been actuated only by ſelfiſh and baſe paſſions; who have never ſought, and never promoted, the happineſs of mankind, die without regret, and are ſoon forgotten. But thoſe, of benevolent hearts, who make it their conſtant aim to do good to their fellow-men, and in their general conduct are gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned by the rules of virtue, acquire a name better than precious ointment. While they live, they are the objects of univerſal veneration and love; and when they die, their memory is bleſſed.</p>
            <p>WHEN, therefore, ſuch uſeful and worthy citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens are cut down by the ſtroke of death, ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, who have been bleſſed with their labors of love, muſt be ſhamefully inſenſible not to be deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the loſs. A good man, even in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt walks of life, will be followed to the grave by
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038564_0005_10126C66D8BACF80"/>
his friends, with weeping eyes and ſorrowful hearts. But when thoſe are laid in the duſt, who have filled various public ſtations, with great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and uſefulneſs, millions mourn: all are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted: the inhabitants of the whole earth ſuſtain a loſs, and teſtify their grief. For ſuch men are bleſſings not to one nation only, but to all. The benign influence of their benevolence, wiſdom, and virtue extend to all people. They are, in ſome reſpects, <hi>that</hi> to the whole human race, which the ſun is to the ſolar ſyſtem. They preſerve order and regularity, and diffuſe light and comfort to all around them, except thoſe, who love darkneſs rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than light, leſt their deeds ſhould reprove them.</p>
            <p>To theſe general obſervations we have been led, by the univerſal ſadneſs and mourning, which have been ſpreading through the earth, ever ſince the fatal fourteenth of December laſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. WASHINGTON died Dec. 14th, 1799, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the evening, after a ſhort illneſs of about twenty-four hours. His diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was an inflammatory fore throat, which proceeded from a cold.</note> On that ever-memorable day, our beloved WASHINGTON reſted from his labors. He finiſhed his career of terreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trial glory, and took poſſeſſion, as we truſt, of that eternal weight of glory, which GOD of his grace has prepared for the faithful.</p>
            <p>BUT, although his body is mouldering in the duſt, the memory of him ſhall never periſh. He ſtill lives, and he will always live, in the affections of his grateful countrymen. His unexampled achievements will ſtand recorded upon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038564_0006_10126C686DB53F88"/>
page of hiſtory, till time ſhall end; and he will be handed down to poſterity, as one of the greateſt and beſt of men. Yea, more, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, his name is written in the LAMB'S book of life, which is beyond the reach of devouring time, and he will literally be in everlaſting remembrance.</p>
            <p>Is then our beloved WASHINGTON removed from us for ever? Will he no more lead our armies to victory; aid us by his ſage advice; or bleſs us with his future counſels? We are unwilling to believe either. But, alas! theſe painful truths are not to be denied. He who triumphed over the enemies of America, who ſubdued the enmity of all hearts, has himſelf fallen a victim to the laſt enemy, Death. By his demiſe, the ſenſibility of every American is ſorely wounded. The ſadneſs of every countenance is expreſſive of the grief of every heart.</p>
            <p>AT ſuch a time of univerſal ſorrow, it is with great propriety, that our civil rulers have invited us to the houſe of GOD. Here we may unitedly contemplate our <hi>afflictions</hi> and our <hi>conſolations.</hi> By ſuitably conſidering both theſe; by reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wonderful diſpenſations of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and by our humiliations and fervent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to GOD, we may hope, that our hearts will be properly affected:—that ſuch a balance of our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions will be produced, that we ſhall not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly depreſſed or elated "at aught this ſcene can threaten or indulge." May the whole nation be deeply humbled under the mighty hand
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038564_0007_10126C6B819282F8"/>
of GOD. May our united humiliations and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications come up before GOD, as ſweet incenſe. With devout hearts, may we adopt the prayer of the Pſalmiſt: "Help, LORD, for the godly man ceaſeth; for the faithful fail from among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men."</p>
            <p>IN AMERICA, the 22d of February has been cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebrated, with feſtivity and rejoicing, becauſe, in the year 1732, it gave birth to WASHINGTON. But, alas! how are the accuſtomed ſcenes of this day reverſed! Our feſtivity ceaſes. Our ſongs of joy are changed for tears of grief. We are clad in mourning attire.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>" To civic triumphs, funeral rites ſucceed;</l>
               <l>To flowery garlands, this encircling weed;</l>
               <l>And to loud paeans ſounding through the ſkies,</l>
               <l>Low ſolemn dirges and heart rending ſighs."</l>
            </lg>
            <p>INDEED, if the citizens of America were not deeply affected with the loſs of their political FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, they would evince baſe ingratitude, and even ſtoical apathy. To drop a tear over his tomb, is as agreeable to our holy religion, as it is congenial with our afflicted hearts. In this our heavenly FATHER, who knows the weakneſs of our frame and the greatneſs of our loſs, will read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily indulge us. In doing this, we ſhall copy his example, whom to imitate is our greateſt glory. For we are told that our Divine MASTER wept at the grave of his friend Lazarus.</p>
            <p>BUT, my friends, for whom do we weep? Is it for our Father, or for ourſelves and our country?
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038564_0008_10126C6FA4DB39F8"/>
Surely not for him. For, if, as Chriſt has told us, we may know men by their fruits, we muſt believe, that he has made a happy change.</p>
            <p>LOOK, then, on the various parts of Gen. WASHINGTON'S life, and you will find that he uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly maintained an excellent character. He was eminent for thoſe virtues, which adorn human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and endear a man to ſociety. Through his whole life, he ſeems to have been actuated by a generous, humane, and patriotic ſpirit, and to have diſcharged his public and private duties with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular fidelity. Notwithſtanding he had filled the moſt exalted ſtations in ſociety, and was loaded with all the honors, which his grateful country could beſtow, yet he uniformly exhibited a ſhining pattern of humility and dignified condeſcenſion. He was a PUBLIC PROFESSOR<note n="*" place="bottom">General WASHINGTON was educated an Epiſcopalian, and uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended divine ſervice in that church; but he exerciſed great liberality of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent towards all other denominations of Chriſtians. Says he in his farewel addreſs to the people; "With <hi>ſlight ſhades</hi> of difference, you have the <hi>ſame religion."</hi>
               </note> of the Chriſtian relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and in his life and converſation adorned its doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines. His obſervance of the Sabbath was very exemplary,<note n="†" place="bottom">At his entrance upon his civil employments, Gen. WASHINGTON an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to the public that he would attend to no ſecular buſineſs upon the Lord's day, and he uniformly adhered to his reſolution.</note> and in his attendance upon the public worſhip of GOD, which was regular and conſtant, he always appeared ſerious and engaged. Nor did he think this the only homage he was bound to pay his Maker. He maintained a daily intercourſe
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038564_0009_10126C713A136E80"/>
with Heaven by prayer.<note n="*" place="bottom">By one of the General's domeſtics while at Cambridge, we are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he regularly maintained family prayer. Through the whole of the war, he is known to have obſerved ſtated ſeaſons of retirement for ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. And it was his poſitive order for none to intrude upon him, but in caſe of an alarm.</note> Frequently in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and in his communications to the public, he expreſſed his deep ſenſe of a ſuperintending Providence, and of his own dependence upon the divine care and direction. He never ſaid, like the proud conquerors of the earth, My own arm hath gotten me the victory. But he uniformly aſcribed his ſucceſs to the bleſſing of GOD upon the united exertions of the whole nation. Read his "Polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical Legacies," and you will need nothing further to convince you of his high ſenſe of the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of religion.<note n="†" place="bottom">A ſtriking ſpecimen of this, you may ſee in the following extract from his "Circular Letter to the Governors of the ſeveral States, in 1783." "I now make it my earneſt prayer, that God would have you, and the State over which you preſide, in his holy protection; that he would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a ſpirit of ſubordination and obedience to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; to entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another, for their fellow-citizens of the United States at large; and particularly, for their breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren who have ſerved in the field; and finally, that he would moſt graciouſly be pleaſed to diſpoſe us all to do juſtice, to love mercy, and to demean our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of mind, which were the characteriſtics of the DIVINE AUTHOR of our BLESSED RELICION<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an humble imitation of whoſe example, in theſe things, we can never hope to be a happy nation."</note> In the cloſing ſcene of life, he diſcovered nothing of the weakneſs of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;—no diſtruſt of the foundation of his hope. He declared, that he was not afraid to die. And he met his fate, as he had lived, like a CHRISTIAN HERO. Although exerciſed with acute pain, not a murmur or a groan eſcaped from him. With
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038564_0010_10126C747A3E9178"/>
great compoſure, he cloſed his eyes, with his own hand, and reſigned his ſpirit to GOD who gave it. "Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace."<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm xxxvii. 37.</note>

            <p>CAN we deſire better evidence reſpecting our departed friend, on which to found a judgment of charity? Is not ſuch profeſſion and ſuch a practice the beſt proof we can have, that he was one of thoſe righteous perſons, who ſhall be in everlaſting remembrance? A celebrated poet hath juſtly ſaid,</p>
            <l>"For modes of faith let graceleſs zealots fight,</l>
            <l>His can't be wrong, whoſe life is in the right."</l>
            <p>WE may, therefore, mingle tears of joy with tears of grief, on the preſent occaſion. While we mourn our loſs, we ſhould rejoice at his gain. And truly it is no ſmall conſolation to have ſuch ſubſtantial evidence, that our deceaſed friend is gone to the FATHER, to be forever happy with the LORD.</p>
            <p>BY the death of General WASHINGTON the <hi>world</hi> ſuſtains a loſs. His writings, his character, and example had a moſt extenſive and ſalutary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. The <hi>friends of order</hi> have loſt in him one of the main pillars by which regular governments of every denomination are upheld. For he firmly oppoſed the reſtleſs diſorganizers of civil ſociety, and thoſe haughty deſpots, who would give laws to all the world. He was willing that every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould chooſe its own form of government
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038564_0011_10126C77B2DE5E90"/>
and be ruled by its own laws. That right he readily yielded to others, which, at every riſk, he had claimed and defended for his own nation. By his death the <hi>friends of ſocial happineſs</hi> have loſt, I will not ſay, the founder of freedom, but the CHIEF CORNER-STONE, on which rational liberty has been erected. Mourn, ye Inhabitants of the earth! Weep, ye Sons of Freedom! For you have loſt one of your beſt friends and greateſt benefactors.</p>
            <p>BUT, alas! Who can calculate the loſs of this GREAT MAN to <hi>America?</hi> We are deprived of our firſt man: Firſt in <hi>war;</hi> firſt in <hi>peace;</hi> firſt in the affections of his countrymen. And juſtly was he dear to them. For, through a long courſe of years, he rendered the moſt eſſential ſervices to his country.</p>
            <p>IN early life, he gave ſtriking proofs of his tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and commenced his career of uſefulneſs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was twenty years of age, he was appointed to a military command. In the year 1753, when the French and Indians from Canada, made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments on the frontiers of Virginia, he was commiſſioned, on the difficult and dangerous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of treating with the Indians, and of warning the French, to deſiſt from their aggreſſions. This commiſſion he executed with honor to himſelf and ſatisfaction to his conſtituents.</p>
            <p>IN 1755, he ſuſtained the rank of extra Aid de Camp to General Braddock, and gave a ſtriking ſpecimen of his military ſkill. That ill-fated com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, contemptuouſly rejecting the prudent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038564_0012_10126C7AB10E0778"/>
of WASHINGTON, fell into an ambuſh of the Savages, on the banks of the Monongahela, near the Ohio, by which himſelf with a large part of the army were ſlain. Colonel WASHINGTON, by his preſence of mind and gallant behavior, ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the remainder from the rage of the victorious foe. This he did in ſuch a maſterly manner, as gained him the applauſe both of Great Britain and America. This brilliant action in a young officer, was the occaſion of his being <hi>then</hi> ſpoken of in terms which <hi>now</hi> ſeem in a manner prophetic of his future greatneſs. Preſident DAVIES, in a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon publiſhed at that time, calls him a worthy young man, whom Providence ſeems raiſing up to be the SAVIOR of his country.</p>
            <p>IN the year 1759, on account of bodily indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he reſigned his commiſſion in the Britiſh army. His health being gradually re-eſtabliſhed, he married the preſent amiable Mrs. WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, and ſettled as planter and farmer on his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate at Mount Vernon. From 1759 to 1774, he was a member of Aſſembly, a magiſtrate of the county in which he reſided, and a judge of the court. In each of theſe capacities, he acted with the ſame aſſiduity and fidelity, as in his more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted offices. He was elected a delegate to the firſt Congreſs in 1774, and to that which aſſociated in the following year.</p>
            <p>How wonderful are the ways of God! By a ſpecial Providence does WASHINGTON ſeem to be raiſed up and endowed with extraordinary talents
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038564_0013_10126C7F3659AE58"/>
particularly ſuited to the eventful era of his life. And this appears to be the time, deſtined by Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, for calling them conſpicuouſly into exerciſe. Great Britain claimed, and by force of arms was attempting to exerciſe, "the right of making laws binding us in all caſes whatſoever." This rouſed the martial genius of the country, and, on the 19th of April, 1775, the flames of war burſt forth in America. When, therefore, a General was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to conduct our armies, the eyes of Congreſs were immediately turned upon WASHINGTON. He was then in the vigor of manhood, and well acquainted with the ſcience of war. He ſuſtained a high reputation, as a ſoldier, and poſſeſſed a moſt engaging addreſs. And by the unanimous voice of Congreſs, to the univerſal ſatisfaction of the people, he was appointed to that moſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant office. This truſt he accepted with a mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty and diffidence peculiar to himſelf. The united voice of the people, he conſidered, as the voice of GOD. He therefore dared not to diſobey. So ardent was his love of liberty; he looked down on ſlavery with ſuch noble indignity; and he felt ſuch reſentment at the injuries done his country, that he was not awed by the terrors of a <hi>proſcription.</hi> Without any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary reward, he determined to enter on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilous enterpriſe, having no alternative before him, but victory or death. But ſatisfied of the juſtice of his cauſe, he truſted GOD for the event.</p>
            <p>DURING an eight-years war, he encountered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable difficulties, fatigues, and dangers. He
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038564_0014_10126C82450971A8"/>
conducted the whole with ſingular wiſdom. At all times, his great military ſkill was conſpicuous; but he ſhone with the brighteſt luſtre in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt perplexing ſeaſons. Difficulties and dangers were ſo far from diſheartening him, that they gave a ſpring to his ſpirits;—an energy to his exertions, that removed every obſtruction. An inſtance of this, you may recollect, took place in the cloſe of the year 1776: that moſt gloomy period of our affairs,—that criſis of American dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. GENERAL WASHINGTON with a handful of men, naked and deſtitute of almoſt every conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, was then flying through the Jerſies, before a numerous, veteran, and well-ſupplied army. How did his great ſoul, at this trying time, ſhine out in all its ſplendor. Combating the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable difficulties, braving the rigors of winter, and the inclemencies of the weather, he with his little band performed prodigies of valor at Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Princeton. They checked the force of the whole Britiſh army, and cloſed with honor a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous campaign. How ſucceſsfully he afterwards oppoſed our enemies, you need not be told. The battles he fought, the victories he won, and the armies he captivated, are freſh in your memories. His prudence, his caution, his wiſdom, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; his incorruptible fidelity and invincible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance; his policy in cluding and circumvent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foe; his amazing fertility of invention, in finding out expedients to guard againſt future dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties; his great ſagacity in penetrating the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the enemy and judging of their future
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038564_0015_10126C83DD00F8F8"/>
movements; and his maſterly addreſs in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing differences, in ſilencing the voice of diſcontent and mutiny, and harmonizing the diſcordant parts of his army, are ſo well known as to fill us with admiration, and will be told to the aſtoniſhment of future generations. A particular detail of his achievements in the Revolutionary War, will not be expected on the preſent occaſion. It is ſufficient to obſerve, that he obtained the grand object for which he contended. He with the PATRIOT ARMY drove the enemy from our ſhores, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled our country in peace, liberty and independence.</p>
            <p>THIS arduous conflict being ended, our victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous General, on the 23d of December, 1783, reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his commiſſion to Congreſs, and, like Cincinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus of Rome, retired to the rank of a private citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, amid the moſt flattering plaudits of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen.</p>
            <p>BUT great talents, deſigned for public uſe, could not long be ſolely occupied in private concerns. The exigencies of our country ſoon called him to the public council. The old Confederation, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in haſte, being found eſſentially deficient, a new form of Government muſt be inſtituted. In the auguſt body, delegated from every part of the Union to perform this mighty work, we behold our venerable WASHINGTON, by their unanimous ſuffrage, placed at their head. Their united wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom produced our preſent happy Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>AFTER the Conſtitution was adopted by the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral States, a mighty taſk ſtill remained to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038564_0016_10126C886B692CA8"/>
The government muſt be organized. This complicated machine muſt be ſet in motion. A perſon was to be choſen, who ſhould ſee that the laws were faithfully executed. Happy for America, there was one citizen, whoſe pre-eminent endowments and diſtinguiſhed ſervices, precluded all controverſy reſpecting the man to whom this important truſt ſhould be committed. By the free ſuffrages of the electors in every State, the General of our armies was twice choſen PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. On the 30th of April, 1789, he was introduced to office.</p>
            <p>THROUGH eight tempeſtuous years, he ſat at the helm of our political ſhip. Here again he diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great talents and ſublime virtues. Encompaſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by dangers on either ſide;—having Scylla on the one hand and Charybdis on the other, he ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſteered a middle courſe, and avoided them both.</p>
            <p>AT length, worn down with cares and fatigues, and thinking, that duty no longer called him to the arduous taſk of the Preſidency, he declined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered a candidate for that office.</p>
            <p>AGAIN he retires to his beloved ſhades. But not long does he enjoy his wiſhed repoſe. The enemies of our country inſult our government and abuſe our citizens. Force is found neceſſary to maintain our rights. While WASHINGTON lived, no other could be thought of to command our armies. At the requeſt of our worthy CHIEF
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038564_0017_10126C8B562C9ED8"/>
MAGISTRATE, and to the joy of every American, he accepted the appointment to that important office. The indignities and abuſes offered to his country, arouſed the reſentment and martial geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of us our war-worn General. He again girded on his conquering ſword. He took the command of our armies, and directed their operations, till HE, who is higher than the higheſt, ſummoned him from all his earthly employments to join the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies above. "Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hoſts doth take away the mighty man, the man of war, the honorable man and the counſellor."</p>
            <p>DID ever before, ſo many great and good qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities unite in one man! It is difficult to determine whether he excelled moſt in the cabinet, or in the field. He had the ſingular felicity of uniting all hearts in favor of the meaſures he recommended for the common good. Such was the purity of his motives, and the diſintereſtedneſs of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; ſo long had his fellow-citizens experienced his wiſdom, and fidelity to their intereſts, that he poſſeſſed their entire confidence. This however was not a blind credulity. He recommended his plans of operation with ſuch force of reaſon, and in ſuch an engaging manner, that all, who were open to conviction, were convinced of their ſound pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icy and ſtimulated to carry them into effect. We may ſafely challenge civil hiſtory to produce his equal. Where ſhall we find another, who, for ſo long a period, has filled ſuch various, important, and very difficult ſtations, with univerſal applauſe, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038564_0018_10126C8CEADBD510"/>
ended his career with equally well-earned honors? When compared with Alexander, Ceſar, and the mighty conquerors of the eaſt, he riſes far above them. They fought for dominion, to increaſe the number of their miſerable ſlaves. But WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON fought for PEACE, for the LIBERTY and INDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENDENCE of his country, and to promote the happineſs of mankind. They were the plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and butchers of the human race; he their ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efactor and friend. They were the enſlavers of <hi>their</hi> country, he was the SAVIOR of <hi>his.</hi> Conſidered in every point of view, we do not heſitate to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him one of the greateſt and beſt men the world ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>BUT, Oh, the frailty of human greatneſs! This firſt of men, the pride of America, the admiration of the world, the glory of human nature, muſt die like the reſt of mortals! Let us conſole ourſelves under this loſs, with the conſideration, that he has finiſhed his courſe with joy;—that he has changed Mount Vernon, for Mount Zion. Farewell, illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious Shade! Patron of liberty! We pay theſe funeral rites, theſe laſt, but juſt reſpects, to thy dear remains. Securely may thy precious duſt reſt in the ſilent tomb, till the trump of GOD ſhall rouſe the dead to judgment. Then may we meet thee again, and with thee be vindicated into the glorious liberties of the ſons of GOD.</p>
            <p>BUT, my mourning friends, ſhall we bury all our comforts in one grave? Have we nothing left to ſolace our grief and wipe away our tears? Bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038564_0019_10126C90AF9B4180"/>
be GOD we have many conſolations. We think too well of our preſent Rulers and of our fellow-citizens at large, to indulge the thought that when General WASHINGTON died, wiſdom, valor, and patriotiſm periſhed with him. He was indeed our firſt man, but not our whole depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Not a few of the PATRIOT ARMY, whoſe valor and military ſkill were equalled by few and exceeded by none, ſtill live, ready to riſe in the defence of their country. Many others, who were ſignally inſtrumental in bringing about our REV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OLUTION, ſtill remain diſpoſed to contribute their exertions to the common good. And although our worthy CHIEF is removed into darkneſs, yet he ſtill lives in his bright example and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent writings. By theſe, although dead he yet ſpeaketh, and tells us what we muſt do to ſave and build up our riſing republic. By theſe, we doubt not, many of the preſent and future generations will be made wiſer and better, and inſpired with patriotiſm and valor. Eſpecially, ſhould we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole ourſelves with the reflection, that the LORD GOD OMNIPOTENT reigneth. He hath ſignally protected us in times paſt, and we have abundant reaſon to repoſe our truſt in him. Conſider, my friends, what great things GOD has done for us. When, heretofore, worthy public characters have been taken from us by death; have not others been raiſed up to ſill their important ſtations? When a HANCOCK was removed, did not a SUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NER ſucceed? And now WASHINGTON is gone,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038564_0020_10126C9511C65E88"/>
does not ADAMS remain? His wiſdom, patriotiſm, and fidelity, in various public ſtations, for more than twenty years together, have raiſed his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter above the reach of ſlander, and juſtly endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to every enlightened American.</p>
            <p>WITH ſuch inſtances of God's goodneſs before our eyes, to diſtruſt his future care would be baſe ingratitude. Let us thank GOD and take courage. He that raiſed up a WASHINGTON for us at ſuch a critical juncture of our affairs, can do any thing for us; and he will do every thing we need, if our ways as a nation pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>LET us, therefore, ſtudy to improve in that righteouſneſs, which exalteth a nation. Let us cultivate love and unanimity, among ourſelves, remembering that united we ſtand; divided we fall. Let us encourage the hearts and ſtrengthen the hands of our Rulers. Our united confidence in their integrity and wiſdom will afford them the higheſt ſatisfaction, and they will be excited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to continue their exertions for the public good. And let us manifeſt our love for our country, and our reſpect for him, whoſe loſs we this day deplore, by imitating his virtues, and by laying up his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in our hearts. In his admirable LEGACY, we have the fruit of his long experience and moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reflections. It clearly points out to us the way to national ſafety and happineſs. And it richly deſerves to be treaſured up in the memory of every American.</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:038564_0021_10126C96A99E3878"/>
ABOVE all, let us cordially embrace and obey the goſpel of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. He hath ſet us a pattern of all holy living, and he hath taught us the words of eternal life. By living agreeably to the maxims of his religion, we ſhall find joy and conſolation; we ſhall have peace, in our death; we ſhall be good citizens, in this world; and, finally, we ſhall be made citizens of the New Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, where ſorrow and mourning ſhall never enter, and where, with the aſſembly of juſt men made perfect, we ſhall dwell forever at God's right hand.</p>
