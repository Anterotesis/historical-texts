            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is Impoſſible to ask a more <hi>Weighty Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>! It is Deplorable, that we hear it ask'd with no more Frequency, with no more Agony. The <hi>ſpirit of Slumber</hi> which the <hi>Poiſon</hi> of the <hi>Old Serpent</hi> has bro't upon the Children of men, is to be deplored Exceedingly. <hi>Awaken us out of this wonderful Stupidity, O God of all Grace, leſt we Periſh wonderfully!</hi>

The <hi>Goſpel</hi> which we have in our hands, tis a Goſpel of ſuch aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Myſtery,</hi> of ſuch Heavenly <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and of ſuch Conſummate <hi>Purity,</hi> that it can be no other than the <hi>Word of God</hi>; It muſt be of a <hi>Divine Original.</hi> Oh! highly Favoured People, who <hi>know</hi> this <hi>Joyful Sound</hi>! Oh! Unavoidably, &amp; Inexcuſably Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if we diſregard it!</p>
            <p>The Devils knew, That thoſe Excellent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Lord, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> were come to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi,</hi> with a Deſign to anſwer this <hi>Weighty Queſtion.</hi>

They could not bear it; they fear'd it would iſſue in a Deſtruction upon their <hi>Kingdom</hi> there. They ſtirr'd up the minds of ſome <hi>Wicked People,</hi> to Abuſe and Revile theſe Miniſters, and run them into Priſon. Some <hi>Wicked People</hi> were afraid, leſt they ſhould loſe a little <hi>Money,</hi> by the coming of ſuch Miniſters among them; and the <hi>Devils</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired thoſe Muckworms to uſe inceſſant Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, until they had made theſe Miniſters uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Preaching any more unto them. Our Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous LORD appeared for His Faithful Servants. They Glorified Him, in the midſt of their Trials. They <hi>Sang His Praiſes,</hi> under the <hi>Stripes</hi> &amp; the <hi>Stocks</hi> which the <hi>Satanic Party</hi> inflicted on them. Oh! Patient Servants of the Lord! What a ſymptom have you, that you ſhall one Day <hi>Reign in Glory</hi> with Him! <hi>Theſe Poor men</hi> Sang <hi>unto the Lord; the Lord heard them, and ſav'd them</hi>! A terrible <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake</hi> at Midnight ſhook open the <hi>Doors</hi> of their Priſon. The Keeper that had the now ſuperſeded <hi>Keyes</hi> of the Priſon, was terrified. In his Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he falls down at the Feet of his <hi>Priſoners</hi>; he treats them no longer as <hi>Priſoners,</hi> but rather as <hi>Angels.</hi> He fervently puts to them the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> which, Oh! that it were often heard with an equal Fervency among us! <hi>What muſt I do to be Saved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Learned men think, that the Gaoler had, from the Traditions of their Philoſophers, conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome <hi>Hope of a Better Life</hi>; and ſeeing his <hi>Life</hi> here in danger, he does, as Diſtreſs'd Wretches in the laſt minutes of their <hi>Life</hi> uſe to do, Cry out for ſome Help to make ſure of a <hi>Better Life.</hi> Or,

more probably, the late words of the Poſſeſſed Young Woman in the Town, about theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; <hi>Theſe men are the Servants of the moſt High God, who ſhew unto us the way of Salvation</hi>; might run in his mind, and mind him of <hi>that Salvation,</hi> and make him think, whether theſe men were not appointed of God for the Inſtruction of others, in the way to <hi>that Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a moſt important matter, which muſt now be undertaken to be Demonſtrated;
<q>That whereas there muſt be Something done, by every man that would be Saved, it ſhould be the Sollicitous Enquiry of every man, What muſt be done by him, that he may be Saved.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We will proceed upon the Awakening <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations</hi> of this thing; <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than any <hi>Thunderbolts.</hi> Oh! that the Iſſue might be, that the Hearers may be Awakened, with a mighty Impreſſion upon their Souls, to make the Enquiry, <hi>What muſt I do to be Saved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> You muſt Know, That there is a <hi>Great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> propoſed unto the ſinful Children of men; And you muſt Know, and Think, That there is nothing of ſo <hi>Great Concernment</hi> for any man, as to obtain a part in that <hi>Great Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, <hi>Knowlege</hi> is the firſt Thing, that is neceſſary in order to <hi>Salvation</hi>; And it is Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> Unſpeakably <hi>Neceſſary.</hi> We read, Hoſ. 4.6. of, <hi>People deſtroy'd for the lack of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:001975_0006_0FBA3A7CC8929868"/>
Ah! <hi>Destructive Ignorance</hi>; what ſhall be done, to chaſe thee out of the world! A world, which by thee is rendred a <hi>Dark World,</hi> the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Darkneſs</hi>! The Oracles of Wiſdom, have aſſured us; <hi>The Soul without Knowlege is not Good</hi>; They have Aſſured us; <hi>They who Know not God, ſhall have a Vengeance, in Flaming Fire, taken of them</hi>; They have aſſured us; <hi>Tis Life Eternal, to Know the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom He hath ſent.</hi> An <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is attended with a long Train of Unknown, but very Evil Conſequences. Tis the <hi>Goſpel of Salvation</hi>; They that are <hi>Ignorant</hi> of it, muſt needs miſs of <hi>Salvation.</hi> Tis an Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and Pernicious Principle, That a <hi>Man may be Saved in any Religion, if he do but Live according to it.</hi> The Unerring and Infallible Goſpel, has Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly taught us otherwiſe: 2 Cor. 4.3. <hi>If our Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel be hid, it is hid unto them that be Loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not unſeaſonable here, and as Early as may be, to bring in that Admonition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Knowlege, Knowlege</hi>; To get <hi>Good Knowlege,</hi> let that be the <hi>Firſt Care</hi> of them that would be <hi>Saved. Knowlege,</hi> Tis a <hi>Principal Thing</hi>; My Child, <hi>Get Knowlege</hi>; with all thy might, <hi>Get <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> Oh! That this <hi>Reſolution</hi> might immediately be made in the minds of all our People; <hi>I will get as much Knowlege as ever I can</hi>!</p>
            <p>The <hi>Word</hi> of God muſt be <hi>Read</hi> and <hi>Heard</hi> with Diligence, that ſo you may arrive to the <hi>Knowlege</hi> that is needful for you.</p>

of it, muſt be diligently Studied</p>
            <p>Unto all the other <hi>Means of Knowlege,</hi> there muſt be added, Humble and Earneſt <hi>Supplications</hi> before the Glorious LORD. You muſt <hi>Cry</hi> to God <hi>for Knowlege,</hi> and <hi>lift up your Voice</hi> to Him <hi>for Underſtanding</hi>; Prefer it before <hi>Silver,</hi> before any Earthly <hi>Treaſures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There may be ſome ſo very <hi>Ignorant,</hi> that they know not how to <hi>Pray.</hi> I would adviſe them, to take the <hi>Hundred and Nineteenth Pſalm.</hi> They will find in it, many a Prayer ſuited unto their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Take it, Uſe it, and particularly, thoſe Petitions in it; <hi>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy Statutes</hi>; and, <hi>Lord, Teach me Good Judgment &amp; Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi>; and, <hi>Lord, Give me <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, that I may know thy Teſtimonies: Give me <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and I ſhall Live.</hi> Take Encouragement from that word; and Plead it before the Lord: Jam. 1.5. <hi>If any of you lack Wiſdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men Liberally, and upbraideth not; and it ſhall be given him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, to purſue diverſe Ends at once, I am to tell you; That the <hi>Main Things</hi> which tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for you to Know, are the <hi>Things which concern Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More Particularly;</p>
            <p>You muſt Know, Firſt; <hi>From what</hi> you do need <hi>Salvation.</hi> And here;</p>
            <p>Firſt; You are to Know, That the <hi>One</hi> Eternal &amp; Infinite <hi>God,</hi> who Subſiſteth in <hi>Three Perſons</hi> (or Aſpects) which His Word calls, The <hi>Father</hi> &amp; the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>; Created our <hi>Firſt Parents,</hi>

Faith</hi> has <hi>other Errands</hi> unto the <hi>Saviour,</hi> beſides that of, <hi>A Deſire to be Juſtified.</hi> A <hi>true Believer</hi> will not count himſelf <hi>Saved,</hi> if he be not <hi>Sanctified,</hi> as well as <hi>Juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Saviour puts this Demand unto you; Mat. 20.32. <hi>What will ye that I ſhall do unto you?</hi> You Anſwer;
<q>O my Great SAVIOUR, I come unto thee, that by thy being my <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> &amp; my <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and my <hi>Advocate, Everliving to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for me,</hi> I may be <hi>Saved unto the Uttermoſt.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But this muſt not be <hi>All.</hi> There muſt be <hi>This</hi> in the Anſwer;
<q>O my <hi>Saviour,</hi> I come unto thee for <hi>Inſtruction</hi>: Let thy <hi>Spirit</hi> with thy <hi>Word,</hi> cauſe me to <hi>Know the Things of my Peace,</hi> and keep me from all <hi>Deluſions.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And there muſt be <hi>This</hi> in the Anſwer.
<q>O my <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>; I come unto thee for <hi>Government</hi>: Let thy <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> Conquer the <hi>Enmity</hi> of my Heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the things that are pleaſing to God; &amp; make me a Conqueror over all my <hi>ſpiritual Adverſaries.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is that <hi>Faith,</hi> whereof the <hi>End</hi> is <hi>the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul. Believe</hi> after this manner, and you <hi>Believe to the ſaving of the Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. But we may carry on the Anſwer, without being <hi>Reproved, for Adding any thing unto the Words

of God.</hi> A true <hi>Faith,</hi> will always have <hi>Repentance</hi> accompanying of it. <hi>Repentance unto Life</hi>; Tis a <hi>Dead Faith</hi> which cannot ſhow it; A <hi>Dead Soul</hi> that has it not. A <hi>Genuine Faith</hi> is always a <hi>Repenting Faith.</hi> We ſee the Two Siſters hand in hand; Act. 20.21. <hi>Repentance toward God, and Faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We conſtantly ſee it in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all the Faithful. Tis the Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Repentance</hi>; 2 Cor. 7.10. <hi>Repentance to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> It muſt be found in all the Candidates of <hi>Salvation.</hi> Well then;</p>
            <p>Firſt; <hi>This muſt be done</hi>; You muſt heartily and bitterly <hi>Bewayl</hi> all your <hi>Sins.</hi> Your <hi>Original Sin,</hi> your <hi>Actual Sin,</hi> the monſtrous <hi>Aggravation</hi> of your Sin; You muſt be <hi>Convinced</hi> of it. A <hi>Contrition</hi> muſt follow this <hi>Conviction</hi>; With a <hi>Broken Heart</hi> you muſt Cry out, Pſal. 38.18. <hi>I will declare my Iniquity, I will be ſorry for my Sin.</hi> You muſt <hi>Mourn</hi> for your <hi>Sin</hi>; and <hi>Mourn</hi> for the <hi>Offence</hi> given to <hi>God</hi> by your Sin as well as for the <hi>Miſchief</hi> done to your ſelves: <hi>Mourn, Mourn,</hi> and never count that you have <hi>Mourned</hi> Enough.</p>
            <p>Secondly; <hi>This muſt be done</hi>; You muſt make a Penitent <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of your <hi>Sins</hi>; a Remorſeful <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of them. All your <hi>Known Crimes,</hi> you muſt as <hi>Particularly</hi> as you can, Enumerate with ſhame and grief before the Lord. You muſt be able to ſay; Pſal. 51.3. <hi>I Acknowlege my Tranſgreſſions, and my Sin is ever before me.</hi> Your Acknowlegement of your <hi>Secret Sins,</hi> muſt be only to the LORD: But where your <hi>Sins</hi> are <hi>Known,</hi> where your <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi> have been either <hi>Sufferers</hi> by, or <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of

your Miſcarriages, They alſo ſhould <hi>Know</hi> that you Acknowlege them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; <hi>This muſt be done</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Every <hi>way of Sin</hi> muſt be <hi>Abhorred,</hi> muſt be <hi>Avoided,</hi> muſt be <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken. Amendment</hi> is Eſſential to <hi>Repentance</hi>: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you <hi>Reform,</hi> you don't <hi>Repent.</hi> So you are warned of God; Prov. 28 13. <hi>He that Confeſſeth and Forſaketh ſhall find Mercy.</hi> If you go on in any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>way of Sin,</hi> you will find it a <hi>Way of Death,</hi> a <hi>Path of the Deſtroyer</hi>; it will bring to a <hi>Damnation that ſlumbreth not.</hi> Very Tremendous Things will be done to thoſe <hi>Enemies</hi> of God, who, <hi>Go on ſtill in their Treſpaſſes.</hi> Have you done Amiſs? You muſt ſay, <hi>I will do ſo no more.</hi> You muſt not <hi>Perſiſt</hi> in what you have done.</p>
            <p>And hence, If you have <hi>Wrong'd</hi> another man in what you have done, you muſt Vigorouſly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour all poſſible RESTITUTION. <hi>Reſtitution,</hi> a Thing too little Underſtood, too little Exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, too little Practiſed; <hi>Reſtitution,</hi> without which there can be no Right <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is found in every True <hi>Believer</hi>; It muſt be found in every one that would be <hi>Saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. And, <hi>Holineſs, Holineſs</hi>; A <hi>Patient Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Well-doing.</hi> There is no <hi>Life</hi> in the <hi>Faith,</hi> which is not Productive of an <hi>Holy Life</hi>; Tis not a <hi>Faith,</hi> which will bring to <hi>Everlaſting Life.</hi> If the <hi>Grace</hi> to Believe on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, be infuſed into the Soul, the <hi>Habit</hi> of every <hi>other Grace</hi> is at the ſame Inſtant infuſed.

the <hi>Motto</hi> on the Golden Gates of the <hi>Holy City</hi>; Heb. 12.14 <hi>Without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> An <hi>Holy Life,</hi> a Life preſſing after Univerſal and Perpetual Conformity to the <hi>Rules of Holineſs</hi>; This, This is the Royal <hi>Path</hi> leading to <hi>Salvation</hi>; Yea, tis no little <hi>Part</hi> of our <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, <hi>This muſt be done</hi>; You muſt <hi>Reſign</hi> your ſelves up unto the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of the Lord; Conſent, Requeſt, Entreat, That He would Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally take <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of you. From the Duſt, Cry unto Him; Pſal. 141.10. <hi>Thou art my God; Thy Spirit is Good; Lead me unto the Land of Rectitude.</hi> Cry unto Him;
<q>O SPIRIT of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> Raiſe me out of the <hi>Ruines</hi> that my Sin has brought upon me. <hi>Poſſeſs</hi> me for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cauſe me to Fear <hi>God,</hi> and Love <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Hate <hi>Sin,</hi> and Sleight <hi>this world,</hi> and know <hi>my ſelf,</hi> and make me <hi>meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light:</hi> Bring me to be one of <hi>Them,</hi> I Pray thee, I Pray thee!</q>
There is a Good <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> laid in this <hi>Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then; <hi>This muſt be done</hi>; You muſt <hi>Livelily</hi> purſue the <hi>Death of every Sin.</hi> You muſt fly to the <hi>Death</hi> of your <hi>Saviour,</hi> as the <hi>Purchaſe</hi> and the <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi> of ſo Great a <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> But you muſt count it a very Great <hi>Bleſſing</hi>; Count no <hi>Trouble</hi> too much to be undergone, that you may come at ſuch a <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> This is that <hi>Holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This muſt be done</hi>; You muſt ſet before your ſelves the <hi>Example</hi> of your <hi>Saviour</hi>; Study <hi>how He was in the world</hi>; Study <hi>to walk as He walked</hi>;

mightily Delight in every ſtroke of <hi>Reſemblance</hi> unto Him; Yea, tho' it be in <hi>Sufferings</hi> that you <hi>Reſemble</hi> Him. This is that <hi>Holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

This is that <hi>Holineſs without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This muſt be done</hi>; You muſt Remember, That the <hi>Eye</hi> of the Omnipreſent GOD is upon you. You muſt often bring this to Remembrance, <hi>God ſees me, hears me, knows me, is acquainted with all my ways.</hi> A ſenſe of your being under the <hi>Notice</hi> of God, and of the <hi>Account</hi> unto which you ſhall be called by God, muſt make you <hi>Afraid</hi> of incurring His Diſpleaſure; <hi>Afraid,</hi> even of <hi>Secret Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</hi> This is that <hi>Holineſs without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This muſt be done</hi>; You muſt make it your <hi>Exerciſe</hi> to keep a <hi>Conſcience clear of Offence towards God, and towards Man.</hi> You muſt labour to be acquainted with your <hi>whole Duty</hi>; And your <hi>Acquaintance</hi> with the Will of God, muſt be follow'd with proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Deſires and Labours after <hi>Obedience</hi> to it. You muſt <hi>Pray always,</hi> with <hi>all Prayer</hi>; with <hi>Secret

Prayer,</hi> with <hi>Houſhold Prayer,</hi> with <hi>Publick Prayer</hi>: You muſt have an high Value for thoſe <hi>Two Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi>; the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper</hi> of the Lord. You muſt Religiouſly Obſerve the <hi>Lords Day.</hi> You muſt preſerve your own <hi>Place,</hi> &amp; <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Bed,</hi> and <hi>Wealth,</hi> and <hi>Name</hi>; You muſt with the ſame ſincerity befriend your <hi>Neighbours</hi> alſo in <hi>Theirs: Love your Neighbours as your ſelves.</hi> And, <hi>Do as you would be done unto.</hi> You muſt be eſpecially and mightily Conſcientious of <hi>Relative Chriſtianity</hi>: Carry it well in all the <hi>Relations,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord has placed you, whether <hi>Superiors,</hi> or <hi>Inferiors,</hi> or <hi>Equals</hi>: with ſuch a Carriage, as may adorn the <hi>Doctrine of God your Saviour</hi>; Such a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as may render your <hi>Correlates</hi> the better for you.

            </p>
            <p>Methinks, A moſt Obvious <hi>Inference</hi> may be drawn from theſe Things; That the <hi>Miniſtry of the Goſpel</hi> muſt be Attended, and not Neglected, by them who would not <hi>Neglect the Great Salvation</hi>; A moſt awful <hi>Inference,</hi> That it is a Dangerous Thing to Live without the <hi>Means of Salvation,</hi> which are in the <hi>Miniſtry of the Goſpel;</hi> ordinarily to be met withal. The <hi>Wells of Salvation</hi> are kept open in ſuch a <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> Oh!

of the world: An <hi>Order</hi> of men concerning whom our Glorious Lord has promiſed, Mat. 28.20. <hi>Lo, I am with you, always to the End of the world.</hi> If an <hi>Angel</hi> ſhould come from Heaven unto you, as unto <hi>Cornelius</hi> once, to ſpeak unto this Queſtion, <hi>What muſt I do to be Saved?</hi> He would unqueſtionably ſay, <hi>Repair to ſuch a Miniſtry; Don't think to live without it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have ſettled the Point; Without <hi>Faith</hi> we can have no <hi>Salvation.</hi> But I aſſume; Rom. 10.14, 17. <hi>How ſhall they Believe in Him of whom they have not heard?

            <p>Your <hi>Queſtion</hi> is Anſwered. O Souls in Peril, I may now ſay unto you; 1 Cor. 15.2. <hi>You are Saved, if you keep in memory what I have Preached unto you.</hi> And yet I muſt ſay unto you, That if after all, you Trample upon theſe things, it will be <hi>Good for you, that you had never been born</hi>; the very mention of them will dreadfully increaſe &amp; inflame your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.

And, <hi>O Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Do thou Mercifully Look down upon the Soul that has heard theſe things; Diſpoſe and Aſſiſt that Soul, to do thoſe Good Things, upon which thou haſt Promiſed the Salvation of the Soul; I Pray thee, I Pray thee!</hi>
