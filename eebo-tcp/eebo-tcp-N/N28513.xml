            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>And Eliſha ſaw it, and he cried, my Father, my Father! the Chariot of Iſrael, and the Horſe-men thereof. And he ſaw him no more; and he took hold of his own Clothes and rent them in two pieces.</hi>

            <p>MY FATHER, MY FATHER! <hi>The Chariot of Iſrael, and the Horſe-men thereof:</hi>—This is the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic cry of Eliſha, on the removal of Elijah from his head, by a whirlwind into heaven, never more to be ſeen! He very ſenſibly felt the loſs; he bitterly lamented it, by expreſſions and actions, indicating great agitation of mind; and the deepeſt ſorrow of heart: He lift up his voice and wept: He took hold of his clothes, and rent them in pieces; intimating, the ſincerity of his affection to his departed friend; the affliction of his bleeding heart at the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful event.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Father, my Father!</hi> The words experts the light in which he viewed him, as ſtanding in the relation of a kind and tender <hi>Father,</hi> who had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to his inſtruction, protection, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. The repetition of the terms, <hi>my Father, my Father!</hi> ſhews the fullneſs of his heart; his <hi>delight,</hi>

his <hi>melancholy delight</hi> in uſing the name, <hi>my Father, my dear Father,</hi> is no more!</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chariot of Iſrael,</hi> and the <hi>Horſe-men</hi> thereof. What an encomium is this, upon Elijah, as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic bleſſing? Chariots and Horſe-men were uſed as means in defence of the country: Elijah is here conſidered as equal to all the armies of Iſrael; to their Chariots and Horſe-men prepared for war, in reſpect to his influence and beneficence; and Eliſha laments that this, the glory and defence of Iſrael, was departed; is extremely affected at the public loſs, ſuſtained by ſuch a ſerious, melancholy Providence.</p>
            <p>Theſe words may ſerve to ſuggeſt ſome thoughts, and excite ſentiments and affections in our hearts, proper to be cheriſhed on the preſent occaſion for which they are choſen,<abbr>viz.</abbr> To improve the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of GOD in the removal of GEORGE WASHINGTON by death. Who, has been a <hi>Father</hi> and friend to our country; and who, in the important ſtations he filled as Preſident and General, was as the Chariots and Horſe-men of our Iſrael; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental as our political ſaviour.</p>
            <p>The Lord JEHOVAH muſt be acknowledged as the ſupreme Governor among the nations; to uſe ſuch means as he pleaſeth to plant and build them up; and it becomes us to take notice of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his hands; to notice the inſtruments he raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, and bleſſeth for the good of his people; to give honor, to whom honor is due, and alſo, ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to regret the loſs of ſuch, as have been Fathers and Benefactors to us.</p>

            <p>Theſe propoſitions, if largely diſcuſſed, would open an extenſive field for meditations, and lead me to further reflections upon the interpoſition of heaven in our behalf heretofore, than I have time at preſent to make; and, to give a minute detail of the character of our late beloved Preſident and General, which may be more proper for an hiſtorian to deſcribe, than for the preacher to relate.</p>
            <p>But let us attend to ſome general thoughts that ariſe from the obſervations made on the text.</p>
            <p>I. Conſider the goodneſs of GOD to his people, in appearing for them under national troubles, and raiſing up men of diſtinguiſhed abilities and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, to be public bleſſings.</p>
            <p>In this caſe, Elijah was raiſed up to be a ſpecial bleſſing to the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> tribes of Iſrael: He acted indeed <hi>principally</hi> in the eccleſiaſtical line, as a prophet of the LORD, to inſtruct and reform the people: but in this way he entered upon the moſt direct method to become a benefactor; for righteouſneſs exalteth a nation; and in righteouſneſs alone, ſhall it be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. And we find him giving moſt ſalutary counſel to kings, how to conduct for the peace and happineſs of the country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:037989_0006_100F6FDB1A21AE98"/>
It was in a time of affliction, of great diſtreſs among the people, when GOD raiſed him up to be an eminent bleſſing to them. For, after the ten tribes had broken off from the houſe of David; their kings, for political reaſons, ſeduced the people, and reſtrained them from attending the ſtated wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of GOD at Jeruſalem; whereupon they fell into idolatry. This provoked the LORD to expoſe them to the will of their enemies, who grievouſly oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them.</p>
            <p>If we look back from this period to preceding ages of the Jewiſh Nation, we ſhall find their hiſtory will furniſh us with many inſtances of the LORD'S appearing for their deliverance, when reduced to extremities. Preſently after their ſettlement in the promiſed land, their enemies deviſed againſt them, to deprive them of their privileges, to rob them of the fruits of their labor, and make ſlaves of them; but when they cried unto the Lord, he had pity on them: He raiſed up and qualified with eminent talents, thoſe who reſcued them and wrought great ſalvation; Men to be Judges, Counsellors and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of Armies.</p>
            <p>The book of Judges contains an hiſtory of diverſe inſtances of this kind, which is worthy peruſing at this time, that our reflections may excite pious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of ſoul, to that God, who is ſo gracious in interpoſing, to redreſs the grievances of his people.</p>
            <p>A very memorable inſtance on ſacred record, is that of David's being raiſed from keeping ſheep, to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037989_0007_100F6FDE018753B0"/>
be the head of the ſtates or tribes of Iſrael. The nation at this period, was in the utmoſt diſtreſs and affliction. The government was diſſolved, or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the moſt arbitrary, tyrannical manner. Civil war among themſelves; the enemy entering into the heart of the country. Without were fightings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were fears, and great perplexities. David appeared by the appointment of God; and meeting the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages of the people: the enemy from abroad was ſubdued; Peace reſtored at home; the union of the tribes cordially affected and cemented; the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed and ſecured, and a foundation laid for the moſt flouriſhing kingdom and happy people, in the next reign, that can be found in the annals of hiſtory.</p>
            <p>And have not we experienced, are not we living witneſſes of the great goodneſs of GOD to us, as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in raiſing up for us, in time of extremity, a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer,</hi> in the perſon of GEORGE WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, our late beloved <hi>Preſident and General?</hi> Though many have done worthily, and have hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or from their fellow-citizens; yet none, I truſt, will think we mean to derogate from them, when we ſay he hath excelled them all: conſidering the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſtations he ſo illuſtriouſly filled for the public good.</p>
            <p>The Father of the ſpirits of all fleſh brought him upon the ſtage of action, and gave him to this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when there was ſpecial need of his aid and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The extremity and diſtreſſes of the country at
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037989_0008_100F6FE1628ADD70"/>
that period, are ſo recent, that they cannot be effac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from our minds, and therefore I need not at preſent recapitulate them. Only to inſtance, that our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were abridged and privileges wreſted from our hands; our dear earned property ſiezed and plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; our lives threatned; yea many of our friends and countrymen ſlain by the ſword! in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, when our eyes were unto the LORD of heaven and earth; he ſent forth a <hi>deliverer,</hi> furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with abilities for the important ſervices deſigned in providence. As he had a large field to act in, many difficulties to encounter, and hardſhips to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was bleſt with a capacious mind; accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate judgment, to diſcern men and things; an happy talent at diction; princely dignity of ſoul; great fortitude, tempered with moderation, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion and meekneſs; with unwearied patience and perſeverance, fitted to preſide in council to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantage; and lead forth an hoſt againſt the enemy with happy ſucceſs. Being choſen of GOD and man to be the ſaviour of his country, he was endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with accompliſhments, through the ſmiles of heaven, to obtain the important object. Scarce ever perhaps, ſo many eminent gifts and talents, entered into the character of one perſon, as in General WASHINGTON. Such majeſty and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! which fitted him to perform great and illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious deeds with honor; and the common actions of life, with ſo much affability and eaſe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering his tenderneſs and affection for the people; and benefactions to the country: with what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety

may we adopt the language of my text? <hi>My Father my Father! the Chariot of Iſrael and the Horſe-men thereof.</hi> As a Father, he engaged without ſtipend or reward, only a bare ſupport of his houſe-hold, to act as <hi>General</hi> of the united forces of <hi>Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica</hi> againſt the enemy. What pure diſintereſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence prompted and animated him to undertake in ſuch an important department; and indure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible hardſhips and ſevereſt trials, with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing patience almoſt of a chriſtian Martyr?<note n="*" place="bottom">Of this condeſcenſion and parental affection to ſuch as are in the lower walks of life, I was witneſs to a very delicate inſtance. Riding into a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous town in the midſt of thouſands, who received him with the greateſt cordiality and joy:—He alighted at the place of his lodgings, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately went forth to a gate fronting the main-ſtreet, to attend a proceſſion of youth, members of the ſeveral ſchools: Who were arranged in diviſions, preceded by their reſpective Inſtructors.

            <p>It may be further worthy remarking the goodneſs of GOD; and in honor to him whom he raiſed up in our behalf; that he was not atheiſtical or deiſtical in his principles, to influence the people to forſake the worſhip of the true GOD; like Jeroboam, who headed the ſeperation from the arbitrary King of Judah. But he ſhewed a profound reverence for the Deity, a regard for the divine oracles, and the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of holy worſhip, and earneſtly recommended us by repeated proclamations, humbly to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our dependence on the care and bleſſing of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for all deſired proſperity and happineſs.

To this religion, the GREAT WASHINGTON ſubſcribed, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly recommended to the people in his affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate farewell Addreſs, when he retired from public, to private life! and yet ſome of an inferior rank, glory in their infidelity, as though wiſdom muſt live and die with them.</p>
            <p>But WASHINGTON is no more!</p>
            <p>This great and illuſtrious perſonage is withdawn from this theatre of action to receive, we truſt, a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reward in heaven. But though taken from our ſight, affectionate thoughts of him are not eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from our minds. His memory is deeply record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the grateful hearts of <hi>millions.</hi> His illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous achievements, his eminent ſervices are immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talized, they are imprinted in indelible characters, to be read and known of all; to be conveyed down from parents to children, to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>What thankfulneſs, does it become us to cheriſh in our hearts to the bleſſed GOD, for raiſing up ſo
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037989_0011_100F6FE82A5AF8C8"/>
ſeaſonably for us, ſuch a public benefactor? and ſhould not we be deeply impreſſed at the ſame time with unfeigned grief at the loſs of ſo great a bleſſing?</p>
            <p>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away! let us ſubſcribe, bleſſed be the name of the Lord: and ſay, that he is holy and righteous in ſo doing; humbly ſubmiting to the rebuke of providence.</p>
            <p>Let us not deſpiſe the chaſtening of the Lord, nor faint under his corrections; but make thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, which become us as men and chriſtians.</p>
            <p>II. We ought to take ſerious notice of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the removal of eminent benefactors by death, and regret the loſs of them.</p>
            <p>It is true they are but men, and like men they die; agreeably to the ſentence paſſed upon all the human race: yet, as the gift of ſuch men is a great bleſſing; the removal of them is a frown of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. There is ſo much virtue taken from the earth, that cannot well be ſpared; there is ſuch an uſeful example removed from our eyes, which is needed to ſtimulate ſurvivors. And though the chief deſign of their being raiſed up, may be anſwered; yet in their retirement, their counſels and prayers might be beneficial: in their removal, ſo much of our glory is departed; ſo much of our defence taken away, and proportionably we are left feeble and expoſed.</p>
            <p>Nature dictates, ſcripture precepts and examples confirm the ſentiment, that the loſs of our fathers
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037989_0012_100F6FEA970C5C30"/>
and public benefactors, ſhould be ſeriouſly noticed and lamented by ſurvivors.</p>
            <p>As natural affections prompt to mourn the loſs of dear kindred; painfully to lament the vacancy left in the heart; ſo ſocial affections and ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>as ariſe from benefits received, will excite ſymphathetic ſenſations in the grateful ſoul.</p>
            <p>Gratitude and due reſpect to the living will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the dead. Thoſe tender feelings of ſoul will be ſenſibly touched; and ſprings of ſorrow burſt forth in correſpondent expreſſions. Ingratitude is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the baſeſt kind, a bitter root of iniquity ſuperlatively great! When there aroſe a King in Egypt that knew not <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who had been the father of the country, and the greateſt benefactor the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ever enjoyed; the moſt barbarous plan was laid, and executed in part, that could enter the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved heart of man, to conceive of. But gratitude and eſteem for worthy deeds, and worthy characters, call forth to view whatever has a tendency to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm their memories, and convey their names down to poſterity with ſweet perfume. Thus <hi>David</hi> felt for his dear friend deceaſed. "I am diſtreſſed for thee, my brother <hi>Jonathan;</hi> very pleaſant haſt thou been unto me."<note n="*" place="bottom">II. Samuel, 1. 26.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As nature dictates and invites to mourn on ſuch occaſions, ſo ſcripture teaches the propriety, and gives inſtances of ſeriouſly noticing ſuch ſcenes. The ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> mourned at his death with a great and fore
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037989_0013_100F6FEF05C80E88"/>
lamentation, inſomuch that the neighboring nations took notice of it as a <hi>grievous</hi> mourning. When <hi>Moſes</hi> died, the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> held thirty days mourning at the affecting providence. "All <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> mourned for <hi>Joſiah,"</hi> at his deceaſe. "And <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the prophet lamented him." He penned a funeral dirge on the occaſion: "And all the ſinging men, and ſinging women, ſpake of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> in their lamentations, and made them an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in <hi>Iſrael;"</hi> behold, "they are written in the Lamentations."</p>
            <p>To weep, is human; is chriſtian; is GODLIKE. "JESUS wept." It evidences a tender heart, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with pious and virtuous affections. It is an honor to a people to expreſs a ſenſe of their loſs of great benefactors in ſolemn mourning. It ſhews that they are not barbarous and uncivilized; but enlightened, well informed, benevolent, virtuous. It will get them a name and praiſe in the world. And when ſincerely done, will meet the approbation of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Decent mourning for the loſs of worthy charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, is ſanctioned by divine authority; and tho' it no way affects the dead, it may benefit the living. In cheriſhing pious reflections on the Providence, their melting hearts are made more ſuſceptible of divine impreſſions, in exciting humbleneſs of mind, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious meditations on their own frailty.</p>
            <p>If great men, and the mighty are fallen, ſurely then may we ſay, men of low degree are vanity, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037989_0014_100F6FF1E5B1D760"/>
muſt be laid in the duſt; alſo in attending ſuch ſcenes, it may ſerve to call off our dependence from the creature, the moſt exalted; and place our truſt in GOD, who, only hath immortality. "Put not your truſt in Princes, nor in the ſon of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts periſh. Happy is he that hath the GOD of <hi>Jacob</hi> for his help; whoſe hope is in the LORD his GOD."<note n="*" place="bottom">146 Pſalm, 3, 4, 5.</note> Again further, in reflecting upon the reſpect ſhewn to worthy characters, and who have deſerved well of their country, it may ſtimulate ſurvivors to worthy deeds themſelves, to go and do likewiſe. To be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced principally by the praiſe of men, is too ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, and dangerous; yet, a proper degree is ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, and may not be hurtful or enſnaring; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a ſenſe of duty, and the honor that cometh from GOD only be uppermoſt in the heart.</p>
            <p>As the eye affects the heart, funeral proceſſions, and outward forms of mourning, may ſerve to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite tender feelings in the ſoul. A ſort of mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal influence will ariſe from aſſociating with mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and viewing their faces bedewed with unfeigned tears. We <hi>ſhall</hi> weep, with thoſe that weep. Hence, ſuch impreſſions will be made, as cannot be eaſily effaced from the mind, and will tend to excite ſerious reflections, that may be very uſeful in future life.</p>
            <p>We honor our deceaſed friends, when we imitate their virtues, and follow them ſo far as they followed CHRIST our divine Redeemer. In this, we ſhew
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037989_0015_100F6FF367935518"/>
greater reſpect to their memories and eſteem for their merits; than by repeated lamentations, clothed in ſackcloth, and ſhedding tears on their graves.—Though dead, yet ſpeaking, they cry; whatſoever things are true, honeſt, juſt and pure; whatſoever things are lovely, and of good report; if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny virtue, if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things. Similar to this, our father and friend WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, when living, counſelled us, and exemplified in his conduct. Among all the honors ſhewn him at his deceaſe, ſhall we deny him that which is the greateſt of all? Will we refuſe to imitate his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; his piety, his benevolence, and his public ſpirit.</p>
            <p>In commemorating the loſs of great and uſeful men, ſuch as the late beloved General WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON; while we give honor to whom honor is due, we are better inſtructed, than to uſe ſervile adulation, like ſlaves, who live on the breath of their Lords; or like the heathen, who deified their heroes and revered them as Gods. Doubtleſs many of the heathen gods originated from the people, extolling the characters of their generals and emperors to an exceſſive height, and placing them above the ſtars.</p>
            <p>But our religion teaches us, that there is but one GOD, ſupreme over all. That all gifts and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments are derived from him; and thoſe who are furniſhed with them, ſhould be honored for God's ſake, whoſe ſervants they are; ſhould be hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored for their <hi>own</hi> ſakes, when improving and uſing

their talents well; and the remov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> of them by death, ſhould be ſincerely lamented for <hi>our own</hi> ſakes, that we are deprived of ſo great a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>"A Prince and great man is fallen this day," in our Iſrael. "The LORD hath taken away the mighty man, and the man of war, and the Judge, and the prudent and antient. But let us not mourn as thoſe that have no hope; but truſt in the LORD who hath the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to preſide and rule over us, as ſhall fear GOD and work righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>As the ſons of the Prophets ſaid, "the ſpirit of <hi>Elijah</hi> doth reſt on <hi>Eliſha."</hi> Thanks be to GOD, that ſuch an happy portion of the ſpirit of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed <hi>General,</hi> and late <hi>Preſident,</hi> doth reſt on his ſucceſſor, who is now the ſupreme magiſtrate of the <hi>Union.</hi> The LORD bleſs him!</p>
            <p>Though we are bereaved of one who was a <hi>Father</hi> to the country, and many years our political head, yet our GOD liveth, and bleſſed be his name. Let us by a pious conduct ſecure his favor and bleſſing. Our Redeemer liveth forever more. Let us ſubmit to him as the Captain of our Salvation; as the Leader and Commander of the People. Let us be <hi>his</hi> pious, humble, and peaceable ſubjects; who is the Prince of peace. Let us be good ſoldiers of JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST; fight under his banner the good fight of faith; then he will lead us on to Glory; where death will be ſwallowed up in victory; immortal honors crown our Heads, and ineffable felicity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice our Hearts.</p>
