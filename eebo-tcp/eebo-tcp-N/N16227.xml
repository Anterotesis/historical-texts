            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE have now the honour to submit to the consideration of the United States in Congress assembled, that constitution which has appeared to us the most adviseable. The friends of our Country have long seen and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, that the power of making war, peace and treaties, that of levying money and regulating commerce, and the correspondent Executive and Judicial authorities, should be fully and effectually vested in the general government of the Union; but the impropriety of delegating such extensive trusts to one body of men is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent—Hence results the necessity of a different organization.</p>
            <p>IT is obviously impracticable in the federal government of these States, to secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each, and yet provide for the interest and safety of all—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals entering into society, must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest. The magnitude of the sacrifice must depend as well on situation and circumstance, as on the object to be obtained. It is at all times difficult to draw with precision the line between those rights which must be surrendered, and those which may be reserved; and on the present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion this difficulty was encreased by a difference among the several States as to their situation, extent, habits, and particular interests.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:020801_0027_0FB0FBD3EF15B218"/>IN all our deliberations on this subject, we kept steadily in our view, that which appears to us the greatest interest of every true Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, the consolidation of our Union, in which is involved our prosperity, felicity, safety, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps our national existence. This important consideration, seriously and deeply impressed on our minds, led each State in the Convention to be less rigid on points of inferiour magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude than might have been otherwise expected; and thus the Constitution which we now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, is the result of a spirit of amity, and of that mutual deference and concession which the peculiarity of our political situation render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indispensible.</p>
            <p>THAT it will meet the full and entire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of every State is not, perhaps, to be expected; but each will doubtless consider, that had her interests been alone consulted, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences might have been particularly disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or injurious to others; that it is liable to as few axceptions as could reasonably have been expected, we hope and believe; that it may promote the lasting welfare of that country so dear to us all, and secure her freedom and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, is our most ardent wish.</p>
