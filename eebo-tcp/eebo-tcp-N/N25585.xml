            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE</hi> Editor is happy that after having taken great pains, and having ſpared neither trouble nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, he is able to preſent his friends and the public with the largeſt and (he believes) the beſt collection of ſongs ever pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in this country.</p>
            <p>As it frequently happens that collections of this kind abound with ribaldry and indecency, the greateſt attention has been paid, that nothing of that tendency ſhould he admitted into this ſelection, ſo that the cautious parent, friend or preceptor may preſent this book as an agreeable companion to the ſocial mind.</p>
            <p>In the Maſonic collection he has been able by the help of a variety of books and the kind aſſiſtance of friends, to form what he hopes will prove an agreeable companion to his brethren in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; he aſſures them that he has taken great care in ſelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that none but ſuch as are genuine ſhould be admitted. He has taken the liberty of adding at the end of the volume, the celebrated and much admired tale of <hi>"Monſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>And at toſſing a pancake was always ſo handy,</l>
                  <l>That my grand-daddy took her to better his fame,</l>

                  <l>King told her, ſhe muſt fetch her maſter down,</l>
                  <l>A chaiſe was ready, he was leaving town,</l>

                  <l>Thus urg'd, ſhe went the ſnoring man to call,</l>
                  <l>And long indeed was ſhe oblig'd to ball;</l>
                  <l>Ere ſhe could rouſe the torpid lump of clay,</l>
                  <l>At laſt he wakes, he riſes, and he ſwears,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>The Frenchman now perceiv'd 'twas all in vain</l>
                  <l>To this tormentor mildly to complain,</l>
                  <l>And ſtrait in rage began his creſt to rear—</l>

                  <l>In ſhort our hero, with the ſame intent,</l>

                  <l>So fond of miſchief was this wicked wit:</l>
                  <l>They threw out water, for the watch they call,</l>
                  <l>But King expecting, ſtill eſcapes them all;</l>

                  <l>And the ſame night, as former freaks ariſe,</l>
                  <l>He fain muſt ſtroll the well-known haunt to trace,</l>
