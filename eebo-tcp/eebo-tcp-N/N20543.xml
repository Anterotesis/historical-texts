            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THOUGHTS ON THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.</head>
            <p>RELIGION, in ſome form or other, ſeems to have been obſerved by mankind, in all ages and all parts of the world; and conſidered as the moſt noble employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the moſt divine nature, and producing the moſt beneſicial effects to ſociety, of all the objects that ever engaged their attention: although from caſual circumſtances, and intereſted motives of individuals, there are as many modes and varieties of worſhip, as languages or nations on the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>Europeans have in general embraced chriſtianity, as contained in the bible, which <hi>they</hi> call the Word of God, as the only true and infallible ſyſtem on earth, and which only can lead us to eternal happineſs. This bible, we have been taught to believe, is holy, juſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and ſuperior to the human underſtanding; ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, that to doubt or diſbelieve it, would entail on us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable never-ending miſery. This doctrine, being inſtilled into children by their nurſes; and enforced by terror at a riper age, has long been aſſented to by the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026954_0004_0FD2942F2B9712A8"/>
               <hi>generality of people,</hi> who ſeldom think or inquire for themſelves, but are always more or leſs the dupes of deſigning men.</p>
            <p>But the times are now changing; the privilege of reaſoning and believing for ourſelves, begins to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed—freedom of enquiry abounds; and the natural inherent right of ſpeaking and acting according to the dictates of our own conſcience (without injuring ſociety) is happily enjoyed. Conſequently, impoſitions of every kind, ſuperſtitious prejudices, and the long worſhipped ſabrics of civil and religious tyranny, are daily grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into contempt, and in all probability will ſoon be corn from their foundations, and conſigned to that infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous oblivion which they ſo highly merit.</p>
            <p>To come more immediately to the point—the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion, as generally practiſed, preſents itſelf as one of thoſe monuments of ignorance and credulity, which the wiſdom of the preſent generation is probably deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to overthrow, and to ſubſtitute a ſyſtem more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, more pure, and more agreeable to the dictates of reaſon. The bible, upon examination, we ſhall find de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in many of the virtues that have been aſcribed to it. As a human compoſition, its merits have been greatly over-rated: it is exceeded in ſentiment, inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtile, and every other literary qualification. The obſcurity, incredibility and obſcenity, ſo conſpicuous in many parts of it, would juſtly condemn the works of a modern writer. It contains a mixture of inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and contradiction; to call which the <hi>word of God,</hi> is the higheſt pitch of extravagance: it is to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Deity that which any perſon of common ſenſe would bluſh to confeſs himſelf the author of.</p>

How are the rights and dignity of human nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſulted, degraded, and trampled upon! how are mankind blinded, deceived, and led away by this ſyſtem! how is the honor and character of the Almighty affronted by the abſurd and impious doctrines it contains! how is the ſacred name of God abuſed and proſtituted to the vileſt and moſt execrable purpoſes, by his pretended worſhippers! and all for one ſimple, evident end, to gratify the pride and avarice of unprincipled, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men!</p>
            <p>But ſomething more than declamation is neceſſary to ſupport theſe aſſertions. I ſhall therefore give the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why I diſbelieve the chriſtian ſyſtem, and all the arguments advanced in its favor.</p>
            <p>As to the exiſting proofs of the divine authority of the bible, whether internal or external, whether the evidence we feel in our own minds on examming it, or the miracles which are ſaid to have attended its propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, they are of no avail in convincing us of its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine origin: And I do not think, that independent of the prejudices of education, and the power of eloquence, there ever was a reaſonable thinking man, who felt a ſufficient internal evidence to convince him of the reality of the whole of its doctrines.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the public proofs exhibited by its founders, we find them no ſtronger than thoſe in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Mahometaniſm, or perhaps any other ſyſtem. Mahomet is ſaid to have wrought as many miracles, preached as good doctrine, converted ten times as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny followers, and was far more ſucceſsful in all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, however bold or difficult, than Jeſus Chriſt. The chriſtians ſay, the Mahometan miracles were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but impoſtures; and the Mahometans ſay, with
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026954_0006_0FD294355FA7E5A8"/>as much authority, that the chriſtian miracles were the time.</p>
            <p>If the goſpel ſyſtem was ſo clear, ſo reaſonable, and ſo powerful, as its advocates aſſert, what neceſſity could there have been for miracles to ſupport it? If it had any foundation in reaſon and nature, there would have been no occaſion for myſtery, miracle or revelation, to confirm it. A doctrine that is reaſonable and true, will appear ſo to every unprejudiced mind, without the aid of any thing ſupernatural. Conſequently, that ſyſtem which requires miraculous aſſiſtance to eſtabliſh it, and cannot be proved by human means, is neither reaſonable nor true.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing the bible to have been written by divine inſpiration, at the times, and by the perſons mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, ſtill it is next to impoſſible, that it could have been tranſmitted down to the preſent time pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contaminated, even if there had been but one nation and one language upon earth. The variety of tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and editions it has paſſed through in the courſe of near eighteen hundred years, if it has exiſted ſo long, (which I am inclined to diſbelieve of many parts) and the continual improvements and alterations in human language, during that period, amount to a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proof that the ſenſe has been unavoidably miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, or wilfully perverted. A confirmation of this remark is open to all: Let any one take the trouble of comparing different cop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of the bible, printed in the laſt and preſent centuries, or even in the ſame year, and he will often find a ſtriking diſagreement.</p>
            <p>Admitting that the bible contains the only doctrine by which we can obtain ſalvation and everlaſting life, which of the numberleſs profeſſions that have ſprung
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026954_0007_0FD29437158F1E88"/>out of it are we to embrace? One ſect tells us that there is no ſalvation out of the pale of their church. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tells us, that unleſs we believe and practiſe their doctrines, we ſhall ſurely be damned. Let us believe therefore, in whatever particular profeſſion we may, we ſhall be damned according to the principles of the others.</p>
            <p>How gracious and beneficent is the chriſtian ſyſtem! ſo perfect and pure that it creates ſo many different, diſtinct, and oppoſite denominations of believers; all of them right, infallibly right, in their own opinions, and proving their doctrine by the clear, inconteſtible authority of divine revelation!</p>
            <p>Many, as an excuſe for countenancing a doctrine which they confeſs may not be true, ſay, that if the chriſtian religion be falſe, it is ſtill very hurtful to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to overturn it; as we have no better guide, and no other method to reſtrain the paſſions and regulate the conduct of mankind; as it is the moſt perfect and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial ſyſtem that could be deviſed. To determine this, we muſt look at its effects.</p>
            <p>That doctrine which has the greateſt tendency to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our preſent and future happineſs, is the beſt; it proves itſelf to be ſo. That the chriſtian ſyſtem does not tend to make us happier, may eaſily be ſhewn, by tracing its natural operations on the human mind. By it we are led to believe, that we are all miſerable and ruined wretches; corrupt and exceedingly wicked from our very birth; naturally ſinful, and oppoſed to the will of God in all our actions, words and thoughts; and ſo far from deſerving the common bleſſings of life, that if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This world, it tells us, is a wretched, tireſome and accurſed place; a mere ſink of guilt and miſery; and all its enjoyments vanity and vexation of ſpirit.

Every accident is a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a prelude to further puniſhment. Every misfortune that happens to their neighbours is a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; and they are liable every moment to be cut off by an avenging God, and ſent to Hell.</p>
            <p>While on the one hand, they repreſent the Deity as then ſervant, to aſſiſt them on every occaſion, avert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every ill they bring upon themſelves, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricating them from every difficulty and diſtreſs they plunge themſelves into. On the other, he is ſuppoſed to be a fierce, revengeful tyrant, delighting in cruelty, puniſhing his creatures for the very ſins which he cauſes them to commit; and creating numberleſs millions of immortal ſouls, that could never have offended him, for the expreſs purpoſe of tormenting them to all eternity. Thus they are generally miſerable through life, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating on death and its ſuppoſed conſequences.</p>
            <p>The authority of the bible appears ſtill more doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful from the abſurdities and contradictions it contains;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026954_0009_0FD29439D2CC60C0"/>contradictions which all the ſophiſtical ingenuity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend divines, with their literal meaning of this text, and ſpiritual interpretation of that, can never explain or reconcile.</p>
            <p>In the very firſt chapter of the whole volume, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an account of the creation, we find an inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable difficulty. In Geneſis i. 27, 28. we are told, that "God created man, <hi>male and ſemale,</hi> bleſſed <hi>them,</hi> and ſaid unto <hi>them,</hi>" &amp;c. But in ii. 20. we find that "there was not an help meet for Adam:" therefore, ver. 18. "God ſaid, it is not good that man ſhould be alone." And, ver. 22. "he made a woman, and brought her unto the man."</p>
            <p>The Almighty, according to many parts of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is a perfect, unchangeable being. In Iſaiah, he is ſaid to declare, that he is "not as a man, that he ſhould repent." But in other places we read of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting very frequently. He repented that he had made man. Having determined to deſtroy the Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, and having ſlain ſeventy thouſand of them, he "repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the evil," and ſpared the reſt. He told Hezekiah that "he ſhould ſurely die, and not live;" but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately repented, and gave him fifteen years longer. Jonah propheſied, in his name, that in forty days Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh ſhould be overthrown; but the people believing him (though he did not perform his promiſe) and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking their ſins, he "repented of the evil that he ſaid he would do unto them, and did it not."</p>
            <p>In one place it ſays, "Our God is a conſuming fire;" and in another, "God is love." He is ſaid to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, revengeful and angry with the wicked every day; and pleaſed again as often at they repent: poſſeſſing
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026954_0010_0FD2943B50E4E7C8"/>all the good and evil qualities of man, that unſtable, wicked, miſerable, and inſignificant worm. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, he is perfectly juſt, wiſe, immutable, and can never repent.</p>
            <p>The chriſtian ſyſtem, I venture to affirm, has been the cauſe of more evil in the world, man any other that ever appeared in it. By inculcating a belief that the Deity was a terrible God, an inexer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>During the firſt 320 years of its exiſtence, chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty occaſioned the deſtruction of many millions of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.

            <p>Indeed, it is impoſſible to calculate the miſchief that has attended the chriſtian ſyſtem ſince its commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But, ſay its advocates, all this was done by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, or the falſe church. Which then is the true church? Not that which perſecutes. And what church is that? The church of Rome? No: For that, after long ſtruggles, no ſooner became eſtabliſhed in power, than it perſecuted its diſſenting ſons with all the zeal and barbarity that it had experienced from its enemies. The church of England? No: For although that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the church of Rome, and rejected many of the errors and corruptions which had crept into it; yet no ſooner was it fully eſtabliſhed in Great-Britain, than it very carefully trod over the ſteps of the mother-church, perſecuted Roman catholics, and all diſſenters. The puritans who fled to this country for the ſake of freedom of conſcience and religious liberty, were no

And I believe there is not a church in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom but would, if it could not convert, moſt gladly deſtroy all its oppoſers; had it that one eſſential and only neceſſary quality, <hi>power.</hi> For they affirm, that the world, with all its bleſſings, are nothing but tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to draw them away from their true intereſt; and that unbelievers of every kind are their natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enemies.</p>

By repreſenting the terrors of their law in the moſt horrid colours, the wretched victim of their deſigns cries out in the depth of deſpair, "<hi>Lord,</hi> what ſhall I do to be ſaved?" The work is then in a certain way of ſucceſs; the convert gives himſelf up to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the church in all things, and is ever after the paſſive tool of its power.

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026954_0014_0FD29445505CC438"/>other unfair means have always been neceſſarily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for its eſtabliſhment. Had it been founded on truth, or conſiſtent with common ſenſe, its advocates would never have refuſed to ſubmit it to reaſon, and the cool, diſpaſſionate judgment of mankind. But they well knew that it could neverſtand the teſt, and this would be the certain means of its deſtruction. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore boldly and preſumptuouſly tell the world, that it is beyond the reach of human reaſon, which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to judge rightly of it. They confeſs that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend a great part of it; but at the ſame time command us to believe it, though we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it.</p>
            <p>It has been the peculiarly honorable lot of Thomas Paine, the firm advocate of truth, the undaunted cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of reaſon, and the reſolute and unconquerable enemy of tyranny, bigotry and prejudice, to open the door to free and impartial enquiry. He has bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entered the field himſelf, and taught the world, that no true ſyſtem of principles, however ſacred they may be held in the public opinion, and however ſtrongly protected and enforced by the terrors of man's ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance here, and eternal puniſhment hereafter, is too awful to be canvaſſed by reaſon, or too ſublime to be comprehended by common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>The chriſtian ſyſtem, as it is not conſiſtent with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is declared to be above it; and ſhould be received even if it does not appear clear and intelligible to our human capacities.</p>
            <p>This by prohibiting enquiry, effectually prevents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of falſehood and confirmation of truth. The doctrine is received upon truſt, upon the credit of our forefathers; becauſe they taught, or rather ſaid ſo, we
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026954_0015_0FD29449D8F49C60"/>muſt implicitly believe ſo, all the remonſtrances of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and experience to the contrary notwithſtanding.</p>
            <p>This is certainly a very great abſurdity. For there once was a beginning to every ſyſtem or theory in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and at that beginning it was neceſſary to exerciſe reaſon as the unerring guide to direct in the choice or rejection thereof. If mankind were not only allowed, but neceſſitated to weigh every doctrine in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Or rather are we not far more wiſe and enlightened than mankind were centuries ago, and much more competent to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and judge of things than they were? By the practice before mentioned, by that tyranny over the minds of men, which has ever been exerciſed in deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſtates, the groſſeſt falſhoods have been forced upon the world for realities, and the moſt deteſtable impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions eſtabliſhed and maintained in all the ſtrength and vigour of immutable truth.</p>
            <p>But theſe arts, how long ſoever they may proſper, and by whatever authority they may be ſupported; though they may call to their aid all the powers of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and prejudices of education, and be aſſiſted by the pride and deceit of hypocritical bygots and merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary tyrants; ſtill muſt they finally fall, and ſink into contemptuous oblivion. The preſent ſtate of ſociety ſeems peculiarly adapted to the advancement of truth, and deſtruction of error.

I believe the whole duty of man is compriſed in this one great republican principle—do juſt as you would be done unto.—My reaſons for believing thus are, in the firſt place, that this firſt cauſe is wiſe and powerful beyond our conception, is clearly evinced in the wonderful formation and diſpoſition of nature, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in every thing that we have any perception of. That he is good, the whole creation proves; for we find nothing made but what is uſeful, beneficial, and conducive to the happineſs of the whole.

            <p>In the ſecond place, it appears from the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of mankind in all ages, that Nature, in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, acts impartially and equally; but leaves his talents, diſpoſition, &amp;c. to be regulated by mere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental circumſtances. That conſcience has an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal power, is evident from the diſlike and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, with which all mankind look upon actions that tend to the injury of ſociety. And not to believe in the unerring authority of natural reaſon, would be to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Deity of injuſtice for not creating us capable of diſtinguiſhing good from evil, and then puniſhing us for the evil we commit.</p>
            <p>In the third place, that the whole duty of man is compriſed in this one great republican principle, "Do as you would be done unto," has appeared ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the world in all ages, that it has been univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed upon, as the unerring rule of action, and the baſis of happineſs: by the obſerving of which there can be neither oppreſſion, deceit, or injuſtice of any kind. The duty of man is his intereſt; his intereſt is to make himſelf happy; and the ſureſt and beſt way of doing this is to promote the proſperity of the whole.</p>

Finally, that ſyſtem of religion which contradicts it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, cannot be wholly true.—That which is not conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with reaſon, or agreeable to the order of nature, muſt be falſe, as different from the will of the Deity, diſplayed in all his works:—And, that which tends to promote diſcord, pride and deceit, is prejudicial to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and ought to be diſcountenanced and oppoſed by every good man.</p>

            <head>REMARKS ON THE PUBLICATIONS WHICH HAVE APPEARED IN OPPOSITION TO THE AGE OF REASON.</head>
            <p>THE firſt attack, the author very wiſely entitled "The Folly of Reaſon," which, as the title indicates, is a mere catch-penny performance, and was probably written from no other than mercenary views: argument and reaſon are rejected, and declamation and bare aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſubſtituted in their place.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the real merit of the piece, it would be an inſult on common ſenſe to ſuppoſe it worthy a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration. But as the advocates of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine it attempts to ſupport are in ſuch need of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that they eagerly catch at every appearance of reaſon or argument in their favor, and deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the idea of importance in that which really poſſeſſes none; ſome remarks, to remove the feeble im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions made by this pamphlet, and ſhew the abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026954_0021_0FD2945716A4AD38"/>of the principles it is intended to eſtabliſh, may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not be unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>The ludicrous abſurdity of the title, is ſo evident to every reader of common ſenſe, that I ſhall not inſult his underſtanding by commenting upon it. It is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, very curious, that the author ſhould attempt, by the power of <hi>his ſhare of reaſon,</hi> to prove the folly and inſufficiency of <hi>all reaſon.</hi> If reaſon, as he aſſerts, is weak and deceitful, it is what I never ſuſpected before; though I muſt confeſs, he goes as far to prove it, not by <hi>argument,</hi> but <hi>example,</hi> as any writer I ever met with.</p>
            <p>The <hi>"bigotry of a deiſt,"</hi> which he mentions in his firſt ſentence, is an entire new expreſſion; and as it is an inconſiſtent one, it cannot apply to Mr. Paine or any one elſe. Bigotry ſignifies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the next ſentence he obſerves, "To, doubt the truth of the ſcriptures at this day is truly alarming." I cannot ſee why it ſhould be alarming at this or any other day, or that it is alarming or dangerous at all: for we know that there is now, and always have been, men of the greateſt eminence, who have both doubted and denied the truth of them, and that without any evil conſequences following.

As for the ſucceeding paragraphs, to page 11, they either mean nothing, or their meaning is unknown to any but the writer: we will therefore paſs on to take notice of what he intends as arguments to prove the truth of the bible, from page 11 to 20. His firſt obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that "The marks and tokens whereby to judge at all times of the truth of a revelation, is the credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the perſon who brings it." On the contrary, the only marks to judge of the truth of a ſtory are, the credibility and reaſonableneſs of the matter, and the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences brought to prove it.</p>
            <p>He ſays, "That God would ſuffer a book that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſuch marks of truth and authority, to make its way ſo long, &amp;c. is not only highly impropable, but in the nature of the thing, plainly impoſſible." But <hi>I ſay</hi> it is both probable and poſſible. For has not the Turkiſh Alcoran, which the chriſtians affirm to be falſe and wicked, exiſted for a time nearly as long as our bible; notwithſtanding all the oppoſition it met with, and in ſpite of all the power and policy of chriſtendom; ſo that it is now as fully believed and more uniformly adheared to than the chriſtian faith?</p>
            <p>He aſſerts, that "the bible contains nothing poor, mean, or ſuperfluous." If, as he attempts to prove, reaſon is incompetent to determine the matter, he has no right to make the aſſertion. At any rate, he has no more authority for ſaying this, than I have for ſaying the contrary. And had the author been endowed with a common ſhare of underſtanding, he would have been convinced that it contain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> much poorneſs, meanneſs, and ſuperfluity: that there are many parts of it highly indecent, perfectly obſcene, and by their obſcurity and unintelligibility truly ſuperfluous. Many chapters in
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:026954_0023_0FD2945A0D755BB8"/>the bible, by being read in churches, have raiſed the bluſh of modeſty on the cheek of innocence; ſhamed the virtuous matron, and diſguſted every man of ſenſe and decency. I could point out many paſſages which no reaſonable parent would ſuffer his children to read, and which if contained in any other book, would baniſh it from poliſhed ſociety.</p>
            <p>Page 20. "Now it is juſt the ſame in the choice of religion, as in the choice of a condition of life." In one ſenſe, this is perfectly true: for of the great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conditions in human life, it is ſometimes very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to determine which would be the beſt for an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual to adopt. And in religion, there being an almoſt innumerable number of different ſects, each one declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſelf to be ſuperior to all the reſt; it is not eaſy to diſcover which we ought to embrace as the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.—That we muſt be ſolely directed by reaſon in the choice of a condition in life, I believe no perſon will pretend to deny. If, then, as our author aſſerts, the caſes are exactly ſimilar, we muſt alſo be guided by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the choice of a religion.</p>
            <p>WE now come to the "<hi>Examination</hi> of the Age of Reaſon, by <hi>Gilbert Wakefield,</hi> late Fellow of Jeſus Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; which, we are led to ſuppoſe, muſt be a powerful and unanſwerable refutation of Mr. Paine's work, ſince the author received his education at Cambridge Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and in <hi>Jeſus</hi> College; and if we may credit what he intimates in the motto, one who has "drank deep of the Pierian ſpring;" while Mr. Paine has only taken "ſhallow draughts."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:026954_0024_0FD294600A853108"/>
He begins his "Examination" with an encomium on Mr. Paine and his writings, and, after allowing <hi>the Age of Reaſon</hi> that merit which he or any other new-fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled reformer cannot deprive it of, informs us what were his motives for combating ſo great a writer.</p>
            <p>In pages 6 and 7, he obſerves, "the time is come when all our opinions muſt be tried at the touch-ſtone of ſevere enquiry; and, if the Jewiſh and Chriſtian reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations cannot ſupport themſelves againſt the batteries of their aſſailants, in the eſtimation of capable and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted judges, the out-poſts muſt be abandoned, and a retreat ſecured to the fortreſſes of <hi>Deiſm,</hi> already oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by the patriarchs of old, and the illuſtrious philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophres of later times." I confeſs it is a proof of his can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor when he calls the Jewiſh and Chriſtian revelations only <hi>out-poſts,</hi> while he acknowledges Deiſm as the <hi>fortreſs,</hi> occupied by the <hi>patriarchs of old,</hi> and the <hi>illuſtrious phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi> of later times; though it is not much in favor of the cauſe he is engaged in, but rather a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt it.</p>
            <p>By the patriarchs of old, I underſtand the ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or heads of families, tribes and nations, wiſe and experienced men, honorable and upright judges of the land. If Deiſm was the fortreſs which they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, as the moſt reaſonable and juſt foundation on which to place their confidence, in oppoſition to the Jewiſh and Chriſtian revelations, which were believed principally by the mean and ignorant—it is certainly a very ſtrong reaſon why we ſhould withhold our belief from it, at leaſt untill we are convinced of its truth by our own reaſon; and if the illuſtrious philoſophers of later times, who muſt be allowed to be the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and unprejudiced of mankind; and who, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026954_0025_0FD294618EBD4120"/>would not adopt any ſyſtem of ſuch magnitude without the moſt mature deliberation and perfect ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction thereon; if theſe men preferred the principles of Deiſm to the doctrines or revealed religion, it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration which ought to ſink deep in every thinking mind, particularly when we reflect that theſe philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, free from the influence of vulgar prejudices and popular opinions, had the advantage of all the writings which preceded them, on which to found their opinion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wakefield ſeems to be confident that the Jewiſh and Chriſtian revelations are pefectly conſiſtent with each other, and that no perſon can acknowledge the authority of the one without believing in the other.— But if he will take the trouble of reading David Levy's anſwer to Dr. Prieſtly's letters to the Jews, he will find that they do not <hi>quite</hi> agree with each other; which would moſt certainly be the caſe, if they were both the words of an unchangeable God. In fact, Mr. Levy makes it appear evident, that the two teſtaments or covenants, are not only inconſiſtent with each other, but are ſo notoriouſly contradictory, that they cannot both be true. Our author himſelf has not by far ſo firm a belief in the old teſtament as in the new; indeed, ſome of the miraculous ſtories in it he diſcredits entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but according to Levy, he ought to believe every part of the old, and conſider the new only as an appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix or confirmation of it.</p>
            <p>He ſhortly after obſerves, "The creed of chriſtian churches, which acknowledges Jeſus Chriſt alſo to be God, and the Holy Ghoſt to be God, is a fundamental violation of all theology; a doctrine alike unknown to the Heathens and Jews, and contemplated with abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence by the followers of Moſes from its firſt propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026954_0026_0FD2946309091088"/>to this very day: a doctrine, inconſiſtent with the plaineſt declarations of Chriſt himſelf and his apoſtles; a doctrine, which no human teſtimony whatever could render credible; a doctrine, which will happily prove a mill-ſtone to all political eſtabliſhments of chriſtianity." All this may be allowed to be true, excepting that it is <hi>a doctrine, inconſiſtent with the plaineſt declarations of the apoſtles;</hi> for we find the Godhead of Jeſus Chriſt ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to ſcripture, according to the writings of the apoſtles. Which belief is adopted as the foundation of almoſt every church in Chriſtendom. He muſt then admit that article as conſiſtent with ſcripture, or reject thoſe paſſages which contain it: and if he rejects one part which he does not believe, why may not all the world likewiſe refuſe their aſſent to thoſe parts which they cannot comprehend or believe? Or has he the ſole privilege of adopting and rejecting whatever portion of the bible he may think proper? The doctrine of the Trinity is certainly found in the chriſtian revelation; and as it is a fundamental article of their faith, if falſe, it muſt overturn the whole ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>The next article of Mr. Paine's creed, our author proceeds, in pages 8 and 9, to corroborate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, by ſome judicious and juſt remarks on <hi>civil privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges</hi> and <hi>titular diſtinctions;</hi> in which he contradicts the doctrine of that infinite inequality among mankind, predeſtinated from eternity, ſo often repeated in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſaps the foundation of the chriſtian religion, and ſtrengthens our diſbelief of it.</p>
            <p>The ſucceeding article of Mr. Paine's belief, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſbelief, he likewiſe confirms, and calls the <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſian</hi> and <hi>Nicene</hi> creeds, a "monſtrous farrago of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urdities and contradictions;" declaring that "ſome
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026954_0027_0FD294649894A210"/>articles of the <hi>Apoſtles'</hi> creed, which may be found in the liturgies of eſtabliſhed churches, are certainly not written in the book of life." In this we agree with him; although we do not ſuppoſe that he poſſeſſes that perfect and true knowledge of the doctrines contained in the ſcriptures, which can render him capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving all the doubts, reconciling all the contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and explaining all the difficulties we find in it.</p>
            <p>The profeſſors of chriſtianity, generally hold, that if we reject one part of the bible, we muſt the whole; for it is all of equal authority and importance: And if our author refuſes his conſent to the doctrines of the Trinity, predeſtination, &amp;c. which it certainly contains, he muſt conſequently doubt of the whole; or believe only ſuch parts as his intereſt or opinion may incline him. To this privilege he is no more entitled than any other man. And if every one has a right, as he undoubtedly has, of not believing any part which appears doubtful to him, the whole bible, at leaſt the doctrinal part of it, may appear falſe or dubious to different perſons, and its credit be thereby entirely deſtroyed; leaving it a matter of indifference to every one to believe or diſbelieve as he may think moſt to his advantage.</p>
            <p>The remainder of this and the following page, contains farthen quotations from Mr. Paine, illuſtrated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with much more good ſenſe and liberality than is to be found in the remainder of the work; giving him credit for juſtneſs of remark, conciſeneſs and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of expreſſion, manly ſenſe, dignified morality, and ſimple, but energetic language. Indeed, ſo far it
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026954_0028_0FD29468B3D3C2E0"/>ſeems to have been intended as the elougium of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raptured friend, rather than the efforts of a violent and conceited adverſary.</p>
            <p>But he can confine himſelf to propriety and candor no longer; and we accordingly find him, in page 13, breaking out into the moſt pointed and ill-founded op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. He aſſerts, that "the ſyſtem of Jeſus Chriſt, proceeds upon the ſuppoſition, that the way of God is open to every man alike; as might be proved by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paſſages of the chriſtian ſcriptures." That this can be proved by them, in a certain degree, may be true; as they can be brought to prove, if their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is good, almoſt any notion that ever entered the imagination of man. But we find them declaring, "that there is no other name under heaven, by which a man can be ſaved, but by Jeſus Chriſt." How this leaves the way of God open to every man alike, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive; for it expreſsly lays this down as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way, and prohibits our ever enjoying ſpiritual, or even temporal happineſs in any other.</p>
            <p>In the next ſentence, he adds, "What the Jews and Chriſtians maintain in behalf of their religious ſyſtems is that their founders delivered to mankind rational ſentiments of the divine nature, of his exiſtence, and his providential government of the world." This ſtatement, to uſe his own language, is frivolous and erroneous in the extreme: for their ſentiments of the exiſtence of the divine nature, and his government of the world, are not only very abſurd and inconſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tent with reaſon, but a great part of them couched in myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious and unintelligible terms, and incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, on their own principles, by any who are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inſpired from Heaven. Indeed, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:026954_0029_0FD2946C7A4C1668"/>them to be beyond the reach of human reaſon; the wiſdom of the world, ſay they, is fooliſhneſs to the doctrine of Chriſt, and the prophets.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to his long ſtring of indubitable poſitions, as he calls them, concerning the antiquity and excellence of the writings of the Jews, little need be ſaid. For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be convinced that they were written at the times and by the perſons which they are ſaid to be. The book of Job, for inſtance, one of the beſt in the old teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, is attributed by divines to various authors; ſome ſuppoſe Moſes wrote it, while he tended his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law's ſheep in the land of Midian; others ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to be the work of Job himſelf; and others think it was witten by Elihu the Buzite; while no perſon can be certain that it was the production of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And how can he inform us, that the Jewiſh writers did not profit by the works of the Greek and Roman moraliſts, inſtead of the contrary? or in ſhort, whether the chriſtian faith was not, according to Mr. Paine (which in all probability is the caſe) built with the ſame materials, and founded upon the ruins of the ancient ſyſtem of heathen mythology?</p>
            <p>Mr. Paine's obſervations on the word <hi>revelation,</hi> our critic ſays, in page 16, are inacurate, ſallacious and inconcluſive; and proceeds to prove his aſſerſion by what he calls "a rational and unexceptionable repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the point in queſtion."</p>
            <p>Were the Jews at that time, or is he at preſent, fully acquainted with all the laws and operations of nature? Is he poſſeſſed of that infinite wiſdom which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends every property, power and quality of the whole creation? Can his purblind eye, at one view, diſcern
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026954_0030_0FD2946D916B9840"/>all the improvements and diſcoveries that may hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be made in every art and ſcience? If ſo, then is he capable of determining what are ſupernatural proofs of a revelation. But, ſays he, "Whether ſuch a diſplay were in reality made in the caſe before us, is not now the queſtion." Why is it not? If a diſplay of ſupernatural agency was neceſſary to prove the authority of the Jewiſh revelation, why is it not likewiſe to the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? For if there was an abſolute neceſſity for this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play to ſupport the doctrine of Moſes; then without that agency it was not entitled to belief. Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the chriſtian faith was not attended by ſomething ſupernatural, mankind could not be expected to believe it. And if there was once a neceſſity for miracles to confirm the doctrine of the goſpel, I can ſee no reaſon why there is not at the preſent time. We find, in the ſcriptures, that when Jeſus ſent out his diſciples to preach the goſpel to the world, he gave them power to raiſe the dead, heal the ſick, caſt out devils, and cure the blind, deaf and dumb, to convince mankind of the truth of their doctrines. But we ſee nothing of the kind in the miniſters of the goſpel (at this day) to prove their divine miſſion: though in the bible the doctrine with its proofs are related as inſeparably connected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And if they preach it without exhibiting its proofs, how can we believe them? We muſt conclude that the preacher and his doctrine are both without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; as <hi>hearſay</hi> is all the evidence we have of their authenticity. Indeed, as in the early ages of chriſtianity, we hear of frequent inſtances of miracles being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by low, illiterate perſons, by which they have obtained the honorable appellation of <hi>ſaints,</hi> ſo among the moſt ignorant and ſuperſtitious nations of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026954_0031_0FD2946F08C5B270"/>ſent age, the reli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of ſome of theſe deified ſaints are ſaid to perform wonderful cures, and other ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral feats. Whether the miracles wrought by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, are entitled to a greater degree of credit than thoſe performed by the latter, every one can judge for himſelf. It is worthy of note, however, that theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous performances, whenever exhibited in ſupport of any other cauſe, are called by chriſtians, artificial deceptions or diabolical cheats.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to Mr. Paine's obſervation, that "viſiting the ſins of the fathers upon the children is contrary to every principle of moral juſtice," Mr. Wakefield bluntly aſſerts, "Nothing in reality can be more feeble and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efficient than this objection."</p>
            <p>That for the ſins of fathers their children, whether innocent or guilty, ſhould ſuffer puniſhment, is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple contrary to reaſon, juſtice, and the laws of every well governed nation. It is a maxim of moral polity, that it is better that an hundred guilty ſhould eſcape, than one innocent ſhould ſuffer: but according to the foregoing doctrine, an indiſcriminate puniſhment falls alike upon the innocent and the guilty.</p>
            <p>The difficulties concerning the immaculate concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus, our author "concedes to the Deiſt, for his own part, in all their force, as pertinent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and of ſerious ſignificancy to thoſe whom they may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d certainly reſts on much weaker evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than any other important fact of all the goſpels." The evidence of the divine authority of the ſcriptures, I always thought was the ſame for one part as for any other: at any rate, I cannot ſee that it is
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:026954_0032_0FD294708791FD00"/>weaker in this inſtance than any where elſe; and ſhould ſuppoſe, if there was any difference, it ſhould be in favor of this particular circumſtance; as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who, it is ſaid, ſo often foretold his coming, mentioned as one of the moſt important proofs of his authority, that "a virgin ſhould conceive and bear a ſon."</p>
            <p>But I certainly agree with our author in believing the ſtory not ſufficiently authenticated to be entitled to a place in my creed. At the ſame time, as we have the ſame evidence for this that we have for every other part of the bible, viz. hearſay; it is full as worthy of belief as any other miraculous ſtory related in it.</p>
            <p>Of Mr. Paine's remarks on the character of Jeſus Chriſt, and the morality which he preached, he ſays, (page 20) "The former part is excellent; the latter was never ſurpaſſed in ignorance and abſurdity." He did not conſider his examination in the light that many do, or he would not have made this laſt aſſertion.</p>
            <p>"To ſay, moreover, of the Chriſtian ſyſtem merely, that it has not been exceeded by any ſyſtem ancient or modern, is ſuch a miſconception as candor will chooſe to impute, not to malignant diſparagement, but to an ignorance rather of the philoſophical ſyſtems of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and the comparative merits of evangelical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality."</p>
            <p>Our author wiſhes to make it appear, that to ſay merely that it has not been exceeded by any, he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as a malignant diſparagement of a ſyſtem, which in his own opinion is a jumble of truth, falſhood, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and abſurdity: for in the very preceding page he will not admit one of its fundamental doctrines into his
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:026954_0033_0FD294745CE9E2D0"/>creed. Or he means that it is an ignoront diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the philoſophical ſyſtems of antiquity, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the chriſtian ſyſtem equal to them; the ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner in which he expreſſes himſelf rendering it uncertain what his real meaning is.</p>
            <p>Our author's next ſentence, page 21, contains a caution, to avoid that very line of conduct which he has himſelf ſo fully practiſed. "I wiſh thoſe heavenly maxims of Solon and the ſon of Sirach, <hi>know thyſelf,</hi> and <hi>underſtand firſt, and then rebuke;</hi> were more deeply impreſſed on the hearts and memories of us all."</p>
            <p>"Jeſus Chriſt wrote no account of himſelf," ſays Mr. Paine; to which our author replies, "to this argument againſt the reſurrection of Jeſus, various <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This is one of the moſt abſurd and ridiculous argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that could poſſibly enter the imagination of man. Becauſe the framers of a ſtory, to give it the appearance of probability, have artfully interſperſed through the whole ſome hiſtorical and geographical facts, which cannot be controverted; our author pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that every part is equally entitled to our fulleſt belief. Suppoſe that Mr. Paine had aſſerted, that he was in Luxembourg, Paris, on the 27th of January, 1794, as he certainly was; mentioning ſeveral impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant circumſtances that occured there at that time; and conclude with declaring that an angel appeared to him, took the pen from his hand, and wrote every word of the Age of Reaſon. This ſtory then, according to Mr. Wakefield's reaſoning, would be undoubtedly true: the miraculous part of it would admit of no detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but muſt ſtand or fall with the main body of the relation; and as the hiſtorical and geographical facts could not be denied, the whole muſt be eſtabliſhed as divine and infallible truth. If this be juſt reaſoning, it is what was never known before; and our author may congratulate himſelf on the honor of a diſcovery of the higheſt conſequence to the literary and thinking world: for at this rate, the Arabian Night's entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026954_0035_0FD294775B7C50E0"/>Robinſon Cruſoe, and every tale or novel in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would be confirmed as indubitable realities.</p>
            <p>But he proceeds to "unfold the purport of this reaſoning," by informing us, at great length, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſciples ſuffered martyrdom in deſence of what they declared they had ſeen and heard. And what does it all amount to? Have not multitudes of Jews, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, and every other national ſect on earth, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered martyrdom with as much zeal and conſtancy as ever the apoſtles or any other chriſtians did? That they were incapable of being deceived reſpecting the angels, miracles, or wonders which they might ſuppoſe they ſaw and heard, no perſon will contend. Animal magnetiſm, pretended ghoſts and witches, not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whole nations being deceived by falſe Chriſts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic gypſies, and wonder-working conjurers, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſhew the extent to which the human mind may be impoſed upon.</p>
            <p>To Mr. Paine's obſervations on the demonſtration of the reſurrection, our author makes this remark; "Not a thouſandth part of the people in Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſaw Lunardi go up from the Art<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lery Ground in a balloon; but the ſuperior impulſe to any poſſible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my mind, who ſaw him, in conſequence of that event, does not exceed the impulſe to a ſimilar action on the mind of another who did not ſee him, by an <hi>evanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent infiniteſimal</hi> of efficacy." The meaning of which I ſuppoſe to be, that as the people of Great-Britain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the aſſenſion of Lunardi, though they did not ſee him go up; ſo all mankind ſhould believe in the reſurrection and aſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt, though they were not eye-witneſſes of the fact. But the caſes are not at all ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ilar: the one is a thing poſſible and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable;
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:026954_0036_0FD29478C8B96600"/>but the other is impoſſible. The generality of people in Great-Britain and every other country, have ſeen globes of cloth, paper, or ſomething elſe of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a balloon, aſcend; which would convince them that the thing was poſſible, and therefore entitled to ſome degree of credibility. Even the moſt ignorant cook, that ſees a potlid raiſed by the ſteam of boiling water, muſt be convinced of the probability of the fact. Whereas no man living ever faw a perſon riſe from perfect death, fly in the air, or any thing of the kind ever performed; and therefore cannot believe the ſtory without ocular conviction of its truth. He next takes much pains to convince us, that the Jews were at that time a vicious and corrupt people; and not at all likely to believe in the authority and doctrines of Jeſus; even ſo depraved that it would have been next to a miracle if they had accepted his miſſion. He labours hard to eſtabliſh this propoſition, by compairing Mr. Paine and his rights of man to Jeſus and his preaching; both ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, one in effigy, the other in reality, by the very people for whoſe happineſs they were laboring. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, "upon the whole, we find no difficulty in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that what has aſtoniſhed Mr. Paine ſo long, ſhould aſtoniſh him no longer; as no ſpecies of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is more common and more legitimate, than that which proves the truth of a circumſtance from the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of corrupt and intereſted witneſſes, who aſſert it is falſe." If Mr. Wakefield can clearly prove to us, that the Jews were at that time ſo corrupt and intereſted that few, very few, and thoſe mean and ignorant, were prevailed upon to believe a doctrine, which, though op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and perſecuted by the nation in general, was ſtill undoubtedly true, and confirmed by many real mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:026954_0037_0FD2953D5BD3C780"/>if he can convince us of this, he may then hold the rejection of the goſpel by the Jews as no good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt its reality. But how is he to do this? We have only his <hi>hardy aſſerſion</hi> for it; and it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould be the height of abſurdity to let that outweigh or deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy the credibility of a whole nation.</p>
            <p>Mr. Paine next appears to our author, in page 32, in his obſervations on the ſtory of the devil and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as a <hi>tumid and hypertragical declaimer;</hi> although he cannot avoid agreeing with him on the ſubject, which he likewiſe illuſtrates by ſeveral learned and (in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) concluſive remarks. But it ſeems, before he had finiſhed his paragraph, that he perceived he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming inſtead of confuting his antagoniſt. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, recollecting which ſide of the queſtion he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to ſupport, exclaims, "Alas! our deiſt fancied himſelf in ſtout combat with genuine chriſtianity, whilſt he was buffeting a mere phantum of ignorance and ſuperſtition! So eaſy is declamation againſt folly!"</p>
            <p>"Theſe books, beginning with Geneſis, and ending with Revelations (which, by the bye, is a book of rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, that requires a revelation to explain it) are, we are told, the word of God," ſays Mr. Paine; to which our author replies,</p>
            <p>"The vindicator, who occupies himſelf in the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſuch unſupported and dogmatical aſſertions, is not much more excuſable than the <hi>ignoramus,</hi> who has the audacity to produce them." Here, becauſe he has no othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſubterfuge at hand, he inſtantly converts the "ſagacious, plain, ſenſible Thomas Paine" into an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious ignoramus, and impudently endeavors to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the abſurdity of his calling the Apocrypha the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:026954_0038_0FD2953F80B1A0A8"/>word of God, when it is evident that he intended no ſuch thing; for he ſays expreſsly, that they were voted to be doubtful. What a miſerable ſituation muſt our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtable champion be in, when he is under the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neceſſity of attacking theideal ſpectres of his ownima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, inſtead of the real and ſubſtantial arguments of his opponent. We find alſo, that he paſſes over the moſt important and influential parts of Mr. Paine's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, and dwells upon thoſe only which he fondly imagines he can oppoſe or ridicule, with at leaſt ſome appearance of confidence and ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Mr. Paine ſays, "When the church mythologiſts eſtabliſhed their ſyſtem, they collected all the writings they could find, and managed them as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed."</p>
            <p>This, Mr. Wakefield boldly aſſerts, page 36, "is an undigeſted and inaccurate ſtatement of the caſe;" and after giving us ſeveral more of his aſſertions and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, comes off exultingly with, "What need of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial detail in repelling the objections of men, who really knew juſt nothing of the ſubject, and ſatisfy their <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>philoſophy</hi> by peremptory aſſeveration only, unilluminated by one ſingle ray of information on the topic in diſpute?" By ſuch pitiful evaſions, ſuch unſounded inſinuations, and ſuch impertinent queſtions, is our profound author to "vindicate his ſaith in chriſtianity upon principles truly rational and unambiguouſly explicit, or relinquiſh it altogether." He continues, "It were moſt eaſy to enlarge on this ſubject; but more has been ſaid already, than ſuch deſultory and unſubſtantiated allegations have any reaſon to expect:" Yes, truly; and more than any thing elſe could have
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:026954_0039_0FD29540EA9CFF20"/>reaſon toexpect, from any but the moſt conceited pedant; and more than can poſſibly reflect the leaſt degree of credit on either his cauſe, his heart, or his head. "And I ſhall only add, from a multitude of cogent inſtances, with reference to <hi>one</hi> branch of evidence of the firſt moment, that a compariſon of the 28th chapter of Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toronomy caly, with the ſubſequent and preſent ſtate of the Iſraelitiſh nation, muſt flaſh conviction, I ſhould think, upon any mind, not totally prejudiced and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, in favor of the <hi>prophetical</hi> pretenſions of the <hi>ſcriptures:</hi> for that the book of Dueteronomy was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed poſterior to thoſe events, what effrontery even of unlearned deiſm, if it hazard the aſſertion, will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prove?" It may perhaps be as hard to prove that it was written poſterior to thoſe events, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But the more time that elapſes ſince the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, renders the probability of its not coming to us unchanged and miſtranſlated, the greater. And at any rate, it cannot be held up as an argument in favor of the divine authority of the new teſtament: for by the appearance of Chriſt on earth, we are told, the law, by which theſe curſes were entailed on the Jews, was aboliſhed. Indeed it reduces that nation to a moſt unhappy dilemma: for if they do not continue to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the injunctions of this law, all the curſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora's box are heaped on their devoted heads; and if they do not embrace the doctrines of the goſpel, that repeals this law, they are to be damned to all eternity. Theſe ſufferings too, when ſuſtained by the Jews for an adhereance to their ſaith, were the juſt judgments of God, for diſobedience as propheſied in the ſcriptures; but when born by the chriſtians, were cruel and unjuſt
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:026954_0040_0FD29544EEF0E438"/>perſecutions, inſtigated by the devil, in oppoſition to the divine will.</p>
            <p>Our author next attacks Mr. Paine's definition of the word revelation, with as much courage and fierceneſs as though he would annihilate the whole ſyſtem of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm with one ſtroke. He calls it "not only the <hi>eſſence,</hi> but the <hi>quinteſſence,</hi> of all weakneſs and abſurdity:" at the ſame time tacitly acknowledging it to be juſt, and anſwering all the purpoſe for which it was intended; by the following confeſſion, "The greater part of the <hi>bible-hiſtory</hi> contains ſimply a narrative of the political occurrences, the Jews; and the tranſactions record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are, therefore, to be conſidered in the ſame light with thoſe of all other hiſtories; namely, as aggravated and diſguiſed in a thouſand inſtances by paſſing through the mediam of national partiality."</p>
            <p>"Aggravated and diſguiſed in a thouſand inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces!" A very candid and important confeſſion, Mr. Wakefield; and if you can only point out to us which theſe thouſand inſtances are, we will perhaps allow the remainder a little more credit than we can the whole, before we are ſatisfied in that particular.</p>
            <p>His next acknowledgment is, "I agree with Thomas Paine, that the account of the creation, with which the book of Ceneſis opens, has all the appearance of being a tradition, which the Iſraelites had among them before they came into Egypt; and after their departure from that country, they put it at the head of their hiſtory, without telling, as it is moſt probable that they did not know, how they came by it." Another very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant conceſſion. And if the ſcripture account of the creation, is nothing more than a tradition (and all nations have their diſſerent traditions) what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026954_0041_0FD295482D1A7E58"/>comes of the credibility of the ſtory of original ſin, Adam's damning all mankind by eating an apple, &amp;c? It muſt certainly fall to the ground, together with the neceſſity of a mediator to repair the loſs, and every other doctrine founded on this tradition.</p>
            <p>"But, ſays he, what majeſty of ſentiment, what a dignified ſimplicity of expreſſion, characterizes the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic account of the creation of the world!" In the name of common ſenſe, what has majeſty of ſentiment, or dignified ſimplicity of expreſſion to do with the truth or falſhood of a ſtory? Truth is truth, without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of artificial ſupport: and all the majeſtic ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and dignified expreſſions that were ever invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cannot make a falſe ſtory true.</p>
            <p>"To all that occurs comprehending any objections to the Jewiſh inſtitution, a very ſatisfactory anſwer has, if I miſtake not, been already given." Yes, truly: if no other anſwer can be found, what has been already given, is ſufficient to ſatisfy us of the propriety of the objections.</p>
            <p>Mr. Paine ſays, "why it has been called the Moſaic acconnt of the creation, I am at a loſs to conceive.— Moſes, I believe, was too good a judge of ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to put his name to that account. He had been educated among the Egyptians, who were a people as well ſkilled in ſcience, and particularly in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronomy, as any people of their day." To which Mr. W. anſwers: "All this may be literally true: but a palpable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>truth is implied in it; that the Egyptians were really a learned and ſcientific people: whereas their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſtronomy was juſt nothing at all. If not, produce me your youchers to this fact, from exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:026954_0042_0FD2954952154D90"/>monuments or ancient teſtimony." To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is it whether the Egyptians were really at that time a learned people or not? How can the diſcuſſion of this ſubject affect the point in queſtion? and yet our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor takes up near two pages in endeavoring to prove this unintereſting and impertinent aſſertion; or rather to diſplay his extraordinary knowledge of ancient hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Mr. Paine obſerves, "If we permit ourſelves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive right ideas of things, we muſt neceſſarily affix the idea, not only of unchangeableneſs, but of the utter impoſſibility of any change taking place, by any means or accident whatever, in that which we would honor with the name of the word of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word of God cannot exiſt in any written or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man language."</p>
            <p>To which our author replies, firſt, by aſking "What can be more frivolous, or unworthy of a man of ſenſe?" then giving us his ideas of a revelation, and finally by endeavoring to prove that we believe the Jewiſh and chriſtian revelations as fully as we do that Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo, planned the fabric of St. Peter's at Rome, and Sir Chriſtopher Wren, that of St. Paul's in London.</p>
            <p>Well may <hi>we</hi> aſk, "What can be more frivolous, and unworthy a man of ſenſe?" The compariſon here introduced, is as fallacious and improper as can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be conceived. For whoever ſees the fabries of St. Peter's and St. Paul's, muſt be convinced, that they were planned by Michael Angelo, Chriſtopher Wren, or ſome other perſons; as there is no other way by which they poſſibly could have been in exiſtence; and we likewiſe ſee, that fabries are planned every day. But if Mr. Wakefield can convince us, that there was no
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:026954_0043_0FD2954C6EB66B78"/>other way than a revelation from heaven by which the Jewiſh and Chriſtian ſyſtems of religion could have been in exiſtence; and that ſuch revelations are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and occur every day; then will we allow the compariſon to be juſt, and the inferences he draws from it reaſonable. As this is impoſſible, we muſt conclude, that the caſes are entirely diſſimilar, the ſimilitude falſe, and the whole argument abſurd and inconcluſive.</p>
            <p>On Mr. Paine's obſerving, "The event that ſerved more than any other to break the firſt link in this long chain of deſpotic ignorance, is that known by the name of the reformation of Luther." Mr. Wakefield ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances as an argument, "Surely it forms no mean preſumption in favor of the reaſonableneſs of revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the reſtoration of ſcience and the rectification of religion, ſhould be congenial and contemporary; that the beams of knowledge ſhould diſpel the damps and darkneſs of ignorant ſuperſtition, but contribute illumination and vigour to the ſincere goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt."</p>
            <p>Whether the reformation of ſcience did really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute illumination and vigour to the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, is a point not clearly eſtabliſhed; and whether, if a complete and unlimited reſtoration of ſcience had taken place, the chriſtian ſyſtem would not have been wholly rejected, might be inſiſted on, with much more reaſon than many of his aſſertions. But one plain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable poſition, of the ſame nature with our author's, will ſufficiently overbalance the weight of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: as we may aſſert, with equal confidence, that it is no mean preſumption in favor of the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of deiſm, and the unreaſonableneſs of divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:026954_0044_0FD2954E0C302DA0"/>that the reſtoration of civil and religious liberty, and the rejection of all revealed religion, in France, ſhould be congenial and contemporary; that the beams of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhould diſpel the damps and darkneſs of ignorant ſuperſtition and hereditary deſpotiſm, but add illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vigour and confirmation, to the ſincere and unerring religion of nature, and revive the <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and deiſm.</p>
            <p>The moſt diſtinguiſlied mathematicians (mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, according to the latter part of this ſame paragraph, has no connection with religion: what does it ſignify, then, that diſtinguiſhed mathematicians believe the chriſtian revelation ?) and philoſophers of our own country, Baron, Boyle, Newton, Locke, Barrow and Hartley, have been the firmeſt believers of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an revelation." To which may be oppoſed as many diſtinguiſhed names on the other ſide of the queſtion: The greateſt philoſophers, and moſt virtuous of their country, Voltaire, Rouſſeau, Pope, Bolinbroke, Hume, Franklin and Paine, have been the firmeſt diſbelievers of the chriſtian revelation.</p>
            <p>We will here further illuſtrate the abſurdity of Mr. W's reaſoning, in his ſtrictures upon Mr. P's remanksupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. Mr. P. endeavors to prove that "the hiſtorical and annectdotal part of the bible, which is almoſt the whole of it, is not within the meaning and compaſs of the word revelation, and therefore is not the word of God." He obſerves, "Revelation is a communication of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which the perſon, to whom that thing is revealed, did not know before. For if I have done a thing, or ſeen it done, it needs no revelation to tell me I have done it, or ſeen it, nor to enable me to tell it, or to write it." To which Mr. W. replies, "ſo then, not only the profeſſors of philoſophy at the higheſt places of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:026954_0045_0FD295501056FBC0"/>but every dame, that teaches the <hi>born-book</hi> in a country village, communicates, it ſeems, a revelation!" This remark is certainly beneath the ſenſe of Mr. Wakefield, if I relate what I have done, or ſeen done, it is no revelation, it requires no immediate inſpiration from heaven to enable me to tell it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Paine's diſſmiſſion is clear and pertinent; and to predend that it neceſſarily follows from his poſition that every thing told to a perſon, which he did not know before, is a revelation, is the height of ſophiſtry. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a puerile habit of ſyllogiſtic diſputation (which Mr. Wakefield probably acquired at Jeſus' Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege) could have betrayed him into ſo weak an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is not unlike the fyllogiſm of the mouſe and cheeſe, noticed by Senea. "Two legged animals eat cheeſe, a mouſe is not a two legged animal, therefore a mouſe does not eat cheeſe." "Away with theſe child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh follies!"</p>
            <p>Mr. Paine makes ſome very juſt remarks upon the impropriety of obliging boys, at this day, to waſte their genius and time in delving over the dear languages; obſerving that the reaſon which once operated in favor of theſe ſtudies now ceaſe to exiſt, ſince all the ancient authors of note are tranſlated into modern languages; which have received every improvement neceſſary to embelliſh them. To which Mr. W. makes the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clowniſh reply, "all have not that ſenſibility of perception, and that elegance of taſte, which is neceſſary to a reliſh of the inimitable beauties of ancient compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. I may be, for example, a delicate bird, delighted in ſtrawberries and the choiceſt fruits—Thomas Paine, a crow; who prefers a feaſt on carrion and putreſſence." For ſhame, Mr. Wakefield, did you learn to make ſuch
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:026954_0046_0FD295518FD42F60"/>compariſons at Jeſus' College! Mr. Paine then becauſe he prefers reading modern authors, and the tranſlation of the ancients, in modern languages, is a crow, and likes to feaſt on matter which that bird is peculiarly fond of. While yourſelf who are delighted with trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring up Greek and Hebrew, in order to aſtoniſh your pariſhioners with your <hi>vaſt</hi> learning, and to convince them of your divine miſſion, are to be ſure a very <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate bird</hi> indeed. You pay a very great compliment to the ancients at the expence of the moderns; and, perhaps, when ſome part of your compoſition in this reply are taken into conſideration with a conſiderable degree of propriety.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the beauties of compoſition, it is the height of abſurdity to ſuppoſe that a perſon, not thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verſed in ancient languages (which is rarely the caſe) can diſcover ſo many beauties in the original, as would be communicated to him in a good tranſlation. Beſides is it prudent to be ſo prodigal of time, ſince human life is reduced to ſo ſhort a period, as to ſpend ſeven or eight years in ſearching for <hi>beauties</hi> in dead languages? The idea is oppoſed to the reaſon of the preſent age.</p>
            <p>His laſt obſervation on his opponent is, "Mr. Paine deſcants with a tolerable ſhare of merriment, in the concluſion of his pamphlet, reſpecting Jonah and the Whale, which my ſtomach alſo feels an equal indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ingurgitate." O what blaſphemy! to diſbelieve a plan, unequivocal, and uncontradicted ſcripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, wrote by the prophet himſelf, who centainly muſt have been the beſt competent judge of the affair! To doubt the word of an inſpired prophet! Why, Mr. Wakefield, you may as well ſuſpect the truth of every part of the bible, which you find not confirmed by the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:026954_0047_0FD29559D95BB6E8"/>teſtimony of ancient profane hiſtory and your own weak fallible reaſon.</p>
            <p>"It is not unlike a tale that I lately heard, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will think not inferior to that before us in ſymptoms of credibility.

But how great was their admiration and delight to diſcover little Caeſar, <hi>perched on a tubercle of the purtenance,</hi> diſpatching his bread and cheeſe in perfect compoſure and ſafety." Blaſphemy, horrid blaſphemy again!

            <head>THE AGE OF INFIDELITY, BY A LAYMAN, IS THE NEXT IN THE ORDER OF ATTACK AGAINST THE FATAL BLOW TO FANATICISM AND PRIESTCRAFT, THE AGE OF REASON.</head>
            <p>FROM the polemic abilities of this writer, and his thorough knowledge of all the arguments for and againſt the tenets he profeſſes, we are inclined to believe that he here appears under falſe colours, being really a gentleman of the <hi>cloth:</hi> perhaps ſome may think a <hi>pious fraud</hi> in this caſe juſtifiable; we only ſuggeſt it to put the reader on his guard againſt the artful reaſoning of a perſon who may think himſelf intereſted in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent impoſitions.</p>
            <p>As many of the errors in this paraphlet have been animadverted upon in our reply to Mr. Wakefield, and as a minute examination of it would far exceed our intended limits, we ſhall only notice the moſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent abſurdities that appear on a curſary review of the work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:026954_0050_0FD2955E59E6E7B8"/>
The author commences thus, "In an age like this, it is no wonder that infidelity has its champions. The genuine goſpel of Chriſt is a ſyſtem too pure and divine to meet the cordial approbation of men of vicious hearts and corrupt principles; and ſuch have hitherto compoſed the majority of mankind."</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the morality which Chriſt preached, infidels, or the diſbelievers in revelation, acknowledge its purity, and obſerve it often more ſcrupulouſly, than thoſe who make ſo great pretentions to piety. But they contend that it required no <hi>divine nature</hi> to teach ſuch doctrine, as many, whom chriſtians call heathens, have taught and practiſed the ſame.</p>
            <p>And they conceive that there can be neither virtue nor vice, in believing or diſbelieving any particular ſpeculative opinion. Virtue and vice conſiſt in actions, and not in creeds.</p>
            <p>The latter part of the paſſage cited above, contains a ſevere cenſure upon the majority of mankind, which they by no means merit. Every one who is the leaſt converſant in ſociety, and will credit his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, inſtead of the gloomy leſſons of his nurſe; and thoſe who are intereſted to deceive him, will atteſt to the fallacy and illiberality of this aſperſion. From con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly viewing human nature upon the dark ſide, from hearing it continually fulminated from the pulpit, that <hi>man is prone to evil, as the ſparks ſly upward,</hi> has ariſen this illfounded opinion.</p>
            <p>We have been taught to believe that mankind were by nature depraved, at enmity with God and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and if it were in their power would hurl the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent from his throne.</p>

               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:026954_0051_0FD2956245FEF538"/>
How ungenerous, how wicked the deception! meet your fellow creature in any part of the globe, and (reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and political prejudices apart) he greets you as his brother, takes part in your ſufferings, and ſooths your afflictions.</p>
            <p>To falſe ſyſtems of education, and not to evil diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in human nature, are owing the calamities of mankind. The doctrine of total depravity has perhaps a greater tendency to viciate the morals of mankind than any ſentiment that has ever been propagated. Tell a man that you know him to be a rogue, and you inſpire him with a propenſity to cheat you.</p>
            <p>"To compare," ſays the Layman, "the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mahomet's ſyſtem with that of Judaiſm or chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianity, is weak and unjuſt in the extreme. Mahomet wrought no miracles, delivered no predictions: but, on the contrary, founded his dominion on the ſword. There is therefore no compariſon."</p>
            <p>This is the aſſertion of a bigoted chriſtian; let us hear what the votaries of Mahomet have to ſay on the other ſide of the queſtion. "They affirm that he fed the hungry, cured the ſick, and raiſed the dead, and that both animate and inanimate nature were equally ſubject to the apoſtle of God. A myſterious animal, the Borak, conveyed him from the temple of Mecca to that of Jeruſalem: with his companion Gabriel, he ſucceſſively aſcended the ſeven heavens and received and repaid the ſalutations of the patriarchs, the prophets, and the angels, in their reſpective manſions. Beyond the ſeventh heavens, Mahomet alone was permitted to proceed; he paſſed the veil of unity, approached with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two bow-ſhots of the throne, and felt a cold that pierced him to the heart, when his ſhoulder was touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:026954_0052_0FD29566938233A0"/>by the hand of God. After this familiar though important converſation, he again deſcended to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, remounted the Borak, and returned to Mecca."

            <p>Theſe miracles a muſulman believes with as much aſſurance, as a Jew, or chriſtian, the extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits related in the old and new teſtament. And why not with the ſame colour of reaſon? "In all religions the life of the founder ſupplies the ſilence of his written revelation: the ſayings of Mahomet were ſo many leſſons of truth; his actions ſo many examples of virtue.</p>
            <p>"The inſpiration of the Hebrew prophets, of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and evangeliſts of Chriſt, might not be incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the exerciſe of their reaſon and memory; and the diverſity of their genius is ſtrongly marked in the ſtyle and compoſition of the books of the old and new teſtament. But Mahomet was content with a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, more humble, yet more ſublime, of a ſimple editor: the ſubſtance of the Koran, according to himſelf or his diſciples, is uncreated and eternal; ſubſiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Since Mr. Layman has introduced Mahomet, we will make a brief ſtatement of the cauſes which led to his
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:026954_0053_0FD29569CC768188"/>eſtabliſhment; and take notice of ſome of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant creeds and precepts enjoined in the Koran; by which we ſhall be enabled to judge whether that religion and it; founder have merited all the abuſe which has been ſo liberally beſtowed upon them by chriſtian writers. This we ſhall do by citing ſeveral detached paſſages from an author of undoubted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectability.</p>
            <p>"It is the boaſt of the Jewiſh apologiſts, that while the learned nations of antiquity were deluded by the fables of polytheiſm, their ſimple anceſtors of Paleſtine preſerved the knowledge and worſhip of the true God. The moral attributes of Jehovah may not eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled with the ſtandard of <hi>human</hi> virtue: his meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical qualities are darkly expreſſed; but each page of the Pentateuch and the Prophets is an evidence of his power: the unity of his name is inſcribed on the firſt table of the law; and his ſanctuary was never defiled by any viſible image of the inviſible eſſence. After the ruin of the temple, the faith of the Hebrew exiles was purified, fixed, and enlightened, by the ſpiritual devotion of the ſynagogue. But the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael had ceaſed to be a people; and the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the world were guilty, at leaſt in the eyes of the prophet, of giving ſons, or daughters, or compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the ſupreme God. In the rude idolatry of the Arabs, the crime is manifeſt and audacious: the Sabians are poorly excuſed by the pre-eminence of the firſt p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The chriſtians of the ſeventh century had inſenſibly relapſed into a ſemblance of paganiſm; their public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:026954_0054_0FD2956B1AAC1060"/>vows were addreſſed to the relics and images that diſgraced the temples of the Eaſt: the throne of the Almighty was darkened by a cloud of martyrs, and ſaints, and angels, the objects of popular veneration; and the Collyridian heretics, who flouriſhed in the fruitful ſoil of Arabia, inveſted the Virgin Mary with the name and honors of a goddeſs. The myſteries of the Trinity and Incarnation <hi>appear</hi> to contradict the principle of the divine unity. In their obvious fenſe, they introduce three equal Deities, and transform the man Jeſus into the ſubſtance of the ſon of God: an orthodox commentary will ſatisfy only a believing mind; intemperate curioſity and zeal had torn the veil of the ſanctuary; and each of the Oriental ſects was eager to confeſs that all except themſelves, deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reproach of idolatry and polytheiſm. The creed of Mahomet is free from ſuſpicion or ambiguity; and the Koran is a glorious teſtimony to the unity of God. The prophet of Mecca rejected the worſhip of idols and men, of ſtars and planets, on the rational principle that whatever riſes muſt ſet, that whatever is born muſt die, that whatever is corruptible muſt decay and periſh. In the author of the univerſe, his rational enthuſiaſm confeſſed and adored an infinite and eternal being, without form or place, without iſſue or ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, preſent to our moſt ſecret thoughts, exiſting by the neceſſity of his own nature, and deriving from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all moral and intellectual perfection. Theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime truths, thus anounced in the language of the prophet, are firmly held by his diſciples, and defined with metaphyſical preciſion by the interpreters of the Koran. A philoſophic theiſt might ſubſcribe the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:026954_0055_0FD2956C8E5480B8"/>creed of the Mahometans: a creed too ſublime perhaps for our preſent faculties.</p>
            <p>"The firſt principle of reaſon and revelation was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the voice of Mahomet: his proſelytes, from India to Morocco, are diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Unitarians;</hi> and the danger of idolatry has been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the interdiction of images.</p>
            <p>"The God of nature has written his exiſtence on all his works, and his law in the heart of man.

During that period, ſome rays of prophetic light had been imparted to one hundred and twenty-four thouſand of the elect, diſcriminated by their reſpective meaſure of virtue and grace; three hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen apoſtles were ſent with a ſpecial commiſſion to recal their country from idolatry and vice; one hundred and four volumes have been dictated by the holy ſpirit; and ſix legiſlators of tranſcendent brightneſs have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to mankind the ſix ſucceſſive revelations of various rites, but of one immutable religion.</p>
            <p>"During ſix hundred years the goſpel was the way of truth and ſalvation; but the chriſtians inſenſibly forgot both the laws and the example of their founder; and Mahomet was inſtructed by the Gnoſtics to accuſe the church, as well as the ſynagogue, of corrupting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the ſacred text. The piety of Moſes and of Chriſt rejoiced in the aſſurance of a future prophet,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:026954_0056_0FD2956E99BC1AB0"/>more illuſtrious than themſelves: the evangelic pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the <hi>Paraclete</hi> or. Holy Ghoſt, was prefigured in the name, and accompliſhed in the perſon of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, the greateſt and the laſt of the apoſtles of God.</p>
            <p>"The polytheiſt is oppreſſed and diſtracted by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſuperſtition: a thouſand rights of Egyptian origin were interwoven with the eſſence of the Moſaic law: and the ſpirit of the goſpel had evaporated in the pageantry of the church. The prophet of Mecca was tempted by prejudice, or policy, or patriotiſm, to ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the rites of the Arabians, and the cuſtom of viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy ſtone of the Caaba. But the precepts of Mahomet himſelf inculcate a more ſimple and rational piety: prayer, faſting, and alms, are the religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a muſulman; and he is encouraged to hope, that prayer will carry him half way to God, faſting will bring him to the door of his palace, and alms will gain him admittance.</p>
            <p>"Cleanlineſs is the key of prayer: the frequent luſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hands, the face, and the body, which was practiſed of old by the Arabs, is ſolemnly enjoined by the Koran.</p>
            <p>"Every ſpot for the ſervice of God is equally pure: the Mahometans indifferently pray in their chamber or in the ſtreet. As a diſtinction from the Jews and chriſtians, the Friday in each week is ſet apart for the uſeful inſtitution of public worſhip: the people are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in the moſch and the imam: ſome reſpectable elder aſcends the pulpit, to begin the prayer and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the ſermon. But the Mahometan religion is deſtitute of prieſthood or ſacrifice; and the independent ſpirit of fanaticiſm looks down with contempt on the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:026954_0057_0FD295704CE77F50"/>miniſters and the ſlaves of ſuperſtition. The voluntary penance of the aſcetics, the torment and glory of their lives, was odious to a prophet who cenſured in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions a raſh vow of abſtaining from fleſh, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſleep; and firmly declared, that he would ſuffer no monks in his religion.</p>
            <p>"The interdiction of wine, peculiar to ſome orders of prieſts or hermits, is converted by Mahomet alone into a poſitive and general law; and a conſiderable portion of the globe has abjured, at his command, the uſe of that ſalutary, though dangerous liquor. Theſe pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſtraints are, doubtleſs, infringed by the libertine and eluded by the hypocrite; but the legiſlator, by whom they are enacted, cannot ſurely be accuſed of alluring his proſelytes by the indulgence of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual appetites. The charity of the Mahometans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to the animal creation; and the Koran repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly inculcates, not as a merit, but as a ſtrict and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable duty, the relief of the indigent and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Mahomet, perhaps, is the only lawgiver who has defined the preciſe meaſure of charity: the ſtandard may vary with the degree and nature of property, as it conſiſts either in money, in corn or cattle, in fruits or merchandiſe; but the muſulman does not accompliſh the law, unleſs he beſtows a <hi>tenth</hi> of his revenue; and if his conſcience accuſes him of fraud or extortion, the tenth, under the idea of reſtitution, is enlarged to a <hi>fifth.</hi> Benevolence is the foundation of juſtice, ſince we are forbid to injure thoſe whom we are bound to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.

Many more extracts, to the ſame purpoſe, from this author, who refers to the Koran to ſhew that theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent precepts are enjoined in that work, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved by muſulmen, might be made, but we think thoſe already adduced are amply ſufficient to prove to every unbiaſſed mind, that the Mahometan eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment was undoubtedly a very great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Jewiſh and chriſtian ſyſtems. The uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God is uniformly adhered to, and the great prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of morality, <hi>the ſoul of all religion,</hi> is ſeverely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated in every chapter of the Koran. Even admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the Mahometan religion owed its eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a great meaſure, to the ſword, that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance can by no means abridge its merits. We expect that the government of the French republic will be eſtabliſhed by the ſword, but it cannot from thence be infered that it will not be equal or ſuperior to any government on earth. The truth is the Mahometan and Chriſtian religion owe their exiſtence to perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Mahomet and his followers were perſecuted by the ſurrounding zelots of former eſtabliſhments; and, when ſufficiently ſtrong, they very wiſely, as all other ſects would do, put their confidence in the <hi>ultimo ratio regis.</hi> Perhaps the ſole reaſon that the Shaking Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers have not made more proſelytes in this country, is becauſe no notice has been taken of them, but they have been left to <hi>work out their own ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The writer thinks his remarks, in the preceding parts of this work, will clear him from the leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of being an advocate for the Mahometan ſyſtem, with all its abſurdities. No, he wiſhes to expunge the ſuperfluities annexed to all religions, and to eſtabliſh the <hi>pure religion of nature,</hi> which alone can ever become
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:026954_0059_0FD2957584CD37B0"/>univerſal, and which would diſſolve thoſe national pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices by whoſe influence monarchs have deluged the world in blood. He wiſhes to convince chriſtians of the impolicy of foſtering prejudices by means of which they have experienced ſo much contempt and cruelty, from thoſe of an oppoſite perſuaſion. What but religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bigotry could induce the Algerines to treat chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians with ſuch barbarity? They conſider infidels to their religion intitled to no mercy. The ſame cauſe has occaſioned the commiſſion of equal or ſuperior cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties by chriſtians, particularly under the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Roman Catholics.</p>
            <p>Perhaps theſe acts of inhumanity cannot be fairly juſtified from either of the ſources on which theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective religions are founded; but as both conſider all, who are not of their way of thinking, as enemies to God, it is a preſumption that man, as his inſtrument, has a right to avenge his cauſe.</p>
            <p>We will now return to our chriſtian friend the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and reſume our ſubject.</p>
            <p>Paſſing over matters of inferior moment, we come to his commentary on Moſes' account of the fall. Here we think, he has injured his cauſe by attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to elucidate this miſterious ſubject. People were in the habit of reading the ſtory in the allegorical, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtyle, without attending to its abſurdities; but the moment you tranſlate it into plain Engliſh, it becomes too trifling, too inſignificant for a ſchool-boy not to ridicule. It belittles the character of the Deity, and to credit it is degrading to his creture, <hi>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this idea of heriditary original ſin was engend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered in the flighty imagination of fanatics, muſt appear
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:026954_0060_0FD2957A0531E138"/>evident, when we reflect on the wiſdom and goodneſs of God; conſequently that man ſtands in the ſame ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation he ever did, and will be accountable only for his own actions.</p>
            <p>He concludes this article thus, "If the reader con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues diſſatisfied, let him try if he can find or invent any more rational hypotheſis to account for the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of moral evil into our world."</p>
            <p>As this is a ſubject of the utmoſt importance, and as we wiſh not to incur the imputation of endeavoring to pull down one theory, without ſubſtituting another, we offer the following obſervations for the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reader.</p>
            <p>The internal evidence of man's free agency muſt be clear to all who reflect on the operation of their own mind: Were this not the caſe there could be no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countability on his part for the commiſſion of evil. That man is created with propenſities in favor of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue univerſal experience proves; and that he poſſeſſes the capability of doing evil neceſſarily reſults from his free agency. This is undoubtedly a more noble mode of exiſtence than to have been created mere paſſive machines. The greateſt difficulty, that occurs, is to reconcile free agency with the pre-ſcience of Deity. Doct. Beattie, in his eſſay on truth, is perfectly ſatisfactory to the writer on this ſubject. He obſerves, it will be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally admitted that there are ſome things which the Deity cannot do; He cannot deceive, he cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit evil; theſe actions are contrary to the nature of a juſt and holy being, and therefore impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Neither is it more derogatory to the character of the Deity, to ſay, there are ſome things which he cannot
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:026954_0061_0FD2957B03B1DCA0"/>know; He has made man a free agent, and therefore cannot foreknow the actions he will commit, the one is inconſiſtent with the other.</p>
            <p>It will be objected to this hypotheſis, that the Deity, by thus circumſcribing himſelf, would be liable to have all his plans fruſtrated by the will of his creatures. What can man, that inſignificant ſpeck in the creation, do towards fruſtrating the great plans of the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent! He may, if he happens to be a monarch, excite wars, and thus occaſion the murder of millions of his fellow men. But can this affect the ſchemes of the Almighty? certainly not; for theſe things take place, and to ſuppoſe God the inſtigator of cruelties, is in the higheſt degree impious.</p>
            <p>By the doctrine of neceſſity the great author of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is diſgraced by an imputed partiality to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; a partiality which doomed from all eternity, certain individuals to everlaſting happineſs, and others to as durable a puniſhment. Every action, ſays the Predeſtinarian, muſt have been juſt as it was. It was utterly impoſſible that Nero ſhould not murder his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—that Richard ſhould not maſſacre his friends and family.—It was not the will of the man, but the decree of heaven that directed the blow; and the pious Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan had no more merit from his virtue, than the moſt rapacious aſſaſſin.</p>
            <p>Mr. Paine obſerves, that "the commandments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome good moral precepts; it is however neceſſary to except the declaration which ſays, that God viſits the ſins of the fathers upon the children. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to every principle of moral juſtice." To which our critic replies, "The innocent never ſuffer for the guilty, except in ſuch temporal calamities as neceſſarily
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:026954_0062_0FD2957D1633EA08"/>reſult from their parents crimes; as when the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy of one generation involves the next in poverty, or the like." What latitude he means to give to this phraſe, <hi>or the like,</hi> is uncertain. It is clear however that the ſin of our firſt parents can bear no reſemblance to the circumſtance he has adduced. Neither can we ſee any ſimilitude in the trifling, childiſh fault of Ham; which, if it can be called a crime, deſerved, and would have received from a <hi>ſober</hi> man of ſenſe, nothing more than a gentle reprimand.</p>
            <p>The inhuman curſe pronounced upon Canaan, and his poſterity, by his unnatural grand-father, when in a ſtate of intoxication (by being credited as the word of God) has perhaps been productive of evil, ſufficient to over-ballance the good effects attending the introduction of the chriſtian religion.</p>
            <p>It has tended to make a conſiderable portion of the human ſpecies miſerable. Chriſtians have the effron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to quote this curſe, in juſtification of a traffic, which the benevolent mind contemplates with abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Good God, how is thy name perverted to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the moſt execrable purpoſes of avarice and ambition!</p>
            <p>"The old teſtament hiſtory," ſays the Laym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, "Is unqueſtionably the moſt ancient hiſtory in the world; and gives the only account of the earlieſt ages which has the leaſt pretenſions to probability." It is we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve generally granted that the Chineſe date their hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory much farther back than the account of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as recorded in the old teſtament; but whether the one or the other have any pretenſions to probability is, in our opinion, what the Layman is incompetent to determine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:026954_0063_0FD2957EF3916698"/>
"The ſacred writers, like other hiſtorians, are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable only for facts, not for their morality. If the Jewiſh hiſtory is ſtrained with blood and cruelty, ſo is that of all other nations." Very true, but other hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians do not pretend that God commanded thoſe cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they relate; this conſtitutes a very material difference. It is but of little conſequence at this day to know whether the Jews actually went into the land of Canaan, and committed all the barbarities upon the innocent inhabitants, which their hiſtory relates. But it is of the utmoſt importance, in order that we gain juſt ideas of the Deity, to know whether he abſolutely headed the Jews, as his choſen people, and commanded them to diſtreſs another part of his creation with all the miſeries of a moſt cruel, vindictive war. The human mind, unprejudiced by education, ſhrinks with horror at the idea of calling ſuch hiſtories the word of a juſt and merciful God.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now cite a paſſage from our critic as a proof of his candour and credibility, "An evil ſpirit of God came upon Saul, and he propheſied," he ſays, "is taken from the book of Thomas Paine, whoſe and whoſe only is the text and comment." If he means that "an evil ſpirit <hi>of</hi> God," is found in the Age of Reaſon, it is falſe. And if he intends to ſay, "An evil ſpirit <hi>from</hi> God, &amp;c." is taken from the book of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Paine, he is ſo far right; but that it is found in him only, is not true: for in 1ſt Samuel, xviii, 10. "And it came to paſs, on the morrow, that the evil ſpirit from God came upon Saul, and he propheſied in the midſt of the houſe." See alſo chap. xvi. ver. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>"The old teſtament was that of God in his ancient character, as God of Iſrael; the new is that of Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:026954_0064_0FD295802AA3E0D8"/>Chriſt, our Redeemer and Mediator." To ſuppoſe that the immutable God, who has exiſted from all eternity the ſame, and who undoubtedly regards with equal care all his creatures, ſhould have two characters, one his ancient, peculiar to him as God of the Jews, the other his modern, as God of chriſtians, is ſupreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ridiculous; and ſhews to what extent of folly the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind may be carried, when reaſon, <hi>that beſt gift of God to man,</hi> is ſuperſeded by blind faith, and fanatic zeal.</p>
            <p>Our critic ſays, that Mr. Paine has committed a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in ſuppoſing that the Devil flew away with Jeſus Chriſt. He thinks it moſt probable that he took him "by the proper way of the ſtairs, to the higheſt part of the temple." The ſcripture however ſays, "The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil taketh him up, and ſetteth him on a pinnacle of the temple." But we conſider it of the moſt ſovereign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, by what way he is ſuppoſed to have taken him. The whole ſtory, that a fallen Angel, who had made a rebellion in heaven, for which he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in hell, ſhould, after this, tempt the Supreme Being to fall down and worſhip him, offering, at the ſame time, to give him all the kingdoms of the earth, which the Deity certainly muſt know he had no juſt claim to, is too contemptible for ridicule.</p>
            <p>Speaking of the Trinity, our critic obſerves the manner in which the Three are One, or the One is Three, is ſtill a myſtery, for it is not known, and perhaps never will be. But we "know as much as is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us to know," and have therefore no buſineſs to puſh our enquiries farther.</p>
            <p>This is the dernier reſort of the devotees to ſyſtems, indefenſible by reaſon—They ſhroud themſelves in a
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:026954_0065_0FD295846B5B9430"/>cloud of myſtery, and exclaim, "Far hence! far hence ye profane! the ground whereon ye tread is holy— here lie the ſecrets of the trade.—As the profeſſors of the doctrine of the Trinity acknowledge a renunciation of reaſon, it would be in vain to attempt by the force of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>on to convince them of its abſurdity.</p>
            <p>The chriſtian mythology, ſays Mr. P. has five Deities: there is God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghoſt, the God Providence and the Goddeſs Nature," "O ſhame on common ſenſe and condour! not only to miſrepreſent the doctrine of the Trinity, but to make chriſtians worſhippers of the Goddeſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! to ſay nothing of the abſurdity of making a God of Providence." We ſubmit Mr. Paine's defence on this article, to the candor of the reader. Is it not a common expreſſion, to ſay, <hi>Providence</hi> governs the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſairs of men? <hi>Nature</hi> has made nothing in vain? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing is meant by theſe phraſes, is beſt known to thoſe who uſe them.</p>
            <p>"It is allowed on all hands that Jeſus Chriſt did pretend to work miracles." This is not granted: for, as Mr. Paine ſays, Jeſus Chriſt wrote no account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The proof of his pretending to work miracles reſts upon hearſay evidence only. All the inferences therefore from this poſition are of no effect.</p>
            <p>Our Layman concludes thus "I ſhall take leave of the reader with obſerving from the cloſe of the pamphlet before us, the ſum total of all the diſcoveries of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern philoſophy in religion—Namely, that by reducing all religion to one ſingle article, the belief of a God, it cuts off every improvement in divine knowledge from the days of Adam—throws us back into the darkeſt ages of heatheniſm, levels us in this reſpect with the moſt
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:026954_0066_0FD295866DFADFC0"/>illiterate barbarians, and all the comfort it leaves us, as to futurity, is, that <hi>"the power that gave us exiſtence is able to contin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e it."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be difficult to calculate all the <hi>improvements in divine knowledge</hi> that have been made from the days of Adam to the preſent time. So various and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory have been the inventions of mankind on this ſubject. "They have annihilated the Supreme Being as much as was in their power: they have ſometimes made him a globe of fire; ſometimes an ox, ſometimes a tree, ſometimes a man, ſometimes a king. They have created God in their own image. They have made him capricious, avaricious, cruel, implacable. They have confined him in heaven as in a palace, and have only invited him on earth to ſolicit in their favor for tythes, riches, honors, pleaſures and power. The real prieſt of the Supreme Being is nature; his temple the univerſe, his worſhip virtue, his feſtivals the joy of a great people aſſembled in his preſence to unite in the mild bonds of univerſal fraternity, and to preſent to him the homage of pure and ſenſible hearts."</p>
            <p>The greateſt improvement that now remains to be made in <hi>divine knowledge</hi> is to revive again the ſimple religion of our firſt parents, the immediate workmanſhip of God. An improvement of this kind, as all others have experienced before, will undoubtedly meet with oppoſition from the bigoted, the we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k, and from thoſe whoſe intereſt it is to continue the preſent impoſitions. "To invite man to the pure worſhip of the Supreme Being, is to aim a fatal blow at fanaticiſm—All fictions will diſappear before truth, and all follies fall before reaſon. Unconſtrained, unperſecuted, all ſects muſt unite in the univerſal religion of nature."</p>

            <p>THIS production may be conſidered as a genuine ſiſter of the Folly of Reaſon. For, as in that work, the <hi>beliefs</hi> of the author aſſume the place of argument. The greateſt merit of this pamphlet is the appearance of a good intention in the writer.</p>
            <p>Mr. S. firſt tells us that "The Age of Reaſon," is, in his opinion, the offspring of ignorance <hi>concerning</hi> the ſcriptures, though he does not point out in what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſtance this ignorance appears.</p>
            <p>The reading of Mr. S. has been ſo much confined to Holy Writ, that he ſuppoſes Mr. Paine entirely indebted to that work for theſe phraſes, "doing juſtice," and "loving mercy."</p>
            <p>He aſſerts, "It is not found in all the bible, that God puniſhes the children for their father's ſins, the children being innocent;" Whereas frequent inſtances of this kind are mentioned in that book: for example, in Joſhua
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:026954_0068_0FD2958DE20C2BD8"/>vii. 24, 26. we find that for the ſin of Acham, the ſon of Zorah, himſelf, his ſons, daughters, oxen, aſſes, ſheep, tent, and all that he had, were burnt.</p>
            <p>Mr. S. ſays, that within the circle of his acquaintance, he has known an inſtance of a Jew's embracing the chriſtian religion, and therefore he "<hi>flatly</hi> denies" Mr. Paine's <hi>impious</hi> aſſertion that the Jews never credited the ſtory concerning the birth of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Our author informs us that the practice of "ſigning wills in the preſence of two or three witneſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>," is "an example we take from the bible." Which he thinks ought to eſtabliſh the authenticity of the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>He ſays, "The Lord of the Univerſe, in order to teach mankind their duty to God and their fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in a <hi>way the moſt eaſy to their comprehenſion,</hi> conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to impregnate the womb of a virgin."</p>
            <p>Why there was any neceſſity of an example of this kind, from the <hi>Lord of the Univerſe,</hi> to teach mankind their <hi>duty,</hi> is beſt known to the author of the <hi>"Guide to Reaſon."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our knowing one concludes with this wholeſome advice "Know thyſelf. If you learn this you will ſee how <hi>conſiſtent</hi> the bible is with <hi>your</hi> condition, and how <hi>conſiſtent</hi> the laws of <hi>our</hi> country are to <hi>our</hi> well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."—According to the good old doctrine of nonre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and paſſive obedience.</p>
            <p>As theſe ſalutary conſequences cannot follow to the inhabitants of many parts of Europe, from knowing themſelves, we conclude "The Guide to Reaſon" was intended and calculated for the ſmall circle of the author's acquaintance, with a particular reference to his Jew-Chriſtian.</p>

            <p>He obſerves, that, Mr. Paine has reſerved this work for an advanced period of his life—or as Lord Kaime ſays of his ſketches, "it is the child of his gray hairs." As Kaime's ſketches of man is a work of very great me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:026954_0070_0FD29590E4A28A40"/>the compariſon here inſtituted is highly favorable to our author.</p>
            <p>He continues, "However unfortunate it is, the fact is undeniable, that men, during the decays of old age and the failure of intellectual faculties, conſtantly think themſelves growing wiſer." Upon another occaſion, when deſcanting upon the French revolution, wiſhing to depreciate the merits of thoſe, whoſe policy and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm have confounded the combined world, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting them as young, inexperienced madmen, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, "In all ages of the world young men have thought old men to be fools: and in all ages, old men have known young men to be fools." So, we ſee, this gentleman's ſentiments can vibrate to either ſide of a queſtion, as beſt ſuits the particular point, he may wiſh to eſtabliſh.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Paine admits a revelation, a word of God, and this is the creation we behold. He goes on to deſcribe this word of God; gives a ſhort account of the ſolar ſyſtem, and by the familiar and even vulgar manner of explaining it, it is evident he wrote his <hi>Age of Reaſon</hi> for common readers in France and America." Certainly; Mr. Paine, that univerſal friend of mankind, writes for the world, he does not wiſh to have his works adapted ſolely to thoſe who aſſume the appellation of <hi>learned,</hi> and whoſe knowledge frequently conſiſts in a long catalogue of hard, tecnical terms.—None but pedants will condemn his writings on this account.</p>
            <p>As the remaining paſſages of the Age of Reaſon, which are noticed by the Reviewer, have been vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the courſe of this work, we paſs on to his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral remarks upon the effects of this publication. "Certain it is, that the tendency of ſuch books, which
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:026954_0071_0FD295922F0F93B0"/>are induſtriouſly circulated by certain democrats, is to level Jeſus Chriſt, as well as the monarchies of the earth. We truſt however that the body of the people in America have too much good ſenſe to be deceived, and that they will not exchange good laws, freedom and a pure religion, for the principles of anarchy, and infidelity,"</p>
            <p>Paſſing over this important diſcovery and the fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner in which it is announced to the public, we notice the baſe inſinuation by which the author intended to prejudice the minds of the vulgar againſt democrats; as tho' they were the only people in the world who had any thing to do with the <hi>Age of Reaſon;</hi> as tho' they were all infidels and anarchiſts. Are religious opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in this, or any other country, a criterion by which to determine political ſentiments? Is infidelity or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm a ſure ſign of a democrat? Will any man of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter hazard this aſſertion? On the contrary, it is a notorious fact that the men of letters and information in France (the clergy not excepted) were almoſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally deiſts, before the revolution. It is alſo notorious that the moſt ſtrenuous ſupporters of the Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are at this moment deiſts; notwithſtanding their hypocritical pretentions for continuing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent religious war againſt the <hi>infidels</hi> of France. And even the New-York Reviewer himſelf has been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore known to be on the ſide of natural religion, altho' he now ſo zealouſly joins chorus with the weak and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning againſt <hi>the Age of Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In America ſtrong religious prejudices have been cultivated in the minds of the people; which has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered circumſpection on this point very neceſſary for
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:026954_0072_0FD29595327F5288"/>thoſe who were ſeeking for places of office. Theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, altho' carefully foſtered by certain illiberal writers, are faſt wearing away. And the doors to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and power will ſoon be open to all ſects alike.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to "good laws" and "freedom," what have they to do with this ſubject? Are not deiſts as peaceable members of ſociety, and have they not as juſt ideas of <hi>freedom,</hi> as any other ſect? And as to "pure religion" the deiſts, in this point, have certainly the advantage: their religion being perfectly pure, ſimple and unmixed, its profeſſors believing in one God only; whereas the chriſtian religion is very complex, its vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries acknowledging a God, conſiſting of three perſons, one of whom is <hi>part</hi> man.</p>
            <p>Thus does this <hi>ſoi deſant,</hi> Eſquire, determine the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of all performances, by his ſcale of politics. If they claſh in the leaſt with this, they are immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be Antifederal, Democratical, Jacobinical, Anarchial, &amp;c. &amp;c. This kind of <hi>abracadabra</hi> may have a tendency to amuſe the ignorant and weak, but with the ſenſible part of the community can have no effect.</p>
            <p>This ſame Reviewer, in his eulogium on a work tending to eſtabliſh "the genuineneſs and authenticity of the new teſtament," commences with the following remarks:</p>
            <p>"At a time, when a falſe philoſophy and falſe liberty are attempting to break down all the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers which wiſdom, divine and human, has raiſed to guard the moral and ſocial ſtate of man from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of turbulent paſſions; when Jacobiniſm in religion and in politics, is aiming to level all authority, human and ditine; to place the young and uniformed above
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:026954_0073_0FD2941387363100"/>the venerable ſage, and raiſe the throne of a capricious reaſon on the ruins of chriſtianity; it gives us peculiar pleaſure to find able champions of our faith among the diſtinguiſhed leterati of our own country."</p>
            <p>He might as well tell us of Jacobiniſm in huſbandry, architecture or navigation, as in religion, the ſubjects have no connection. We are furpriſed that this critic has not noticed the Telegraphe, late diſcovered in France, and condemned it as a Jacobinical invention. We are perſuaded that were he acquainted with the political ſentiments of Mr. Herſchel, and found them favorable to the French revolution, he would convert his planet into a member of the Jacobin club.</p>
            <p>Thus are all improvements in moral and natural philoſophy, in the arts and ſciences, liable to be arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Jacobinical inovations. Reaſon, which was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently intended by the Creator, as a guide to our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is ſet down as "capricious" and incompetent to the purpoſe. We muſt follow blindly the ſyſtems, which chance or deſign has adopted, becauſe it is moſt for the convenience of the few, who live upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of the many.</p>
            <p>"We truſt, however, that the body of people in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, have too much good ſenſe to be deceived, and that they will not exchange" their <hi>reaſon</hi> for arbitrary ſyſtems, contrary to it, and which of courſe diſgrace it.</p>
            <p>Our Reviewer, at the cloſe of his obſervations on the pamphlet under conſideration, introduces a <hi>new idea</hi> reſpecting the mode of worſhip inſtituted in France, which <hi>he thinks</hi> of great importance, and ſeems much pleaſed at having been the firſt to make the diſcovery.</p>
            <p>"The French have aboliſhed chriſtianity, and renewed the mythology of the ancient Greeks and Romans, by
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:026954_0074_0FD2959ED44DFF80"/>erecting certain virtues, as juſtice, truth, patriotiſm, &amp;c. into divinities to be worſhipped, and actually inſtituting feſtivals and erecting temples in honor of theſe viſionary, metaphyſical, undefined deities. This was the preciſe origin of the pagan idolatry—the foundation on which the whole ſyſtem of ancient mythology was erected; and out of which grew all its abſurdities and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This idea ſeems not to have been ſtarted in America; but it is juſt.</p>
            <p>We are willing to give our critic <hi>all the honor</hi> of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſtarted</hi> this idea, and are convinced that he is ſtill alone in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>: For, when we read the decree of the convention, reſpecting national feſtivals, we are perſuaded that no other perſon has ever entertained ſo whimſical a notion.</p>
            <p>The convention, after hearing a lengthy report on the ſubject of national feſtivals, which particularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces the belief of the unity of God, decreed as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>

            <p n="2">2. They acknowledge that a worſhip worthy of the Supreme Being, is to practiſe the duties of men, and they claſs among theſe duties, the deteſtation of treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery and tyranny; the puniſhment of tyrants and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; the ſuccouring of the unfortunate; reſpect for the weakneſs of men—the defending the oppreſſed; the doing to others all the good we are capable of; and injuring no one.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They will inſtitute feſtivals to recal men to the remembrance of the divinity, and to the dignity of their being.</p>

According to this <hi>new idea</hi> of the Reviewer, all theſe feſtivals muſt be transformed into deities, for each one is as fair a candidate as the others.

            <p>Finally, Does this ſhortſighted, partial Reviewer, in his zeal for ſupporting ancient ſyſtems, hope to arreſt the inveſtigating ſpirit of the preſent age—does he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſtop the revolutionary principles, which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading almoſt all parts of the globe—and <hi>can he wiſh</hi> to continue thoſe religious prejudices that have already deluged the world in blood?—Humanity revolts at the idea!—and philoſophy and reaſon look down with contempt upon ſuch feeble eſſays to check their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>

            <head>VINDICATION OF OUR AUTHOR'S CHARACTER AND WRITINGS, IN ANSWER TO AN ANONYMOUS PUBLICA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION IN A PHILADELPHIA PAPER.</head>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the illiberal writer, in your evening paper of Monday, upon the Age of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Thomas Paine, ſcarcely deſerves notice, he ſhall not paſs without ſome obſervations from one who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately acquainted with that excellent writer, and his works, which will be read and admired when this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famer, will be conſigned to contempt and oblivion: And I am not a little ſurprized, that ſuch a jargon of ſeandal, falſhood and abuſe, againſt one of our beſt and moſt valuable Patriots, ſhould find admittance in an American paper.</p>
            <p>He ſays "this Pamphlet, the Age of Reaſon, has been thrown on the public, as a baſtard is laid in the ſtreets, without a typographic dad, or mam, to claim the brat, with an intention to juſtify the title;" this is an impudent and a fooliſh falſhood, for Mr. Paine avows <hi>the brat</hi> and has given his name to it.</p>
            <p>Mankind have from the firſt of time been going on in improvement, and of conſequence it is to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that by "the <hi>fag end</hi> of the 18th century," ſubjects will be more thoroughly diſcuſſed, and better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, than they were at the <hi>fag end</hi> of the 17th.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of then proceeding to make his ſtrictures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the book, he ſtops to give you the hiſtory of its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, which is a mixture of miſrepreſentation, and falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Mr. Paine was known in England both as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot and a writer, before he came to America, his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication in behalf of the inferior officers of the Revenue, gained him great credit, and many friends, though it
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:026954_0078_0FD295A54DF1C748"/>coſt him his place;
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>This muſt mean only a News-paper publication, as Mr. Paine expreſsly declares that the work entitled, Common Senſe, was the firſt book he ever publiſhed.</hi>
               </note> it was for that and not for the deficiency in his accounts, for he had none, being only a ſurveyor, that a vile and corrupt government diſplaced him, and it was Dr. Franklin himſelf who was the cauſe of his coming to this country. The laſt ten lines of this paragraph contain as audacious an untruth, as ever inſulted the public;
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>The paſſage alluded to is as follows: "It appears moreover that the people of England did not reliſh his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, quite as well as he expected; and that for one of his laſt pieces, as deſtructive to the peace and happineſs of their country, they threatened our knight-errant with ſuch ſerious vengeance that, to avaid a trip to Botany-bay, he fled over to France, as a leſs dangerous voyage."</hi>
               </note> the truth is Mr. Paine publiſhed the ſecond part of the Rights of Man in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and remained many months after in that city. He was then elected a member of the National Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for two places, he choſe to repreſent Calais, and a deputation was ſent to Dover, where he embarked pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liely at noon day, and the ſame deputation accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to Paris, where he took his ſeat.</p>
            <p>It is true his ſame went before him; it is true he continued his hatred of Kings and tyrants, yet he voted againſt the death of Louis 16th—but his intimacy with Briſſot who tranſlated and read his ſpeeches, and who has ſince been executed for conſpiracy, and treaſon, was the cauſe of his arreſtation, and of his being confined in the palace of Luxembourgh in Paris, and not in the Caſtle of Luxembourgh which I ſuppoſe this writer would have us underſtand; the remainder of this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph is too contemptible for notice.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, theſe daſtardly attacks upon Mr. Paine's political character, can do him little harm among a people who remember his exertions in the cauſe of Liberty, and the good effects they produced.</p>

            </head>
            <p>OUR <hi>Reverend Divine,</hi> after quoting ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached paſſages from <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> as a charm againſt the powers of reaſon, commences his addreſs as follows:</p>
            <p>"Unpleaſing is the office to expoſe an individual to public obloquy on account of the impropriety of his conduct. The intereſts, however, of virtue and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; the good of human ſociety, and various other particulars, often render ſuch a meaſure, not only juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable but neceſſary."</p>
            <p>Here we obſerve, this apoſtle of "virtue and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on," inſtead of confuting "the Age of Reaſon," pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to traduce the character of its author.</p>
            <p>If the advocates of the chriſtian religion are reduced to this expedient, it is a ſhrewd ſign that they ſuſpect the weakneſs and fallacy of the arguments which are adduced in ſupport of it. How can "impropriety of conduct," alter the <hi>eternal principles of truth,</hi> eſtabliſhed in the "Age of Reaſon?" The ſentiments, advanced in that work, muſt ſtand or fall by their own intrinſic merits.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Paine during the American Revolution, by his patriotic writings and ſervices, juſtly obtained our
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:026954_0080_0FD295A9EA22C610"/>eſteem and applauſe."—Were we as uncharitable as our opponent, we might here obſerve, that this praiſe comes from a ſuſpected quarter; as a <hi>certain order</hi> in America were almoſt univerſally oppoſed to our Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and of courſe to the writings of Thomas Paine on that ſubject. Indeed many parts of this addreſs tend to confirm our ſuſpicions on this point.</p>
            <p>"And it was hoped, he having returned to Europe, that we ſhould ever have had occaſion to have revered his name." Why a perſon who "by his patriotic wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and ſervices," had juſtly merited ſo much "eſteem and applauſe," in America, could not have ſtill been "revered," in this country, without returning to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, is beſt known to the learned gentleman who makes this remark.</p>
            <p>— "to perſuade us to renounce the divine ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of chriſtianity, which alo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>— "it becomes a duty, that the unwary may be preſerved from ſeduction, to diveſt this deiſtical en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt and incendiary of his maſk, and to exhibit him in his genuine character."</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to apply language more improperly than is expreſſed in the paſſage before us. Where is the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:026954_0081_0FD295AC51FF7BA0"/>man on earth, that has appeared more open, more can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, more intriped and perſevering in the cauſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, than Thomas Paine?

To accuſe him then of wearing a maſk is the height of preſumption and folly. Be aſſured, ſir, that it is impoſſible to palm upon the Americans, <hi>a maſked incendiary,</hi> as the "genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine character," of Thomas Paine; and that whoever attempts it, will do it, at the expence of their veracity and reputation.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould deiſm be the conſtant theme of abuſe for bigots of all other perſuaſions? Have not its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors an equal right to the free enjoyment of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious principles?

            <p>Knowledge is ſpread abroad;—the ſhackles of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition are broken—mankind have began to reflect—the idea of the awfulneſs of the ſubject, and the profanity of doubting the authenticity of the ſcriptures, will now frighten none but children and dotards.—If the truth of chriſtianity cannot be defended by fair reaſoning, it ought not, and cannot be ſupported in a country, where freedom of ſpeech and writing is allowed. At leaſt, if it cannot be made to appear that it has a better effect on ſociety than deiſm, the ſyſtem, with the fables that gave riſe to it, muſt ſail, and be no more heard of, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:026954_0082_0FD295ADCD958618"/>as we now relate the ſtories of witches, to ſhew the credulity and ignorance of former ages.</p>
            <p>That a religion, which naturally excites ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm—which has cauſed ſo many cruel wars, and conſequent miſery to mankind, will not, upon fair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation, be thought preferable in effects to the mild, unpaſſionate religion of nature, is evident. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expect the gradual riſe of deiſm upon the ruins of the chriſtian ſyſtem, and adviſe all ſectaries to prepare their minds for this event.</p>
            <p>Deiſm will conſequently introduce modes of worſhip conſiſtent with the character of <hi>reaſonable beings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Temples of <hi>reaſon</hi> will ſucceed temples of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; lectures on moral philoſophy and other uſeful ſubjects will then be delivered from the pulpit.

This doctrine will take place of <hi>faith, miſtery, miracle,</hi> and <hi>prophecy:</hi> And thus a ſeventh part of the time be profitably, and agrecably ſpent, which is now ſacrificed at the ſhrine of bigotry and folly.</p>
            <p>Many of the clergy, no doubt, would give their hearty aſſent for the introduction of this ſyſtem; but it would not anſwer their purpoſe to propoſe it: the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation muſt be gradually effected by enlightening the minds of the people.</p>
