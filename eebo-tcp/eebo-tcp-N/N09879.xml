            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT is to you I dedicate this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and beg your protection of the ſame, hoping it will meet with a kind reception.</p>
            <p>THE approbation men of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and ſenſe have given the following Work, has made me venture it into your hands: And I hope in the peruſal you will keep in view the Author, I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you cannot then fail of making great allowances.

               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:012572_0004_0F8B147632063E70"/>
And when you know that, it alone may be judged by ſome, ſufficient to brand me with the hateful name of <hi>Tory,</hi> and thereby condemn this Diſſuaſion. But let me inform you (for there is no general rule without an excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that I am a moſt ſincere well-wiſher to the common cauſe of <hi>Liberty,</hi> both <hi>perſonal</hi> and <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional;</hi> then you will, give me a place in the liſt of your ſtaunch Friends, and accept of this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, as intended to be a mean of aboliſhing one great part of <hi>Slavery</hi> here.</p>
            <p>IF there is any merit in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſet free from <hi>Bondage</hi> our fellow creatures, and in trying to promote the good and welfare of any nation, province, country,

or individual, ſurely I may claim it; for my ſincere endeavour is to theſe purpoſes: And if I ſhould happen to miſs my aim, I ſhall ſit down ſatisfied with the merit of a good intent.</p>
            <p>READERS, I have but one favour to aſk of you, which is, to peruſe this Performance with an open unbiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mind; overlooking any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects you may obſerve in theſe ſheets, knowing they are the haſty and undigeſted thoughts of the Author, put together with more good intent than ability; after this you may either reject or practiſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own conſciences, and the light of this Treatiſe, if there is any to be found in it. <hi>Enſlav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> your fellow men, and uſing and maſſacring them as they do in the

               <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> and Southern Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is a matter of too great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be only ſlightly thought of. And as I hope you have the <hi>humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>Britons,</hi> and that <hi>love of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> with which every true <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is, or ought to be poſſeſſed of, you will not countenance it, but declare yourſelves as I do, <hi>well-wiſhers of the Britiſh Empire, and conſequently enemies to</hi> Slavery.</p>
            <p>ACCEPT then, Friends and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in one common cauſe, this ſmall token of that love and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which I bear to freedom, (for no country can be called free where there is one Slave) and give me leave to ſubſcribe myſelf,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I HAD not well arrived in <hi>America,</hi> when caſting my eyes on ſo many Black Slaves, I immediately found a warm incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ariſe in my breaſt, to do my endeavours for relieving them by publiſhing to the world my ſentiments upon their ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="x" facs="unknown:012572_0008_0F8B147B29B46828"/>SCARCE had I time to draw a breath of this air, before I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately applied myſelf to enquire into the ſtate of this <hi>Slavery,</hi> and the conſtitution upon which it is founded, and having met with proper preliminaries by way of foundation for a ſmall Treatiſe, I ſet myſelf to work in forming, and in ſhort finiſhed this Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>FROM the conſideration of the ſmallneſs of this production, and my inability to treat the ſubject properly, I was nigh reſolving not to prefix my name hereto: But thinking again, ſome oppoſite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might take hold of that, I thought it moſt proper to ſhew my common ſignature, knowing
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:012572_0009_0F8B147BF40634F0"/>
the cauſe I defend is good and well founded.</p>
            <p>SOME will no doubt be ſurpriſed that I have wrote this Diſſuaſion after the form of a Sermon: It is eaſily accounted for. A Sermon being <hi>a diſcourſe of inſtruction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by a Divine for the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people.</hi> I am no Divine nor ever expect to be; but I hope that is no reaſon why theſe ſheets ſhould not be of publick benefit, as my deſign was for that end; I choſe to write it in this form, as being the trueſt way to diſplay with perſpicuity and plainneſs the unlawfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Slave Trade, for which purpoſe I have attempted it in different heads and branches, in ſome of which
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:012572_0010_0F8B147CCBA0A388"/>
are contained many pertinent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks or obſervations on this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human Commerce; and I thought further, it was the eaſieſt method for myſelf, and plaineſt for my Readers; it being intended for the weakeſt and higheſt capacities.</p>
            <p>IT may be objected by ſome, that the writings on this ſubject are too numerous already. I anſwer, that however many there may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, (although I could find but very few) yet there are none ſo full as not to admit of amendments or improvements: If ſo, and that theſe may not altogether be of inconſiderable uſe to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, why may not I make them? and why may they not be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to mankind?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:012572_0011_0F8B147D799180C8"/>A TREATISE of this kind may not be unneceſſary, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Books, Pamphlets, and Letters have been publiſhed on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>BUT however ineffectual this Treatiſe may prove hereafter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, this I comfort myſelf with, it is as full, conſidering the largeneſs, as any upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which I have ſeen; and there are few arguments that poſſibly could be advanced, or citations drawn from Scripture concerning man-ſelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that have eſcaped, in trying to wean men from this baſe and inhuman trade. And in fine, if this Work meets with encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement equal to the Author's care and endeavours to make it
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:012572_0012_0F8B147E2F488DA0"/>
the moſt uſeful of the kind, by having the deſired effect he ſhall eſteem himſelf ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</p>
            <p>WITH regard to the Diſſuaſion, I leave the Reader to judge, after having read it over cooly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, whether it ought to be approved or diſapproved; if the former, it will no doubt meet with his protection in publick. But I have ſomething to aſk, which I beg may not be refuſed, and that is, if you have not a fund of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience laid up in ſtore, before you begin to peruſe it, you are requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lay it aſide, until you have.</p>
            <p>THERE is one ſmall part of it taken from <hi>Poſtlethwayt</hi>'s Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:012572_0013_0F8B147EE97937D0"/>
of Commerce. Another part from <hi>A. Benezett</hi>'s Caution to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her Colonies, both which Authors I am very glad were born before me, they having aſſiſted me ſo far. And with regard to the remaining part, I can tell where it came from.</p>
            <p>AS it is neceſſary in order to bring about a change in any, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly a publick affair, to touch the minds of the people with a juſt and true ſenſe of the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the thing wanted to be removed, that to the end they may be unanimous in the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment thereof; this Diſſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I am convinced you will find upon peruſal, is calculated for that purpoſe, and am very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:012572_0014_0F8B14811242CE00"/>
that it alone never can ſtrike the great blow without the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative force added to it.</p>
            <p>I WILL detain you no longer; indeed I have almoſt run into an Introduction amidſt this Preface: But it could not well be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the connexion between them was ſo great, and had I ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated them, I ſhould have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred your diſpleaſure, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the Prolegomenas to a degree larger than the Diſſuaſion itſelf.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE ſubject of which theſe few ſheets treat, would have been one of the laſt I ſhould have ventured upon, had not the deluſion of the men who are concerned in enſlaving the people called <hi>Negroes</hi> appeared ſo glaring, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction that the <hi>Slave Trade</hi> bears to Chriſtianity, prompted me to it.</p>
            <p>I SHALL be as cool and impartial in treating of this matter, as any Britiſh ſubject or Chriſtian can: But why do I ſay cool? It is impoſſible I ſhould ſpeak cooly of ſuch baſe, unchriſtian, and inhuman practices, in a land of Liberty and Chriſtianity: However, in caſe any thing ſhould be mentioned in the ſequel that may give unintended offence to any perſon, I hope the tender feelings for theſe diſtreſſed Captives, with which I am poſſeſſed, and the warmth that is in my breaſt, to have this Trade aboliſhed, will be ſufficient excuſe.</p>
            <p>I PROPOSE dividing the following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe into theſe different heads.</p>

            <p n="3">III. The diſadvantages ariſing from this baſe Trade.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. THE advantages ariſing from aboliſhing it. And,</p>
            <p n="5">V. CONCLUDE with a ſhort admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe concerned, and a method to put the Trade to <hi>Africa</hi> on a juſt and lawful footing.</p>
            <p>THE firſt-head was, That the cuſtom of making Slaves of our fellow creatures, is expreſſly againſt the revealed laws of GOD. And in treating of this part, I ſhall divide it into the following branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. 1ſt. By the laws of GOD, <hi>He that ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſelleth a man, ſhall be put to death.</hi> 2d. <hi>He in whoſe hands he ſhall be found, ſhall be put to death,</hi> by the ſame laws. 3d. <hi>He that buyeth a Servant and ſerveth him ſix years, ſhall ſet him free the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, and furniſh him liberally with what he hath.</hi> And 4th. <hi>If thy Brother,</hi> that is, your fellow-creature, <hi>be ſold
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012572_0017_0F8B1482C5891570"/>
unto thee, thou ſhall not compel him to ſerve as a Bond-man; but as an hired Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE firſt branch under this head is, <hi>He that ſtealeth and ſelleth a man, ſhall be put to death.</hi> This is one of the moſt expreſs laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Exod.</hi> xxi. 16, two firſt, and laſt clauſes of the verſe, there mentioned in the moſt peremptory words; <hi>And he that ſtealeth a man, and ſelleth him, ſhall ſurely be put to death.</hi> It certainly can be looked upon in no other light in the Merchants and Ship-maſters who are in this Trade to <hi>Africa,</hi> than ſtealing of men, being acceſſary to, and aiding in inciting them to war one with another, and for this purpoſe, ſupplying them with prodigious quantities of arms and ammunition, whereby they are hurried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to confuſion, bloodſhed, and all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of temporal miſery, which muſt conſequently beget in their minds ſuch a general deteſtation and ſcorn of the Chriſtian name, as may deeply affect, if not wholly preclude, their belief of the great truths of our holy religion. Thus an inſatiable deſire of gain prevails with their Kings, who, inſtead of being protectors of their people, for this alluring
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012572_0018_0F8B14836AD1F1D0"/>
bait laid before them, by the <hi>European</hi> and <hi>American</hi> Factors, or Ship-maſters, invade the Liberties of theſe unhappy people, and occaſion their opreſſion. Theſe Kings, whenever they want goods ſend to the Ship-maſters, acquainting them they have Negroes, and ſometimes the Factors and Ship-maſters ſend to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them, that they have a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of goods, and want Slaves for the ſame. Theſe Chiefs, whether they have Slaves then or not, agree, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately go to war with their neighbours, and in procuring three or four hundred priſoners, burn five or ſix towns, as appears by the following extract from a Surgeon's Journal in a <hi>Liverpool</hi> veſſel.</p>

            <p>HERE follows another relation taken from an original Journal of a Surgeon who ſailed out of <hi>New-York,</hi>
               <q>Being on the Coaſt of <hi>Guinea</hi> at a place called <hi>Baſalia,</hi> the Commander of the veſſel, according to cuſtom, ſent a perſon on ſhore, with a preſent to the King, acquainting him with his arrival, and informing him they wanted a cargo of Slaves. The King promiſed to furniſh them, and in order to do it, ſet out to war againſt his enemies; deſigning alſo to ſurpriſe ſome town, and take all
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012572_0020_0F8B14883482A468"/>
the people priſoners: Some time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the King ſent them word, he had not yet met with the deſired ſucceſs, having been twice repulſed in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to break up two towns; but that he ſtill hoped to procure a number of Slaves for them, and in this deſign perſiſted, until he met his enemies in the field, where a battle was fought, which laſted three days, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which time, the engagement was ſo bloody that four thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men were ſlain on the ſpot. Think (ſays he) what a pitiful ſight it was to ſee the Widows weeping over their loſt Huſbands, Orphans deploring the loſs of their Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
Oh! ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpectacles! to ſee four or five towns burnt, and four thouſand five hundred people killed, for the ſake of taking three or four hundred, and you! you! Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Ship-maſters and Factors the cauſe of it all! Think you ever to get the crime of ſpilling ſo much blood repented of?</p>
            <p>IT is a known cuſtom among the Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who reſide in <hi>Africa,</hi> and the Ship-maſters who trade there, to corrupt many Negroes on the ſea coaſt, who ſtop at no act of cruelty for gain. They
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012572_0021_0F8B1488AEC7AD70"/>
make it a practice, to ſteal abundance of little Blacks of both ſexes, when found on the roads, or in the fields, where their Parents keep them all day to watch the corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Can it be denied that the <hi>Africans</hi> are <hi>ſtolen</hi> after ſo many proofs of it, and if it is not direct ſtealth in the Ship-maſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet it is the ſame in effect; for if they did not go there and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the Chiefs with money or goods, there would be no wars, as is the caſe at preſent; and there would be none ſtolen if the ſtealers were not bribed by the Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or Ship-maſters; and not only thoſe that are made Slaves of, there would ſtill be ten thouſand others who are killed in the broils, that would be ſaved, were they to diſcontinue this baſe Trade.</p>
            <p>THUS far I have ſhewn that they are ſtolen. They may ſay they pay for them. I anſwer, they give money or goods by way of price to ſome of the Princes and Negroes, who, for the ſake of lucre, take them priſoners by war or ſtealth, ſo that what money they give theſe ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drels, (forgive me the expreſſion; for, what name can a man expect who would take his Father or Brother and ſell them for gain?) who take them in theſe ways
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012572_0022_0F8B148975329B48"/>
cannot be looked upon as a price paid in lieu, for the Negroes themſelves never condeſcend to be mancipated, as they get none of the money that is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly given for them. They at length arrive at the port, the Ship-maſter ſell them at a moſt exorbitant profit, and in a few voyages he makes what he calls his fortune; this is all he aimed at and wiſhed for; and what follows, ſecures his eternal deſtruction, unleſs timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of: For the truth of this, I could mention very ſtriking inſtances of men, who I ſee almoſt every day; but do not chuſe mentioning names, for fear of ſeeing them contemned and deſpiſed by every well thinking perſon.</p>
            <p>I NEED add no more on this branch, it being clear that they are ſtolen in every ſenſe it can be taken; they, the Ship-maſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being the ſole cauſe of the many wars and broils that are amongſt the Negro Princes and Chiefs, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the cauſe of theſe poor creatures being taken and made Slaves of, and of the many thouſands that are killed in the wars: Beſides, it is not, nor can be denied, that they ſell them, ſo that they who practiſe this branch of Man-ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012572_0023_0F8B148A36996EA8"/>
and ſelling can expect nothing but the penalties of GOD's laws, which he, in his own time, will inflict, ſince man! indolent man! will not puniſh them with death, as warranted ſufficiently by the above cited paſſage in holy writ.</p>
            <p>BEFORE I leave this branch it may not he improper to give my Readers a ſhort ſketch of the barbarous uſage theſe unhappy people meet with from the Ship-maſters in their paſſage from <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi> After they have got them on board ſhackled two and two together, they keep them confined below all the paſſage, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver permitting more than two on deck at a time to take one breath of freſh air, the moſt common bleſſing we enjoy, conſcious that they are doing wrong to theſe people, and not certain but GOD might raiſe them againſt the Ship-maſter and his crew, if they had the leaſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſtir up an inſurrection in the ſhip, to retrieve their Liberty which they had in their own country, and which then ought to enjoy by the laws of GOD, of <hi>Britain,</hi> and the Plantations.</p>
            <p>FOR the Reader's true ſatisfaction as to this inhuman and unchriſtian uſage, which could be expected of no other
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012572_0024_0F8B148AF494E060"/>
than Barbarians, I ſhall here narrate ſome accounts which have been given by men concerned ni the Slave Trade.</p>
            <p>FIRST, the following caſe is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in <hi>Aſtley</hi>'s Collection of Voyages, by <hi>John Atkins,</hi> Surgeon on board Admiral <hi>Ogle</hi>'s ſquadron,
<q>Of one <hi>Harding,</hi> Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a veſſel, in which ſeveral of the Men-ſlaves and a Woman-ſlave had attempted to riſe in order to recover their Liberty; ſome of whom the Maſter of his own authority ſentenced to cruel deaths, making them firſt eat the hearts and liver of one of thoſe he killed. The woman he hoiſted by the thumbs, whiped, and ſlaſhed with knives before other Slaves, until ſhe died.</q>
Oh unparralelled cruelty!</p>
            <p>NEXT is an account given by a Ship-maſter who brought a Cargo of Slaves to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> upon an enquiry what had been the ſucceſs of the voyage, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<q>That he had found it a difficult matter to ſet the Negroes a fighting with each other in order to procure the number he wanted.</q>
This ſhews, Reader, what methods they practiſe to obtain theſe Slaves, <hi>by ſetting them a fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with each other.</hi>
               <q>But when he had
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012572_0025_0F8B148BAB3ECD00"/>
obtained his end, having filled his veſſel with Slaves, a new difficulty aroſe from their refuſal to take food: Thoſe deſperate creatures chuſing rather to die with hunger than to be carried from their native country.</q>
Upon a further enquiry how he got them to forego this deſperate reſolution, he anſwered,
<q>That he obliged all the Negroes to come on deck, where they perſiſting in their reſolution of not taking food, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſailors to lay hold on one of the moſt obſtinate, who chopped the poor creature into ſmall pieces, forcing ſome of the others to eat a part of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled body; ſwearing to the ſurvivors, that he would uſe them all one after the other in the ſame manner if they did not conſent to eat.</q>
This horrid execution he applauded as a good act, it having had the deſired effect in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to take food.</p>
            <p>"AS deteſtable and ſhocking as theſe uſages to the poor Negroes may appear to ſuch whoſe hearts are not yet hardened by the practiſe of that cruelty which the love of wealth by degrees introduceth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the human mind, it will not be ſtrange to thoſe who have been concerned or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Trade."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:012572_0026_0F8B148C6C825D08"/>THE ſecond branch was, <hi>If he be found in his hands, he ſurely ſhall be put to death.</hi> This is the third and fourth clauſe of the before cited verſe in <hi>Exod. If he be found in his hands.</hi> This is to be underſtood in two ſenſes, either found in the Ship-maſter's hands who ſtole him, or bought, as he ſay, or in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's hands who purchaſes him. As to the firſt of theſe ſenſes in which this paſſage may be taken, if the laws of GOD, yea, even of man, were to be put into execution, he, the ſtealer, or even the buyer, would be puniſhed with death, for it is clear as to Man-ſtealing, that it deſerves death, by the above paſſage of Scripture, and it is no leſs with regard to buying: But why do I ſay buying? For no money can be equal to the worth of a man: Buying, I admit that word becauſe Ship-maſters and others in this Trade, ſay, for their juſtification that they purchaſed the Negroes, but as there are no laws, either of GOD or man, for the buying and ſtealing of <hi>Africans,</hi> I am inclined to think it cannot be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but they juſtly deſerve death. And in the ſecond ſenſe, the man who buys the <hi>Africans</hi> or Negroes is full as culpable as the ſtealer, and liable to the ſame
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012572_0027_0F8B148D749015D0"/>
puniſhment, for Scripture does not point out particularly either of them, but only juſt, <hi>If he be found in his hands,</hi> that is, in any man's hands, ſo that it can be proved he ſtole or bought him, <hi>he ſurely ſhall be put to death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE third part was, <hi>He that buyeth a Servant and ſerveth him ſix years, ſhall ſet him free the ſeventh, and furniſh him libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally with what he hath.</hi> The firſt part of this branch is proved in three different texts, <hi>viz. Exod.</hi> xxi. 2. <hi>Deut.</hi> xv. 12. and <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxiv. 14. In all which parts it is expreſſly mentioned, <hi>That if an</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <hi>Servant be ſold unto thee,</hi> or if you buy him he <hi>ſhall ſerve thee ſix years, and the ſeventh, thou ſhall let him go free from thee,</hi> that is, he ſhall pay nothing for his Liberty.</p>
            <p>SOME perſons for argument ſake may object to this, ſaying, theſe people are not <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as mentioned in theſe texts of Scripture, but <hi>Heathens.</hi> This may be difficult enough to determine. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, admit they are <hi>Heathens,</hi> (although it is well known they are not) it muſt be owned by thoſe who know them, that the natives of <hi>Africa</hi> have exalted notions of a Deity. It is an odd method theſe
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012572_0028_0F8B148DE97D27A0"/>
Traders take to civilize and teach them the Chriſtian religion, by importing one hundred thouſand of them yearly into <hi>Virginia</hi> and other Southern Provinces, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Weſt-Indi</hi> iſlands, where they are kept in greater darkneſs than before, as they are not allowed to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip GOD on the Sabbath; but are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in worldly buſineſs on that day, which is a ſcandal to the Rulers of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies and Iſlands where ſuch things are practiſed. It is ſubverſive of the Chriſtian religion not to allow thoſe ignorant people the benefit of it, who make up more than two thirds of the inhabitants of the before mentioned pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It is expreſſly againſt the laws of GOD; for he gave <hi>Paul</hi> and other Apoſtles commiſſion to go and preach the goſpel to every nation, kindred, and tongue; but inſtead of that, where the goſpel is preached throughout the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies, and where theſe people might expect to receive the light of it; I ſay, inſtead of that, they are kept from divine worſhip on Sundays, and never once in their lifetime admitted to church, but obliged to cultivate their ſmall piece of ground allowed them by their Maſters.</p>
            <p>THE laſt part of the verſe runs thus,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012572_0029_0F8B149002509720"/>
               <hi>And ſhall furniſh him liberally with what he hath.</hi> That is, when the Servant hath ſerved thee ſix years, as expreſſed in <hi>Exod.</hi> xxi. 2, and <hi>Deut.</hi> xv. 12. <hi>Then in the ſeventh year you ſhall let him go free from you;</hi> and in ver. 13. <hi>Thou ſhall not let him go away empty.</hi> Ver. 14. <hi>Thou ſhall furniſh him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy wine preſs; of that wherewith the</hi> LORD <hi>thy</hi> GOD <hi>hath bleſſed thee, thou ſhalt, give him. This is in token that thou doſt acknowledge the benefit that thou haſt received by his labours.</hi> Marg. Bible.</p>
            <p>IT is ſtill further required to ſet your Servants or Bond-men free at the above appointed time, by the 15th verſe of the ſame chap. <hi>And thou ſhalt remember that thou waſt a Bond-man in the land of</hi> Egygt, <hi>and the</hi> LORD <hi>thy</hi> GOD <hi>redeemed thee; therefore I command thee this thing to day. I command thee.</hi> You are ordered, yea, commanded to do <hi>this thing.</hi> What thing? To ſet free your Bond-ſervants after ſix years ſervice. You are commanded to do it <hi>to day, viz.</hi> At the expiration of ſix years, for, ſays GOD, by the voice of his Servant, <hi>I command thee this thing to day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is a bleſſing promiſed to thoſe who do this thing in ver. 18 of the above
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012572_0030_0F8B1490286C8E78"/>
chap. After enjoining that it may not ſeem hard unto you in ſending away this Servant, as he hath been worth a double hired one, in ſerving thee ſix years, he ſays, <hi>and the</hi> LORD <hi>thy</hi> GOD <hi>ſhall bleſs thee in all that thou doeſt.</hi> Sweet encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for poor ſinful ſouls! To be bleſſed in every thing that they do. What man will forfeit this great bleſſing for the ſake of the ſervice of one, two, or more Servants for life? Will he allow himſelf to be curſed by GOD in every thing that he doeth for the ſmall gain he can make by their ſervices? This charming pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a bleſſing in all that thou doeſt, and the dreadful events that may take place in contradicting the command of GOD, I hope will make ſuch impreſſions upon the minds of men, that they will not bind Servant to ſerve above ſix years; but will ſet him at liberty in the ſeventh year, and give him liberally of what the LORD hath bleſſed them with, as requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the above cited text. If you think you have not enough of this, paſs along to</p>
            <p>THE fourth and laſt ſection on this head, <hi>If thy Brother be ſold unto thee, thou ſhall not compel him to ſerve as a Bond-man; but as an hired Servant.</hi> This is proved by <hi>Lev.</hi> xxv. 39, 40. where it is ſaid, <hi>If thy
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012572_0031_0F8B1492C0B8B910"/>
Brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be ſold unto thee, thou ſhalt not compel him to ſerve as a Bond-ſervant.</hi> This is expreſſly againſt making Slaves of any of our poor Brethren, or compeling them to ſerve as Bond-ſervants. <hi>If thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor,</hi> are the words of the verſe; the poor <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> who fall into the hands of the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolves that prowl on their coaſts, are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſerve their lifetime, and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after them: This is being Bond-men with a witneſs, and as we have great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe they are poor enough when they ſteal them, they are kept ſo forever after, not having means to make a penny themſelves. The <hi>Africans</hi> will be underſtood, if not primarily intended, to be the people mentioned in this text! It is ſaid, <hi>Thy Brother who dwelleth by thee:</hi> When they are in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> it is certain they are at a great diſtance; but when they come to <hi>America</hi> or the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> they then dwell <hi>by us;</hi> therefore I think, from the above citations, no perſon can buy theſe people, and oblige them and their children to ſerve as Slaves, without incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſpleaſure of GOD and his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for diſobeying his juſt commands.</p>
            <p>IT may be added, as in v. 42d of the ſame chap. <hi>For they are my ſervants, which I brought
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012572_0032_0F8B1493822DF008"/>
forth out of</hi> Eygpt; <hi>they ſhall not be ſold as Bond-men.</hi> The laſt part of this verſe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſly againſt <hi>ſelling</hi> them as Bond-men. Should it be objected, that the <hi>Africans</hi> were not <hi>brought forth out of the land of</hi> Egypt, it would not affect the controverſy. I would ſincerely adviſe every man who is in this abominable Trade not to perſiſt in it, ſeeing the many threats and commands againſt him in GOD's laws, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that are promiſed if he does not.</p>
            <p>THE IId General Head propoſed, is, That this practiſe of making Slaves of our Brethren is likewiſe againſt the law of nature, and the Charter of this Province. The firſt part of this head, may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily proved by the following texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>Matt.</hi> vii. 12. <hi>Therefore all things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them. Luke</hi> vi. 31. <hi>And as you would that men ſhould do to you, do ye ſo to them likewiſe.</hi> Who is that proud one that will not receive theſe inſtructions? And who is that man that will do unto any perſon, either white or black, Chriſtian or Savage, contrary to what he would that he ſhould do to him? This would be acting contrary to reaſon and common ſenſe. Would any perſon conſent to have himſelf torn from his friends and native country, and be
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012572_0033_0F8B1493F0BAAF88"/>
made a Slave for life, and to have his dear, dear little children continue in the ſame condition from one generation to another? No; ſurely no perſon would agree to that. Well then, it certainly muſt be contrary to the laws of nature, chriſtianity, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of the texts juſt quoted, which were wrote for our direction and guidance in this world. It is likewiſe certain, that thoſe who carry on this Trade, do not unto men as they would men ſhould do to them; for if theſe poor people which they, the Ship-maſters take from their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and then ſell for Slaves, were doing to them as they are done to, they would (were it in their power, which ſeldom is the caſe, the owners being conſcious of the wrong they are doing, and dreading what naturally would follow) revenge the injury they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in being made Slaves, and reſume that Liberty again, which was wrongful-taken from them; I ſay, they would often revenge the injury offered them by killing the Captain of the ſhip who had taken them to be mancipated for life, and would ſerve in the ſame manner the Owners of the veſſel if they could get them, who are no better than the Maſters, in putting them into ſuch employ. Who could find fault with them? No perſon, They were only
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012572_0034_0F8B1494A9E20FA8"/>
retrieving the moſt common bleſſing we enjoy, Liberty, and inſtead of being puniſhed, the law would protect them in ſo noble an action. But,</p>
            <p>READERS, before I leave this, let me beg you to "bring the matter home to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and think whether any condition in life can be more completely miſerable than that of thoſe diſtreſſed Captives. On reflecting, that each of them had ſome ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der attachments which were broke by the cruel ſeparation! Some Parent or Wife who had not an opportunity of mingling tears in a parting embrace! Perhaps ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant or aged Parent whom his labour was to feed, and vigilance protect! and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the dreadful apprehenſions of perpetual Slavery."</p>
            <p>TO inforce this part of the head, allow me, Reader, to intrude a little upon your time, by giving you a ſhort account of the barbarous uſage theſe poor Negroes meet with from their Maſters in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> and Southern Provinces of <hi>North-America;</hi> on reading of which, you will not he long in concluding, that they do not in this caſe obſerve the golden rule.</p>
            <p>THE crimes attending the Slave Trade are
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012572_0035_0F8B14956CB530C0"/>
greatly aggravated by the extreme cruel uſage the Negroes meet with in the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as well with regard to food and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as the hard and unreaſonable labour that is exacted from them, and what cannot be forgot, the ſevere chaſtiſements they frequently ſuffer, which is bounded by the wrath and pleaſure of their hard taſk-maſters. 1ſt. As to their food. In <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes, &amp;c.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſuppoſed eighty thouſand Negroes, are upon the Iſland of <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and yet through the hard labour they exact of theſe poor creatures, and what of them are killed through their barbarous chaſtiſements, a decreaſe is made of five thouſand Slaves yearly, which they are reſupplied with from <hi>Africa;</hi> and it may be reaſonably expected, that the children eighty thouſand Negroes would have, were they worked in the ſame manner with the white people, and did not ſo many of them die through hard labour, and from the treatment they ſuffer: I ſay, it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, there would be an increaſe of ten thouſand at a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate computation yearly, inſtead of five thouſand decrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. One may form an idea from this, of what an additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ſupply moſt of the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Iſlands and Southern Provinces <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for there is not one of them but what import a conſiderable number of Slaves annually, to keep up their common ſtock.</note> "three quarts of corn and three herrings are a weeks allowance for a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Slave; and it is mentioned in the Syſtem of Geography, that in <hi>Jamaica</hi> the Owners of the Negro Slaves ſet aſide for each, a piece of ground, and allow them Sundays to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate it, the produce of which with a few ſalt herrings or other ſalt fiſh is all that is allowed for their ſupport. But need I
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012572_0036_0F8B149676EDA540"/>
go ſo far as <hi>Jamaica</hi> to prove this? No. In <hi>Virginia</hi> they do the ſame. 2d. As to their cloathing. In the Iſlands, the allowance for a Slave's cloathing is ſeldom more than ſix yards of oznabrigs a year, and in the Southern Colonies, where the piercing weſterly winds are long and ſenſibly felt, theſe poor <hi>Africans</hi> ſuffer much for the want of ſufficient cloathing; indeed, ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to relate! ſome of them are obliged to work moſt of the night in boiling-houſes, notwithſtanding the hard days work they have performed. Their Owners make great gain by their Slave's labour. They lay heavy burdens on them, and yet feed and cloath them very ſparingly, and ſome ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at all; ſo that it cannot be wondered that theſe poor creatures are obliged to ſhift for their living as they do, which occaſions ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them being killed in ſtealing potatoes or other food to ſatisfy hunger. If they are detected in taking any thing from the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they belong to, which they have ſo hardly laboured for, they are cruely whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." Laſtly. With reſpect to the beating which theſe poor people meet with in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> For the leaſt fault they whip them moſt unmercifully, <hi>viz.</hi> for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at work in half an hour after the uſual notice; ſpeaking a word which the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012572_0037_0F8B14971BDADFE8"/>
may think ſaucy; not ſhewing reſpect enough to him; not doing with agility ſome hard piece of work ordered them; and any thing which the Overſeer may take exception at. They beat them with thick clubs, and you may ſee their bodies all wha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a terrible manner.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>George Whitefield</hi> writes in a letter to the Planters in <hi>Virginia, Carolina, &amp;c.</hi>
               <q>The taſk-maſters, by their inhuman uſage and unrelenting ſcourges have ploughed their backs and made long furrows, and at length brought them even to death.</q>
This is the fate which great numbers in the iſlands and Southern Provinces meet with. When ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their cloathing and food, he adds,
<q>When paſſing along, I have viewed your plantations cleared and cultivated, many ſpacious houſes built, and the Owners of them faring ſumptuouſly every day. My blood has frequently run cold with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me to conſider how many of your Slaves had neither convenient food to eat or proper raiment to put on, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of the comforts you enjoy were ſolely owing to their indefatigable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</q>
In <hi>Virginia, &amp;c.</hi> in caſe a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro gives the ſlighteſt affront to a white perſon. He goes to the negroes Maſter
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012572_0038_0F8B14994B638ED0"/>
and demands ſatisfaction, the Maſter deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers him to the white perſon to take what ſatisfaction he pleaſes; who whips him, ſtrikes him with clubs, and, as is often done, cuts off his ears, and mark him by cuting his face, or other parts of his body. What more could be done to a brute beaſt, who was brought up and deſigned for the yoke? Oh! how long will you continue in this deluſion and horrid abuſe of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal workmanſhip of GOD. It is aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing how a people who ſo much value themſelves upon their Freedom can continue in the practice of ſo much oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Will not the groans of this afflicted and miſerable people reach Heaven! And when the cup of inequity is filled, the unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tendency muſt be the pouring ſorth of GOD's judgments upon their oppreſſors. But alas! is it not too plain that this cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty has already been the object of divine anger? For what greater judgment can befal any perſon than to become a prey to that obduracy of heart, that neglectful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of GOD, and a callouſneſs to every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious impreſſion?</p>
            <p>I COULD ſay a great deal more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unparralleled cruelty that theſe Negroes meet with: But I apprehend more has been ſaid already than will be believed,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012572_0039_0F8B1499E95F7228"/>
although it is far from coming up to the real truth; for it is impoſſible my pen can repreſent in proper colours the hard uſage they meet with. The ſympathizing Reader muſt feel the reſt, for I can aſſiſt him no farther. I believe there are but few that have not heard or read of the cruel treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe unhappy mortals. Indeed it is almoſt incredible that ſuch cruelty ſhould be practiſed in any of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions.</p>
            <p>I COULD have quoted a dozen Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, ſetting forth the inhuman puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted upon the <hi>Africans;</hi> but that would have ſwelled my page. I hope this ſhort, but true narrative, for great part of which I am much obliged to Mr. <hi>Benezet,</hi> will anſwer the ſame end of raiſing in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry breaſt an utter deteſtation and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the horrid cuſtoms and ſavage uſage in the Iſlands and Colonies abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and I make no doubt but every one will clearly ſee, <hi>they do not to theſe Negroes as they would that they ſhould do to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I THINK it is time to leave this part and go to the laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That this baſe cuſtom is likewiſe againſt the Charter of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; as is clearly and moſt ſimply demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by a clauſe in ſaid Charter, granted by King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> dated
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012572_0040_0F8B149B8D45A0F8"/>
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the 7th of <hi>October,</hi> in the third year of their reign, wherein, <hi>inter alia,</hi> it is eſtabliſhed and ordained, <hi>That all and every of the Subjects of Us, our Heirs, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, which ſhall go to and inhabit within Our ſaid Province and territory, and every of their Children which ſhall happen to be born there, or on the ſeas in going thither, or returning from thence, ſhall have and enjoy all</hi> Liberties <hi>and immunities of</hi> FREE <hi>and natural Subjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the dominions of Us, Our Heirs, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, to all intents, conſtructions, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes whatſoever, as if they and every of them were born within our realm of</hi> England. I need ſay but little as to this branch of the head further than to obſerve, that the clauſe of the Charter juſt cited, proves clearly, and which cannot be further diſputed, <hi>that all and every of the Subjects, the Inhabitants of</hi> New-England, <hi>which ſhall come to and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit withn the Province and territory of the ſame, and every of their Children which ſhall happen to be born there, ſhall have and enjoy all the</hi> Liberties, &amp;c. <hi>of</hi> FREE <hi>and natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the realm of</hi> England. Indeed I am ſorry to mention that this Charter ſhould have been ſo long ſubverted and remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved by the Publick in ſo intereſting a point, when by timely obſervance it might have ſaved many thouſands from Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012572_0041_0F8B149C29D077C0"/>
that are now dead and mouldered into duſt. I hope this eaſy found light will not be too late diſcovered to direct and ſave the preſent Slaves from their Bondage, which many! too many! groan under: So that I expect the inhabitants of the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Provinces will not give any perſon an opportunity of charging them with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous character of making or keeping any man or woman Slaves, when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining daily that their Liberties are wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, and little think how they deprive theſe poor Black People of their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, when there is as little reaſon for it as there is for making Slaves of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects. The above cited clauſe in the Charter, ſays, <hi>Thoſe born in or ſhall come to and dwell within the Province of the</hi> Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts-Bay are FREE; from which I am led to think, and which every perſon muſt ſee, will extend to Black as well as White. But, Reader, excuſe me, whoever you are, that may take offence at my conſtruing this clauſe of the Charter in the manner I have done, it is only my opinion, and every one is at liberty to enjoy his own ſentiments upon it as will as I; therefore I flatter myſelf of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoon, that means will be taken by the Legiſlature of moſt, if not all the Provinces of <hi>North-America,</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Iſlands,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012572_0042_0F8B149CEA79FE30"/>
totally prohibiting the importation of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes into the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations; and ſetting at Liberty with univerſal conſent, every Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro throughout the whole, at leaſt in <hi>North-America,</hi> which will be an honour to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, to ſay that this great and this only remaining hinderance to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute freedom as well as legality of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> trade is now happily and gloriouſly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; and then we may all cry with ſhouts of joy! which few more countries in the four quarters of the globe can, <hi>That complete</hi> FREEDOM <hi>both in people and trade is allowed throughout the</hi> Britiſh <hi>Iſlands and Plantations in</hi> America <hi>and</hi> the Weſt-Indies!</p>
            <p>THE IIId General Head propoſed was, To ſhew the diſadvantages ariſing from this baſe Trade. This head I propoſe to conſider ſeprately, and ſhall 1ſt. Shew the diſadvantages to <hi>Africa</hi> in taking ſo many of its natives away yearly. 2d. Treat of the hurt and prejudice of this Trade with <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> 3d. Shew the diſadvantages to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> particularly to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> in carrying Black Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thither.</p>
            <p>The firſt part of this head in, To ſhew the diſadvantages to <hi>Africa</hi> in taking ſo many of its natives yearly. Before I enter upon this branch it may not be improper to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012572_0043_0F8B149DAF5F03A0"/>
a few obſervations which Mr. <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlethwayt</hi> makes upon the great qualities which this country abound with. "Its ſituation for commerce is certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any of the other quarters of the world, for it ſtands in the center be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the other three, and has thereby a much nearer communication with <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> than any other quarter has with the reſt. It is wonderfully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated for commerce by the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of iſlands, and more particularly by the aſſiſtance of the trade winds, which render the navigation ſafe, eaſy, and conſtant. It is furniſhed with the greateſt and moſt convenient navigable rivers, and perhaps with as many of them as any other of the chief parts of the world: Such are the <hi>Nile, Nubia, Niger, Natal,</hi> which are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the firſt magnitude; beſides theſe there are innumerable others, though not equal to the former, are yet very excellent ſtreams, ſituated for navigation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and which by their noble courſes penetrate far inland; if the <hi>Europeans, &amp;c.</hi> would cultivate a human and Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian like commerce with the <hi>Africans,</hi> they might through theſe rivers become the medium of an endleſs beneficial commerce. The country is populous beyond credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:012572_0044_0F8B149E828F1B08"/>
the ſoil fruitful, the ſeaſon for the greateſt part mild and clement, and the air ſalubrious." I muſt ſtop in the midſt of this agreeable deſcription, being afraid of leading myſelf into an undue length in this narrative of the beautious perfection of that rich and fruitful part of the world.</p>
            <p>I SHALL now conſider the diſadvantages to <hi>Africa</hi> in taking ſo many of its natives away yearly. But it needleſs to ſpeak much on this head, as moſt of my Readers will perceive the prejudices to <hi>Africa</hi> in thus drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it of the inhabitants yearly in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Britain</hi> and the Plantations do. I ſhall mention a few of them. 1ſt. There can be no loſs to any country (particularly to one like <hi>Africa</hi> that is yet moſtly to cultivate) equal to that of depopulating it. 2d. It prevents the inland country, where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant broils are carried on, from defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves againſt the attacks and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments made on their properties by the Kings and Chiefs, whereby many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of their ſubjects being taken priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are ſold to the Coaſters, they being nouriſhed and careſſed by the <hi>Europeans,</hi> particularly by <hi>Britain</hi> and the Colonies, in doing ſo, for the ſake of the Slave Trade to <hi>America,</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> and further, in conſequence of this depriving
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012572_0045_0F8B149F332070A0"/>
them of defending themſelves againſt theſe baſe aſſaults, it prevents them entirely from cultivating and manuring that fruitful and rich country, to the degree it is capable of. 3d. It ever obſtructs the civilizing of thoſe people, and conſequently of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting amongſt them the Chriſtian religion, and extending the Trade into the bowels of <hi>Africa,</hi> which by contrary means might be eaſily practicable. 4th. That whilſt the ſlaving Trade of thoſe people, continue to be the great object of the powers that trade there it is to be feared it will ever, as it does at preſent ſpirit up wars and hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities amongſt the Negro Princes and Chiefs, for the ſake of making captives of each other for ſale. And 5th. The greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to <hi>Africa,</hi> by thus draining it of the inhabitants is, that it prevents them from cultivating and peopling that great fertile country, of introducing <hi>European</hi> arts and ſciences amongſt them, and of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on a friendly, civil, and chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with them into the heart of their region.</p>
            <p>The ſecond branch alluding to the third head was, to treat of the prejudice to <hi>Africa,</hi> and its trade with <hi>Europe.</hi> It is an abſolute fact, that theſe people are inceſſently at war with their neighbouring
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:012572_0046_0F8B149FEBFB3F30"/>
Princes ſo that they cannot get their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs looked into or followed, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a great hinderance to the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing ſuch quantities of their country's produce of every kind, to ſend to <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America, &amp;c.</hi> as they might do, were this Slave Trade aboliſhed, and the Rulers in amity, friendſhip, and concord, one with another.</p>
            <p>It is further a hurt to the <hi>African</hi> trade with <hi>Europe,</hi> for the Slave Trade has ſo gained upon the minds of thoſe men that traffick to <hi>Africa,</hi> that they never once think of the other commodities, at leaſt in ſuch quantities as <hi>Europe</hi> might conſume were the attention neceſſary paid to it by making this the only object of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders notice, I believe it would turn out much more profitable to keep wholly to the produce of this country, <hi>viz.</hi> gums, ivory, gold and ſilver duſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to reſign that baſe unchriſtian Trade of Man-ſelling.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, on this head, To ſhew the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, &amp;c.</hi> in bringing Black people into them. This will be made very eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear when you conſider, that theſe nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Black People, which are yearly brought
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:012572_0047_0F8B14A0AF3A2A08"/>
into the ſouthern-moſt parts of <hi>North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> were very poor at that time, not having a penny to command, and never ſo much as once in their lifetime had it in their power to make one half that ſum for themſelves, ſo that the different Provinces in the Continent, and the Iſlands in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> are filled with theſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitous Black People, and muſt be put upon the townſhips to which they belong, in caſe this enſlaving them be ever aboliſhed, which I flatter myſelf, and I hope not vainly, will be done in time, and that with effect. Further, why do they fill their Plantations with Black People, ſo unnatural to the Whites, the Proprietors of the different Colonies, when it ſeems no way difficult to obtain White People to ſerve free in their ſtead? <hi>Europe</hi> in general affords numbers of poor and diſtreſſed objects for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, find if theſe were not overworked, as the Negroes generally are, they would make as good Servants for the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Plantations as the Blacks do. And if the <hi>Europeans</hi> were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a level with regard to the price of labour, in their Colonies, I cannot but think they would reap great advantage in laying aſide the Slave Trade, and cultivate a friendly and civilized Commerce with the <hi>Africans.</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:012572_0048_0F8B14A1EDF34E40"/>
Until this is done it does not ſeem poſſible that the inland trade of that country ſhould ever be extended to the degree it is capable of; for while the ſpirit of <hi>Butchery</hi> and making Slaves of each other, is promoted by the <hi>Europeans, Americans, &amp;c.</hi> amongſt thoſe people, they will never be able to travel with ſafety into the heart of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or to cement ſuch commercial friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and alliance with them, as will actually introduce our arts and manufactures.</p>
            <p>THE IVth General Head was, To ſhew the advantages ariſing from aboliſhing this baſe cuſtom. This Head I propoſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into two parts, 1ſt. The advantages to <hi>Africa,</hi> and 2d. The advantages to <hi>Europe</hi> particularly to <hi>Britain</hi> and the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in <hi>America</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FIRST to <hi>Africa.</hi> The advantages that would ariſe to it, in aboliſhing this baſe and unchriſtian-like Commerce are nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſome of which may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the following. 1ſt. The aboliſhing this Trade may be a means of peopling this country, and of cultivating it in the ſame manner with any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſo as to render it capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of bearing in as great abundance as the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> ſpices of equal quality to thoſe
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012572_0049_0F8B14A24B8E7730"/>
of <hi>Banda, Ternate,</hi> and <hi>Amboyna;</hi> I ſay, the like ſpices might be produced on the rich and fruitful ſhores of <hi>Melinda</hi> on the eaſt ſide, or of the ſlave coaſt on the weſt ſide of <hi>Africa,</hi> and that as eaſy and to as great advantage, as where they are now raiſed, the latitude being the ſame, and ſoil not unlike; and, in ſhort, cinnamon and all others, the production of <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> by proper management might be raiſed here as well as in thoſe parts. 2d. It would introduce the Chriſtian religion among them, which is a ſhame to theſe nations who pretend to hold faſt the principles of Chriſtianity, to keep ſo long hid, and of conſequence, be a means of bringing among them the more civilized arts and ſciences. 3d. It will recommend the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> dreſs, and introduce their cuſtoms among the natives, and of courſe civilize them like other Chriſtian nations. Laſtly. It will be a means of bringing this country to as great perfection in trade, riches, and grandeur, as any in <hi>Europe,</hi> it being a much more fertile and plentious ſoil for many valuable productions.</p>
            <p>MUCH more could I ſay upon the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous advantages ariſing to this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent country: But let what has been ſaid ſuffice, I leave the reſt to the Reader's own
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012572_0050_0F8B14A469845F48"/>
feeling, if he has any for this poor diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Africa</hi> which groans under a heavy load of oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>THE next thing in courſe is, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that would ariſe to <hi>Europe</hi> in thus carrying on a Chriſtian-like Commerce with <hi>Africa.</hi> This trade even in its preſent ſtate, excluding that of the Slaves, is as advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous as any that is now followed; and what will it be when a friendly traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick is carried on? It is as it were all profit, the firſt coſt being ſome things of <hi>European,</hi> particularly of <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and others generally purchaſed with them; for which there is in return, gold, elephant's-teeth, wax, gums, cotton-wool, divers dying-woods, and Slaves: But this laſt piece of Commerce, <hi>viz.</hi> Man-ſlaving, I am far from making a part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> trade, and I dare ſay every humane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will be likeminded. Theſe are articles which the country abound in, and would be ſtill cheaper to an immenſe degree, were the inland parts ſettled with their own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but inſtead of that, a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand are yearly carried away. <hi>Britain</hi> pays but little for the commodities it exports to <hi>Africa,</hi> being moſtly, as obſerved before, its own produce, ſuch as worſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton cloths of all kinds, braſs, iron, and cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012572_0051_0F8B14A528A5D2A0"/>
work of every ſort, particularly large quantities of all kinds of defenſive arms, with powder and ſhot in proportion; <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> goods, every kind of <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and a good deal of <hi>American</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> rum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not eaſy to ſay what vaſt quantities of the above <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>American</hi> productions would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted yearly among ſo great a people, and in ſo very extenſive a country, were the Slave Trade ſtopped. It is the intereſt of every Merchant in <hi>Britain</hi> and the Plantations who are now concerned in traffick to <hi>Africa,</hi> to cultivate the inland commerce in its utmoſt extent, as having no manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern with the Slave Trade, there being the greateſt reaſon to believe, that where they now export twenty ſhillings worth of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities thither, they would then export an hundred pound; and I am inclined to think when the trade comes to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the degree it will admit of, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe goods that are imported from <hi>Africa,</hi> there will ſtill be diſcovered an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite variety of trafficable articles, with which the preſent Traders are totally unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this Trade become the moſt benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to <hi>Britain, America,</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> of any that is at preſent on foot, as it is common to every individual, and of
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012572_0052_0F8B14A8F1BEC590"/>
which the government has taken much notice, by granting an annual ſum of ten thouſand pounds ſterling for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and upholding the forts and caſtles in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Settlements in <hi>Africa,</hi> ſo that they are entirely defended againſt the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of any enemy, and their Trade and Colonies ſecured by irreſiſtible ſtrength of forts and caſtles.</p>
            <p>A GREAT deal more could be mentioned on the thouſands of advantages that may ariſe to the intereſt of <hi>Britain</hi> and the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in aboliſhing this wicked Trade: However, I ſhall detain my Readers no longer on this head, but as propoſed,</p>
            <p>CONCLUDE the whole with ſome ſhort admonitions to thoſe concerned, and a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to put this Trade to <hi>Africa</hi> upon a juſt and lawful footing. I adviſe every Merchant and Shipmaſter who is in this Trade of Man-ſlaving to renounce and give it up. What arguments or reaſon, pray, can be advanced for his juſtification, when he ſees ſuch threats and curſes againſt him, particularly mentioned in the firſt head? Why ſhould any perſon incur the penalties of GOD's Law ſo daringly for the ſake of gain? Should they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on a death-bed, what agonies and troubles of mind muſt they undergo in the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012572_0053_0F8B14AA59F080C0"/>
thoughts of enſlaving ſo many miſerable creatures, of murdering ſo many thouſands of innocent people in the wars they occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, treacherouſly taking them out of their own country, uſing them barbarouſly, maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring numbers of them in all the cruel ways imaginable on the paſſage, ſelling them for life, and depriving them even of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable living, notwithſtanding they ſerve for nothing elſe; ſurely the judgment of GOD muſt come upon ſuch men who will thus uſe their own Brethren who were born to inherit the ſame ſalvation with us, and if his judgment does not come upon them, it will purſue their children unto the third and fourth generation, until the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that have been thus ſcandalouſly amaſſed be ſquandered away, and they become as poor as theſe Negroes themſelves, by ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of whom ſuch unjuſt gain was made. But this is only one way out of thouſands that GOD chuſes to afflict his enemies in this world. And,</p>
            <p>STILL purſuing, that GOD will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on thoſe that puniſh wrongfully ſuch poor Negroes, I ſhall inſert what the above mentioned Mr. <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> ſays in a letter to the inhabitants of <hi>Virginia,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>We have, ſays he, a remarkable inſtance of GOD's taking
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012572_0054_0F8B14AA78D73948"/>
cognizance of, and avenging the quarrel of poor Slaves, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxi. 1. There was a famine in the days of <hi>David,</hi> three years, year after year, and <hi>David</hi> enquired of the LORD, and the LORD anſwered, it is for <hi>Saul,</hi> and his bloody houſe, becauſe he ſlew the <hi>Gibeonites.</hi> Two things are here very remarkable, 1ſt. Theſe <hi>Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites</hi> were only hewers of wood and drawers of water; or in other words, Slaves like yours. 2d. That this plague was ſent by GOD <hi>many years after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi> (the cauſe of the plague) was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. And for what end were this and ſuch like examples recorded in holy Scripture? Without doubt for our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For GOD is the ſame to-day as he was yeſterday, and will continue the ſame for ever. He does not reject the prayer of the poor and deſtitute, nor diſregard the cry of the meaneſt Negro.</q>
When ſpeaking of the oppreſſion and unchriſtian uſage theſe poor Negroes meet with from the Shipmaſters in their paſſage, and from the Maſters they are ſold to in the ſouth parts of <hi>America</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> he adds,
<q>The blood of the Negroes ſpilt for theſe many years in your reſpective Provinces will riſe up to Heaven againſt you,</q>
toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that loſt in <hi>Africa,</hi> occaſioned by the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012572_0055_0F8B14AB29E81A88"/>
Traders that go thither. IT may not be improper to obſerve here, that this plague was ſent by GOD on <hi>Saul</hi> and his bloody houſe <hi>many years after the ſlaughter of the</hi> Gibeonites; ſo may theſe men reaſonably expect, that have occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſtill continue to be the cauſe of ſpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo much innocent blood in <hi>Africa</hi> and the different Provinces, to have a plague or curſe come upon them, <hi>many years after the perpetrating theſe wicked deeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I WILL inſert a few queſtions, for which I am indebted to Mr. <hi>Poſtlethwayt,</hi> by way of argument or perſuaſion to give up this enſlaving of Men to thoſe people who will be ready to defend this ſcandalous Trade to <hi>Africa,</hi> and of keeping theſe people in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, who are brought into a country where the goſpel is preached on all ſides of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. "WHETHER the people of this country notwithſtanding their colour, are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being civilized and brought into the Chriſtian religion, as well as great numbers of the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> have been; and whether the primitive inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of all countries ſo far as we have been able to trace them were not once as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage

            <p>I MAKE no doubt, but ſome perſons who are concerned in the Slave Trade to <hi>Africa,</hi> will attempt making anſwer to ſome of theſe queſtions: But I preſume

there are others of them they will not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon, knowing they are founded upon reaſon and truth, and I hope will have great influence on thoſe this Treatiſe concern.</p>
            <p>I WOULD add one neceſſary query more, to thoſe who hold the ſword of juſtice, and who muſt account to GOD for the uſe they make of it. Since the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Law is ſo truly valuable for its juſtice, how can they overlook the barbarous deaths and wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Slavery of the unhappy <hi>Africans,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trial or proof of being guilty of crimes adequate to their puniſhments? Why are thoſe Maſters of veſſels (who are not the moſt conſiderate of men) ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be ſovereign arbiters of the lives of theſe miſerable Negroes in their paſſage, and allowed with impunity to deſtroy, may I not ſay murder their fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in a manner ſo cruel as can never be related but with ſhame and horror? Anſwer me this, ye pretended Judges and Governors in the different Colonies where ſuch prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices are uſed, and not be ſhocked at the negligence you have ſleeped in. Since you are put in remembrance of it now, I hope and ſincerely with, I, or any other perſon may not have occaſion to remind you of the ſame again, but that you will puniſh with
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012572_0060_0F8B14AF2CA14718"/>
equity all thoſe who import Negroes; there being hundreds of poor <hi>Europeans</hi> that would be glad to come and ſerve in any of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations, and thoſe that could not pay a paſſage doubtleſs would ſell part of their time for it; and this I make no doubt, conſidering they have not the charge of their funeral and death-bed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences and ſundry other things to pay, will come nigh if not full as cheap as buying and keeping Negroes; and it will be attended with this advantage, that theſe White people when they have ſerved ſome years in the loweſt capacities turn out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the waſte land, marry, and in a few years we ſee a town well ſettled, and in leſs than fifty years there will be an increaſe of fourfold; by this means the country will fill up and we become reſpectable and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from an enemy, and furniſhed with every conveniency of life. And YOU Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who have the legiſlative po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in your hands will ſtill further make Laws and put them in execution, ſtopping any further importation of Slaves into the Provinces or Iſlands where you are the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative head, ſo that in that time they may furniſh themſelves with ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and by proper uſage keep up that quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity which ſo much decreaſe by improper
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:012572_0061_0F8B14AFC6C713B0"/>
management. Now give me leave to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</p>
            <p>IN a method to put this Trade to <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> on a juſt and lawful footing. Firſt, in order to this, it is my humble opinion, if I may be allowed to give it, that there be a number of men who may chuſe to venture in this Trade, both in <hi>Britain</hi> and the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that ſhall be incorporated into ſeparate bodies by the name of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or <hi>Britiſh; American,</hi> or <hi>New England African</hi> companies, or by the denomination of other Provinces in <hi>America,</hi> or Plantations in the <hi>Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi> and theſe companies ſhall equip and rig out as many veſſels as they think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, loading them with <hi>Britiſh America, Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-India</hi> goods, and bring back in return, the rich and plentiful produce of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi> But before I go any further into this point it muſt be obſerved, there is one real hinderance in the way which muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, or elſe no man or company need ever think of penetrating into the heart of this country, but juſt content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with taking the ſkim of this Trade, leting the body ſtand, and that is, the Slave Trade; this muſt be entirely renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and given up by the <hi>Europeans,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by <hi>Britain</hi> and the Colonies;
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012572_0062_0F8B14B08A7231C0"/>
then we may with a good face and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence travel into the heart of <hi>Africa,</hi> and meet with a friendly and hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from the natives, who will trade with us, and give in exchange their valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble productions for our goods which are generally exported thither.</p>
            <p>WHEN that great, that only chief obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, the Slave Trade is removed, then <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and the Colonies will flouriſh by ſo great and profitable a Commerce. Think what a great addition it will make to their traffick, the furniſhing a hundred thouſand people annually, more than are at preſent with cloathing, powder, ſhot, and warlike arms, and many more things needleſs here to enumerate out of England; rum, and ſundry other articles out of <hi>America</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> It is ſuppoſed that the above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary number of Blacks are taken out of <hi>Africa</hi> yearly, and either murdered or made Slaves of, by the ſhips that go there out of <hi>Boſton, &amp;c.</hi> and what advantages may ariſe to the inhabitants in peopling, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of cultivating and manuring their ground, and of bringing their rich trade to the perfection it is capable of, with <hi>Britain, &amp;c.</hi> is hard to ſay, when the innermoſt parts of that great and fruitful country is ſettled,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:012572_0063_0F8B14B139F73FA8"/>
and a free and happy trade carried into the heart of it: But thus far I will venture to ſay, as I have done already, that where twenty ſhillings worth of commodities is at preſent exported an hundred pound will be, when a friendly Commerce is carried on with the natives.</p>
            <p>THESE companies may ſay, that if once this trade is ſet on foot, other <hi>European</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who have Settlements in <hi>Africa</hi> will invade them whenever they begin to thrive by not having ſufficient funds for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in good defence the forts, &amp;c. on the Settlements. As to this I anſwer, that thoſe companies have a ſum of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds ſterling annually, from the Crown of <hi>Britain,</hi> for maintaining and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the forts and caſtles that are built upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies, which with the duties ariſing from the Trade will be ſufficient to maintain, uphold, and defend them with ſtrength ſuperior to the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enemy.</p>
            <p>THUS far I hope I have removed your fears of inability in ſupporting and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing this Trade, and likewiſe have mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ways and means to put the ſame on a juſt and lawful footing. Now let me,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:012572_0064_0F8B14B1E89F79A0"/>
patient Reader, conclude with a ſhort Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the Ship-maſters and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants concerned in this Trade, in part of which I have had recourſe again to my good old Friend Mr. <hi>Benezet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I BEG you all would fly from the oppreſſion and Bondage to which the poor <hi>Africans</hi> are ſubjected, looſe the bonds from off their necks, and thereby extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate yourſelves from a cuſtom which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to your welfare here and hereafter; and as you are ſenſible moſt men have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to this baſe, unlawful Trade, you ought to vindicate yourſelves to the world, upon principles of reaſon, honeſty, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and then you will not attack the perſons, or invade the rights of theſe people. I believe thoſe who are concerned in this Trade will be at a loſs to make this juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation but upon motives ſo weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, that I do not think any of them which have been advanced for their defence worthy of notice; and if they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerving of that, they certainly are below regard; therefore I think <hi>you ſhould forever lay it aſide.</hi> This is the beſt and ſhorteſt way; for <hi>there ſhould be no trade carried on,</hi> it being a national and provincial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, <hi>but ſuch as is juſtifiable both to</hi> GOD
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012572_0065_0F8B14B2B0F98D48"/>
               <hi>and man,</hi> and this is in direct oppoſition to both. But laying man's reſentment aſide, which is of little moment in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with that of the Almighty's, I counſel you once more to think of a future reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, conſider what reaſons you will be able to produce at the great and laſt day. You now accumulate riches and live in pleaſure; but what will you do in the end, and that will be but ſhort? What if you ſhould be called hence and hurried out of this world under the vaſt load of blood guiltineſs that is now lying on your ſouls? How many thouſands have you been the iſtruments to, and primary cauſe of being killed in the wars and broils, with the <hi>African</hi> Chiefs, wanting to obtain your number to enſlave; and how many have you killed in the paſſage, when theſe poor Creatures were trying to retrieve their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which they had in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and which you unjuſtly take from them, or rather chuſing to die than take food to nouriſh and preſerve themſelves for being mancipated with their children after them?</p>
            <p>IT is declared in the moſt expreſs terms in Scripture, that thieves and murderers ſhall not inherit the kingdom of GOD. You
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:012572_0066_0F8B14B36F310A18"/>
who are in this Trade take warning by that, and if you have any thoughts or Chriſtian feeling you muſt certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it; for that you are thieves and murderers (I hope after what has been ſaid) will not be diſputed; and you ſhould think that at the ſame time and by the ſame means you are treaſuring up worldly riches, you are treaſuring up fountains of wrath againſt the day of anger and vengeance that ſhall come upon the workers of iniquity, unleſs timely repented of.</p>

Can you think that GOD will hear your prayers, receive your ſupplications, or grant your deſires, while you act thus groſſly and openly againſt his divine revealed will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? And do you ſuppoſe that he who is the Parent of all nations, the Protector of
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012572_0067_0F8B14B49D4A6DA8"/>
all people, and the Father of all men, will not revenge the male-treatment of his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring whom he once ſo loved as to give his only begotten Son, <hi>that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in him ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life?</hi> This love of GOD to man, which is diſcloſed in Scripture, adds double provocation to your crimes; for if GOD regards us with ſo much affection, we ought alſo to eſteem one another.</p>
            <p>PERMIT yourſelves for a moment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect equitably and deliberately upon the nature of this horrid, deteſtable, vile, and abominable Man Trade, and your hearts muſt certainly relent, if you have not loſt all ſenſe of benevolence, all ſympathy and compaſſion towards thoſe of your Brethren who have the ſame capacities, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſouls, and who were born to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the ſame ſalvation with you; I ſay, if you are not callous to every Chriſtian, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and manly ſenſibility, you certainly muſt feel compaſſion for thoſe extremely oppreſſed people, when you think what miſeries, what devaſtations and maſſacres among them you have been the author of, and all for filthy lucre's ſake. The thoughts of this accurſed Trade touches my very heart, and finding if I continue any
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:012572_0068_0F8B14B56EA792B0"/>
longer I ſhall get out of the bounds of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, muſt therefore conclude. And if all you have read ſhould have no weight upon your hardned hearts, this remains for my conſolation that I have done my duty; and I pray! Fervently pray! That GOD would have mercy on your ſinful ſouls; and that he of his infinite goodneſs would grant that you may be made ſenſible of your guilt and repent of theſe your execrable and really deteſtable deeds.</p>
