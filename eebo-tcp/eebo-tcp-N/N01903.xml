            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> but I hope, it will be done <hi>Remarkably,</hi> and very <hi>Proftably.</hi> The very <hi>ſilence</hi> will have in it a <hi>Voice</hi> to be greatly hearken'd to. And if I declare to you, That my Deſign is, to ſtrike my Hearers <hi>Dumb,</hi> it will be a <hi>Kindneſs</hi> for theme Indeed an <hi>Angel</hi> once brought it as a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke</hi> to a good Man, for ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002250_0005_0FDADA0E17326290"/>in him, <hi>Thou ſhalt be Dumb and not able to ſpeak.</hi> But I am now to propoſe it as the <hi>Glory</hi> of a good Man, <hi>Thou ſhalt be Dumb, and hold thy Peace, not willing to ſpeak. When</hi> and <hi>How</hi> and <hi>Why</hi> to <hi>hold ones peace,</hi> truly 'tis a Thing the People of GOD ſhould be well-acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted withal.</p>
            <p>BEFORE I go any further, I am to tell you, <hi>when</hi> this Duty of <hi>ſilence</hi> is to be Studied. It muſt be our ſtudy <hi>To hold our peace,</hi> when we have <hi>ſad things</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling of us. The <hi>ſeaſon</hi> of the Duty is, when we meet with grievous Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, with heavy Calamities. <hi>How</hi> and <hi>Why</hi> the Duty is to be attended, you ſhall be told, after I have informed you <hi>who</hi> 'tis that gives us the Pattern of it.</p>
            <p>IT was <hi>Aaron,</hi> an Eminent Miniſter of GOD, yea, the <hi>High-Prieſt of Iſrael. Sad Things</hi> befell the Family of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Man. Two of his Children were taken from him; yea, with very awful Circumſtances taken from him. GOD Struck them Dead, with <hi>Fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> A <hi>Fire from Heaven</hi> had lately conſumed the <hi>Burnt-Offerings</hi> of the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002250_0006_0FDADA0F0CC43810"/>Altar.</hi> GOD required, That this <hi>Fire</hi> ſhould always be kept alive with a <hi>perfetual Fuel,</hi> and be the <hi>only Fire</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in <hi>all</hi> their Offerings. But the Two Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> who Officiated in the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> under him, imagined (as the Jews interpret the matter to us) that this <hi>Fire</hi> was only for the <hi>Burnt-Offerings:</hi> For the <hi>Altar of Incenſe</hi> they imagined, they might fetch their <hi>Fire</hi> elſewhere; and they did ſo. GOD was offended; and by ſtriking them <hi>Dead,</hi> on the very <hi>Firſt Day</hi> after the Service of the <hi>Altar</hi> began, and after the <hi>Seven Days</hi> for the <hi>Conſecration</hi> were finiſhed and they were to offer <hi>Sacrifices</hi> for themſelves and the People, He gave a Lively Intimation, that <hi>Life</hi> was not now to be obtained or expected from <hi>that Service.</hi> No, 'tis our JESUS alone, who is the <hi>Truth</hi> and the <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Conduct of <hi>Aaron</hi> under the <hi>ſad Things</hi> which befell him and his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is now to be obſerved. The <hi>Saint of the Lord</hi> has this Reported of him; <hi>He hold his peace.</hi> A <hi>Good Report!</hi> The Conſideration which produced this <hi>Holy ſilence</hi> in him, was in the Meſſage, which
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002250_0007_0FDADA108DC446D8"/>his Brother brought from GOD unto him. <hi>The Lord ſaid, I will be Sanctified in them that come nigh unto me; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the People will I be glorified.</hi> The Glorious GOD would be conſidered, as the Diſpenſer of the <hi>ſad Things</hi> which the Man of GOD met withal, and would accordingly be Glorified.</p>
            <p>AND now, may a DOCTRINE <hi>Worthy of all Acceptation,</hi> be by all of us duely <hi>Accepted</hi> of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SINCE 'tis the Glorious GOD, who is the Doer of all that in the ſad Things which we meet withal is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ne unto us, it becomes us to Glorify Him with an an HOLY SILENCE under them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I call to mind, that when <hi>David</hi> as well as <hi>Aaron,</hi> had <hi>ſad Things</hi> befalling him, he gives this Account of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct under them, Pſal. XXXIX. 9. <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; becauſe thou didſt it.</hi> I am very much of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that when that Servant of GOD ſo Behaved and Expreſſed himſelf, he doubtleſs had in his Eye, the Story of <hi>Aaron,</hi> which I now have in mine: A Story which he could not but be well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appriſed of. So then having the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002250_0008_0FDADA146F241D80"/>of thus calling in <hi>David</hi> as well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s <hi>Aaron</hi> to ſupport my DOCTRINE, it may now be ſaid, thoſe Two Bright Stars, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſhall now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in <hi>Conjunction;</hi> and by your <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of them, you ſhall underſtand how to Steer in the Darkeſt Hours that <hi>ſad Things</hi> may bring upon you. Under ſad Things, the Great Thing with which we are to Glorify GOD, is PATIENCE; PATIENCE. The Thing required of us, is that, Jam. I. 4. <hi>Let Patience have its perfect work.</hi> I don't Remember that the Hebrew Language, has any Term for <hi>Patience,</hi> but that of <hi>ſilence.</hi> The Deſcription which the Old Teſtament gives of <hi>Patience,</hi> is <hi>To be Dumb, and not Open ones Mouth.</hi> There are ſome, who ſo read, Pſal. LXV. 1. <hi>Silence is praiſe to thee, O GOD.</hi> Our GOD is never more <hi>Praiſed</hi> than by our <hi>ſilence.</hi> Our <hi>ſilence</hi> under ſad Things, will be a moſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Praiſe</hi> to our GOD. This, This, is the Grace to be now <hi>ſpoken</hi> of! And in ſpeaking of it,</p>
            <p n="1">I. WE are to lay down the <hi>Maxim,</hi> which does command, and may even compel, the <hi>Holy ſilence,</hi> that is to be
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002250_0009_0FDADA15ECB38AE0"/>preſerved under <hi>ſad Things</hi> befalling of us. The Maxim is this; <hi>The Glorious GOD is He who does all that is done unto us, in the ſad Things we meet withal;</hi> Whatever <hi>Afflictive</hi> Thing is done unto us, the Great GOD ſays, <hi>I am now to be Sanctified and Glorified as the doer of it.</hi> Of every thing that proves a ſtroke of <hi>Adverſity</hi> unto us, we muſt make this Confeſſion, <hi>Lord, Thou doeſt it.</hi> It was demanded.

            <p>BUT what is contained, in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Deſire, <hi>Undertake for me.</hi> It contains in General, a Deſire, that GOD would <hi>go thorough</hi> with all that ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>needful for our Succour. He that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes</hi> a Buſineſs, muſt <hi>perform</hi> it, and <hi>go thorough</hi> with it. Now there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things needful to be <hi>performed</hi> for the <hi>oppreſſed</hi> People of GOD.</p>
            <p>Firſt. MAY GOD <hi>Undertake</hi> for us, That we may be <hi>strengthened</hi> and <hi>comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> under our <hi>Oppreſſions.</hi> If GOD un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for us, we ſhall have the <hi>Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> of God; God will aſſiſt us to bear our <hi>Oppreſſions</hi> with <hi>Patience.</hi> If God <hi>undertake</hi> for us, we ſhall <hi>Continue</hi> and <hi>Perſevere</hi> in the <hi>Wayes</hi> of God under our <hi>Oppreſſions,</hi> and not ſtep aſide into any Sin, tho' we are <hi>broken in the Place of Dragons.</hi> If God <hi>undertake</hi> for us, we ſhall be kept from Heart-breaking <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondencies</hi> under our <hi>Oppreſſions;</hi> our Hearts will be revived with the <hi>Great Conſolations of God</hi> brought home unto them. We read, Pſal. LV. 22. <hi>He ſhall ſuſtain thee.</hi> When we pray, <hi>Lord, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002250_0049_0FDADA866F3EA290"/>for me,</hi> we are to preſent ſuch deſires as theſe before the Lord: <q>
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> Let none of my <hi>Diſtreſſes</hi> be too hard for me. If I muſt be <hi>Diſtreſſed,</hi> yet let me not be <hi>Forſaken.</hi> Do not ſuffer me to be <hi>Tempted above what thou wilt make me able to bear.</hi> Viſit me with thy <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> let thy Spirit <hi>viſit</hi> me with thy <hi>Promiſes</hi> under my <hi>Diſtreſſes.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. MAY GOD <hi>undertake</hi> for us, That we may <hi>get Good</hi> by our <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</hi> If God <hi>undertake</hi> for us, our <hi>Oppreſſions</hi> will be made <hi>Beneficial,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, and Serviceable unto us; and we ſhall reap out of them the beſt of <hi>Benefits.</hi> If God <hi>undertake</hi> for us, our <hi>Oppreſſions</hi> will bring us <hi>nearer</hi> to God, and make us <hi>liker</hi> to Chriſt, and the Things which <hi>preſs</hi> us down, will but <hi>Raiſe</hi> us up to the moſt Heave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly elevations. It GOD <hi>undertake</hi> for us, our Souls will thrive under our <hi>Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> more than the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did under their <hi>Egyptian</hi> ones; we ſhall be gainers by our Loſſes. We read, Heb. XII. 11. <hi>The chastning afterwards yields the peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fruit of Righteouſneſs.</hi> When we
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002250_0050_0FDADA87CE229760"/>pray, <hi>Lord, undertake for me,</hi> we are to preſent ſuch Deſires as theſe before the Lord: <q>
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> Let my <hi>Diſtreſſes</hi> prove <hi>Kindneſſes</hi> to me. Let me find that thou haſt in <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> diſtreſſed me; and that <hi>all the Fruit ſhall be to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my Sin.</hi> Let me be made <hi>better,</hi> by all the <hi>Evil</hi> that befals me; and let me be made <hi>Wiſer</hi> by the <hi>Rod</hi> of thy Correction.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. MAY GOD <hi>undertake</hi> for us, That we may be <hi>Sav'd out</hi> of our <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</hi> The Great GOD, is the <hi>GOD of Salvations.</hi> If once He <hi>undertake</hi> for us, we ſhall have <hi>Salvations</hi> from our <hi>Oppreſſions.</hi> The cry of the <hi>oppreſſed</hi> is, <hi>Ariſe and ſave us.</hi> We read, Pſal. CVII. 6. <hi>They cryed unto the Lord, in their Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and He delivered them out of their Diſtreſſes.</hi> When we pray, <hi>Lord, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for me,</hi> we preſent theſe deſires be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord; <q>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is what we have to do. But now,</p>
            <p>WE will Enquire, Secondly. <hi>Why</hi> the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002250_0051_0FDADA8CAD564708"/>
               <hi>oppreſſed</hi> ſhould thus make their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>WE will Anſwer. It ſhould be done for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt. THERE is the <hi>Hand</hi> of GOD, in all our <hi>Oppreſſions.</hi> It is the <hi>Hand</hi> of GOD, that lays them on. Tho' the Bleſſed GOD can be no <hi>Oppreſſor;</hi> yet we can ſuffer no <hi>Oppreſſions</hi> without the <hi>Will</hi> of GOD. All our <hi>Afflictions</hi> are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by GOD. It was a word ſpoken once to one, who cryed out, <hi>I am Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;</hi> Job. V. 6, 8. <hi>Affliction comes not forth of the Duſt, neither does Trouble ſpring out of the Ground; I would ſeek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cauſe.</hi> Whatever <hi>Diſtreſſes</hi> may Afflict us, and <hi>Oppreſs</hi> us, 'tis the unexceptionable <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of GOD, that has brought them upon us. If it be the <hi>Oppreſſion of Man,</hi> that is grievous unto us, even this alſo is not without the <hi>Providence</hi> of GOD. No Man can wrong us, but it may be ſaid, <hi>God has bidden him.</hi> We read, Job. XXXIV. 29. <hi>When He giveth Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs who can make Trouble?</hi> Well then; Since we have to do with GOD, in all our <hi>Oppreſſions,</hi> what ſhall we do, but
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002250_0052_0FDADA8DCD3FC8E0"/>make our <hi>Complaint</hi> unto GOD? Yea, GOD ſends our <hi>Oppreſſions</hi> upon us, on purpoſe to provoke and produce our <hi>Complaint</hi> unto <hi>Him.</hi> He ſays, <hi>In their Affliction, ſurely they will ſeek me Early.</hi> The <hi>ſame Hand</hi> that lays our <hi>Oppreſſions</hi> upon us; whither ſhall we look but unto <hi>that Hand,</hi> either to moderate them to us, or to deliver us from them?</p>
            <p>Secondly. THE Faithful GOD is <hi>Engag'd</hi> for our Help in all our <hi>Oppreſſions.</hi> The very <hi>Nature</hi> of GOD, this is full of <hi>Mercy,</hi> full of <hi>Pity.</hi> There is in the very <hi>Nature</hi> of GOD, a Compaſſion for the Oppreſſed. We read, Lam. III. 32. <hi>Tho' He cauſe grief, yet will be have compoſſion, according to the Multitude of His Mercies.</hi> Hence it comes to paſs, that when <hi>Sinful</hi> Men have brought ſad <hi>Oppreſſions</hi> and Confuſions on themſelves by their <hi>Sins,</hi> yet if they make their <hi>Complaint</hi> unto the Lord, He ſoon ſays, <hi>Tho' I have brought ſuch things upon them, yet I earneſtly remember them ſtill, and I will ſurely have mercy on them.</hi> 'Tis therefore alſo one of the <hi>Titles,</hi> by which the Lord has made Himſelf known unto us; Pſal. IX. 9. <hi>The Lord will be a Refuge
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002250_0053_0FDADA8F7A077FD0"/>for the oppreſſed.</hi> And, Pſal. X. 18. <hi>He will judge the oppreſſed.</hi> Yea, And there is the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of GOD for it. GOD has <hi>Promiſed,</hi> That when the <hi>Oppreſſed</hi> bring their complaint unto Him, they ſhall not ſeek His Face in vain. Thus we read; Pſal. XII. 5. <hi>For the oppreſſion of the poor, for the ſighing of the needy, now will I ariſe, ſaith the Lord. Oppreſſed Believer,</hi> why art thou <hi>caſt down?</hi> why is thy <hi>Soul diſquieted</hi> within thee? Go tell the Lord, all that lies as a <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> upon thee; Thou wilt find him ready to take notice of thy <hi>Diſtreſs,</hi> ready to do thee Good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. <hi>NONE</hi> but GOD <hi>can help</hi> us in all our <hi>Oppreſſions.</hi> We read, Jer. III. 23. <hi>In vain is ſalvation expected elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; Truly in the Lord our GOD is the ſalvation of Iſrael.</hi> It is <hi>in vain</hi> to ask, any one elſe but the Lord only to <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi> for us. If <hi>Creatures</hi> do <hi>undertake</hi> any thing for us, without GOD they can <hi>Accompliſh</hi> nothing for us. They are all Phyſicians of no value. We read, Job XXI. 4. <hi>As for me, is my Complaint unto man? If it were ſo — 'Tis in vain</hi> for us to call, <hi>O Friend, undertake for
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002250_0054_0FDADA90CA222978"/>me.</hi> We have no way left, but to call, <hi>O Lord, undertake for me.</hi> All other <hi>Undertakers</hi> will be <hi>miſerable Comforters.</hi> They will effectually put us off, as the King did the poor <hi>Oppreſſed</hi> Woman; <hi>If the Lord help thee not, whence can I help thee!</hi> GOD is the only <hi>Refuge of the Oppreſſed.</hi> When any <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> is upon us, we muſt make that Concluſion; <q>
                  <hi>My Soul, wait thou only upon GOD; for my expectation is from Him alone. He only is my Rock and my Salvation.</hi>
               </q>

            <div type="application">

               <p>AND now, What are your <hi>Oppreſſions,</hi> what are your Exerciſes, <hi>O ye People, every one of you?</hi> Behold, a Lovely, the only <hi>Method of Relief!</hi> Oh! Let all <hi>Oppreſſed</hi> People, repair to the Glorious GOD, as their Great <hi>Undertaker.</hi> Make your Complaint, and your Prayer unto GOD, that He would <hi>Undertake</hi> for you.

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002250_0055_0FDADA95D5E77F88"/>many <hi>ways</hi> to get off the <hi>heavy Burdens,</hi> which we feel <hi>Oppreſſing</hi> of us; <hi>Behold, I ſhow unto you, a more excellent way.</hi> Spread before the Lord, all the <hi>Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and all the <hi>Diſtreſſes,</hi> that encumber you. Cry unto Him, <hi>O Lord, I am op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, Undertake for me!</hi> This is the way to come at that Happineſs; Iſai. LIV. 14. <hi>Thou ſhalt be far from oppreſſion, for thou ſhalt not fear it.</hi> To call upon GOD, <hi>O Lord, I am oppreſſed, undertake for me:</hi> This is the way, to ſee a glad <hi>Period</hi> put unto your <hi>Oppreſſions.</hi> The <hi>Experience</hi> of the Pious in all Ages have proved this way. Thouſands and Myriads have been the Inſtances of thoſe, who have been able to ſay, <hi>This Poor one, was Oppreſſed, and lamentably diſtreſſed, but he cried unto the Lord, and the Lord ſaved him out of all his Troubles.</hi> To call upon GOD, <hi>O Lord, I am oppreſſed, Undertake for me:</hi> This is the way to <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Change</hi> the <hi>Oppreſſions</hi> immediately. The <hi>Afflictions</hi> may remain, but they ſhall ceaſe to be <hi>Oppreſſions.</hi> We ſhall be able to <hi>ſtand,</hi> and <hi>walk,</hi> and <hi>look</hi> cheerfully under them. If we were of <hi>Sorrowful Spirits,</hi> yet having <hi>poured out our Souls
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002250_0056_0FDADA96F373A180"/>unto the Lord,</hi> we ſhall now be <hi>no more ſad.</hi> We ſhall be upheld when we have <hi>caſt our Burdens on the Lord.</hi> When <hi>Peter</hi> cries out, <hi>Lord, ſave me,</hi> the outſtretched Arm of the Lord, will <hi>ſave</hi> His Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Servant from ſinking in the Black waves which threaten him. This admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable way, of dealing with all our <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſſes,</hi> I muſt recommend it univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally, recommend it wonderfully.</p>
               <p n="1">I. THIS muſt be the <hi>Method of Relief,</hi> when you meet with ſharp <hi>Scourges</hi> from the Hand of Heaven, upon any of your Enjoyments. Whatever <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> or <hi>Affliction</hi> lies upon you in any of your Enjoyments, Oh! mourn unto the Lord; <hi>Lord, I am oppreſſed, Undertake for me.</hi> This is the Direction, Jam. V. 13. <hi>Is any afflicted, let him Pray.</hi> So we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; Pſal.

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002250_0057_0FDADA98CA065860"/>for me.</hi> Add that cry; Pſal.

Do you ſtoup, &amp; ſhrink, as under a diſmal <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> becauſe thoſe that were as the very Staff of your Life, are taken from you? Is the <hi>Lamb</hi> that has been <hi>unto you as a Daughter</hi> going from you! Go to that Lord, who has taken your <hi>Friends</hi> from you, and who is infinitely Better than all <hi>Friends.</hi> Ask that you may find him ſo.

XXV. 16. <hi>Have merry on me, for I am deſolate and afflicted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. THIS muſt be the <hi>Method of Relief,</hi> when you fall into the Hand of the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor.</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:002250_0058_0FDADA99F60A7130"/>You read; Eccl.

               </p>
               <p>I will be yet more particular. We read, Gal. VI. 2. <hi>Bear ye one anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</hi> Alas, Men make <hi>Burdens</hi> for <hi>one another;</hi> By their <hi>Baſe Humours</hi> they do ſo.

I will only obſerve to you, theſe Two Things upon it.</p>
               <p>THE One is; That it is a Conſolation to me when I am o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE Other is; That I can aſſure you, a poor <hi>Oppreſſed</hi> Servant of GOD, having the view of a CHRIST concerned for him, and feeling a CHRIST poſſeſſing of him, and converſing with him, finds e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough and enough to comfort him, in the <hi>Multitude of his Thoughts within him.</hi> Upon the <hi>precious Thoughts</hi> of a CHRIST, he is kept from <hi>fainting</hi> under any <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
