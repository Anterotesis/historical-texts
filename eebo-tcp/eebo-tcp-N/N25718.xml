         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>ALTHOUGH I am aware, that by electing for my humble productions a patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſo diſtinguiſhed, I hazard the accuſation of preſumption, I reſt confident that your candour will aſcribe my temerity to the beſt poſſible motive.</p>
                  <p>THAT benignity and dignified affability, which is perhaps inſeparable from a truly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mind, may be compared to the lucid veil, that, thrown around the orient beam, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modates to our imbecile gaze thoſe ſplendors, which might otherwiſe dazzle and confound; we trace with enkindling ardor the mildly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered radiance, we learn to appreciate its worth, and ſpontaneouſly we bleſs its genial path.</p>
                  <p>To dwell with accumulating energy upon the pleaſing paſt, is one of the appropriate felicities of reaſon; and, amid the review of other times, retroſpection frequently preſents to my mental eye, a period which memory piouſly conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, when, privileged by an opportunity of
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:034162_0003_0FFC5DA10E47DE58"/>
contemplating the Preſident, during the white moments of ſocial pleaſure, the domeſtic vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues collected and embodied, were exemplified with uncommon luſtre; and while the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of his philanthropic manners, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form elevation, gives me to mark with addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional complacency, the aſcendency he hath ſo meritoriouſly obtained in the public mind, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the authority to inſcribe theſe volumes to him among the moſt elating circumſtances of my life.</p>
                  <p>WERE I to indulge the genuine language of my heart, it would be a taſk of no ordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, to circumſcribe within due bounds thoſe expanſive effuſions reſulting from admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his character, and from affectionate gratitude for the very eſſential ſervices he hath rendered to a country, that may conſider his birth as an era in her annals, and that juſtly places this event among her higheſt honours.</p>
                  <p>THE homage we yield to eminent abilities, and luminous rectitude, can never involve the charge of ſingularity; for genius, elevated by virtue and unimpeached integrity, adorned by literature, elegance and taſte, have in all ages commanded the eſteem and veneration of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: but although I might plead the ſanction of numerous and reſpectable examples, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:034162_0004_0FFC5D9F8B13EC18"/>
however, diſcern the utility of eſſaying to prove, that the majeſty of day illumines our world, or that his ſalutary influence, like ſome gladdening deity, diffuſes over the face of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſiſtency, harmony, and unrivalled beauty.</p>
                  <p>THAT America has looked up to you, Sir, as her ſecond hope, is a truth which carries in its boſom a panegyric upon your virtues more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive, than if an angel had pronounced your eulogy; and while our fervid benedictions muſt ever follow the retiring Chief, whoſe guardian care conducted our benighted footſteps over paths untried and perilous, to a brilliant morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the refulgent dawn of which is regarded as the harbinger of a glorious meridian, we hail with ardent expectancy his patriotic ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, who, like another Eliſha, clothed in the ſacred veſtments of authority, inherits a full proportion of that ſpirit, which reſted upon him, who, emancipating his country from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable uſurpations, will ever be recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed as her DELIVERER: Thus, in the ſame moment that to the name of Waſhington, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful gratitude, bending over the unperiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing record of his illuſtrious acts, eſtabliſhes in the Columbian boſom her eternal monuments; we exult in an ADAMS, whoſe tranſcendent tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:034162_0005_0FFC5D9A396469D0"/>
and whoſe vigilance, are fully adequate to the emergencies and the dangers of a FREE GOVERNMENT; whoſe wiſdom and magnanim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity will firmly guide the helm of State; who, although contending ſtorms may aſſail, and the big waves of oppoſition may laſh the bark, will purſue with unwavering intrepidity, his deſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way; while rectitude his chart, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience his compaſs, he muſt aſſuredly make the broad and ample harbour of Security.</p>
                  <p>YES, Sir, I indulge a hope that your name may not only ſhield me from the oblivion I dread, but poſſibly confer a degree of celebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to which my own merit may not furniſh a title; yet whatever is the fate of pretenſions originating perhaps in arrogance, may you, Sir, purſue your courſe with ever new effulgence. The guardian of a nation's weal, you will watch over us for good. May you long continue to direct, enliven, and invigorate; and may your parting moments ſet ſerenely bright.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE, Sir, the honour to be, with every ſentiment of eſteem and veneration,</p>

                  <head>PREFACE to the READER.</head>
                  <p>MY Readers will not call my veracity in queſtion, when I aſſure them that I am ardently anxious for their approbation. A lover of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, I do not remember the period when I was not ſolicitous to render myſelf acceptable to all thoſe who were naturally or adventitiouſly my aſſociates. Had I poſſeſſed ability, I ſhould have advanced every individual of my ſpecies to the higheſt ſtate of felicity, of which the preſent ſcene is ſuſceptible; but circumſcribed within very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bounds, I have, I had almoſt ſaid momently, been reduced to the neceſſity of lamenting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efficacy of my wiſhes. Yet this my <hi>ruling paſſion,</hi> a fondneſs to ſtand well in the opinion of the world, having given a prevalent hue to every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant action of my life, hath operated powerfully upon my ambition, ſtimulated my efforts, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in my boſom an invincible deſire to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent myſelf before a public which I reverence, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibly impelling me to become a candidate for that complacency we naturally feel toward thoſe perſons, or that performance, which hath contrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uted to our emolument, or even amuſement.</p>
                  <p>MY deſires are, I am free to own, aſpiring—perhaps preſumptuouſly ſo. I would be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:034162_0007_0FFC5D92D6492F58"/>
and reſpected by my contemporaries; I would be continued in grateful remembrance when I make my exit; and I would deſcend with celeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to poſterity.</p>
                  <p>HAD I been miſtreſs of talents for an achievement ſo meritorious, my firſt object in writing would have been the information and improvement of my readers; nor will I deny that a pleaſing hope plays about my heart, ſuggeſting a poſſibility of my becoming in ſome ſmall degree beneficial to thoſe young people, who, juſt entering the career of life, may turn, with all the endearing ardour of youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enthuſiaſm, to a <hi>New Book,</hi> to an <hi>American Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor;</hi> and while with partial avidity they purſue the <hi>well intended</hi> pages, they may ſelect a hint, or treaſure up a remark, which may become uſeful in the deſtined journey of life.</p>
                  <p>BUT vanity, in the moſt extravagant moments of her triumph, having never flattered me with the capability of conveying inſtruction to thoſe, whoſe underſtandings have paſſed the age of adoleſcence, my view has only been to <hi>amuſe;</hi> and if I can do this without offending, I ſhall be honoured with a place in ſome gentle boſom where I ſhould elſe have been unknown; I ſhall obtain a portion of eſteem, and my <hi>ruling paſſion</hi> will be thus far gratified.</p>
                  <p>To have preſented a finiſhed or perfect produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (ſuch is my fondneſs for literary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ame) I would gladly have relinquiſhed my <hi>preſent mode of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>ay, more—I would have laboured for the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:034162_0008_0FFC5D914EB9B6E0"/>
of ſuch a compoſition through a long ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of lengthening years, although my life had been a ſcene of <hi>penury</hi> and <hi>hardſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WITH ſuch ſentiments I ſhall not be ſuſpected of writing haſtily or careleſsly. The truth is, I have penned every eſſay as cautiouſly as if I had been aſſured my reputation reſted ſolely upon that ſingle effort: yet defects of almoſt every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription may too probably occur; the Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, the Rhetorician, the Poet, theſe may all trace ſuch palpable deviations from the given ſtandard, as may render me, in their opinion, an unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble offender againſt the rules of language, and the elegance and graces of ſtyle. Poſſibly too, thus laid open to all the ſeverity of criticiſm, I may be arraigned, tried and condemned; and in this caſe it is certainly true, that I am preparing for myſelf the ſevereſt pangs. But, be this as it may, I reſt aſſured, that the feelings of the Moraliſt being in no inſtance wounded, he will accept with complacency my efforts in the common cauſe, and humanely ſhield me from thoſe ſhafts which might otherwiſe transfix my peace.</p>
                  <p>HAVING, in the concluding Eſſay, given my reaſons for aſſuming the maſculine character, I have only further to obſerve, that thoſe who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the utility of conveying inſtruction and amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by allegory or metaphor, and who allow the propriety of giving a tongue to the inanimate world, and ſpeech to the inferior orders of the creation, will not object to the liberty I have taken. It is
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:034162_0009_0FFC5D8FC8FE3F00"/>
ſuperfluous to add, that allegory and fable are not only authorized by the beſt moral writers, but are alſo ſanctioned by holy writ.</p>
                  <p>I CANNOT urge in defence of my temerity, that the importunity of friends hath drawn me forth—certainly not. But, worthy reader, I repeat that I have been animated, in this my arduous purſuit, <hi>by a deſire to be introduced to thee, by a wiſh to make one in the number of thy friends. I am ſolicitous to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an eſtabliſhment in the boſom of virtue</hi>—I would advance my claim to the ſweetly ſoothing ſtrains of juſt applauſe; and I would ſecure for myſelf, and for my infant daughter, (ſhould our future exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies require it) thy amity and thy patronage.</p>
                  <p>IF thou proceedeſt through the volumes before thee, we ſhall paſs on together through many a page; the ſentiments of my heart will be unreſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly pourtrayed; and I fondly perſuade myſelf that thou wilt, without reluctance, embrace in the arms of thy complacency, thy moſt obedient, and ſincerely devoted friend, and very humble ſervant,</p>

                     <p>OBSERVING in the general preface, publiſhed in the <hi>December</hi> Magazine,<note n="*" place="bottom">The reader is requeſted to remember, that the Eſſays which compoſe this Firſt Volume were written purpoſely for the Monthly Muſeum, in which they originally appeared; and that they now ſtand precisely in the order, and nearly in the manner, in which they were firſt preſented.</note> a hint which I have conſtrued into a deſire to increaſe the number of your miſcellaneous correſpondents; and, ſtimulated by the delicate reproof upon literary indolence, which that elegant exordium contains, I feel myſelf, while ſitting quite at my leiſure, on this evening of January 27th, 1792, ſtrongly incited by my <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad genius—the event</hi> muſt determine the character of the ſpright which is goading me on, to take into my ſerious conſideration, the ſolicitation which in ſaid preface is ſo modeſtly urged, and which ſquares ſo wonderfully well with my ideas of the reaſon and fitneſs of things.</p>
                     <p>Not that I ſhall aim at palming myſelf upon the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, for a ſon of literature, a votary of the nine, or a dabbler in wit. I have no pretenſion to any of theſe characters. I am <hi>rather</hi> a plain man, who, after ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the day in making proviſion for my little family, ſit myſelf comfortably down by a clean hearth, and a good fire, enjoying, through theſe long evenings, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite

zeſt, the pleaſures of the hour, whether they happen to be furniſhed by an amuſing tale, a well written book, or a ſocial friend. Poſſibly I might have jogged on to the end of my journey, in this ſober, tranquil manner: but alas, for ſome time paſt, I think, as near as I can remember, ever ſince the commencement of your Magazine, I have been ſeized with a violent deſire to become a writer. To combat this unaccountable itch for ſcribbling, it is in vain that I have endeavoured; it follows me through all the buſy ſcenes which the day preſents; it is my conſtant accompaniment in every nocturnal haunt; and it often keeps me waking, when, I verily believe, but for this reſtleſs deſire, I might enjoy, in the fulleſt latitude, every bleſſing which hath ever yet been aſcribed to ſleep.</p>
                     <p>The many comprehenſive titles, and alluring ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures, which have from time to time embelliſhed your Magazine, have well near captivated my reaſon; and among many <hi>et ceteras,</hi> which might be enumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, the following appellations have had for me pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar charms: An ample field ſeemed opening in the title page of the <hi>General Obſerver;</hi> the name <hi>Philo</hi> appeared replete with ſtudious lore; the <hi>Politician</hi> was indefatigable for the good of the nation; the <hi>Philanthropiſt</hi> bled ſympathy; and with the <hi>Rivulet</hi> I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>raptured. At the bar of fancy, many a title for my intended eſſays hath been tried, and hath been ſucceſſively condemned. A variety of ſignatures have been deliberately adopted, and as deliberately diſplaced, until my pericranium hath been nearly turned with thinking. Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, with my wiſh to commence author, originated alſo, a moſt inordinate ambition, and an inſatiable thirſt for applauſe. In whatever line I made my appearance, I was ſolicitous to ſtand unequalled.—I would be Ceſar, or I would be nothing. The ſmoothneſs of Addiſon's page, the purity, ſtrength and correctneſs of Swift, the magic numbers of Pope
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034162_0014_0FFC5D827B376898"/>
—theſe muſt all veil to me. The Homers and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils of antiquity, I would rival; and, audacious as I am, from the Philenia's of the preſent age, I would arrogantly ſnatch the bays. Strange as is this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it is nevertheleſs true. And, moreover, all theſe wild extravagancies have been engendered in a brain, which it may be, doth not poſſeſs abilities ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the furniſhing a paragraph in a common newſpaper! My caſe, I aſſure you, Gentlemen, hath been truly pitiable, while, for three years paſt, I have been ſtruggling with an inflatus, which hath been almoſt irreſiſtible. Reaſon, however, aided, as I ſaid, by a conviction of inferiority, hath hitherto reſtrained me; but your laſt preface hath done the buſineſs—it hath intereſted my feelings, and induced <hi>even reaſon</hi> to enliſt under the banners of temerity—the fire thus long pent up, cannot now be ſmothered, but acquiring, from its confinement, additional fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, it at length produces me a candidate for that applauſe, by a proſpect of which, you are ſolicitous to engage your readers in the arduous purſuit of fame.</p>
                     <p>Thus reſolved, the die is caſt, and this ungovernable mania admits of one only remedy. But having once made up my mind to write, an appellation is the next thing to be conſidered; for as to ſubjects, my ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine hopes aſſure me they will follow of courſe. A writer of facetious memory, hath repreſented his dear Jenny, when ſhe could not obtain the tiſſued robe, as meekly aſſuming the humbleſt garb which frugality could furniſh. I am fond of reſpectable examples, and I have humility enough to be influenced by them.</p>
                     <p>My title having much exerciſed my mind, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced that any conſiderable achievements are beyond my graſp, upon mature deliberation I have thought beſt to adopt, and I do hereby adopt, the name, character, and avocation of a GLEANER; and this appellation, I do freely confeſs, gives a full and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034162_0015_0FFC5D7FE1C33040"/>
complete idea of my preſent amazingly curtailed views.</p>
                     <p>Here pride ſuggeſts a queſtion, What is any mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſcribbler better than a Gleaner? But I very <hi>ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly</hi> reply, Let my brethren and ſiſters of the quill characterize themſelves; I ſhall not thus, upon the very threſhold of the vocation of my election, enter the liſts.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, I am very fond of my title: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that I ſhall find it in many reſpects abundantly convenient; more eſpecially, ſhould an accuſation of plagiariſm be lodged againſt me, my very <hi>title</hi> will plead my apology; for it would be indeed pitiful if the opulent reaper, whoſe granaries are confeſſedly large, and variouſly ſupplied, ſhould grudge the poor Gleaner what little he induſtriouſly collects, and what, from the richneſs and plenty of his ample harveſt, he can never want.</p>
                     <p>With diligence then, I ſhall ranſack the fields, the meadows, and the groves; each ſecret haunt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſequeſtered, with avidity I ſhall explore; deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf privileged to crop with impunity a hint from one, an idea from another, and to aim at im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement upon a ſentence from a third. I ſhall give to my materials whatever texture my fancy directs; and, as I ſaid, feeling myſelf entitled to toleration as a Gleaner, in this expreſſive name I ſhall take ſhelter, ſtanding entirely regardleſs of every charge relative to property, originality, and every thing of this nature, which may be preferred againſt me.</p>
                     <p>Mean time, ſhould any of the Parnaſſian girls, or his godſhip Apollo, or any other genius, ſylph, or gnome, of legendary or fairy anceſtry, fond of encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging a young beginner, throw into my baſket an <hi>unbroken ſheaf,</hi> you may depend upon it that I will aſſay to form the valuable original, with all the care, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy and ſkill which cloſe thinking, deep ſtudy, and an ardent deſire to excel, can beſtow; and you may far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034162_0016_0FFC5D7D00BEA898"/>
aſſure yourſelves, that when thus highly wrought, I ſhall haſte to preſent the precious gift, a fit offering at the ſhrine of the Maſſachuſetts Magazine. Thus having, as far as it lays with me, adjuſted prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I propoſe myſelf, Gentlemen, as a candidate for a place in your Magazine. If my pretenſions are judged inadmiſſible, preſiding in your reſpectable divan, you have but to wave your oblivious wand, and I am <hi>forever</hi> ſilenced. I confeſs, however, that I have no violent inclination to ſee the Gleaner among your liſt of acknowledgments to correſpondents, ſet up as a mark for the ſhafts of wit, however burniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they may be.</p>
                     <p>You, Gentlemen, poſſeſs the ſpecific at which I have already hinted, and by which I may be radically cured; and if this attempt is really as abſurd as I am even now, at times, inclined to think it, your non-inſertion of, and ſilence thereto, will operate as effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually as the ſevereſt reprehenſion, and will be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Gleaner as a judgment from which there is no appeal.</p>

                     <p>Bleſs me! cried Margaretta, while, in the hope of meeting ſomething from the pen of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, ſhe threw her fine eyes in a curſory manner ever the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex to the February Magazine. But pray, it may
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034162_0017_0FFC5D7907C29E38"/>
be aſked, who is Margaretta? Curioſity is, without doubt, a uſeful if not a laudable propenſity; and, if it is the parent of many evils, it is but fair to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that it hath alſo among its numerous ſons and daughters ſome extremely well favoured children. Curioſity hath given birth to the moſt arduous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits; its achievements have been of the greateſt util<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; and without this ſtimulus we ſhould have great reaſon to fear an univerſal ſtagnation in every branch of knowledge. Moreover, this ſame curioſity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts, at this preſent, very exactly with my feelings; for the queſtion—Pray, who is Margaretta? involves a ſubject upon which I expatiate with infinite ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and upon which I have never yet loſt an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of being loquaciouſly communicative.</p>
                     <p>At the cloſe of the late war, when I was an idle young fellow, fond of indulging myſelf in every lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury which the ſmall patrimony that deſcended to me from a very worthy father, would permit, I conceived an invincible deſire of becoming a ſpectator of the felicity which I imagined the inhabitants of South-Carolina, particularly the ſuffering metropolis of that State, would experience on their emancipation from a ſucceſſion of evils, which, for a period of ſeven years, had continued to occupy their minds, giving them to taſte deeply of every calamity conſequent upon a war, conducted in that part of our country with almoſt unparalleled barbarity. I had early connected my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the bands of wedlock with a young woman of a mild and conceding diſpoſition, who ſincerely loved me, and who, accommodating herſelf even to my caprices, hath made it the ſtudy of her life, when ſhe could not convince my judgment, however ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional her arguments in her own eſtimation, to bend to my purpoſes her moſt approved wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>When I announced my intention of viſiting South Carolina, ſhe could not forbear ſuggeſting ſome economical ideas; but upon a declaration that I was determined to execute my plan, ſhe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034162_0018_0FFC5D7648CEB320"/>
with that kind of acquieſcence, which our ſex is ſo fond of conſidering as the proper charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic of womanhood. For a progreſs then of many hundred miles, in a one horſe chaiſe, we commenced our journey; we intended to paſs on by eaſy ſtages; and, moreover, we were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by one of the patriotic exiled citizens of Charleſton, with whom, during a ſtruggle which aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated the remoteſt ſubjects of the union, we had contracted an intimate acquaintance. The kindneſs of this gentleman, who was well mounted, ſerving us as a relay, we proceeded expeditiouſly enough, and I do not remember that I ever in my life paſſed my time more agreeably. Many ſcenes novel and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting, proſpects extenſive, and views truly pictur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſque, arreſted our attention; and were I not haſting to give a ſolution to the reader's queſtion, I might perhaps amuſe him very tolerably, in the deſcriptive line, through two or three pages cloſe printing; but in a courſe of publications, I may poſſibly again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to exhibitions which pleaſed me ſo highly at the time, when I may be more at leiſure to <hi>glean</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever flower recollection may furniſh.</p>
                     <p>On our arrival in Charleſton we found our moſt ſanguine expectations anſwered; the joy of the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated citizens was unbounded—it was beyond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; nor can I give a better idea of their ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction than by pronouncing it in exact proportion to, and fully commenſurate with, their preceding ſufferings. Our companion, however, was, by the ſame unwarrantable meaſures which had wrecked many a princely fortune, ſtripped of his whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; ſo that being entire ſtrangers in Charleſton, we were neceſſitated to provide ourſelves with hired lodgings.</p>
                     <p>Our landlady was a widow of reputation, whoſe houſe was frequented only by people of the utmoſt circumſpection. The ſecond day after our arrival, as the good woman was pouring the tea, which
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034162_0019_0FFC5D74C708B860"/>
we had choſen for breakfaſt, a gentle tap at the door drew our attention. My wife, who is in fact the pink of civility, was mechanically riſing to open it, when ſhe was prevented by our hoſteſs, who cried, Sit down, Madam, it is nobody but the child. My dear Mary, who is extravagantly fond of children, catching at the ſound, eagerly replied, "Then, Madam, you have a young family." "No, Madam," returned the hoſteſs, "it is long ſince my young folks have been grown up about me; but this little creature belongs to an unfortunate lodger of mine, who is continually weeping over her, and who I am afraid will not long be an inhabitant of this bad world; indeed I ſuppoſe her preſent errand is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by ſome new diſtreſs of her mother's, for the pretty thing is wonderfully ſenſible for ſuch a mere baby." My poor wife, in whoſe compoſition human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity is the paramount ingredient, inſtantly found her benevolence engaged; all her tender feelings took the alarm; and, precipitately quitting her chair, in a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous voice ſhe exclaimed, "Pray, Madam, neglect not the unfortunate ſick perſon for us; I can fill the tea, and I beſeech you to admit the little petitioner." The good woman, pronouncing a panegyric upon the tenderneſs of my wife's diſpoſition, forthwith threw open the door, when a little female, apparently about ten years of age, preſented herſelf; ſhe was beautiful as innocence, and her figure was of that kind, which ſeems formed to intereſt every benign principle of the ſoul; which is calculated to invigorate, even in the boſom of the moſt phlegmatic, the latent ſparks of pity, although nearly ſmothered there.</p>
                     <p>"Oh Mrs. Thrifty!" exclaimed the heart affecting pleader, <q>will you not come to my mamma? will you not give her ſome more of them bleſſed drops which yeſterday made her ſo much better? ſhe is—indeed ſhe is</q>—Here, caſting her eyes toward us, whom her concern had before prevented her from ſeeing, and who were regarding her with a mixture of pity and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034162_0020_0FFC5D73459E2410"/>
admiration, a modeſt bluſh tinged her cheek, which, even at that early age, had been too often waſhed by the tear of ſorrow; and, burſting into an agony of grief, ſhe remained ſilent. "Go on, Margaretta, ſaid Mrs. Thrifty; let us know what new complaint you have to make; this gentleman and lady are very good, and will excuſe you." Mary took the hand of the weeping cherub, and drawing her to her, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed upon her humid cheek one of thoſe balmy kiſſes which ſhe is always ready to beſtow upon the young proficient, thus early enliſted under the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of misfortune. "Mrs. Thrifty ſays right, my dear, every body will love and pity you; tell us, how is your mamma?" The child, hanging upon the arm of my wife, expreſſed by her intelligent eyes a thouſand mingling ſenſations; ſurpriſe, love, gratitude, and a corrected kind of joy, ſeemed to grow at once in her ſoul; and, bowing upon the hand of Mary in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed manner, ſhe ſpontaneouſly expreſſed the invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untary emotions of her boſom: <q>Oh my dear lady, will you not ſee my mamma? certainly you can make her well, and ſhe is indeed very ſick; I thought this morning ſhe would ſpeak to me no more—ſhe looked ſo pale—and was ſo long before ſhe bid me repeat my morning hymn: Oh if my poor mamma ſhould die—I cannot—indeed I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtay here.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mary, it will not be doubted, bent her utmoſt efforts to ſoothe the ſweet mourner. But not to dwell longer upon a ſubject, on which it will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be thought I have already too much enlarged, it ſhall ſuffice to ſay, that, through the good offices of her little friend, Mary ſoon procured an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction into the chamber of the ſick—that, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which at firſt originated in compaſſion for the charming child, meliorated into a ſympathetic kind of amity—and that, for the courſe of one week, ſhe paſſed a very large proportion of her time in endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring to mitigate the calamities of the ſuffering mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034162_0021_0FFC5D6D834F55F8"/>
Her aſſiduities, however, were not crowned with the ſalutary effects ſhe wiſhed; the patient, it was but too apparent, was haſtening on to the hour of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; her diſorder was a regular decline; the ſhafts of a deep-rooted and incurable grief, muſt, of neceſſity, be unerring; and it was evident, that in the boſom of the fair afflicted, corroding ſorrow had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed its envenomed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ooth. My wife often recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended a reſignation to, and reliance on, the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a paternal God; but the dying woman ſhook her head, and continued her pity moving ſighs: And about ten days after our abode at Mrs. Thrifty's, the poor lady recovering from a fainting fit, during which it was ſuppoſed ſhe had breathed her laſt, ſummoned us into her apartment, and, conſigning Margaretta to the care of Mrs. Thrifty, ſhe thus addreſſed us:—</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>You ſee before you, my friends—for friends, ſhort as is the interval in which I have known you, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of concurring circumſtances evinces you, in the moſt exalted ſenſe of the term, to be; but you are uniformly, I doubt not, the friends of the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and the Searcher of all hearts knows that my claim to your regards in this character is indubitable. You ſee before you, I ſay, a very diſtreſſed woman; for the ſake of the child who is juſt gone from me, I will briefly recount to you the outlines, if I may ſo expreſs myſelf, of my life. She is not, as ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, my daughter—I never was a mother—I was the eldeſt of two ſiſters, who ſaw ourſelves reduced from affluence to penury; we were orphans, and we were, by the rapacious hand of unexampled fraud, deſpoiled of our patrimony; our mutual affection, however, ſurvived; and, upon the altar which our misfortunes had erected, we exchanged vows of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal amity. To a ſmall town in the environs of London we retired, endeavouring to ſhelter our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs heads, and to ſeek from honeſt induſtry, that ſupport, of which, by faithleſs truſtees, we had been robbed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="23" facs="unknown:034162_0022_0FFC5D6BDAA92260"/>
My ſiſter was addreſſed by a young man, whom I conceived altogether unworthy of her; for the pride of my heart was yet unſubdued; ſhe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, notwithſtanding all my remonſtrances, perſiſted in encouraging the purſuit of young Melworth; while, ſo rooted was my averſion, ſo impaſſioned my decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and ſo unyielding the anger which deformed my ſoul, that I raſhly proteſted, the hour which made them one, ſhould fix between us an everlaſting bar, and that I would on no account, after ſuch an event, hold with her the ſmalleſt intercourſe. Their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage nevertheleſs took place, and to my ſiſter's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties for a reſtoration of our former amities, my obdurate heart continued inſenſible.</p>
                        <p>About this time, Captain Arbuthnot made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in our village; a tender friendſhip grew between us; it meliorated into love, and he, in ſome ſort, ſupplied to me the place of my loſt ſiſter: Hymen ſanctified our union, and I eſteemed myſelf the happieſt of women.</p>
                        <p>Of my ſiſter, I knew but little; common ſame indeed informed me, that ſhe was ſatisfied with her connexion, that her circumſtances were eaſy, that ſhe had given birth to one daughter, and with this intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence I was well enough contented. It is true, I was, by private whiſpers, aſſured that ſhe pined after a reconciliation, and that ſhe had often been heard to ſay, that a renewal of our once warm and glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attachment, was the only remaining requiſite which was yet wanting to complete her felicity. Still, however, I was unmoved; and I verily believed that every tender ſentiment, in regard to my ſiſter, was eradicated from my boſom. It was at this junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that I accompanied Captain Arbuthnot in a journey of ſome months; and on my return, being upon a viſit, among other occurrences which were retailed to me, I learned that Mr. Melworth, having engaged on board a ſhip which had foundered at ſea, every life had been loſt; and that Mrs. Melworth,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:034162_0023_0FFC5D68B49C3748"/>
whoſe health was before in a declining ſtate, was faſt ſinking under this calamitous event. The feelings of nature, were now, as by a ſhock of electricity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly rouſed. Unſpeakable was the agony of my ſoul! with the utmoſt ſpeed I haſted to her abode; but alas! I was only in time to receive her laſt ſighs! the dart which my unkindneſs had aimed at her peace, urged by a ſtroke ſo fatal, deeply transfixed her ſpirit, and ſhe was abſolutely expiring a martyr to the ſeverity of her fate. Yet, ere ſhe breathed her laſt, ſhe bequeathed her little Margaretta to my care. The ſweet infant, then only two years old, intuitively, as it ſhould ſeem, threw her arms about my neck, while in the preſence of Heaven, and in the hearing of her departing mother, I ſolemnly ſwore never to forſake her; and, ſince that hour, to ſhelter, to ſoothe, to reſtrain, and to direct my lovely charge, hath been the prime object of my life; but, yet a little while, and I ſhall be here no more. Oh thou ſainted ſhade of my much wronged Margaretta! may my death, ſo ſimilar to thy own, expiate my injuſtice to thee, thou firſt, moſt indulgent, and mildeſt of women.</p>
                        <p>In one of the regiments ſtationed in Ireland, and in the year eighty-one ordered to America, Captain Arbuthnot had a command; he was now my only friend, and with my little orphan, who imagined us her real parents, I reſolved to follow his fortunes. We had been induced to ſuppoſe that caſe and afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence awaited us here; that the country was ſubdued, and that nothing remained for us but to take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the forfeited lands; but we have been miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably deceived. Landing in this city, upon the third of June, as early as the ſeventh of the ſame month, the troops marched under the command of Lord Rawdon, encountering inconceivable difficulties, in a rapid progreſs beneath the intenſe rays of a burning ſun, through the whole extent of the State. My un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate huſband fell a victim to the climate, and to the wounds which he received in the engagement,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:034162_0024_0FFC5D65B8E406A0"/>
which took place near Shubrick's plantation. Need the reſt be told?—Upon the evacuation of Charleſton, I was unable to embark with the troops. For my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Margaretta, my laſt ſigh will be breathed; it is for her, as I ſaid, my humane friends, that I have thus long detained you. By the injuries of which they complain, the benevolent feelings of the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of this city are blunted—what can I do? ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as you are, I ſolicit your advice—was ſhe but provided for, my paſſage out of time would be eaſy; for, with regard to myſelf, I know no proſpect ſo pleaſing, as a ſpeedy reunion with my Henry and my much injured ſiſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mary caſt upon me her intelligent eyes; I underſtood the reference, and I haſtily replied, If, Madam, your confidence in us is ſufficient to calm your mind, you may make yourſelf entirely eaſy about your girl; for, from this moment, we jointly inveſt ourſelves with the guardianſhip of the little orphan, and we promiſe to conſider her as the child of our affection. This was enough; the matron yielded up her ſpirit without a remaining re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret; and, after aſſiſting at her obſequies, we returned home, well pleaſed with our new acquiſition.</p>

                     <p>"BLESS me!" cried Margaretta, "as I live, here is, in this Magazine, a publication entitled the Gleaner!" As ſhe ſpoke, ſhe bent her lovely face toward me, in order the more attentively to obſerve what effect this information produced in the lines of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034162_0025_0FFC5D61CE877B80"/>
my countenance, I endeavoured to preſerve my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed gravity. Margaretta interrogated—"Dear Sir, did I not lately hear you ſay, that if you ever appeared in the world as an author, you would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be known by this appellation?" I was ſtill ſilent—Margaretta continued,—"I proteſt, Sir, I am ſorry you are foreſtalled, for I had promiſed myſelf a fund of improvement, whenever you ſhould employ your talents as a writer: I expected alſo, much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment from the various conjectures which I imagined would have been hazarded, relative to the real character of the Gleaner, and I was poſitive, that from the commendations which would undoubtedly have been beſtowed upon my beſt friend, I ſhould have experienced ſome of the fineſt ſenſations of which my gratefully duteous heart is ſuſceptible." I ſaw that having entered upon a ſubject that her ingenuity never fails of rendering ſufficiently copious, ſhe would ſo manage it, as to prattle on, till her tender volubility had made of me the fool, into which it is always in her power, (my boaſted equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity notwithſtanding) to convert me. I judged it proper, therefore, to ſtop her in her career, and drawing my pipe from my mouth, I haſtily exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—I tell you, child—I tell you, Miſs Melworth, that the univerſe containeth not ſo vile an aſſaſſin of our beſt purpoſes, ſo dete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:034162_0026_0FFC5D604C40CB88"/>
there is no reſurrection. Had I, immediately on my election, engaged in a compoſition of ſome kind or other, (for the verſatility of the title allows the utmoſt latitude) had I forthwith ſent it forward to the Editors, I ſhould thus have ſecured, by appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the deſignation of my choice; but what regrets can redeem the paſt? read it, however, my dear, and let us profit by every means.</p>
                     <p>The reader will remember that at the time of this confab, the ſecond number of the Gleaner was not written.</p>
                     <p>Margaretta read, and when ſhe had finiſhed the piece, I proceeded, without commenting thereon, to harangue the good girl, and Mary my wife (though I muſt confeſs, that few females ſtand leſs in need of lecturing) upon the value of time, upon the neceſſity of ſeizing it by the forelock, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. And indeed is there a more eſtimable gem, a pearl of more intrinſic worth, than that quota of days, which is committed to every hand? and, ſince by graſping the moments we cannot detain them, ſince when once they have winged their flight, it is only by reflection that they are known, what induſtrious lapidaries ought we to be, that ſo their radiant influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may emit the moſt ſuperb and lengthening beams of light. I have long been a warm admirer of that Roman Emperor, who is repreſented as lamenting in ſo impaſſioned a manner, the loſs of a ſingle day; and in truth, he could not poſſibly have been furniſhed with a more rational cauſe of regret; for, had he been robbed of his poſſeſſions, as an individual, the wheel of fortune is ſtill revolving, and his ancient patrimony might have once more been eſtabliſhed; were his vaſt dominions in any part diſmembered, armed for conqueſt, he might have gone forth, and his victorious arm might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have reunited the ſevered diſtrict; was he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the choiceſt of his friends, with the gods they ſtill remained, and futurity would doubtleſs
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:034162_0027_0FFC5D5D954F17E8"/>
reſtore them: but alas! the lapſe of time he could never overtake, its courſe muſt be ever progreſſive, no hand can roll back its career. Neither Joſhua nor Hezekiah, though they may juſtly be deemed Heaven's firſt favourites, though the condeſcending Deity propitiouſly bending his ear to the prayer of their ſupplications, added whole years to the life of the one, inveſting the other with full power to arreſt and ſuſpend the operations of nature, giving the ſun at his command to ſtand ſtill upon Mount Gibeon, and the moon in the valley of Ajalon, yet they could not ſo far prevail with their God, as to induce him to recal a ſingle moment which had paſſed by.</p>
                     <p>If then, time is a good, which when gone is beyond redemption, utterly and altogether irretrievable, the wonder is, that we are ſo little attentive to its waſte that in its regulations and diſtribution we economize ſo little! I have thought, that if parſimony is ever tolerated, it ought to be in the diſpoſition of time, and that the penurious hand, when employed in appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the moments, may with propriety be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the direction of virtue. It is ſtrange to hear from the mouth of one who murders above half the hours, by conſigning them to oblivious ſleep, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the ſhortneſs of time, and yet nothing is more frequent. Six hours in four and twenty, devoted to ſleep, when the conſtitution is naturally good, is ſaid, by the moſt eminent phyſicians, to be fully adequate to every purpoſe of health. If we have accuſtomed ourſelves, when the ſun is upwards of fifteen hours above our horizon, to proſtrate before the drowſy god, until the hour of eight in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let us by perſeverance acquire the habit of quitting our pillows at five, at a moment when the bluſhing face of nature is clothed in tranquillity; when every breeze ſeems commiſſioned to invigorate the mind; when the weary frame which the evening before ſunk down languid, debilitated, and almoſt exhauſted, is as it were renovated; when, aided by
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:034162_0028_0FFC5D59250DD700"/>
fancy, we might be induced to conceive ourſelves again in the morning of our days; when every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance diſpoſeth to the peaceful enjoyments of contemplation, and the moſt philanthropic ſentiments are originated in the boſom: Let us, I ſay, reſolutely and cheerfully embark in this <hi>ſpeculation,</hi> and we ſhall find that three of the moſt delightful hours are every day gained; that twenty-one hours are cleared in the courſe of one week; and how many months may be thus added to a common life, let the expert arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metician calculate. It is certain that ſleep is a figure of death, that while wrapt in its embraces, we are in <hi>effect</hi> as <hi>helpleſs,</hi> and in <hi>fact</hi> as <hi>unconſcious</hi> of every thing which in reality paſſeth upon this globe, as the body which hath been for many years entombed; and as it is quite as poſſible to commit a debauch in ſleeping as in eating or drinking, it muſt be acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged as an undoubted truth, that every moment thus devoted, which is more than ſufficient to reſtore the tired faculties, is worſe than loſt. But it is not enough that we become careful to enrich ourſelves by an accumulation of hours, an exact attention to their appropriation being to the full as requiſite. It is in vain that we have amaſſed much property, if we laviſh it in a profuſe or thoughtleſs manner. Order ſhould be employed as the handmaid of time; ſhe ſhould mark, arrange and decorate every move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; thus protecting from the inroads of confuſion, which would ingulf even the longevity of an antedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luvian.</p>
                     <p>It would be pleaſant to obſerve the contraſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a family, the females of which were properly methodical, and economical in their diſtributions and expenditures of time, and one accuſtomed to leave every thing to the moment of neceſſity, to conform to no regulations, but to crowd the affairs which ought to take rank, in the different diviſions of the week, into ſome contingency for which they are totally unprepared: The one is the habitation of

tranquillity; it is a well ordered community; it is a complicated machine, the component parts of which are ſo harmoniouſly organized, as to produce none but the moſt concordant ſounds, to effectuate none but the moſt ſalutary and uniform purpoſes; in ſhort, it is a terreſtrial paradiſe, where dwells love and unity, attended by all the bleſſings of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     <p>I wiſh not, ſaid Erneſtus to Craſtinatus, to entruſt my only ſon to the fluctuating waves of the treacherous ocean; but, in my opinion, neither Charybdis nor Scyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, though armed with all the terrors once attributed to them, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Why do you not take him into your compting-houſe, replied Craſtinatus, he will certainly find full employ there, for I declare for my own part, that though I conſtantly retain two clerks, I am yet notwithſtanding, inexpreſſibly fatigued by the multiplicity of attentions which my buſineſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves. Well, I do not know how it is returned Erneſtus; but I aſſure you, neighbour, upon my hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, though I have not the ſmalleſt aſſiſtance, that were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But the buſineſs of Craſtinatus is more various, more extenſive, and his avocations are more multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Erneſtus, it may be, moves in a more confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſphere.

devoted, and equity in their dealings is alike the goal of their wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>But the cloſe of every week ſtates exactly the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of Erneſtus; the poſting of his books was, from the firſt, the work of every day; as often as poſſible he paſſeth receipts; and when this deſideratum cannot be obtained, ſo preciſely is debt and credit announced, that the foot of every page preſents the moſt unerring information; the whole amount of his <hi>poſſeſſions</hi> he knows; every farthing for which he is indebted is in legible characters expreſſed, and in a very ſhort ſpace of time, he can eſtimate to a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, what he is <hi>really</hi> worth: no perſon demands of Erneſtus a ſecond time his dues, for he never <hi>hazards larger ſums, than his capital can at any time command;</hi> this enableth him to wear the wreath of punctuality, and he ſupports, unimpeached, even by the tongue of ſlander, the character of an honeſt man. The happy effects of ſuch a mode of procedure, are too obvious to be pointed out, and Erneſtus <hi>feels</hi> them all.</p>
                     <p>The heart of Craſtinatus is equally good, but irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution hath affixed its ſtamp upon his mind, and he hath not perſeverance enough to break the force of habit; a demand upon Craſtinatus for a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, throws him into the utmoſt confuſion; his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts have ran ſo long, that they involve a thouſand intricacies; all hands are at work to inveſtigate; to come at truth is difficult, if not impoſſible; and it is a wonder if a rupture is not the conſequence. When Craſtinatus hath paid the great debt of nature, his affairs will lay open to the inroads of fraud, his wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow and his orphan children will be the ſufferers, and the probability is, that an inſolvency will take place. Whereas, had he—But it is time that I recollect myſelf; it may be thought that I encroach too far upon a department, which may be conſidered as already filled. Well then, having gleaned thus much, I will only add, that a late ingenious writer would have obſerved—Craſtinatus "doth not work it right."</p>

                     <p>THERE is ſcarce an obſerver in all the purlieus of contemplation, but muſt recollect, in ſome part or other of his life, to have met with ſpirited declamations upon the degeneracy of the times. O Tempora! O Mores! is an exclamation frequently in the mouths of thoſe who inherit much, and who are, by the good and wholeſome laws of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, guaranteed the peaceable enjoyment of their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple poſſeſſions. There is a ſet of people who can never ſee a tax-bill, or attend to the requiſitions of government, without mutinouſly, if not treacherouſly, running the parallel between what they term the preſent exorbitant demands, and the moderate char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Britiſh adminiſtration; and while they are blind to the emoluments of independence, they ſeem to forget that <hi>houſe keeping is of neceſſity more expenſive than a reſidence in the dwelling of a parent or a maſter</hi> If the ſpirit of diſcontent was peculiar to theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate cavillers, it would be well; but we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to find, that it pervades all orders of men, from the philoſopher down to the verieſt grumbler—from the prieſt to the cobler—from the aggrandized lawyer to his fleeced client—from the moſt enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened phyſician to his ſuffering patient—from the ſtateſman to the beggar—and from the liberally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed and independent gentleman to the common day's labourer. In ſhort, every deſcription of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are found crying out on the depravity of the times; and were we to give full credit to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of thoſe, who, from age to age, have taken an unaccountable pleaſure in <hi>depreciating the time being,</hi> we ſhould be ready to conclude, that we muſt at length have arrived at the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of turpitude,

and have become adepts in every ſpecies of atrocious criminality. Yet the accuſation proceeds from the lips of very reſpectable complainants, whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in many reſpects, is hardly problematical, and to whoſe deciſions we ſubmit perhaps with too much docility.</p>
                     <p>In order to exalt the ancients, and to render them ſupreme in the ſcale of excellence, it is cuſtomary to level the moderns; and the fame of the one is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated, in an exact ratio, as that of the other is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued.</p>
                     <p>We are told much of the <hi>golden age;</hi> but the moſt careful inveſtigator is at a loſs at what period of the world to date its epoch; ſince, immediately upon the expulſion of Adam from the paradiſe which he had forfeited, the battery of hatred and malevolence was opened; grants were abroad in the earth, and nations no ſooner exiſted, than they learned war.</p>
                     <p>The golden age, then, with all its ſplendid charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtics, we are feign to conſign to the region of fancy, denying it a being, but in the breath of poetic fiction, or the annals of imagination.</p>
                     <p>The ſuperiority which we are ſo ready to award to the ancients, may be equally without any foundation in reality; and it is in my humble opinion probable, that their principal advantages were derived from their being firſt upon the ſtage of action. Methinks I ſee the bluſh of indignation tinge the face of the reader, and he is ready to execrate the Gleaner, for attempting to pluck from the venerable brow of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity the ſmalleſt twig of fame.

                     <p>Man is uſhered into being; he finds himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to all the viciſſitudes with which the various ſeaſons are replete; the wintery ſtorms are abroad; hail, rain and ſnow poſſeſs a power eſſentially to afflict him; he burns beneath a torrid zone, or he freezes beneath a frigid; in ſhort, every thing points out to him the neceſſity of a ſhelter, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, he ſinks the hollowed cavity, or he raiſes the thatched hut; with proper repairs, this homely dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling would anſwer full as well for his ſucceſſor; but his ſon improves thereon, and every generation adds ſomething, till at length the finiſhed edifice becomes complete. Now, I would aſk, is not every genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion entitled to its quota of praiſe? and ſince the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal inventor was urged merely by neceſſity, and performed no more than what the beaver and other animals have frequently done, may not the <hi>improver,</hi> who had not this incitement, come in for his full ſhare?</p>
                     <p>Surely the annals of antiquity record inſtances of barbariſm in perſons, when the manners were deemed highly poliſhed, which would ſhock the preſent feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the moſt illiterate.

buffoon to hold up a Socrates as a fit ſubject for the ridicule of the people!</p>
                     <p>But the ancients made many diſcoveries—very true—and is not the reaſon obvious? <hi>There was much to diſcover;</hi> moreover, neceſſity, as hath been before hinted, is an excellent ſtimulus to promptitude; yet, in ſome reſpects, it would ſeem that they were vaſtly deficient in ingenuity: For example; through re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving centuries they remained ignorant of the art of printing, by which they might ſo eligibly have tranſmitted to us their elaborate productions, although they could not ſet a foot upon the <hi>yielding</hi> earth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out producing an <hi>impreſſion</hi> ſufficient to ſuggeſt to them ſo valuable an idea.</p>
                     <p>The education of a modern ſtudent is by no means finiſhed, without an extenſive acquaintance with the hiſtory, learning, manners and cuſtoms of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients; the beſt part of his life is therefore devoted to acquire this knowledge, and when thus accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, he finds that the age of fancy is well near fled, and that to him the door of originality ſeems effectually barred. The ſtudent of antiquity was not thus encumbered; from his predeceſſors he had little to reap, and the volume of nature was opened before him; yet his acquirements were often ſuperficial, while the deepeſt reſearches, with their conſequent improvements, were reſerved for later ages.</p>
                     <p>How dreadful are the preparations for war, which the page of antiquity recounts! their terrific habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; their deathful chariots; their elephants, with all the ſhocking apparatus! ſcarcely are they exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the arrangements of an American ſavage, and hardly are the tortures which he meditates, more fearfully tremendous. What ſcenes of blood and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation doth the annals of ancient hiſtory exhibit! how frequently are the feelings of humanity pierced to the very ſoul! what fratricide! what parricide! while inſtances are not wanting of <hi>mothers,</hi> who wade to empire through the blood of thoſe children, in

                     <p>The government of the ancients, whether demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical, ariſtocratical, monarchical, ſimple or mixed; all theſe, if examined by the eye of impartiality, the boaſted wiſdom of their legiſlators, yielding in many reſpects to modern improvements, will, if I miſtake not, by exactly ſtriking the balance, prove the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Deity to be equal, and manifeſt him diſtrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uting with a paternal hand, to every age their exact proportion of talents, endowing every diviſion of time, with men poſſeſſing underſtandings alike capable of profiting by the circumſtances in which they were involved. With regard to the religion of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, I ſuppoſe it will be granted, that it was a heap of abſurdities; that it conſiſted of contradictions, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities, and myſteries; the character of their very deities are lewd and otherwiſe immoral; with the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valſhip and content on of their gods we are diſguſted; and even the hiſtory of their Jupiter is replete with crimes, that abundantly juſtify the ill humour of his Juno, that would have warranted the moſt coercive proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But to reſume the language of reaſon; this fond predilection for, and preference of the ancients, is, in reality, altogether unaccountable; it is a ſingular trait in the hiſtory of mankind, ſince, in every other inſtance, the perſons, places and things, with which we have aſſociated, and to which we are accuſtomed, poſſeſs a charm, the blandiſhments of which we find

Indeed this attachment to country is aſtoniſhing, and not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doth it betray the mind into prejudices and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, extravagant and unjuſt. But one of the moſt pleaſing effects of this local affection is, that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine tranſport which ſo agreeably ſurpriſes the ſoul, upon unexpectedly meeting, in a diſtant land, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, a townſman, or even a ſubject of the ſame government; perhaps in the ſtreets of our own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict, we ſhould have paſſed him with the utmoſt indifference; but abſence ſtill more endears to us every natural connexion; reflection meliorates our ideas; circumſtances in themſelves of little or no conſequence, acquire a tender kind of importance; recollection preſents the ſcenes of home-felt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and though, probably, they were undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by any prominent feature, by any particular refinement, or impreſſive ſoftneſs, yet, regiſtered in the ſtore-houſe of memory, they riſe up dignified and reſpectable claimants, they are cheriſhed with aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting regard, they point us to anticipated good; and the traveller, who would once have been viewed as a ſtranger, ſtanding as a memento, is embraced with the ardour of friendſhip.</p>

all things are in a ſtate of progreſſion, I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the preſent, <hi>as the beſt of all poſſible times;</hi> yet I do conceive, that at no period ſince the lapſe of Adam, was the world in ſo high a ſtate of improvement, as it is at this very inſtant; it is leſs malevolent, and more philanthropic; it is leſs barbarous, and more civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized; it is leſs vicious, and more moral; it is leſs rude; it evinceth an increaſing ſhare of urbanity; in ſhort, the augmentation of its virtues is rapid, and the probability is, as progreſſive movements preclude a retrograde idea, that having rounded the circle, it will finally regain the point from whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced its career.</p>
                     <p>Let us take a view of the preſent order and decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy obſerved in ſociety; how ſuperior is it even to the patriarchal age: Let us attend the riſe, the progreſs, and the termination of the hoſtilities of adverſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; how multiplied are their precautions; how accumulated their manifeſtoes; what ſtrict juſtice, or at leaſt the ſemblance thereof, are the contending parties obliged to exerciſe; with what regularity is the whole proceſs conducted; how great is the faith and confidence of treaties; what odium attends the infringement thereof; with what cordiality, when the ſword is ſheathed, do the battling heroes embrace! reſentments immediately ſubſide, and the captured and the wounded become the objects of generous and inſtantaneous attention; hoſpitals, refreſhments, and a variety of ſolaces are prepared, and it is the pride of the foe, that the defeated warrior ſhould receive every alleviation, of which the circumſtances of his ſituation are ſuſceptible.

If we turn our eyes toward our own country, we ſhall acknowledge that a few years have produced the moſt aſtoniſhing effects: Unnatural and inadmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible claims have been made; they have been inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated; they have been weighed in the balance, and they have been found wanting. The genius of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, invigorated in this younger world, hath arrayed itſelf for the battle; it hath gone forth; it hath ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated oppoſition; its banner have been diſplayed: it hath enliſted its worthies; the ſtruggle hath been arduous, but the event hath crowned us with ſucceſs; over veteran foes we have been victorious; independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence claps her wings; peace is reſtored; govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are formed: public faith eſtabliſhed; and we bid fair to become a great and a happy people.

Governments within governments exiſt; their component parts are adequate to the purpoſes of juriſdiction; they are members of the national government; they are united, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Perhaps the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of concentration are not ſuſceptible of cloſe inveſtigation like the immortal ſpark by which we are animated, it takes the alarm, and flies off, when we would apply to its vital parts the inſtrument of diſſection. Yet to the captious reaſoner, the anſwer is as ready, as to the ſophiſt, who aſſerted the nonexiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of motion, merely becauſe he could not move in the place where he was, and it was impoſſible he could move where he was not; but we cannot admit his ergo, for experience proclaims that we abſolutely do move, and it is a fact, that theſe governments, ſimple and complex, have, in reality, an energetic and reſpectable being. Thus, in this inſtance, we have refined upon the plans of our anceſtors, and we are happily reaping the genial fruits of a wife and well concerted ſyſtem. Our admirable Conſtitution unites the advantages which are attributed to a monarchical government, to an oligarchy, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy; ſince ſufficient power is lodged in the hands of the Chief Magiſtrate, to benefit the people; ſince an order of nobility is inſtituted, an order, to which all our worthies may pretend—<hi>the order of Virtue</hi>—which, in truth, is alone ennobling; and ſince the career being open to all, we may with democratical equality purſue the ſplendid prize.</p>
                     <p>It is with glad complacency we mark the honours which encircle the head of our immortal Chief; we congratulate our countrymen, that they have, to the utmoſt of their power, with becoming unanimity agreed to reward his patriotic worth; that, inveſting

                     <p>Nor, though that fell deſpoiler, ſlander, hath dared to infix its envenomed tooth in the fair and conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent character of our illuſtrious Vice-Preſident, will the public mind ſubmit to the deception which au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious accuſation would preſume to fabricate; it will not ſuffer a man, who would have conferred honour on any country in which he had happened to be born; who adorns every department which he is called to fill, from the tender domeſtic ſcene, to the higheſt offices of ſtate, with elegance and propriety, with the moſt undeviating firmneſs, and unblemiſhed integrity; whoſe intereſting and highly finiſhed litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry productions will tranſmit his name to ages yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born; when the invidious caviller, and the writer of this eſſay, will, it is probable, be whelmed in the gulph of oblivion;—the public mind, I ſay, will not ſuffer ſuch a man to ſink; they will not ſuffer the opaque cloud, which for a moment may have ſhaded the diſk of ſo bright a luminary, long to intercept its radiance; no, it will judiciouſly decide, and riſing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to prejudice, it will ſtill confer on him its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpecting confidence.</p>
                     <p>Mentioning the Vice-Preſident, I am reminded of a tour I lately made through a neighbouring State, when falling into company with a leading man in the government, he expreſſed himſelf with a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of acrimony of that gentleman; and upon

my gravely demanding in what he was culpable, the diſaffected perſon, in ſo many words, replied, that he did not like him; that he believed him to be haughty and unyielding; that in his progreſs through that State, he, the objector, had been one of a number who had been ſolicitous to do him all the honour in their power: that they aſſembled in large companies, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the militia, rung the bells, &amp;c. &amp;c. but that Mr. Adams contrived, by ſome means or other, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude their wiſhes, for he had abſolutely, in defiance of all this homage which was prepared for him, paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unmindful on, incog. as it were, refuſing in fact every acknowledgment of their allegiance. Such, and ſo enormous, are the pretended miſdemeanours of the Vice-Preſident; yet, nevertheleſs, I perſuade myſelf that the aſſemblage of virtues which brighten his character, will at length flaſh conviction upon ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery eye, and that the <hi>many</hi> will know to diſtinguiſh, and to value that noble independence of ſpirit, that inborn worth, and intrinſic greatneſs, which, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an oſtentatious diſplay of grandeur, contents it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with innate conſciouſneſs of real elevation.</p>

But while there is life, a latent hope will play about the heart: The villagers inſiſted that the captain's little ſnug honeſt fellow ſhould be called in.

The muſcles between the fourth and fifth ribs, an inch nearer to the centre of the breaſt, then the back bone, were cut through; the pleura was pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, to enlarge the aperture into the cavity of the breaſt, the proper inſtruments were introduced; two fingers of the operator were then inſinuated, and, paſſing through the wound, were preſſed on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſurface of the diſeaſed lobe, when inſtantly the ſeat of the vomica, was by its tremulation diſcovered; it was at this period, that ſome perſon, to whom years had given an advantage over our phyſician, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently exclaimed, Doctor, we beg that you would proceed no farther! Is it not a wonder that terror at the ſound of this imprudent interpoſition, cut not the ſlender thread of the patient's life? The operator, however, made ſure of ſucceſs, warmly replied, "By heaven, I will not now be ſtopped;" when, penetrating the inveſting membrane of the right lobe, into the abſceſs, and dilating it three quarters of an inch, its contents, blood and purulent matter, to the quantity of a pint, were immediately diſcharged; the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this operation have been moſt happy, the patient, from not being able to repoſe for a ſingle moment upon either ſide, now ſtretches himſelf at his eaſe, and ſlumbers ſweetly upon his bed; his cough, night ſweats, ſore mouth, and ſwelled feet are no more; from extreme debility, he is ſufficiently ſtrong to walk abroad, and he eats, drinks, and digeſts, perfectly well. What a tranſition!—he is regarded as one raiſed from the dead; while every perſon admires the cool, courageous, and determined reſolution, with which he ſubmitted to ſo fearful an experiment. He is of the loweſt grade of induſtrious poor; the powers of his mind were never remarkable; his life had contained no ſtriking exertions; he had ſeemed only in the common way to yield to the neceſſity which his misfortunes had created—had any one, in the morning of his exiſtence, officiouſly preſented him a picture of the ills which he was to endure,

The idea, which to embody and effectuate, I would not only relinquiſh whole years of my exiſtence, but I would abſolutely be contented to live and die in obſcurity, originated in an hour, which having appropriated to ſome choice ſpirits, I paſſed convivially over a bottle; we were not, however, bacchanalians, and our wine but ſerved to meliorate and give an edge to our reflections.</p>

Our ſubjects were multifarious, and with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt freedom we arraigned, tried, and condemned. Among other matters of ſpeculation which we had taken it upon us liberally to analyze and critically to ſcan, the cauſe of the little encouragement which is generally throughout the world, and eſpecially in our own country, given to genius, we carefully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to inveſtigate; but for this abſurdity, it was in vain that we aſſayed rationally to account; and we were reduced to the neceſſity of lamenting a fact, the ſources of which, our utmoſt reſearches could not penetrate. The diſappointments of a Butler, the melancholy fate of an Otway, with a long train of et-ceteras, we could not review, without pathetically deploring; and ſo far were we from conceiving that the taſte of the preſent times was in any degree refined, that one of our party gave it as his decided opinion, that if Pope, Addiſon and Swift flouriſhed in America, their merit would be almoſt entirely diſregarded, and that there would ſcarce be found a ſingle wight, who would acknowledge their ſuperior claims. From regretting, we naturally proceeded to deviſing the ways and means, and our pericraniums were fruitful in expedients to remedy an evil which we regarded as a real blot upon the riſing fame of this new world. After many pro's and con's, it was unanimouſly agreed among us, (and I do aſſure you there was in our junto many reſpectable perſons) that it would be a moſt happy arrangement, if the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the United States of America would admit an additional article, providing for the eſtabliſhment of <hi>real genius,</hi> whether it be found in the male or female world. It is not ſeldom the caſe, that, to anſwer the preſſing wants of life, the efforts of the mind are ſo wholly engroſſed, that the operations of genius are ſuſpended, if not wholly blaſted, and the door to intellectual fame is thus of neceſſity barred. Againſt this inconvenience, in its utmoſt latitude, our plan went to the providing. Congreſs ſhould appoint perſons, duly qualified to examine every

To obviate the neceſſity of every pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary attention, out of the Treaſury of the United States, penſions, competent to the decencies of life, according to the wants and degrees of merit which the candidates poſſeſſed, ſhould be decreed, and reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly paid; and to preclude every reaſonable objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>ſinecure</hi> ſhould be continued (except in caſes of natural and abſolute decay) no longer than while the beneficed remained, to the utmoſt of his or her power, in the full exerciſe of thoſe talents which procured from the liberality of government ſo honorary a diſtinction.</p>

deciſions were, for the moſt part, made; and I felt a kind of horror at the mangling of names, which I had accuſtomed myſelf to conſider in the moſt reſpectable point of view. From queſtioning the correctneſs and the delicacy of Addiſon, the wit of Swift, and the poetical merit of Pope, they ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned before their imperious tribunal, the candidates for fame, which, in this younger world, diſtinguiſh the preſent day: Trumbull, Barlow, Humphreys, Warren, Morton, Belknap, &amp;c. &amp;c.—theſe all paſſed in review before them; and as they ſeemed determined to ſet no bounds to their invidious cenſures, their obſervations were of courſe equally deſtitute of juſtice and of candour. From theſe luminous bodies in the hemiſphere of literature, deſcending in their career, they fell pell-mell upon the poor Gleaner. He was regarded as free plunder, ſerving as a mark at which to point their keeneſt ſhafts of ſatire; he was <hi>any body, every body,</hi> or <hi>nobody.</hi> One while he was certainly a <hi>Parſon,</hi> for, in his laſt number, throwing off the maſk, he had poſitively ſermonized throughout; it was true he had taken his text from a brother chip; but what of that? his ſpeech betrayed him. A ſecond gravely declared, that he was credibly informed, the Gleaner was, at this preſent, a ſtudent in Harvard College; and indeed, (he added) it is <hi>evident, that he needs inſtruction.</hi> Here a loud laugh interrupted, for a moment, the progreſs of their critical and judicious remarks; when a young barriſter, taking up the matter, for the ſake of the argument, juſt to exerciſe his talents, profeſſionally pronounced, that moſt aſſuredly the gentleman who ſpoke laſt had been groſsly impoſed upon, in the plea of veſting the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty under conſideration; for that the Gleaner cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bore ſtrong marks of genius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that, to his knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, it was the production of a Connecticut p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="56" facs="unknown:034162_0055_0FFC5D0B034CA678"/>
the Gleaner, there is not to be found, in that writer, a ſingle ſentence of ſheer wit. From the firſt number, indeed, I encouraged a hope of originality, of a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of entertainment, not every day to be met with; but that, it ſhould ſeem, was a forced matter, a mere hot-bed production, a ſpark ſtruck from a flint, rather than the offspring of that pure, celeſtial and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal fire, which, like its ethereal ſource, can never be extinguiſhed, and which, ever genuine, glowing, and animated, is with propriety hailed by that dignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appellation—true genius. But the Gleaner, O ſhocking! in his Margaretta, indeed, I took an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, but he juſt p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n, (and he ſhook his head with great ſagacity) the Gleaner is not worth our attention; he is poor, deſpicably poor—low, pitifully low; and I heſitate not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him a mere trite, common-place obſerver. A middle-aged gentleman, who ſat at the bottom of the table, and who had been, till then, ſilent, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, as I conceive, by a kind of ſympathy, being himſelf probably a ſupplicant at the ſhrine of fame, now joined in the converſation, by candidly ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it did not appear the Gleaner had laid any claim to extraordinary talents; that he had very early renounced the vain hopes by which he had been inflated; that if every writer could not reach the eminence of a Boyle, a Locke, or a Newton, yet thoſe who were contented with the ſubordination of their ſeveral departments, were entitled to their quota of praiſe; that if the obſervations of the Gleaner were trite, he was but a Gleaner, and the modeſty of his pretenſions entitled him to the full exerciſe of candor. But your Honor, (continued the good-natured gentleman) was intereſted in his Margaretta; now I think it very poſſible that Miſs Melworth may again make her appearance, and it is my opinion, that the Gleaner withholds her now, not altogether from poverty of genius, but from the fear of giving
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:034162_0056_0FFC5D06A39C7868"/>
to his productions the air of a novel—(I could hardly forbear taking my advocate in my arms)—and you know, Gentlemen, in what a frivolous point of view, the noveliſt, at this preſent, ſtands. It is painful to ſink, and who would wiſh to debaſe the eſſayeſt (for ſo it would be eſteemed) into a mere annaliſt of brilliant fictions; yet, for my own part, I am free to own, that I claſs this ſpecies of writing in the very higheſt grade of excellence; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t is true that the beſt things may be made ſubſervient to the worſt of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and the pen, ſeized by the ſingers of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath not ſeldom proved licentiouſly luxurious. Thus, even a Richardſon, though his writings abound with the pureſt morals, and though his Clariſſa, with a ſingle exception, may be regarded as a model, cannot, perhaps, be conſidered as altogether faultleſs; yet I have thought, that under proper regulations, the province aſſigned to the novel writer, might be productive of the higheſt utility; love, I would not hail as almighty; I would not create a deſpot, before whoſe throne every other conſideration muſt, of neceſſity, proſtrate; I would not repreſent him as reducing to vaſſalage every faculty of the ſoul, and riding victorious over decency, propriety, and every other virtue; but I would deſcribe him as a benign monarch, to whom reaſon ſhould adminiſter; his powers ſhould be limited, and chaſtized by prudence; and, by a ſeries of intereſting, circumſtantial and well digeſted narrations, I would produce events deeply marked, and ſtrikingly natural, which ſhould indiſputably evince the triumphs of diſcretion over the impaſſioned dictates of the perturbed ſpirit; vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umes, wrote upon ſuch a plan, would, I venture to aſſert, be more ſerviceable to the intereſts of virtue than even the ethic page; for, however plauſibly we may harangue, the voice of the narrator will ſtill be heard, when, perhaps, the moſt elaborate eſſays, not thus embelliſhed, which ever iſſued from the cloſet of the ſtudious, will paſs the torpid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Author and Pattern of the Chriſtian faith, ſeems, in the whole courſe of his teaching, to put this matter beyond a doubt: One ſpecimen readily preſents—when the Saviour undertakes to cultivate the intereſts of benevolence, when he would diſſeminate the ſeeds of that univerſal benignity, or brotherhood, which, ſpringing up, ſhall one day produce a rich harveſt of immortal amity, he perſonifies his wiſhes, and ſays, "A certain man went down from Jeruſalem to Jericho," &amp;c. &amp;c.

Now I have been plaguily puzzled to know at what you were driving: I never, in the whole courſe of my life, was fond of an uncertain navigation, becauſe,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:034162_0058_0FFC5D009B159800"/>
d'ye ſee, there is no knowing what rocks and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands may take one up. For my part, I never waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many glaſſes in poring over your books, and your hiſtories, and all that—not I—it was my buſineſs to mind how the ſhip worked, to ſee if ſhe made good way, and failed as many knots in an hour as the charming Sall, or Bet. When I was a lad, my father ſent me to ſchool, and would have made a parſon of me; but it would not do—the wind pointed another way, and ſo I up jib, and bore away, making all the ſail I could to more convenient moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: Howſomever, I learned enough of the art to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me to make an obſervation, by the help of which I can carry my ſhip round the globe, paſſing with ſafety through the narroweſt ſtraits, always keeping her clear of a lee ſhore, and never running foul of any rock or ſhoal, though I have made ever ſo many voyages; but I always kept a good look out, was careful to heave the log, attending, with my own eyes, to the veerings, and my reckonings were as ſure and as certain as the rock of Gibraltar. But what is all this to the purpoſe? avaſt a moment, and you ſhall hear. Being pretty much weather beaten, I thought beſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſince, to make the ſafe and convenient harbour of matrimony, and my daughter Molly, for that was the ſober name we gave her at the fount, though, by the bye, my wife very ſoon tacking about, choſe to call her Maria, till returning from a trip ſhe hath made to a neighbouring town, the wind again ſhifting, there is nothing ſo proper, ſo ſedate, and which, ſhe ſays, ſquares ſo well with her ideas, as Mary; thus reducing us to the neceſſity of beginning our traverſe anew; well, but my ſaid daughter Molly, Maria, or Mary, being born juſt a year after our marriage, and very ſoon becoming a fine roſy cheeked girl, I have ever ſince been examining every point of direction, ſo belaying the lifts and the braces, the clewlines and the buntlines, that ſhe may be as good a ſail, make as good way, and procure as good a birth, as any little tight ſea boat of them all. Her mother was for

putting her adrift at a boarding ſchool, but by virtue of my authority, I have hitherto kept her in her old moorings, being hugely afraid of the breakers, which ſhe may encounter upon the ocean of inexperience; but my education being ſuch as I have ſaid, I am ſomething ſuſpicious that I may not perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand every point of the compaſs; and being embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſo difficult a navigation, I am, for the firſt time ſince I undertook the command of a ſhip, rather doubtful of my courſe. Now you muſt know, that though I am no reader, I have, in order to find out by the entries and clearances, which way the wind ſets with my old comrades, made it my practice to take on board the news-papers; that ſince my mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimonial adventure, I have alſo ſhipped their firſt couſins, the magazines, and that one cold evening, upon the firſt of April laſt, my wife and I being ſafely hauled up along ſide of a good fire, were mightily taken with your Margaretta, and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſtriking our colours, we lovingly agreed to diſpoſe of our Molly, preciſely as you ſhould inform us you had done of the little yawl belayed along ſide your anchorage by dame Arbuthnot; but now, Mr. Gleaner, I am coming to the point; though we have ever ſince kept watch and watch, placing upon the maſt-head of ſcrutiny the careful eye of intelligence, yet we cannot eſpy the ſmalleſt appearance of the little ſkiff for which we are looking out; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, you ſeem to have hoiſted every ſail, bearing directly from the port to which we ſuppoſed you were bound!

                           <p>I WAS early left an orphan, and my education was much neglected; but nevertheleſs, a variety of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring circumſtances, diſpoſing the heart of a very worthy gentleman in my favour, I happily became his wife. For a few years, the hiſtory of my life may be regarded as the annals of felicity; but alas! I have laid my huſband in the grave, and the ſtory of my enjoyments is finiſhed; yet, in a little daughter, I once again revive; my girl ſtill attaches me to humanity. I am in poſſeſſion of what I deem a competency; and, being entruſted by her deceaſed father with the entire diſpoſal of my child, I would adopt, in the forming of her mind, that ſyſtem, which may be the beſt calculated to make her good and happy.</p>
                           <p>Thus circumſtanced, I have looked with very much anxiety, into every late publication, which I have thought calculated for the meridian of my underſtanding; and in this purſuit, your lovely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan very naturally attracted my attention; if I was amuſed with an agreeable fiction, I was, nevertheleſs, intereſted and pleaſed; if the charming ſtranger was endowed with more than a fanciful exiſtence, I ſhed tears of joy that ſhe had found upon this Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican ſhore ſo able a patron; and I have for many weeks expected from your gentle Mary, and her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Margaretta, ſome hint, whereby to ſhape my future conduct. I will confeſs to you, Sir, that read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your numbers under this cloud of diſappointment, I have not ſo well reliſhed ſubjects, which, however, for aught I know, may have been extremely well choſen, and altogether as well handled.

Mrs. Aburthnot, ſhe hath continued to progreſs in our affections, endearing herſelf to us by every act of duty, and having laid her in our boſom, ſhe hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unto us indeed a daughter. Heaven hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied us children; but we regret not that circumſtance, while this amiable female lives to prop, to ſoothe, and to ſlope our paſſage through the journey of life. Having packed up her little moveables, the moſt val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable of which was a miniature of her mother, put into her hands by her aunt (whoſe degree of affinity ſhe hath ſince underſtood) juſt before ſhe expired, we quitted the capital of South-Carolina. I took a place for myſelf in the ſtage; and Mary, accommodating herſelf to the movements of that vehicle, came on with the child. Mary hath the peculiar talent of ſtealing from the unfortunate their ſharpeſt ſorrows; moments of the keeneſt anguiſh ſhe can ſometimes beguile; and by her addreſs ſhe hath not ſeldom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the wounded boſom the lacerating ſhaft. To ſoothe and to ſupport the little Margaretta, who was at firſt overwhelmed with grief, ſhe bent her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt efforts; and as the minds of children, at that early and intereſting age, are commonly very ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, and eaſily impreſſed, ſhe ſucceeded wonderfully well; while the little creature, aſſured and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before we had reached the northern extremity of the middle States, with her heart as light as the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamer, prattled away moſt delightfully.</p>
                     <p>When we returned home, we fitted up a little chamber, of which we conſtituted Margaretta the ſole proprietor; my wife informing her that ſhe ſhould eſtabliſh a poſt betwixt her apartment and her own, that if they choſe, upon any occaſion, to ſeparate, they might with the greater convenience open a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence by letter. The rudiments of Margaret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's education had been attended to; in her plain work ſhe had made conſiderable proficiency; ſhe could read the ſeventh, tenth, eleventh and twelfth chapters of Nehemiah, without much difficulty; and when her aunt was taken ill, ſhe was on the point of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:034162_0067_0FFC5CE31C76C610"/>
being put into joining-hand; but Mary very ſoon ſketched out for our charge rather an extenſive plan of education; and as I was not entirely convinced of the inutility of her views, the natural indolence of my temper induced me to let the matter paſs, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering my caveat by way of ſtopping proceedings; and indeed, I think the propriety of circumſcribing the education of a female, within ſuch narrow bounds as are frequently aſſigned, is at leaſt problematical. A celebrated writer, I really forget who, hath penned upon this ſubject a number of ſelf-evident truths; and it is an incontrovertible fact, that to the matron is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted not only the care of her daughter, but alſo the forming the firſt and oftentimes the moſt important movements of that mind, which is to inform the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture man; the early dawnings of reaſon ſhe is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to watch, and from her are received the moſt indelible impreſſions of his life. Now, was ſhe properly qualified, how enviable and how dignified would be her employment. The probability is, that the family of children, whom ſhe directed, ſuppoſing them to poſſeſs common capacities, being once initiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the flowery paths of ſcience, would ſeldom ſtop ſhort of the deſired goal. Fine writing, arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, geography, aſtronomy, muſic, drawing; an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all theſe might be formed in infancy; the firſt principles of the fine arts might be ſo accommodated, as to conſtitute the paſtime of the child; the ſeeds of knowledge might be implanted in the tender mind, and even budding there, before the avocations of the father permitted him to combine his efforts. Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſweet preceptreſs, would originate a ſtrong predilection for inſtructions, that would with intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tenderneſs be given, and that would be made to aſſume the face of entertainment, and thus the young proficient would be, almoſt imperceptibly, engaged in thoſe walks, in which an advantageous perſeverance might rationally be expected. A mother, who poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a competent knowledge of the Engliſh and French tongues, and who is properly aſſiduous about
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:034162_0068_0FFC5CE1987692C0"/>
her children, I conceive, will find it little more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to teach them to liſp in two languages, than in one: and as the powers of the ſtudent advanceth, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain portions of the day may be regularly appropriat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the converſing in that language which is not deſigned for the common intercourſes of life. Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in either tongue, to the parent, or fictitious char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters, may be alternately written, and thus an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant knowledge of both may be gradually obtained. Learning, certainly, can never with propriety be eſteemed a burthen; and when the mind is judiciouſly balanced, it renders the poſſeſſor not only more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but alſo more amiable, and more generally uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Literary acquiſitions cannot, unleſs the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the mind are deranged, be lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t; and while the goods of fortune may be whelmed beneath the contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of revolving time, intellectual property ſtill remains, and the mental funds can never be exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The accompliſhed, the liberally accompliſhed female, if ſhe is deſtined to move in the line of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency, will be regarded as a pleaſing and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive companion; whatever ſhe does will connect an air of perſuaſive elevation; wherever ſhe may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitiouſly called, genuine dignity will be the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniment of her ſteps; ſhe will always be attended to with pleaſure, and ſhe cannot fail of being diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; ſhould ſhe, in her career of life, be arreſted by adverſe fortune, many reſources of relief, of pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, and of emolument, open themſelves before her; and ſhe is not <hi>neceſſarily</hi> condemned to laborious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, or to the drudgery of that unremitted ſameneſs, which the rotine of the needle preſents.</p>
                     <p>But whatever may be the merits of the courſe which I am thus <hi>apparently</hi> advocating, without ſtopping to examine the other ſide of the queſtion, I proceed to ſay, that the plan of education adopted for Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta was, as I have already hinted, ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, and that Mrs. Vigillius (to addreſs my good wife, in her dignified character of governante, with all poſſible reſpect) having inſtructed her pupil in the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:034162_0069_0FFC5CDAE6DDD058"/>
grand fundamental points of the philanthropic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Jeſus, was never eaſy while any branch of improvement, which could by the moſt remote con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction be deemed feminine, remained uneſſayed; and I muſt in juſtice declare, that the conſequence, by producing Margaretta at the age of ſixteen, a beautiful and accompliſhed girl, more than anſwered her moſt ſanguine expectations.</p>
                     <p>Of needle work, in its varieties, my wife pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her a perfect miſtreſs; her knowledge of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and French tongues, was fully adequate to her years, and her manner of reading had, for me, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar charms; her hand writing was neat and eaſy; ſhe was a good accomptant, a tolerable geographer and chronologiſt; ſhe had ſkimmed the ſurface of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronomy and natural philoſophy; had made good proficiency in her ſtudy of hiſtory and the poets; could ſketch a landſcape; could furniſh, from her own fancy, patterns for the muſlins which ſhe wrought; could bear her part in a minuet and a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillion, and was allowed to have an excellent hand upon the piano forte. We once entertained a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of debarring her the indulgence of novels; but thoſe books, being in the hands of every one, we conceived the accompliſhment of our wiſhes in this reſpect, except we had bred her an abſolute recluſe, almoſt impracticable; and Mrs. Vigillius, therefore, thought it beſt to permit the uſe of every decent work, cauſing them to be read in her preſence, hoping that ſhe might, by her ſuggeſtions and obſervations, preſent an antidote to the poiſon, with which the pen of the noveliſt is too often fraught. The ſtudy of hiſtory was purſued, if I may ſo expreſs myſelf, ſyſtematically: To the page of the hiſtorian one hour every day was regularly devoted; a ſecond hour, Mary converſed with her adopted daughter upon the ſubject which a uniform courſe of reading had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and a third hour Margaretta was directed to employ, in committing to paper ſuch particular facts, remarks and conſequences deduced therefrom, as had,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:034162_0070_0FFC5CD77014DA68"/>
during the hours appropriated to reading, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing, moſt ſtrikingly impreſſed her mind; and by theſe means the leading features of hiſtory were inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly imprinted thereon. Mrs. Vigillius alſo compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed little geographical, hiſtorical, and chronological catechiſms, or dialogues, the nature of which will be eaſily conceived; and ſhe pronounced them of infinite advantage in the proſecution of her plan; ſhe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted likewiſe, at leaſt once every week, to little voluntary abſences, when my boy Plato, being conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted courier betwixt the apartments of my wife and daughter, an epiſtolary correſpondence was carried on between them, from which more than one impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant benefit was derived; the penmanſhip of our charge was improved; the beautiful and elegant art of letter writing was by degrees acquired; and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetta was early accuſtomed to lay open her heart to her maternal friend.</p>
                     <p>Perſons when holding the pen, generally expreſs themſelves more freely than when engaged in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; and if they have a perfect confidence in thoſe whom they addreſs, the probability is, that, unboſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, they will not fail to unveil the inmoſt receſſes of their ſouls—thus was Margaretta properly and happily habituated to diſcloſe, without a bluſh, each riſing thought to her, on whom the care of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring her for the great career of life had devolved.</p>
                     <p>No, Mr. Pedant, ſhe was not unfitted for her prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſphere; and your ſtomach, however critical it may be, never digeſted finer puddings than thoſe which I, with an uncommon zeſt, have partook, as knowing they were the compoſition of her fair hand—yes, in the receipts of cookery ſhe is thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verſed; ſhe is in every reſpect the complete houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife; and our linen never received ſo fine a gloſs as when it was ironed and laid in order by Margaretta. Mrs. Vigillius was early taught the ſcience of economy, and ſhe took care to teach it to her daughter; and being more eſpecially economical of time, ſhe ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangeth matters as never to appear embarraſſed, or in
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:034162_0071_0FFC5CD5DFBBB7E0"/>
a hurry, having always her hours of leiſure, which ſhe appropriates to the contingencies of the day. It is true, ſhe does not often engage in viſits of mere cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emony, ſeldom making one of any party, without ſome view either to her own emolument, or that of thoſe about her; and with regard to dreſs, ſhe ſpends but little time in aſſorting an article which is, it muſt be confeſſed, too generally a monopolizer of a bleſſing, that can hardly be too highly eſtimated. She doth not think it neceſſary to have her diſhabille for the morning, her robe-de-chambre for noon, and her full trimed polanee or trollopee, for the evening. The morning generally, except in caſes of any particular emergency, preſents her dreſſed for the day; and as ſhe is always elegant, of courſe ſhe can never be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous, extravagant or gaudy. It will be hardly neceſſary to add, that Miſs Melworth was, and is, her exact copieſt; and indeed ſhe is ſo warmly attached to my dear Mary, that I verily believe it would have been in her power to have initiated her into the devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous paths of error; and this is ſaying a great deal of a mind which poſſeſſeth ſuch innate goodneſs, as doth that which inhabits the gentle boſom of my Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetta. Upon the ſubject of dreſs, I am naturally reminded of the requeſt of my fanciful correſpondent Monimia Caſtalio, relative to the dreſs of Margaretta, and particularly the height of her head; and I am happy that I can gratify Miſs Monimia Caſtalio, by rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ollecting a circumſtance, which being in point, may ſerve as a ſpecimen of the general ſtyle of Margaret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's dreſs. I think ſhe was about fifteen, when Mrs. Vigillius conforming as much as her ideas of propriety would admit, to the then faſhion of the times, made for her a hat of white ſatin. I remember there was a prettily fancied ribbon to it; and it had, I thought, rather a jauntee appearance. Margaretta put it on, and ſallied forth to pay a viſit to an acquaintance, a Miſs Preedy; and the next morning, when ſeated at the breakfaſt table, with much heſitation ſhe requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her mamma to purchaſe for her, as an additional
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:034162_0072_0FFC5CD32B4600C0"/>
ornament to her hat, ſome beautiful feathers, which ſhe ſaid were to be diſpoſed of at the very next ſhop. Mrs. Vigillius, with great calmneſs, replied, "Yes, my dear, without doubt I can obtain for you the feathers; but I have for ſome time been endeavouring to accumulate a ſum, which I had intended to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate for the completion of your little library; and a crown laid out in feathers, will take therefrom at leaſt one handſome and inſtructive volume; it is true, I have ſome money now by me, deſigned for another uſe—Poor Mrs. Lovemore, over whoſe mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes you have ſhed ſo many tears, ſtill ſwells the ſigh of ſorrow—he, whoſe preſence would turn her little cottage into a palace, yet remains impriſoned! I have long had it in contemplation to dry the tear of anguiſh from the cheek of that ſolitary mourner; and I have anticipated the pleaſure I ſhould experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence while witneſſing the mantling joy, and the dimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſmiles, which would, upon an occaſion ſo happy, pervade the faces of the little beings who owe to her their exiſtence—Genius of ſenſibility! how extatic would be my emotions, could I be made inſtrumental in reſtering to their embraces the huſband and the father! The ſum for which Mr. Lovemore is held in durance, is ſmall, and his misfortunes could not by human prudence be either foreſeen or prevented. From the late expenditures in our family, I have ſo far economized, as to have at length made up the requiſite ſum; and I had thought to have taken a walk this fine morning, in order to liberate the poor man—but you want the feathers, and Lovemore muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in captivity until I can lay by another crown."</p>
                     <p>Never ſhall I forget the expreſſion, the animated expreſſion, which lighted up the countenance of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetta; tears of mingling pleaſure and delicate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, were upon her cheek; with a kind of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous eagerneſs, ſhe ſeized the hand of Mary, and in a moſt graceful manner bowing thereon, with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulous voice ſhe thus queſtioned—thus entreated—"And will the ſorrows of the poor Mrs. Lovemore
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:034162_0073_0FFC5CCE7853CCC0"/>
know an end? O friend, patroneſs, protectreſs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, mother—what ſhall I ſay?—Already my obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to you are infinite—but tell me, dear lady, will you ſtill add thereto—ſhall I accompany you to the abode of Mrs. Lovemore? I know that you will conſent—let us go this inſtant—I will fly for your cloak, and we will not delay a moment."</p>
                     <p>It is hardly neceſſary to add that Margaretta obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſuit, and I ſubjoin a declaration, that theſe kind of feathers are the moſt beautiful, and the higheſt plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of any ſhe hath ever yet worn in her hat or cap.</p>
                     <p>But while we have been aſſiduouſly employed in cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating the mind of Margaretta, we have been endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring to eradicate the ſeeds of that over-weening ſelf conceit, which, while it would induce an oſtentatious exhibition of thoſe talents natural, or adventitious, which ſhe may poſſeſs—like a rampant weed would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede and overſhadow the growth of every virtue. Againſt pride and affectation we have been careful to guard her, by conſtantly inculcating one grand truth; a truth, to the conviction of which every ingenuous mind muſt be ever open. Her perſon, the ſymmetry of her features, the roſe and lily of her complexion, the <hi>tout enſemble</hi> of her exterior, the harmony of her voice, &amp;c. &amp;c.—theſe are the endowments of nature—while the artificial accompliſhments with which ſhe is inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, reſulting wholly from accident, and being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether independent of her own arrangements, confer upon her no real or intrinſic merit.</p>
                     <p>We are daily aſſuring her, that every thing in future depends upon her own exertions, and that her character muſt be deſignated by that conſiſtent decency, that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant propriety, and that dignified condeſcenſion, which are indeed truly eſtimable. We have apprized her, that in every ſtage of her journey through life, ſhe will find friends—or a ſocial intercourſe with the circles in which ſhe may be called to move—conſtituting one of her principal enjoyments, and that if ſhe is not eager for admiration, if ſhe avoids making a diſplay of ſuperior abilities, ſhe will eſcape thoſe ſhafts of envy which
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:034162_0074_0FFC5CCCF1D896F0"/>
will otherwiſe be too ſurely aimed at her peace; and ſecure to herſelf the complacent feelings of thoſe with whom ſhe may be converſant.</p>
                     <p>Margaretta hath a becoming ſpirit, and diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a ſtranger to her heart; ſhe is rather cheerful than gay; ſhe never diverts herſelf with ſimplicity and ignorance; <hi>double entendres</hi> ſhe deteſts; ſhe is not an adept in the preſent faſhionable mode of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon words, and ſhe never deſcends to what is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed jeſting; ſhe can deliver herſelf upon any ſubject, on which ſhe ventures to ſpeak, with great eaſe; but in large or mixed companies ſhe engages in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with manifeſt reluctance; and I have heard her declare, that ſhe hath frequently, when encircled by ſtrangers, felt alarmed at the ſound of her own voice; ſhe never comments upon thoſe blunders which are the reſult of a neglected education, nor will ſhe lend her ſmiles to thoſe who are thus employed; and ſhe obſerves, that ſuch kind of peccadillos have upon her no other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, than to excite in her boſom the ſenſation of gratitude</p>
                     <p>With the laws of cuſtom, or faſhion, ſhe is thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted, and ſhe conſents to follow them as far as they ſquare with the dictates of rectitude; but ſhe never ſacrifices to their documents either her humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or her convenience; ſhe regards, as extremely venial, an ignorance of their deſpotic inſtitutions; (indeed the multifarious requirements of mere ceremony, ſtrike her in ſo trifling a point of view, that ſhe conceives it rather a matter of courſe that they ſhould ſometimes be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) and ſhe prefers plain manners to all the glitter of a ſtudied or laboured addreſs.</p>
                     <p>But it is againſt the unaccountable freaks of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious, that all the artillery of that humour, of which ſhe poſſeſſes a natural fund, is levelled; frank and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous herſelf, ſhe laughs at the vagaries of the whimſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and her heart is ever upon her lips; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he reflects much, and her judgment is faſhioned by reaſon; ſhe cannot be ſeen without pleaſure, nor heard without inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>But I am rather deſcribing what Margaretta <hi>is,</hi> than what ſhe <hi>was,</hi> at the period of her hiſtory
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:034162_0075_0FFC5CCB6DE3F878"/>
to which we are arrived. Three or four years have matured her talents, preſenting the daily improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and promiſing girl, a truly lovely and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed woman, abundantly anſwering the fondeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations which were formed of her.</p>
                     <p>When our beloved charge had completed her ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year, we conceived it full time to introduce her an intereſting and beautiful object to a world, of whoſe deceptions we had been careful to warn her, and for whoſe intercourſe, we flattered ourſelves, ſhe was as well qualified as girls at her age generally are.</p>
                     <p>It was at this period that Mrs. Vigillius, in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the preſſing entreaties of a friend in whom ſhe entirely confided, reluctantly conſented that Miſs Melworth ſhould paſs a few weeks in the city of New-Haven.</p>
                     <p>But it may be proper to refer the opening of a new, and important ſcene, to a ſeparate eſſay; and we ſhall proceed to bring forward the appropriate number, with all poſſible diſpatch.</p>

                              </gap>, have never known affliction ſo ſevere. Well, but my mamma hath taught me not to dwell upon the dark ſide of events; and finding an adherence to her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts my ſureſt path, I wave every thing of a mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy nature, and proceed to ſay—that Mrs. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington received me with much affection; that ſhe treats me in all reſpects with the ſame tender atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſhe beſtows upon her own daughter, Miſs Amelia; and that I do not believe, if I except my own dear mamma, that there is in the whole world a better woman. Col. Worthington, as we were told, is at preſent abſent from home; ſo that, excepting the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics, who are decent and obliging people, our family conſiſts only of Mrs. Worthington, Miſs Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, and myſelf. I am delighted with New-Haven, with its beautiful plains, its high ſurrounding mountains, its neat built houſes, its ample ſtreets, and the tall trees by which on either hand they are ſhaded. Yale Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, an epiſcopalian church, and three diſſenting meeting houſes, are ſituated contiguous to each other. You know, my mamma, you directed me to write as if you were a ſtranger to every particular. As I walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the green, the neighbourhood of theſe build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſeemed to conſecrate the ſpot, rendering it, as it were, hallowed ground. Yale College is not near to ſpacious as the deſcription which we received from Edward Hamilton of the ſeminary in which he was educated; indeed, ever ſince the evening upon which Edward entertained us ſo agreeably with an account of Harvard College, I have had a very ſtrong inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to behold thoſe venerable domes. Many ſtudents, however, proſecute their ſtudies here; and I cannot but eſteem every young creature happy who hath the diſpoſition, and is preſented with the opportunity, of acquiring knowledge. As I have been introduced by Mrs. Worthington as the adopted daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Vigillius, and as the characters of my dear parental friends are ſo properly revered here, I have
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:034162_0077_0FFC5CC2F8123F80"/>
received the moſt marked attentions. If I might be allowed to give an opinion, I would ſay that the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of New-Haven appear to me to be friendly, and hoſpitable, and that the ladies are truly polite. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I may be permitted to pronounce, that thoſe whom I have ſeen, anſwer very exactly to the idea of genuine urbanity, which you, Madam, have taught me to form. Among the many who have moſt obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed me, the limits of a letter will only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to mention Mrs. Edwards. Mr. Edwards, you will recollect, Madam, is an eminent barriſter; and the perſon who is permitted to mingle in their ſocial circles, cannot but enjoy a ſatisfaction of a ſuperior kind.</p>
                           <p>The ladies of New-Haven are remarkably fond of cultivating flowers; and a diſquiſition upon the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the parterre makes a part in almoſt every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Mrs. Edwards counted in her garden at one time, no leſs than eight hundred tulips all in full blow, among which the various ſtreaks and ſhades were innumerable. Doubtleſs I could be very happy in New-Haven, if it was the reſidence of my papa and mamma, but were it the paradiſe of the globe, I ſhould ſigh for the village of their abode; and the elegant ſaloon which my mamma devotes to ſentimental friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the ſocial breakfaſting parlour, the ample dining room, the chamber, of which with ſuch unexampled goodneſs I was conſtituted ſole proprietor, the ſweet little flower garden, the ſmooth gravel walk termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the woodbine alcove, &amp;c. &amp;c. theſe would all live in my idea as the haunts of perfect happineſs. Mrs. Worthington inſiſts on my tarrying here until the expiration of the Commencement holidays; but in truth, I am well pleaſed that my leave of abſence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth not near ſo far; and I am glad that my mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma hath fixed preciſely the time of my return; for I always feel aſſured and tranquil when I am entirely under her direction. You will pleaſe to aſſure all my young acquaintance, particularly Serafina and Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hamilton, that they are often preſent to my imagination; that in my dreams I ſtill mix in their
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:034162_0078_0FFC5CC04E314148"/>
little parties; and that it is impoſſible I ſhould ceaſe to remember them, or to love them very ſincerely.</p>
                           <p>Well, I have written more than two pages, and yet have not executed the purpoſe I formed when I ſat me down to this employ: You have accuſtomed me, deareſt lady, to unboſom myſelf to you, and though this is my firſt ſeparation from you, yet the epiſtolary correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with which I have for ſuch a length of time, though continued under your roof, been indulged, hath given me the habit of expreſſing myſelf to you in this way, with the utmoſt freedom; and as a proof that I will never wear diſguiſes, when addreſſing her whoſe care hath rendered life to me a valuable gift, I will confeſs that I make the following communication with more reluctance than I ever yet, upon any occaſion, experienced; but truth ſhall be my motto, and to my loved patroneſs I will have no reſerves. I had been but one hour in the family of Mrs. Worthington, when a young gentleman, Mr. Siniſterus Courtland, made his appearance in that lady's drawing room; he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the air of an eſtabliſhed acquaintance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he ſtands high in the eſteem of Mrs. Worthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; a large party was collected, all of whom he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed in a manner truly engaging, and upon my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing introduced, payed me a compliment in a ſtyle ſo new, ſo elevated, and ſo ſtrikingly pleaſing, that my heart inſtantaneouſly acknowledged an involuntary prepoſſeſſion in his favour; ſenſations with which I was till that moment unacquainted, pervaded my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; I felt my face in a glow, and a pleaſing kind of perturbation took poſſeſſion of my faculties. My op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of ſeeing Mr. Courtland have been ſince frequent. Three days afterwards he declared himſelf my lover; his aſſiduities are unwearied; he profeſſes to live but in my preſence, and he proteſts that my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of him will make him the moſt miſerable of men. Mrs. Worthington aſſures me, that Mr. Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is a gentleman whoſe addreſſes no lady need bluſh to receive; and I will own to you, Madam, that if a few years more had paſſed ever my head, as you have
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:034162_0079_0FFC5CBEC8A7AED8"/>
taught me to conceive a union with a man of worth may rationally be the ultimatum of a woman's wiſhes; I ſhould think I ſtood a greater chance for happineſs with this gentleman, than with any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual of his ſex.</p>
                           <p>Mr. Courtland is a native of V—in the State of—he ſays he had formerly the honour of an acquaintance with my papa. He is tall and well made, his addreſs is eaſy, and commanding; the contour of his face is ſtrikingly agreeable; indeed, his whole exteriour is a combination of elegance and dignity, and his manners are confeſſedly deſcriptive of the finiſhed gentleman. I am told that he adds to theſe ſuperficial accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments a ſubſtantial and cultivated underſtanding; that he is a man of erudition, and poſſeſſeth alſo, with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral knowledge of books, an extenſive acquaintance with the world. On my return, he will preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before my parental friends. Perhaps they may not approve a connexion ſo diſproportioned in regard to years, Mr. Courtland having numbered full thirty, and I but little better than ſixteen. I confeſs that I feel a degree of culpability while detecting my heart, thus audaciouſly leaning toward an election, until my honoured benefactors, pointing the finger, had united<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounced, "There, Margaretta, there is your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial ſoul; behold the perſon whom we direct you to regard, as him who is deſtined the aſſociate of your future life;" but my fault is altogether involuntary, and I pray you, my dear lady, to preſent to my papa my reſpectful regards; and to aſſure him that from his honoured lips, and thoſe of my mamma, muſt proceed the award which will decide the fate of their ever du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, ever grateful, ever affectionate</p>

                     <p>This letter, I ſay, inflicted upon my boſom the moſt pungent anxiety. Full well I knew Siniſterus Courtland. I knew him much better (for my perſonal interviews with him had been but few) than he was apprized of; I knew him to be baſe, deſigning, and however incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:034162_0080_0FFC5CBAA2DF6DE0"/>
theſe qualities may ſeem, improvident alſo; his father had bred him a gentleman, leaving him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſlender patrimony to ſupport his pretenſions, while he was wholly deſtitute of the means, diſpoſition, or talents, to add thereto; nay, even his ſmall inheritance, without ſpending a ſingle thought on the future, he had deeply involved, until preſſed upon by his creditors, he was finally induced to an effort to extricate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by the very <hi>honourable method</hi> of deluding ſome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whoſe expectations were tolerable, into an affair of the heart, the matrimonial termination of which, he conſidered as an axiom, which was too irrefragable to admit of doubt; he had ſpent the morning of his life in fluttering from town to town, paying his devoirs to every inconſiderate girl, who, allured by his flattery, and charmed by an exteriour which is indeed unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable, and deceived alſo by the eaſe, brilliancy, and eclat of his appearance into a good opinion of his finances, became the dupe of her own vanity, finding her inclinations betrayed, in favour of an impoſtor, who on his part, poſſeſſed not depth of underſtanding ſufficient to render him capable of a ſerious or laſting impreſſion.</p>
                     <p>It is ſcarcely neceſſary to add a finiſhing to the character that now preſented a formidable candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date for the heart of my girl; and, in addition to the unfavourable light in which I beheld Mr. Courtland, I had long entertained other views for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetta, adjuſting my plans in ſuch a manner, as I conceived well nigh precluded a diſappointment: I was ſenſible, that as I had no near relation of my own, it was generally ſuppoſed Miſs Melworth would be my heir, and I ſhuddered at the idea of the little fortune which, with much induſtry, application and economy, I had accumulated, being ſquandered by a ſpendthrift, while my daughter, and her deſcendants, were left pennyleſs! For a moment, regarding myſelf as a ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecked voyager, bereaved of every hope, I was ready, yielding the point, to ſtretch myſelf upon the barren heaths of deſpair; but after deliberating the matter, I conceived, that though my fabric tottered, it was not

abſolutely whelmed; and though I was aware that, manured by the prejudices prepared in the hot-bed of novel reading, the impreſſions made upon young minds, with the paſſions implanted in the tender ſoil, were not eaſily eraſed, or up-rooted; yet I conceived that the taſk, however arduous, was not altogether impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and while apprized that the buſineſs in which I was about to engage required in the management thereof the utmoſt delicacy, I concluded, nevertheleſs, that an object ſo deſirable, was at leaſt worth any attempt to obtain it. Thus having made up my mind, Mary, who was hand in glove with me, began our operations, by reſponding to the letter of Margaretta, in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined manner.</p>

                           <p>I PERSUADE myſelf, my dear Margaretta, that it would at this time be wholly ſuperfluous to expreſs to you the very high ſatisfaction which both your father and myſelf mutually experience, at that unfeigned complacency in your ſituation, which you take every opportunity ſo gratefully to avow. Once for all, my dear girl, you may aſſure yourſelf that your affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate regards are abundantly reciprocated; that we have no idea of a warmer attachment than we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for you; and, that if the hearts of natural parents beat with ardours ſtronger than thoſe which expand our boſoms, they muſt border ſo nearly upon anguiſh, that we are not ambitious of being able, experimentally to aſcertain the difference; neither ſhall I, at this time, expatiate upon the merit of your letter—my opinion of your epiſtolary talents, you already know, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I ſhould not ſo eaſily deny myſelf a repetition of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>

I hardly know where to begin, or how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to you the anxiety to which you have given birth in our boſoms. Is it poſſible, that my Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta can <hi>love</hi> where ſhe cannot <hi>entirely eſteem!</hi> and can ſhe have ſo far forgot the leſſons of her youth, as <hi>entirely to eſteem</hi> Mr. Courtland! What is the conduct of a man of honour in ſo delicate a conjuncture as you delineate? doth he wait till he hath, as he ſuppoſes, irrevocably fixed himſelf in the heart of a young woman, before he deigns to apprize thoſe whoſe nights and days have been ſpent in watching for her welfare? Certainly not—but immediately after his propoſals have been made to her, who I grant is the perſon principally concerned, if he can diſcern the ſmalleſt appearance of ſucceſs, (and men are eagle eyed upon theſe occaſions) he will ſolicit the ſanction of her guardian friends, that he may either avail himſelf of them as auxiliaries in his purſuit; or, if neceſſary, ſet about conquering a paſſion which cannot be conſecrated by duty—reverſe the picture, and the man of duplicity ſtands confeſt; he will ſteal into the confidence of the unſuſpecting virgin, obtaining what he conceives an unalterable and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided aſcendency over her mind, and then, <hi>merely as a compliment,</hi> the parents are made acquainted with the buſineſs, who, if they preſume to enter their caveat, however improper the connexion may in fact be, are accuſed of tyranny, barbarity, and what not.</p>
                           <p>Thus Mr. Courtland—the poſt paſſes by our door, but he hath not condeſcended to pen for us a ſingle line, which might inform us of his enterprize. Doubtleſs his intention is to aſſail your paſſions during the whole period of your purpoſed viſit, when deeming the matter irremediable, he will make us a genteel bow, and <hi>inſult</hi> us by requeſting our advice! But from you, my dear child, we expect a deciſion more upright—you have deviated, it is true, but you have as yet taken but one ſtep, and we doubt not that you will very ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the path of diſcretion. You ſee that our objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Mr. Courtland is not altogether on account of his years, though this of itſelf is in our opinion inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable;

at preſent, ſixteen and thirty may move in the ſame ſphere; but paſs a few years, and we may almoſt trace their orbits in oppoſite hemiſpheres; <hi>ſeventy is the age of man</hi>—while fifty-ſix may enjoy the utmoſt vigour of mental and corporeal powers—indeed, if <hi>ſimilarity of diſpoſitions, ſentiments and attachments are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to conſtitute matrimonial felicity, ſurely an equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or nearly an equality of years, ought to be deemed of ſome importance in the calculation.</hi> I know that to almoſt every general rule there are exceptions; but yet, nevertheleſs, I would not give my voice in favour of a gentleman's having more than two or three years at fartheſt, the advantage over her whom he ſelected as the partner of his life.</p>
                           <p>Aſk yourſelf, my dear, what opportunity have you had of becoming acquainted with the views, hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, or temper of Mr. Courtland; and yet, although, when your letter was written, only <hi>ten days</hi> from the moment of your introduction to him had elapſed, you <hi>ſeriouſly pronounced him the individual, who of all his ſex is the moſt capable of making you happy!</hi> Such is the natural good ſenſe of my Margaretta, that I aſſure myſelf I need not comment upon this declaration.</p>
                           <p>I am rather ſurpriſed at the part which my friend Mrs. Worthington hath taken in this affair; ſurely, in this inſtance, ſhe hath been miſled by the goodneſs of her own heart. Mr. Courtland is only a viſitor in New-Haven; the place of his nativity and uſual reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is at a great diſtance; and ſhe can only know in general that he is a man of family and education. But in truth, I myſelf have been wrong; I ought not to have parted with my Margaretta. Yet, while I palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate my fault, by a declaration that I conceived her extreme youth would have protected her from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo important; I truſt, that the tears which I have ſhed upon this occaſion, will expiate it.</p>
                           <p>Yes, my love, your father knows Mr. Courtland—<hi>he knows him well;</hi> and without further inveſtigating the character of that gentleman, he bids me tell you, that he hath long entertained views of eſtabliſhing you
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:034162_0084_0FFC5CAB1F104158"/>
in our own neighbourhood. Edward Hamilton—ſtart not, my dear, at a name, which in the innocence of your heart you have a thouſand times declared you loved—hath now completed his nineteenth year; he bids fair to be every thing which a fond father could wiſh for the man, to whom he yielded the beloved daughter of his affections; his character is bottomed upon integrity; he is every way accompliſhed; his proſpects are good; his knowledge of the profeſſion of his election, indeed his extenſive acquaintance with mercantile affairs, is, for his years, prodigious; with regard to his exteriour and addreſs, if we allow for the charm of novelty, he might rival even a Courtland; and I declare I know not the youth who can equal him for gentility of mein, and beauty of perſon. But theſe are attractions, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply conſidered, to which the heart of my Margaretta, when ſhe ſuffers herſelf calmly to reflect, will, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, ever remain impregnable. Before the death of your reverend friend, old Mr. Hamilton, the plan of uniting our children, ſuppoſing their hearts were not reluctant, was adjuſted. The good gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded his ſon as almoſt an affianced lover; otherwiſe I imagine he would not have left his ward, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and accompliſhed Serafina, ſituated as ſhe is in regard to Edward; who, however unblemiſhed his character may be, is nevertheleſs, as a young man, a very ill-judged guardian for a young and unconnected woman. Hitherto, being deſirous of leaving you wholly unreſtrained, we have kept our ſecret cloſe locked in our own boſoms; and until the receipt of your letter, we have beheld with pleaſure the gradual advancement of our wiſhes. For Edward, he is wholly devoted to you, and while hardly conſcious of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives by which he is actuated, he is aſſiduous in every thing which relates to you; even trifles are inveſted with importance, if they are inſcribed with your name—if you are unexpectedly mentioned, his whole frame is viſibly agitated, his complexion aſſumes a more ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated glow, his voice is mellowed into an unuſual ſoftneſs, and his tongue is never tired in rehearſing
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:034162_0085_0FFC5CA7C5398A28"/>
your praiſes; but, fear not my girl—if we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince your judgment, and woo your beſt affections, you ſhall never be the wife of Hamilton.</p>
                           <p>Your intereſt and happineſs is the ſole motive of our actions; it is the pole ſtar by which all our movements are directed, and if we can but ſee you pleaſingly eſtabliſhed, and in poſſeſſion of tranquillity, we ſhall lay us down in perfect peace. We regard the unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our plan to you at this time, as premature, and we <hi>feelingly</hi> regret that our meaſures are thus unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately precipitated. We have not yet diſcloſed our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Edward; we are not in favour of early mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; and though the laws of Heaven and of good citizenſhip, have ordained the ſexes for each other, yet we think that years are requiſite to ripen the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to aſcertain the choice, which a young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may have every reaſon to ſuppoſe immutably fixed. We have conceived, that a female who takes a ſtep ſo important, at the age of twenty three, or upwards, hath loſt no time; and it was only in compliance with the dying requeſt of Mr. Hamilton, that we conſented, ſuppoſing our young people ſhould be propitious, that you ſhould, at the period when you ſhall have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted your nineteenth year, exchange your vows with his deſerving ſon.</p>
                           <p>But, waving theſe matters for the preſent, I have to ſay, that your father, after preſenting you his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal regards and bleſſing, directs me to inform you, that buſineſs will ſoon call him to New-Haven, and that, if curtailing your viſit, you can find it agreeable to return home with him, you will confer on him a very high obligation; in this requeſt, my dear, I, for my part, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But alas! that cheerfulneſs, which had ſo long preſided in her boſom, had taken its flight; and though joy gladdened in her countenance at the entrance of our village, and at the appearance of our habitation; though ſhe ſeemed, while claſped in the arms of Mary, to be loſt in extacy—yet, upon her lovely countenance the cloud again gathered; her eye beamed a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly languor; the roſe upon her cheek viſibly gave place to the lily of her complexion, and we were well nigh diſtracted by the gloomy forebodings which her altered figure originated in our ſouls. We had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed our plan, the ultimatum of which was her feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; and we were determined, if we could not bend her to our wiſhes, to follow her through all the viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes her unfortunate preference might involve, with every alleviation which we could furniſh.

Having, however, ſo great a ſtake, it became us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate much, to be very cautious in our movements; a precipitate ſtep might ruin our meaſures, and it was our aim to be guarded at all points. Courtland very ſoon made his appearance in our village, we extended to him the rights of hoſpitality; and, as an admirer of Miſs Melworth's, we gave him every decent opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of advocating his cauſe. To this mode of proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure we were impelled by the following conſiderations: Should we refuſe, to this pretender, that uniform civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, with which we have diſtinguiſhed every ſtranger, the wound thereby given to the feelings of Margaretta, might very poſſibly add to the ſtrength of her attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the idea of his ſuffering upon her account, intereſting her gratitude, would ſtill more have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared him to her; while, in the inmoſt receſſes of her ſoul, accuſing us of injuſtice, ſhe would ſyllogiſtically have concluded, that error in one particular involved a poſſibility of miſtake in another. And it would, in truth, have been in a very high degree abſurd, to have denied his claim to common attentions, merely becauſe he had eyes for the charms of a perſon, whom our partiality induced us to think, had merit ſufficient to captivate every beholder. In this arrangement we alſo made ourſelves witneſſes of every movement, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all neceſſity for, and poſſibility of, clandeſtine views; and we conceived, beſides, that as Miſs Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth poſſeſſed a penetration far beyond her years, frequent interviews with <hi>Siniſterus Courtland</hi> would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly develope to her underſtanding his true charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, effectually deſtroying that maſk under which he
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:034162_0088_0FFC5C9FDC2F4560"/>
had continued to betray the unwary; and we well knew, that could <hi>ſhe herſelf</hi> make the diſcovery we wiſhed, ſuch an event would operate more propitiouſly than any information, however important, which might be handed her from any other quarter. Perhaps it may be matter of ſurpriſe, that being myſelf in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch material documents, I did not come to an immediate explanation, thus adjuſting the buſineſs agreeably to my own deſignation. But though, as I apprehend, the preceding remark anticipates this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, I have yet to ſay, I was aware of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuges to which bad men often have recourſe: Had I declared my knowledge of what I termed Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's enormities, it would have been eaſy for him to have availed himſelf of the plea of youth and inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, of a change of ſyſtem, reformation, preſent regularity, &amp;c. &amp;c. and, for his poverty, it was an objection which the ardour of young affection would not only find a <hi>laudable generoſity</hi> in palliating, but it would, with glowing zeal, aſſay to enliſt againſt ſo <hi>mercenary</hi> and <hi>unworthy</hi> a conſideration, the moſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous propenſities of the ſoul. I knew that to eraſe impreſſions, made upon the youthful boſom, violent efforts muſt generally be inadequate; that they would much more frequently lacerate, than obliterate; and I was not willing to leave in the boſom of Margaretta the ſmalleſt fear. I had not forgotten the integrity and the ingenuity which characterizes the morning of life; and I remembered alſo, that the enthuſiaſm of an early love, is fruitful in its vindications of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of its preference; and that it is ready to accuſe every objector as prejudiced and unjuſt. Taking the matter up in this view, we thought beſt to await ſome fortunate criſis, holding the <hi>unqueſtionable facts</hi> of which we were poſſeſſed, relative to Courtland, as our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

of our determination to take every proper ſtep, which we ſhould deem likely to propitiate the mind of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetta, reſpecting an event which we regarded in ſo eligible a view; and we grounded our objections to him on the diſparity of years, the ſhort date of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Miſs Melworth, and the diſtance of his reſidence; nevertheleſs, we added, that if we had the power, even of natural parents, over the final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of that young lady, we ſhould not hold ourſelves authorized to direct her any further than reaſon point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that we left him at full liberty to proſecute his ſuit with what advantage he might, only promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we ſhould not conſent to diſpoſe of Miſs. Melworth, even to Hamilton himſelf, until ſhe had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely rounded her nineteenth year. Courtland, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this aſſurance, reddened exceſſively; he had hoped <hi>his happineſs might have been much ſooner accelerated, and ſome very preſſing circumſtances, relative to him, demanded a very early eſtabliſhment.</hi> Our determination upon this head continued, however, unalterable; while our eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſing, as we apparently did, the intereſts of Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, occaſioned in the boſom of our daughter ſuch a ſtruggle between inclination and duty, as ſtill looked with a very ſerious and unfriendly aſpect upon her health. Upon our grand ſubject, both Mary and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf held with her many converſations, which, I am vain enough to imagine, might be uſeful to young perſons thus circumſtanced, and which, did not the limits preſcribed to a writer for the Magazine, ſet bounds to my encroachments, ſhould moſt certainly be recounted; but ſhould they be demanded, as they were immediately committed to paper, future Glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhall certainly record them. One ſentiment, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which dropped from the mouth of Mary, which I accidentally overheard, and which was perfectly new to me, I cannot excuſe myſelf from giving. She was, one fine afternoon, while ſeated with Margaretta in the arbour to which they were both ſo much attached, endeavouring, in a manner peculiar to herſelf, to ſooth the feelings of her daughter; thus encouraging her to
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:034162_0090_0FFC5C9835D5A978"/>
lay open her whole ſoul, that ſhe might, from ſuch confidence, the better judge of the nature of the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edy ſhe was to apply; when Miſs Melworth, ſenſibly regretting that ſhe was ſo unfortunately ſituated, as to feel a diſpoſition to act contrary to the wiſhes of her beſt friends; by turns lamenting and accuſing the treachery of a heart which had thus betrayed her, concluded a very tender harangue, by a declaration, that though Hamilton was every thing amiable, yet ſhe was certain ſhe could never feel for him that pref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence which ſhe did for Courtland; ſhe could never regard him in any other view than that of a brother. "Will you, my ſweet girl," replied Mary, "<hi>re-conſider</hi> this affirmation? you are fond of reaſoning, you know; and truſt me, my dear, when I aſſure you, that an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment which embraceth not reaſon as its auxiliary, is not worth cheriſhing. You own that Hamilton is every thing amiable; but you can only love him as a brother! you pretend not to point out a ſingle vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, a ſingle accompliſhment, a ſingle grace, in which Courtland can claim a ſuperiority over Hamilton; yet you can only love Hamilton as a brother, while you love Courtland as—as what, my dear? Will you, Margaretta, pleaſe to point out the diſtinction between thoſe attachments which you feel for the one and the other? You bluſh, my love; let me kiſs off that conſcious tear—Say, my charming reaſoner, would theſe over nice diſtinctions, for which you cannot find a name, ever have found entrance into the boſom of a virtuous girl, were it not for that falſe taſte which is formed by novel reading? What is this ſomething which you feel for Courtland, and which you cannot feel for Hamilton? Certainly it is, at beſt, but the fever of the imagination, the delirium of fancy; and ever experienced votary of this <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> if under the direction of truth, will tell you, that the duration of the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="92" facs="unknown:034162_0091_0FFC5C9687AF6C28"/>
would ſacrifice to the illuſion of a moment, the happineſs of a life. Did you never, my dear, reflect upon the connexions which muſt have been formed by the immediate deſcendants of the pair who were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in Paradiſe? brothers then interchanged the nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial vow with ſiſters; they were unacquainted with the refinements of modern times; the virtues which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared the brother, rendered the huſband amiable; and we have no authority for ſuppoſing, that their matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial felicity was more circumſcribed than that of their poſterity. It is true, that the multiplication of our ſpecies have rendered other regulations, relative to the marriage contract, or the parties contracting, both neceſſary and proper; and it is undoubtedly true, that an obſervation of theſe regulations, is religiouſly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory; but yet, in my opinion, the abſurdity of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a character in great eſtimation, and highly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, as a brother, which we ſhould at the ſame time regard with reluctance as a conjugal companion, is ſtill palpable; and I muſt repeat, that the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ſuch romantic ideas can originate only in the regions of fancy." Thus far my honeſt woman. But Margaretta, in a letter to Miſs Worthington, which lately came under my obſervation, hath beſt deſcribed her own ſenſations; I ſubjoin it therefore, <hi>verbatim,</hi> as it flowed from as ſuſceptible and upright a heart, as ever beat in the boſom of humanity.</p>

                           <p>You aſk me if I have recovered my tranquillity; alas, no! and I fear, my Amelia, that peace hath fled forever from my boſom. Mr. Courtland, as you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is here; would I had never ſeen him—I might then have been happy. Edward Hamilton—the bloom hath forſaken his checks—the luſtre of his fine eyes is no more—I never ſaw ſo total a change in a youth, who but lately might have figured as the perſonifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of health, enlivened and informed by the moſt endearing vivacity: Would I had never ſeen Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land—I might then have been happy. When Edward Hamilton ſuffers, I feel that I cannot ſtand by regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; I follow him with the affection of a ſiſter; but of late, he ſtudiouſly ſhuns my advances: It was but yeſterday, that with trembling eagerneſs, he graſped my hand; ſomething he was about to ſay; but, as if recollecting himſelf, inſtantly, like the ſpectre of a dream. he fled away. And I not juſtified in ſayings that if I had never ſeen Courtland, I might then have been happy? Serafina too, is often drowned in tears. Serafina is the ſiſter of my heart. Why will ſhe not exchange her vows with. Edward? how rich ſhould I then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The engagement en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into with old Mr. Hamilton was conditional; and you know, my dear, that though I am—though I <hi>was,</hi> I ſhould ſay, cheerful, it never could be ſaid that I was gay; and I think I could accommodate my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the graveſt humour: But my parents, you will ſay, are the beſt judges; and you, Miſs Worthington,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:034162_0093_0FFC5C8DBB595C00"/>
are a good girl, while I, methinks, am become a faulty, a very faulty creature. My mother—but my mother is an angel—I do aſſure you, my dear, that I not ſeldom feel a degree of awe, while contemplating the character of ſo divine a woman, which abſolutely deters me from arrogating to myſelf the title, with which her condeſcending indulgence hath inveſted me. This ſuperior woman, you will recollect, aſſured me that I ſhould never be the wife of Hamilton, except both my judgment, and my beſt affections were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting; exactly with this declaration, doth every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement correſpond; and, while neither ſhe nor my father produce a ſingle argument in favour of the man of their election, which reaſon doth not fully au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize, they unitedly and repeatedly engage, that however I may ultimately determine, they will nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ceaſe to be my parental friends. Tell me, my dear, what returns doth ſuch matchleſs generoſity merit? And help me to diſcharge as I ought, with becoming decency, a daughter's part. Unexampled indeed is their conſideration for me; and ſtill the more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance their goodneſs, and ally it to perfection, they aſſay to wear a tranquillity which is foreign from their hearts; for alas! do I not hourly obſerve the anxious ſolicitude but too viſibly pourtrayed in the manly fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of my father—often have I wiped the tear from the ſwoln eye of my mother—often have I witneſſed the chagrin which they have mutually and involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily manifeſted at any diſcovery which I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily made of my attachment to Courtland; and I have but too well marked the joy of their brightened countenances, at the ſmalleſt inſtance of my tenderneſs for Edward. What right do I poſſeſs thus to ſtab the boſoms which have ſo long foſtered me? Better I had been whelmed beneath thoſe waves which gave death to him from whom I derived my exiſtence, than thus to become the ſource of corroding anxiety, to characters ſo exalted. Every penſive look of theirs pierces me to the ſoul; and I ſeem to move an evil genius, doomed to chace peace from their revered boſoms. Amelia,

I could not be other than miſerable, even poſſeſſed of the man of my heart, if I thus implanted in the pillow of my guardian friends, the rankling thorn of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
                           <p>Forgive, my dear, this incoherent letter; it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of my feelings; the preſſure upon my ſpirits is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme; my ſituation is truly melancholy; it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely that which I would wiſh to avoid. Could I unite my hopes and wiſhes with the expectations of thoſe who have a right to my utmoſt obedience, how enviable would be my lot? You demand a long, a very long letter; but what can I write which will not be calculated to caſt a cloud over the charming vivacity of my lively friend. Yet you would acquaint yourſelf with every movement of my ſoul! well then, as you have expreſſed a predilection for my little poetical attempts, I will tranſcribe for you ſome lines which I laſt night haſtily penned, after I had retired from my parents, enriched with their affectionate and joint ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ediction; they delineate my wiſhes; they delineate my feelings, and they are the fervid breathings of a much agitated, and deeply wounded ſpirit.</p>

                     <p>THUS, for a conſiderable time, matters remained ſtationary as it were, in my family. Courtland continued his purſuit. In the boſom of Margaretta, the conflict between duty and inclination was unyield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſevere; and Hamilton, with a noble conſiſtency,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:034162_0096_0FFC5C8AAC413940"/>
perſevered in declining a competition, which he deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unworthy that rational, diſintereſted and fervent attachment, which every faculty of his ſoul had long acknowledged for Miſs Melworth.</p>
                     <p>Courtland, evidently exulting in his ſucceſs, felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated himſelf upon his opening proſpects; and calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the tenderneſs of Margaretta, he became con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident it would be in his power to obtain a much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier day, than the very diſtant era which we had ſo peremptorily named.</p>
                     <p>We were thus circumſtanced, when the following little poem that made its appearance in the Gazette, however inconſiderable it may in fact be, from the important conſequences by which it was attended, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its a place in my narration.</p>

                        </gap>ender her an object generally beloved; and, indeed, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and equality of her conduct had been ſuch, as to produce a ſoleciſm to the adage, which creates envy as the ſhadow of merit; nor did we know that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of malevolence was in exerciſe toward her. It was ſoon noiſed abroad that Margaretta had been eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logized in the news paper, and it furniſhed a topic for thoſe circles in which ſhe moved; her partial favourers found beauties in the piece, which perhaps a critic would have been far from allowing it. They made it their buſineſs to find out the Author; they applied themſelves with much avidity to the purſuit; and they determined, if they ſhould be ſo fortunate as to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, to hail him as the prince of poets.</p>
                     <p>We had, among the number of our viſitors, and old lady by the name of Clacket, who was alſo much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to Miſs Melworth, and whoſe curioſity was upon this occaſion raiſed to the higheſt pitch. She roundly taxed Courtland with being the author of the poem; and the embarraſſment which be diſcovered, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly juſtified her ſuſpicions.</p>
                     <p>The piece had, as I hinted, its admirers; and Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land either ſaw, or thought he ſaw, an advantage in adopting this fugitive relation of the Parnaſſian laſſes: He managed the matter with ſome adroitneſs; his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant was authorized to whiſper, as it profound ſecret to lady Clacket's maid, that his maſter had in truth compoſed the favourite lines, which had originated to much ſpeculation; and ſhe reporting it in confidence to her lady, it was in a few days entruſted to the taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnity of the whole neighbourhood. Courtland was repeatedly complimented upon his poetical abilities, and he heſitated not to wear the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ays.</p>
                     <p>It happened about this time that Courtland made one of a large circle which were collected round our
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:034162_0099_0FFC6302C3675E50"/>
ſocial board, when the before mentioned lady intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the ſubject of the poem, and proceeded with all the loquacity of talkative volubility, to pronounce a panegyric upon our gentleman, as the author. The poet bowed, bluſhed, and looked ſilly. Margaretta was evidently pleaſed; while I, regarding the whole affair, as another <hi>much ado about nothing,</hi> ſhould have paſſed it without further obſervation, had I not acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally glanced the face of Serafina, who was alſo of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r' party, and whoſe countenance, in the courſe of a few moments, expreſſed the moſt lively ſenſations. Her heightened complexion during the converſation, now changing to the cleareſt white, and now aſſuming the deepeſt colouring with which the moſt impaſſioned feelings could tinge it. I marked Serafina, but I mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in ſilence; for, from theſe ſuſpicious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, I was induced to fear that the ſpecious manners of our gallant, had made alſo upon the youthful mind of this young lady, an impreſſion which would be with difficulty eradicated! But I was not ſuffered to remain long under this deception; our company ſoon ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and only Courtland, Margaretta, Serafina, Mary and myſelf, remained. The chagrin upon the face of Serafina was ſtill viſible, when, ſtanding up with much dignity in her manner, ſhe inſtantly accounted for the appearance, by which I had been miſled.</p>
                     <p>Addreſſing Mr. Courtland, ſhe thus expreſſed herſelf: "I am, Sir, the friend of Edward Hamilton; we have been educated together, almoſt from the firſt moment of our exiſtence, and every ſecret of his ſoul is repoſed in my boſom. I am not ſure that he would approve of what I am about to ſay; nay, feeling my mind at this preſent in a great meaſure governed by indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I am not myſelf poſitive, that I am quite right; however, like all angry folks I am hurried on by an impetuoſity which I find altogether irreſiſtable. Is it not enough, Sir, that you have ſupplanted that unhappy young man in his deareſt hopes? Is it not enough that you have ſtepped between him and that hoard of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which he fondly fancied was treaſured up for him?
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:034162_0100_0FFA6523F38D9608"/>
but muſt you alſo <hi>poorly ſteal</hi> that pittance of fame, which juſtice reſerved for him? You know, Sir, that you never wrote the piece for which you have been contented to receive the praiſes of ſo many admirers. I have at this moment the original lines upon Miſs Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, which were written by Edward, in my pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book; they were penned upon yonder verdant bank, during Miſs Melworth's continuance at New-Haven, while I was prattling by his ſide. It is true he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agines they are deſtroyed; he requeſted that I would deſtroy them; but I have imprudently and unkindly given a copy of them to Miſs Predy, and thus they have found their way to the preſs."</p>
                     <p>What would I have then given for the pencil of a Hogarth, that I might have ſketched the group which my parlour at that inſtant exhibited. Need I tell thee, reader, that I am not even a deſcendant of Hogarth's? I trow not; but I add, by way of inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that having a mortal averſion to daubing, it is therefore that I paſs haſtily over every expreſſive fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was then replete with the deepeſt meaning, and only obſerve, that Courtland, almoſt immediately recovering himſelf, ſuddenly ſeized the outſtretched hand of Miſs Clifford, and preſſing it with much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to his lips, burſt into an immoderate fit of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, affecting great ſurpriſe, that ſhe took the matter ſo ſeriouſly, and declaring that he meant nothing more than a jeſt, and merely to amuſe himſelf with the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and credulity of lady Clacket.</p>
                     <p>For my own part, my aſtoniſhment at the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the fellow, abſolutely ſtruck me dumb; and I ſuffered him to give his adventure what turn he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without even the capability of interrupting him! I ſaw, however, by the altered looks of Margaretta; by a degree of diſguſt which pervaded her fine counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the pointed reprehenſion which ſhe darted from her charmingly expreſſive eyes; from all theſe auſpicious indications, I gathered, that the full time for executing my ſcheme, was at length arrived, and that the mine being thus accidentally and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſly
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:034162_0101_0FFA6526A03E9F98"/>
ſprung, it became me to continue my opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with all poſſible expedition.</p>
                     <p>Courtland, therefore, had no ſooner taken his leave for the evening, than without taking the leaſt notice of the rhymes, or their effect, I obſerved to my daughter—that having long noted with much concern her waſting frame, and impaired conſtitution, I was at laſt come to the reſolution of bending myſelf entirely to her wiſhes; that upon the next morning's viſit which we ſhould receive from her lover, I would lead him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to my library—that poſſibly I might have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken his character, but that I would then enter into a converſation with him, of a nature ſo ſerious, as fully to aſcertain our man—that I would requeſt her, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by her mother, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eat herſelf in the adjoining apartment, where they might be ear witneſſes of our diſcourſe—and that if, after the inveſtigation to which I ſhould oblige Mr. Courtland to ſubmit, he ſhould ſtill continue the object of a choice, which would then be ſo deliberate, I would myſelf lead her to the altar, at any hour which ſhe ſhould judge moſt proper; and, furthermore, that I promiſed on behalf of Mary, as well as in my own name, that we would continue through life, in every event, to partake her felicity, and to gild for her, to the utmoſt of our ability, every misfortune which might await her.</p>
                     <p>Margaretta trembled exceſſively; her complexion now reddened to the deepeſt dye, and now changed to the moſt deadly pale! we were fearful that ſhe would faint. Mary addreſſed her in the moſt ſoothing language; this had the deſired effect; and, burſting into tears, ſhe raiſed her claſped hands, while a kind of agonized expreſſion was depictured upon her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and, ere we were aware, with a ſudden and tremulous emotion, quitting her ſeat, ſhe ſunk down upon her knees! ſore us. "Oh Sir, oh Madam!" in a broken voice ſhe exclaimed, "ſpare your child, ſpare <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> this evening paſſed your doors; I am convinced
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:034162_0102_0FFC63004A796580"/>
that he is poorly mean, that he is capable of the moſt deliberate baſeneſs; and never ſhall my ſoul bind itſelf in alliance with an unworthy pretender, who can thus pitifully ſtoop to purloin the fame, with which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted merit had inveſted his ſuperior."</p>
                     <p>"Nay, my love," rejoined Mary, "you are now again too precipitate; would you diſcard the man of your heart, merely becauſe he is ambitious of adorning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the poet's laurel? beſides, theſe tears, theſe looks of anguiſh, theſe broken accents, and heart-affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſighs; theſe all betray a mind not ſufficiently at eaſe, to make up a determination ſo important; ſhould you thus haſtily proceed, you may poſſibly repent at leiſure. Come to my arms, my daughter—let me preſs this throbbing heart to the boſom of friendſhip; let us take time, my love; your father, whoſe wiſdom not ſeldom leads him through the labyrinth of the human heart, ſhall proſecute his plan, while we, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning the aid of mild reſignation, abide, with patient acquieſcence, the event."</p>
                     <p>Thus, then, we adjuſted our meaſures; and the returning ſun, according to cuſtom, preſenting Mr. Courtland, uſhered in an hour which I regarded among the moſt important of my life. My unalterable intention was to conſtitute Miſs Melworth ſole heireſs of every ſhilling which I poſſeſſed; yet, regarding our ſpark, in pecuniary matters, as another <hi>Zeluco,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived myſelf juſtified in practiſing a little addreſs, in order to the unmaſking an impoſtor, who, by meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods ſo unwarrantable, had obtained ſuch hold of the affections of my daughter.</p>
                     <p>Behold me then, gentle reader, with theſe impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſeated in my library, and Courtland, with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bluſhing effrontery,</hi> lolling upon a ſofa before me; liſten, alſo, while with a ſolemn, but compoſed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and in a reſolute and peremptory tone of voice, I thus deliver myſelf.</p>
                     <p>"I have requeſted this interview, Sir, in order to obtain your ear upon a very important ſubject. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that your pretenſions to Miſs Melworth, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:034162_0103_0FFC62FDD341B000"/>
your knowledge of our predilection for Mr. Hamilton, are ſtill continued; and I repeat, that no parental friends, ought <hi>unduly</hi> to influence in an affair, which cannot ſo deeply intereſt them, as the individuals who are principally concerned; we conſent, therefore, ſuppoſing Miſs Melworth's preference ſhould remain, to yield you her hand, and we aſſure you that her matrimonial choice ſhall, in no ſort, influence her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes." Here Courtland bowed exultingly, and I proceeded to ſay—"But, Sir, it is juſt, that upon this occaſion, I add, that, as Miſs Melworth is not in fact, our daughter, ſhe is not by nature entitled to our inheritance. My heart, Sir, my paternal heart, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges for that young lady the ſtrongeſt affection; but family claims are reſpectable, and the pride of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationſhip is ſeldom wholly eradicated from the boſom. There is now living in a certain metropolis upon this continent, a diſtant relation of mine, who bears my name; it is true he is rich, but his family is large, and as I am fond, I confeſs, of eſtabliſhing my name, the world, in general, will not condemn me, ſhould I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the greater part of my real eſtate to this my kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; while prudence directs me to ſecure to Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta and her poſterity, whatever part of my poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions I ſhall judge proper to endow her with; and I am poſitive that Miſs Melworth will not accuſe me of want of affection for her, whatever arrangements I may be induced to make."</p>
                     <p>I aſſay not to deſcribe the agitated alterations, which the countenance of Courtland underwent, during the latter part of my harangue; anger, diſappointment, and the deepeſt chagrin, were marked there; when, ſtarting from his ſeat, with an indignation but ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, he expreſſed himſelf to the following effect: <q>I was informed, Sir, that you had no relation in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; I was informed that Miſs Melworth would undoubtedly ſucceed to your eſtates; and I was moreover informed, that you had deſtined a very handſome ſum, as a nuptial preſent, for the huſband of that young lady, upon the day of marriage; if I
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:034162_0104_0FFC62FC136940E8"/>
am deceived, Sir, though I <hi>adore</hi> Miſs Melworth, yet neither my fortune nor my family will admit of my union with a young lady, who, (excuſe me, Sir) doth not ſeem to have <hi>any</hi> well grounded expectations, and who cannot claim a ſingle perſon in the world, as her natural relation.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was with difficulty that I ſtifled my reſentment; but, aſſuming an air of calmneſs, I returned—"I am ignorant, Sir, who was your informant; but I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident I have never before explained myſelf upon this ſubject, to any one, and I am not anſwerable for the erroneous conjectures of the buſy multitude: But, Sir, you, in your turn, muſt excuſe me, when I ſay, that I ſhould imagine a perſon upon the eve of bankruptcy, if he really loved the woman whom he was ſeeking to affiance to penury, would be happy to find her inveſted with a ſhare of property, which being independent of his failure, would ſet her above abſolute want."</p>
                     <p>This was enough; it worked him up to a degree of frenzy; and, clenching his fiſt, with a menacing air, he approached my ſeat.</p>
                     <p>"What, Sir, can you mean? What do you mean Mr. Vigillius? I demand an explanation."</p>
                     <p>"Compoſe yourſelf, Sir," I rejoined, "I am not to be intimidated by thoſe big looks, or that air of haughty defiance. Had you, Mr. Courtland, when you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented yourſelf in my family, as a candidate for the affection of my daughter, ingenuouſly favoured me with a <hi>real</hi> ſtatement of your affairs, I would have uſed my intereſt to have adjuſted them amicably with your creditors; and had the attachment of Margaretta been permanent, while I regarded you as a worthy, though an unfortunate man, I ſhould, notwithſtanding my conditional engagement with Mr. Hamilton, have viewed the matter with tolerable complacency: but, when you paſs yourſelf upon us as a man in affluent circumſtances, when you act, in every inſtance, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate deceiver, I ſhould greatly grieve, did I not know that my daughter's eyes were already opened: She, even at this moment, regains her former tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:034162_0105_0FFC62F9DC446F58"/>
You are no ſtranger to me. Sir; your <hi>amours,</hi> your <hi>improvidence,</hi> the <hi>ruined ſtate of your finances,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. I have this moment letters in my pocket, from your principal creditors, and I could long ere this have apprized Miſs Melworth, had I not judged it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that ſhe ſhould make the diſcovery for herſelf—ſhe hath made it, and I am again a happy man."</p>
                     <p>Courtland's cowardly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oul now ſhrunk from my gaze; but aſſuming, with his wonted fineſſe, the air of an injured man, as he darted from the library, and from the houſe, he ſaid, <q>It is well, Sir, it is well that your connexion with Miſs Melworth is your protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; otherwiſe I ſhould not fail to call you to a very ſevere account, for falſehoods and abſurdities, which the boſom of malevolence hath doubtleſs orignated.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the library, I immediately paſſed to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining apartment. Margaretta hid her bluſhing face in the boſom of her mother: and while I preſſed thoſe beautiful females to my heart, I proteſted, by the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs which I bore them, that I was, at that inſtant, the happieſt of human beings.</p>
                     <p>Margaretta propoſed a thouſand queſtions in a breath; and, while ſhe bleſſed the hour of her emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, ſhe begged to learn the reſidence of the dear family I had mentioned, who, from their affinity to me, ſhe gratefully ſaid, were already imaged in her heart, and to whom ſhe wiſhed ſpeedily to devote the page of tender acknowledgment, for the ſhare they undeſignedly had, in liberating a mind which had been ſo unworthily enſlaved. Tapping her cheek, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed my wonder that ſhe too had been deceived; for, my dear, I added, though there is actually, in the city of—, a gentleman of my name, circumſtanced exactly as I have ſtated, yet I am not perſonally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him; nor do I know that there is the remoteſt conſanguinity between us, in any other line, than as we are alike deſcended from the honeſt couple who had their reſidence in Paradiſe.</p>
                     <p>In fact, not having, in my converſation with Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, abſolutely avowed an intention of alienating
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:034162_0106_0FFC62F68DB9D310"/>
from Margaretta any part of my eſtate; only ſimply ſuggeſting the rationality and equity of ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, and having fully accompliſhed my deſign, I was not anxious to guard my ſecret.</p>
                     <p>Courtland, who ſtill continued in our neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, was ſoon apprized of the ſtratagem which I had ſo ſucceſsfully employed; and ſuch was the egregious vanity of the coxcomb, that he entertained no doubt of being able to reinſtate himſelf in the boſom of Margaretta; to which end, he addreſſed her by many expoſtulatory letters; imputing the part he had acted in the library, entirely to ſurpriſe, and diſavowing ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery tittle of what had been alleged againſt him; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that thoſe calumnies had undoubtedly been fabricated by ſome friends of Hamilton's, on purpoſe to ruin him in his love; and, that however ſhe might determine, his inviolable attachment to her would never permit him to be other than the humbleſt of her <hi>adorers.</hi> It was in vain Miſs Melworth aſſured him, that his real ſituation, his wiſhes, or his purſuits, could affect her in no other way, than as ſhe was a general well-wiſher to her ſpecies; and that, having outlived the eſteem ſhe once avowed for him, ſhe muſt beg leave to decline all correſpondence with him in future. No ſooner were his letters returned unopened, than he perſiſted in beſieging every door which ſhe entered; and, having once croſſed the threſhold, his clamorous proteſtations bore a ſtronger reſemblance to thoſe of a madman, than to a rationally attached lover. Miſs Melworth, however, acquitted herſelf upon every of theſe occaſions, with that cool and determined conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, which was neceſſary to the eſtabliſhment of her character, which confirmed the general ſentiment in her favour, and placed the whole affair in its true light.</p>
                     <p>But many days elapſed, before my girl regained her wonted <hi>ſelf-complacency.</hi> She often lamented the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which thus, ſubjecting her to ſo humiliating an attachment, had involved us alſo in the utmoſt anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety; and not being able to forgive herſelf, for a time
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:034162_0107_0FFC62F4D3282108"/>
ſhe continued to deplore. But the good ſenſe ſhe ſo eminently poſſeſſed, leading her at length to impute her error to inexperience, finally baniſhed every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining regret, and enabled her to pen a letter to Miſs Worthington, which I produce as a contraſt to that which appeared in my laſt Gleaner.</p>

                           <p>NEWS, joyful news! my beloved girl. Your Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetta is reſtored to her ſenſes, and ſhe is now the cheerfulleſt, the moſt contented, and the happieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the univerſe. Yes, thanks to the unworthineſs of Courtland, my liberated heart is at this moment lighter than a feather; and I can now behold this once formidable man without the ſmalleſt perturbation, ſave what is excited by the recollection of that imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, which ſo poorly ſubjected me to an indiſcretion which muſt, as often as it is recurred to, ſuffuſe my cheek with the bluſh of conſcious error! The ſtory of my emancipation is too long to relate in the little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment allowed me, for the poſt is on the wing, and as my dear Amelia has given me reaſon to flatter myſelf I ſhall ſoon ſee her at—, a bare ſketch of this happy event ſhall ſuffice, while I voluntarily engage to fill up the outlines during ſome <hi>tete a tete,</hi> which we will ſweetly enjoy, in the woodbine alcove, you have ſo often heard me mention.</p>
                           <p>For ſome time, being left by my matchleſs parents wholly to the exerciſe of my own reaſon, I had begun to diſcover that Courtland was not the faultleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which my imagination had almoſt deified. He let ſlip no opportunity of piqueing Hamilton; he ſeemed ungenerouſly to aim at pointing the ſhaft which ſo apparently wounded the boſom of my early friend; and his triumphant exultation partook a degree of meanneſs, at which I felt my boſom involuntarily reluct. Once or twice, too, I looked in upon ſome poor neighbours of ours, who were ſtruggling with diſeaſe and penury, in order, in my little way, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford

them what relief my angel benefactor had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned me to yield; methought his ſoul was not formed for pity or for ſympathy; no tear ſtarted in his eye; and while his complaiſance induced him to accompany me in my walk, his features gathered a ſevere and rigid kind of auſterity; that gentle and engaging demeanor, for which we have together ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired him, was no more; his air was haughty and forbidding, and he deigned not to pour even the oil of ſoothing words, into the lacerated boſom of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row! Upon theſe occaſions diſguſt grew in my ſoul, and I was conſcious that my attachment was gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diminiſhing. A little poem, written by Edward Hamilton, he had the weakneſs to claim; this alſo, exhibiting him in a new and diſagreeable light, made large inroads unpon that eſteem, which, while with you, (not conſidering, that I thereby violated the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I owed my revered friends) I had ſo fondly cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed; but the finiſhing ſtroke was reſerved for the inveſtigating wiſdom of my father. By the dictates of equity Courtland was tried, and he came out—I will not ſay what he came out. In ſhort, my Amelia, no longer enſlaved by that dangerous man, it is not my buſineſs to purſue him by invectives; he mingles, in regard to me, with the reſt of his ſpecies: I owe him no ill-will, and I am only ſolicitous that no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy young body, not patronized and directed, as I have been, may fall a victim to the wiles which an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy ſo faſcinating may prepare for her.</p>
                           <p>For myſelf, my utmoſt wiſhes are gratified; joy once more illumines the revered countenances of my parental friends: I am conſcious that I have baniſhed anxiety from their boſoms, and this conſciouſneſs ſeems to dignify and render my exiſtence of importance; it is of itſelf a ſufficient compenſation for years of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; from a mighty preſſure my ſoul is relieved; every thing wears its accuſtomed face; I ſkip about the houſe as uſual, and this dwelling is the ſame bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manſion which it heretofore was.

where ſhe hath been acceſſary in planting ſo ſharp a thorn. Liſten, my beloved Margaretta, to the recital I have to make; and let the virtues of Hamilton ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their due eſtimation.</p>
                           <p>About ſix years ſince, a gentleman by the name of wellwood, was one of the moſt reſpectable dwellers in this city; his family conſiſted only of his lady and daughter, with their domeſtics; his daughter had been educated with the exacteſt care, and ſhe was, at eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>een, a beautiful and accompliſhed young woman. Juſt at this important period, Mr. Wellwood paid the great debt of nature; and ſo deep an impreſſion did this melancholy and calamitous event make upon the mind of Mrs. Wellwood, who was one of the firſt of women, that after languiſhing a few weeks, under all the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a rapid decline, ſhe alſo obtained her paſſport, reſigning her life, a confeſſed and lamented martyr to grief.</p>
                           <p>Thus, in a very ſhort interval, the unfortunate Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Wellwood ſaw herſelf precipitated from a ſituation the moſt eligible, with which the diſpoſitions of pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Providence can poſſibly endow a young creature, to that of an unprotected orphan; no guardian father, no indulgent mother remained, to direct her ſteps, or to approbate her movements! She had been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to regard her parents as the ſource of wiſdom; no deſign had ſhe ever executed, unſanctioned by the parental voice, unpropitiated by the maternal ſmile; and the authors of her exiſtence had, in every ſenſe, continued the prop and the confidence of the being they had reared. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Wellwood were natives of this city; none of their kindred reſided among us: So that the beauteous orphan viewed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as alone in the univerſe; and when ſhe caſt her diſtracted gaze upon the clay cold tenements of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a mother; upon thoſe eyes, now for ever cloſed, which, while the leaſt veſtige of life remained, had ſtill darted upon her the moſt benign and unequiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocal teſtimonies of affectionate tenderneſs; upon thoſe lips never again to be unſealed, which had opened but
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:034162_0111_0FFC62E8EA25B410"/>
to enrich her with advice, admonitions, directions, or benedictions; when, with folded arms, ſhe contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated thoſe trophies of relentleſs death, the unutterable anguiſh of her ſpirit, depriving her for a time of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſuſpended the operation of the ſilent ſorrow, which afterward reduced her to the very verge of the grave! Not a benevolent heart in this city, but deeply felt for the lovely mourner; never did I ſee a more pathetic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally intereſting object. But time, that ſovereign phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, and the ſoothing of thoſe friends, to whom her virtues and her misfortunes had inexpreſſibly endeared her, at length effectuated in her boſom preciſely that ſtate of tender melancholy, which, in a delicate and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timental mind, is deſcribed as finding a luxury in tears; and her youth and an excellent conſtitution, ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ravages which had been made in her health, ſhe was gradually reſtored to a penſive kind of ſerenity.</p>
                           <p>The effects, of which Mr. Wellwood had died poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, excluſive of his houſehold moveables, which were very genteel, conſiſting altogether of navigation and articles of merchandize, he had directed in his will that they ſhould be immediately converted into ready money; and the gentleman whom he had appointed his executor, with that integrity and diſpatch, which are ſuch conſpicuous traits in his character, ſpeedily diſburſing every arrearage, and adjuſting every affair relative to his truſt, delivered into the hands of Miſs Wellwood the ſum of two thouſand pounds in caſh; this being the whole amount, after ſuch ſettlement, of what remained of her deceaſed father's eſtate; and of this her patrimony, ſhe was, agreeably to his direction, the ſole and uncontrolled poſſeſſor. Behold her then, before ſhe had completed her nineteenth year, abſolute miſtreſs of herſelf and fortune: Her apartments were elegantly furniſhed; ſhe was in poſſeſſion of a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome library, and two thouſand pounds in ready ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Juſt at this criſis, Courtland made his firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at New-Haven. His exteriour and deportment,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:034162_0112_0FFC62E741752758"/>
we have mutually agreed, are pleaſingly faſcinating, and our unguarded ſex are but too eaſily captivated. His arts of ſeduction muſt be prodigious. When I ſee you, I will recount the gradual advances, by which he undermined a virtue, that would have been proof againſt a common aſſailant. Hoodwinking her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and miſleading her judgment by arguments the moſt ſophiſtical, <hi>he induced her to view, as the reſult of human regulations, the marriage vow;</hi> it was not to be found in the law of God, and it (or rather, the calling a prieſt to witneſs it) was calculated only for the meridian of common ſouls: True, the inſtitution anſwered political purpoſes, and it might be neceſſary to preſerve a character; but for him—his nuptial hour—ſhould it take place previous to the death of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priciouſly obſtinate old uncle, who was a bachelor, and who had made his ſucceeding to his eſtate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his continuing ſingle, would mark him the moſt imprudent of men. Mean time, his love for Miſs Wellwood was unbounded; he could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly exiſt without her; he could not bear the idea of ſeeing her hourly expoſed to the ſolicitations of thoſe numerous pretenders, who thronged about her, while he was conſcious that he poſſeſſed no ſuperior claim to her attention; and ſurely, as they had the ſole diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of themſelves, they might, in the ſight of Heaven, exchange their vows; while that Heaven, which would record the deed, would alſo ſanction and crown with ſucceſs, a union ſo pure, ſo diſintereſted, and formed ſo wholly under its own ſacred auſpices; this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action would in fact conſtitute their real nuptials, and upon the demiſe of the old gentleman, they would immediately ſubmit to authoriſe their union by mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern rites.</p>
                           <p>Miſs Wellwood loved the villain—Horrid wretch!—he ſucceeded but too well, and ſhe was involved in the deepeſt ruin! My tears blot the paper—would to God that they could cancel her faults, and ſerve as a <hi>lethe</hi> for her ſufferings. Not a ſoul was apprized of their intercourſe; and ſo well were their meaſures taken,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:034162_0113_0FFC62E514669C48"/>
that when, ſix months after, the young lady diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, amid the various conjectures which were formed, not even the ſhadow of ſuſpicion glanced upon Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; every one expreſſed, in their own way, his or her wonder, grief, and apprehenſion; the whole town took an intereſt in her unexpected removal, and Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was with the foremoſt to expreſs his aſtoniſhment; but as Miſs Wellwood was entirely independent, no one was authoriſed to commence an active inquiry or purſuit.</p>
                           <p>The attention excited by any extraordinary event, after having its run, at length ſubſides; and Miſs Wellwood ceaſed by degrees to be the ſubject of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; nor hath her ſtrange flight been in any ſort accounted for, until two days ſince, when Bridget in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into our breakfaſting parlour this forlorn female, who, immediately upon fixing her eyes on my mother, ſunk down almoſt breathleſs at her feet! It is hardly neceſſary to add, that we inſtantly raiſed the hapleſs orphan, and that after recognizing, with ſome difficulty, the well-known features of Miſs Wellwood, we received from her lips the foregoing particulars.</p>
                           <p>Upon her quitting New-Haven, ſhe repaired directly to apartments, which had been taken for her by Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in a diſtant village; her patrimony, you will not doubt, was relinquiſhed to her betrayer. After ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing her honour, every thing elſe became a trifle. At firſt, he vouchſafed to ſupport her; but for theſe two laſt years, either wanting ability or inclination, ſhe has not been able to obtain from him the ſmalleſt ſum! Of her furniture, of her valuable library, of every thing ſhe is ſtripped; and for ſome months paſt ſhe hath been reduced to the neceſſity of parting with her clothes, and of availing herſelf of her ſkill in needle work, for the ſubſiſtence of herſelf and three ſons, whom ſhe hath borne to Courtland; and the little wretches, with their injured mother, have long been in want of the common neceſſaries of life! Yet, through all this, ſhe hath been ſupported, being buoyed up by the hope of an ultimate reſidence with the father of
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:034162_0114_0FFC62E226D187D0"/>
her children: By the laws of Heaven, ſhe regards her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as already his wife, while ſhe hath repeatedly, with floods of tears, beſought the abandoned man to confer upon her, by the rites of the church, a title ſo honourable; and, though ſtill repulſed, and often with ſeverity, ſhe hath never deſpaired, until the tidings that Courtland was on the point of marriage with a young lady, who had abode for ſome time with us, reached her ears; this heart-rending intelligence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her, upon the before mentioned morning, in our parlour; this hath alſo procured you the ſorrow, which ſo melancholy a recital will doubtleſs occaſion.</p>
                           <p>The once beautiful form of Miſs Wellwood is now ſurpriſingly emaciated; the few paſt weeks hath made dreadful havoc in her conſtitution; we aſſay to pour into her lacerated boſom what conſolation is in our power; we have made her acquainted with your char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, with its marked integrity and uniform conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency; and we have encouraged her to hope every thing from a goodneſs ſo perfect. The deſolated ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer will herſelf addreſs you. Alas, alas! what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I ſay! it is with difficulty that I have written thus far; but this information we have judged abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary. May God preſerve my dear Miſs Melworth from ſo black a villain—every thing is to be feared. For myſelf, I ſtand, in my own apprehenſion, as a culprit before you. Forgive, I entreat you, my ſorrowing mother; and with your wonted kindneſs, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give—O forgive—your truly affectionate, and greatly afflicted</p>

Miſs Worthington hath condeſcended to become my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducer, and ſhe informs me that ſhe hath unfolded to you the ſtory of my woes!</p>
                           <p>For myſelf, I write not, moſt reſpected young lady, either to exonerate myſelf, or to criminate an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate man, who hath had the preſumption to aſpire to ſuch daring heights! Regiſtered in the uncontrovert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible records of heaven, the wife of Courtland, in walks ſo reprehenſible, it would ill become me to be found. No, Madam, I write to ſupplicate, and on my bended knees I am proſtrated before you—I write to ſupplicate you to uſe your intereſt in the heart of Courtland, in my favour. Help me, O thou unblemiſhed votary of virtue! help me to reclaim a huſband, who, not naturally bad, hath too long wandered in the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous paths of diſſipation; who hath drank too deeply of the empoiſoned cup of error; and who, if he is not ſoon rouſed from his viſionary career, may ſuddenly be precipitated into the gulph of perdition!</p>
                           <p>I ſaid that Mr. Courtland was not naturally bad; and believe me, good young lady, I have, in a thouſand inſtances, obſerved the rectitude of his heart. Early indulgence, and a miſtaken mode of education, hath been his ruin; but the amiable qualities which are natal in his boſom, have, nevertheleſs, through the weeds by which they have been well nigh choaked, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally diſcovered themſelves. Yet, whatever are his faults, they can never obliterate my errors; <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he obſerved in me ſome blameable weakneſs,</hi> or he would never have taken thoſe unwarrantable ſteps, which were the conſequence of our acquaintance; and now, circumſtanced as we are, a failure of duty in
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:034162_0116_0FFC62DD8EA67148"/>
him, can never apologize for the want of every proper exertion on my ſide. He is the father of my children; I have a preſentiment that he may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the boſom of equity; and, if he will permit me, I will watch over him as my deareſt treaſure. Let him but acknowledge the honourable and endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ties, father and huſband; let him but ſanction them in the face of the world, and I will ſoothe his aching head; I will ſmooth his thorny pillow; and, in every circumſtance, in ſickneſs and in health, I will continue that faithful Fanny, whom he hath ſo often ſworn never to forſake, and whom, in the fulneſs of his heart, he hath called Heaven to witneſs, he would ever prefer to all created beings.</p>
                           <p>Perhaps he can no more command the ſums which I have yielded into his hands—be it ſo, they were mine, I made them his, and he had a right to diſpoſe of them—Nay, I think I had rather find him deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; for ſuch a ſituation will acquit him of that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, with which he is otherwiſe chargeable on account of his late neglects. What are pecuniary emoluments, compared to that real felicity, which is to be derived from a mutual, a faithful, and an unbroken attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I have made the experiment, and I can confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently pronounce it in truth a fact—<hi>that we want but little here below.</hi> Let him know, Madam, that I will draw the impenetrable veil of ſilence over the paſt; that we will commence anew the voyage of life; and that if he will at length be juſt, his returning kindneſs, by invigorating once more this poor, this enervated frame, will reſtore alacrity to my efforts; and that I am, in that caſe, poſitive, our combined exertions will procure for ourſelves, and our little ones, the <hi>neceſſaries of life.</hi>

It is for my children I am thus importunate; were it not for their dear ſakes, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my ſufferings ſhould never interrupt the felicity of Miſs Melworth. No, believe me, no—but I would ſeek ſome turfed pillow, whereon to reſt my weary head; and, cloſing forever theſe humid lids, I would

haſte to repoſe me in that vault, which entombs the remains of my revered parents, and where only, I can rationally expect to meet the tranquillity for which I ſigh. Innocent little ſufferers!—obſerve them, deareſt lady; to you their hands are uplifted—Courtland's features are imaged in their faces, and they plead the cauſe of equity.</p>

                     <p>Old Mr. Wellwood had been one of the firſt of my friends; and from his countenance and advice, on my ſetting out in life, I had derived material advantages.

I was fearful ſhe was ill adviſed, but from the idea I had entertained of her diſcretion, I had not the leaſt ſuſpicion of the truth.

                           <p>Mr. Courtland, though not at preſent our viſitor, is ſtill a reſident in this neighbourhood; and my father bids me aſſure you, that every rational ſtep ſhall be taken, which can be ſuppoſed to have the remoteſt tendency toward the reſtoration of your peace. He himſelf will undertake your cauſe; and as his plans are always the reſult of wiſdom and penetration, he is not ſeldom gratified by the accompliſhment of his wiſhes. He will ſeek Mr. Courtland; he will aſſail him by thoſe invincible arguments, with which equity, reaſon and nature will furniſh him; and ſhould he ſtill remain obdurate, my dear and commiſerating father will, nevertheleſs, aid you by his counſel, and continue

unto you his protection; he will aſſiſt you in educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your young people, and in diſpoſing of them in a manner, which will render them <hi>uſeful members of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety:</hi> In ſhort, no efforts which benevolence can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, will be wanting, to alleviate your misfortunes. Cheer up then, lovely mourner; the orphan's friend is ours: I predict that the ſmile of tranquillity will again illumine your grief-worn countenance; and ſhould I yet have to raiſe to you the voice of felicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>good, in that event, will be educed from evil,</hi> and I ſhall then ceaſe to regret a circumſtance, which at preſent, as often as it is remembered, tinges my cheek with the bluſh of confuſion. Were it neceſſary, I would add, that no means ſhall be left unaſſayed, which may be within the reach of, dear Madam, your truly commiſerating, and ſincere well-wiſher,</p>

                     <p>TAKING it for granted, that the candid reader will allow for the partiality of a young creature, <hi>whoſe high ſenſe of common benefits,</hi> and whoſe gratitude had rendered her almoſt an enthuſiaſt,—I intrude no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereon. Margaretta's letter ſoon produced Miſs Wellwood in our family; and upon the morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her arrival, I ſat off in purſuit of Mr. Courtland. My moſt direct courſe brought me to rap at the door of his lodgings, and as I was rather early, I made myſelf ſure of finding him within. My aſtoniſhment, however, was not equal to my regret, when I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by his landlady, that a writ of attachment, being the evening before ſerved upon him, at the ſuit of Mr.—, and he not being able to procure ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he was then lodged in the county jail. I heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated not in regard to the meaſures which were beſt to be taken; a few moments produced me in that abode of the miſerable; and I found little difficulty in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an interview with the priſoner.</p>
                     <p>Courtland—never ſhall I forget his appearance—all thoſe airs of importance, which had marked his innate conſciouſneſs of ſuperiority, were whelmed in the ſtorm
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:034162_0121_0FFC62D0CE531570"/>
of adverſity, that had at length burſt upon him. His haggard looks proclaimed, that ſleep, in her accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed manner, had forſaken his dreary abode; his dreſs was neglected; his hair in diſordered ringlets hung upon his ſhoulders: In ſhort, ſcarce a veſtige of the finiſhed gentleman remained; and his folded arms and vacant countenance, as I beheld him unobſerved, were almoſt deſcriptive of inſanity: But the jailer announcing my name, his agonized and unaffected diſcompoſure commanded my utmoſt commiſeration; an expreſſion indicative of mingling confuſion, ſurpriſe and apprehenſion, inſtantly ſuffuſed his cheek; and, with extreme perturbation, he exclaimed, <q>Good God! Mr. Vigillius—this is too much—but, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, Sir, <hi>the uniformity of your character</hi> will not permit a continuance of the idea, that you are come hither either to reproach or inſult me.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"To inſult you, Mr. Courtland! God forbid. I come hither rather the petitioner of your favour; and it is a truth, that I at this moment feel in regard to you, all the father predominating in my boſom; but, having matter for your private ear, I muſt beg the indulgence of this gentleman for a few moments."</p>
                     <p>The humane keeper withdrew with much civility; and the conſternation of our delinquent was unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, while I proceeded to inform him of the early knowledge I had obtained of the commencement and progreſs of his career; of my information in regard to the ruined ſtate of his affairs; and of my actual cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with his principal creditors. "I have opened my buſineſs, Sir," I added, "by this exordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, on purpoſe to let you know how well qualified I am to ſerve you; and however you may have ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while I have thus taken it upon me to probe your wounds, I flatter myſelf you may be induced to bleſs the hand, which is furniſhed alſo with a ſpecific.

negociation with the different claimants upon Mr. Courtland. New-Haven furniſhed me with many auxiliaries; it was ſufficient to produce the daughter of Mr. Wellwood, to command, in her favour, the moſt energetic efforts: We ſpeedily obtained a very advantageous compromiſe; our debtor was, by the joint aſſiſtance of many reſpectable characters, ſet up in buſineſs; and the deficiencies of nature and education, which we have noted in him, were abundantly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>by the abilities, application, and economical arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of</hi> Mrs. Courtland.

                     <p>I AM ſometimes wonderfully amuſed by the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous comments upon theſe my lucubrations, which in the courſe of my peregrinations are frequently pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into my ear. It muſt be confeſſed, that as I jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from place to place, I am ſufficiently ſolicitous to collect the ſentiments of my readers; and that although I am often ſubjected to extreme mortification in this my anxious purſuit, yet I have, upon ſome occaſions, inhaled, from the voice of the genuine critic, the fine effluvia of well-judged praiſe.</p>
                     <p>But during a late tour, which I made to a diſtant metropolis, I was not ſo fortunate as to obſerve that my laurel crown was much indebted to the brighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand of fame; for although I then breathed the natal air of the Maſſachuſetts Magazine, yet I found that upon the ear of <hi>the many,</hi> even the name of the Gleaner had never vibrated; and that a conſiderable
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:034162_0124_0FFC62C763C26370"/>
majority of thoſe whoſe attention he had engaged, ſeemed more occupied in detecting the <hi>real author,</hi> than in eſſaying to inveſtigate the merit of his productions! An old lady, (taking off her ſpectacles, and laying down her knitting-work) informed me ſhe had been credibly aſſured, that the Gleaner had in fact never been married; that he was a young man, a dweller in Worceſter, and that he never having had a <hi>bit of a wiſe,</hi> it was impoſſible to tell what to believe.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>facetious divine,</hi> ſitting by, gravely replied, "Well, if the ſcoundrel has impoſed upon the public by a fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious tale, he ought ſurely to be toſſed in a blanket; and I, for my part, am willing to lend any aſſiſtance in my power, to deliver a delinquent, ſo atrocious, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign puniſhment."</p>
                     <p>A ſober young woman next joined in the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proceeding with great ſolemnity to give in her evidence: She ſaid ſhe had but juſt returned from New-Haven; that ſhe happened to be there when the ſtory of Miſs Wellwood came out; and that ſhe was, by unqueſtionable authority, poſitively aſſured they had never heard the name of Margaretta Melworth, until they ſaw it in the Magazine; that the Wellwoods, the Courtlands, and even the Worthingtons, (as deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Gleaner) were wholly unknown in that city.</p>
                     <p>"Pſhaw, pſhaw, young woman," ſaid a pedant, who had eyed the fair ſpeaker with an air of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious contempt, "you know nothing of the matter; but ignorance is always forth putting. I tell you that I had the honour of receiving my education at Yale College; I was there at the very period, on which the Gleaner repreſents his Margaretta as having paſſed ſome time in the city of New-Haven, and I more than once ſaw that young lady at church, and in ſeveral private families; it is true that being then but a you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

A teſtimony ſo deciſive, could not be controverted; the old lady reſumed her knitting, and an air of general complacency took place.</p>
                     <p>

I cannot help regarding this <hi>hunting after names,</hi> as deſcriptive of the frivolity of the human mind: No ſooner does an anonymous piece make its appearance, than curioſity inveſts itſelf in the ſtole of ſagacity, conjecture is upon the rack—Who is he? Where does he live? What is his <hi>real name,</hi> and occupation? And to the importance of theſe queſtions, conſiderations of real weight give place; as if the being able to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a name was replete with information of the moſt ſalutary kind. Whereas, if the writing is in no ſort perſonal, and cannot be conſtrued into a libel, a knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the author can be of no moment, neither can a name deſignate a character. <hi>Facts, real events,</hi> have often been communicated to the world <hi>under feigned names;</hi> and inſtruction not ſeldom arrays itſelf in the decent and alluring veil of allegory.</p>
                     <p>The buſineſs of the reader is to ſcan the <hi>intrinſic value</hi> and <hi>general tendency</hi> of the compoſition; if that is conſiderable, if that is laudable, he ought to leave the author to announce himſelf under what auſpices he ſhall judge proper.</p>
                     <p>Paſſing from theſe <hi>name-hunters,</hi> I joined a ſelect tea party, when I had an opportunity of hearing the work itſelf very freely deſcanted upon; and while I was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the uncandid and ſatirical diſquiſition which I underwent, I was proportionably elated at obſerving that my daughter was as much a favourite in the world at large, as in the village in which ſhe hath been educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In Margaretta every one appeared intereſted; and, however queſtionable the merit of the Gleaner was deemed, Miſs Melworth obtained her full ſhare of applauſe. A damſel, verging upon thirty, the height of whoſe feathers was enormous, pronounced the poet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Gleaner <hi>pitiful;</hi> declared his eſſays in general much <hi>below a mediocrity;</hi> and ſhe added, that in her opinion they depreciated as rapidly as the paper cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of inſolvent memory; that his laſt numbers were <hi>monſtrouſly</hi> unnatural; that the library ſcene in partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular was quite <hi>outree,</hi> ſince it was impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of a man ſo <hi>truly polite,</hi> thus paſſionate; that her

friend Mrs. G—condemned thoſe writings altogeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that Mrs. G—having <hi>travelled, and ſeen the world, muſt undoubtedly be acknowledged a competent judge.</hi> Yet ſhe allowed Margaretta to be a decent young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and ſhe doubted not if ſhe had been left entirely to herſelf, ſhe would have generouſly choſen the <hi>man of her heart,</hi> whatever might have been the embarraſſments in which his <hi>juvenile errors</hi> might have involved him.</p>
                     <p>"<hi>Juvenile errors!</hi>" repeated a female who ſat next her. "Is it poſſible, Madam, that you can beſtow an epithet ſo gentle upon crimes of ſo deep a die? O! that our ſex were conſcious of their true dignity; <hi>that they were juſt to themſelves;</hi> then ſhould we no longer behold the unprincipled betrayer obtaining the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of virtue; then would the deſpoiler, baniſhed from ſociety, be neceſſitated to preſs forward to the path of rectitude, and a uniform purſuit of goodneſs becoming the price of his reſtoration to the privileges and immunities of a ſocial being, he would be compell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to array himſelf in the garments of conſiſtent equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For my own part," continued the fair rationaliſt, "I am free to own, however ſingular it may be deemed, that unblemiſhed virtue is, in my eſtimation, as eſſential in a man, as in a woman; and that as <hi>man is commonly the primary aggreſſor,</hi> I regard a <hi>male proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> with even greater deteſtation than I do an aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned female. I profeſs myſelf an admirer of the Gleaner. I conceive him to be a moral writer; and I muſt own that far from thinking the library ſcene <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,</hi> I have conceived it inimitably drawn. <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is repreſented from the beginning as a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſuperficial; that ſhallow waters are not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom noiſy, is a common obſervation; and it is as true that in ſilent majeſty the great profound may ſtand collected. Mr. Vigillius, with infinite addreſs, had wrought up to the higheſt pitch, the ſanguine expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his man; he is in fancy placed upon an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence at which he had long aimed; and having, as he ſuppoſed, at length obtained the enviable ſummit of his wiſhes, he is ſuddenly daſhed therefrom.</p>

"Is it then ſurpriſing to find him off his guard, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when it is remembered, that his reaſons for keeping meaſures with the Gleaner were no longer in force? Viewing the matter in this light, I confeſs, it appears to me rather extraordinary, that his paſſions diſcovered <hi>no greater exceſs.</hi> But, be this as it may, I declare to you, that Margaretta captivates my very ſoul; that the virtues attributed to Hamilton ſtrike me moſt pleaſingly: I am charmed with the open in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>"What in the name of ingenuity," interrupted the lady who was filling tea, "<hi>has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The lovely ſentimentaliſts here adverted to, will rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ollect a converſation ſo recent; and, from the throng which upon that occaſion crowded the levee of Mrs.—, they may poſſibly recognize the Gleaner; but even in this caſe, I feel pleaſingly aſſured, that in the boſom of candour, diſcretion and good-nature, <hi>my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret is perfectly ſafe,</hi> while I am confident, that by <hi>the many I ſhall remain untraced.</hi> My amiable panegyriſts were unconſcious that they delivered their ſentiments in the preſence of an <hi>intereſted man, who hung upon their lips, engraving their words in characters indelible upon the tablets of his breaſt;</hi> yet, as I am happy in an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of rendering to ſuperior merit the tribute of

                     <p>It happened that Mr. Hamilton returned home up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very evening which witneſſed the nuptials of Mr. Courtland and Miſs Wellwood. Being ignorant of his route, it had not been in our power to follow him by letter; and he was conſequently unacquainted with every thing that had paſſed in our village, during his abſence. This plan he had purpoſely concerted, with an expectation of baniſhing from his boſom thoſe tender ſentiments of Margaretta, which were inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with his peace; and fondly imagining that he had effectuated his wiſhes, he alighted at the lodgings of Serafina, whither he firſt repaired, in tolerable tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; but, on inquiring for Miſs Clifford, being rather abruptly informed by her maid, that her young lady paſſed that evening in the family of Mr. Vigillius, in order to aſſiſt at the marriage of Mr. Courtland, he diſcovered, in a ſingle moment, the cruel fallacy of thoſe hopes he had ſo confidently cheriſhed. He was unacquainted with the exiſtence and even the name of Miſs Wellwood: It was Courtland's wedding night; he could think of no one but Margaretta; a thouſand varying ideas ruſhed inſtantaneouſly upon his mind; all his purpoſes were broken; and he ſaw that, ſo far from accompliſhing the laudable end which he had propoſed, by tearing himſelf from the beloved object, he had too probably accelerated his own ruin.</p>
                     <p>In ſpeechleſs agony he claſped his hands, and raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fine eyes to Heaven, he haſtily withdrew to the retirement of his own chamber, where, ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſon, fortitude and religion to his aid, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to rally his ſcattered forces, to recollect

thoſe reſources which, in proſpect, had appeared ſo pregnant with conſolation; and, upon this occaſion, preſſing into his ſervice every <hi>balancing</hi> auxiliary, in a manner becoming the mind conſcious of its divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igin, of its tranſitory abode in tabernacles of clay, and of its beatified and immortal deſtination—in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner honorary to philoſophy, and honorary to manhood, he ſought to make head againſt thoſe paſſions which were ravaging all before them, and which were ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to precipitate him into the abyſs of deſpair! What progreſs he would have made in this conflict, and on which ſide victory would have declared, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to determine; for after the combat had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, with various ſucceſs, from twilight grey, until the ſober hour of twelve, the whole phalanx of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was thrown into diſorder, by the following little harmleſs ſcrip of paper, received from the hand of Serafina; true, it bore on its milk-white ſurface cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>caballiſtic</hi> inſcriptions, which ſeemed endowed with magic influence; and Hamilton read with no leſs ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour than it was penned, the language of friendſhip.</p>

                     <p>IT is ſcarcely neceſſary to add, that Edward imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately obeyed this flattering ſummons: He was at a loſs what to conceive, and he was ready to hope

for impoſſibilities; but a ſhort interval preſenting him before the companion of his youth, he had little time for conjecture; and the propitious explanation was no ſooner given, than, abſorbed in a delirium of joy, he loſt ſight of every ill, and pronounced himſelf wholly invulnerable, altogether ſuperior to the ſhafts of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>The enſuing morning produced him, the image of rationally complacent happineſs, in our bridal circle. He attended Miſs Clifford; Mary and myſelf were addreſſed by him with pleaſing reſpect; and while he bowed upon the hand of Margaretta, his eye beamed unutterable tenderneſs; a refined and animated kind of affection, and a glow of ineffable ſatisfaction, ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every expreſſive feature, mantled upon his cheek, and ſeemed to inveſt him with ſupernatural graces: In ſhort, the fine manly open countenance evidently aſſumed a celeſtial contour, and the charming youth was never before ſo completely captivating.</p>
                     <p>In the beautiful face of Margaretta, mingling ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and pleaſure were agreeably blended; a bluſh of ſenſibility pervaded her cheek; and an attachment, which I dare believe will be laſting as her life, gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enliſted every faculty of her ſoul; an attachment, raiſed upon the ſuperſtructure of eſteem, entwining a full growth of amity, and finally attaining the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary wreath of rationally approved love. Such an attachment was alone worthy the boſom of Miſs Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth; and I had the happineſs to obſerve, that her meliorated paſſions, rectified and confirmed, at length pointed to the centre of true and chaſtiſed felicity.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner was ſhe aſſured of the continued, and even augmented tenderneſs, and of the confiding friendſhip of her Edward, than ſhe yielded up her whole heart, without heſitation, to the ſweetly faſcinating impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Sanctioned by duty, authorized by reaſon, and borne forward upon the feathery ſails of white-boſomed hope, ſhe did not ſee that ſhe ought to bluſh at avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe ſentiments of preference, which her youthful heart acknowledged; and they were, in truth, as pure
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:034162_0131_0FFC62B6C6A6C240"/>
as thoſe which are impreſſed upon ſeraphic boſoms, amid the paradiſe of their God.</p>
                     <p>During the period which preceded her marriage, ſhe gave and received many viſits to and from Miſs Worthington. She made many little tours round the country; and, poſſeſſing a ſtrikingly commanding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior, with manners ſo truly pleaſing, ſhe was, of courſe, followed by a train of admirers. Courtlands, Bellamours and Plodders, of every deſcription, crowded about her; and, aſſailed on every ſide by the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly enervating and empoiſoned airs of adulation, the uniformity of her character was put to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt teſt.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Melworth, however, was fully equal to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deal which was thus prepared for her; and ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to receive her admirers of every deſcription, in a manner which was truly worthy of approbation. The impaſſioned feelings of the devoted heart, never contributed, in the ſmalleſt degree, to her amuſement: She had not to charge herſelf with inflicting a ſingle moment's unneceſſary pain; and no ſooner did the ſerious pretender advance his claim, then his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of love, though received with grateful reſpect, were deciſively rejected. Obligations for every hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orary teſtimony, ſhe was free to acknowledge; but ſhe was not ambitious to enliſt a train of danglers. Her heart, tremblingly alive to the merits of Hamilton, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the nature of their connexion was not publickly known, was ready, almoſt indignantly, to reſent the officious competition of thoſe, whom her delicacy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her to conſider as intruders. But reaſon, true to its office, corrected the fervid ebullitions of paſſion, and always brought her back to that tranquillity of mind, ſo neceſſary to the full exerciſe of her fine tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. Obſervation, experience, reaſon and judgment, theſe all combined to confirm her in the election ſhe had made; and, on the boſom of ſerenity, her hours rolled on.</p>
                     <p>Both the mental and exterior accompliſhments of our children were ſtill improving; their mutual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:034162_0132_0FFC62B53A8AB5A8"/>
ſeemed daily to augment, and the proſpect ſtill brightened upon us. We often addreſſed them upon the importance of the vows they were deſtined to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, repreſenting, with all the energy which language could command, the neceſſity of a permanent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abating affection, to render ſilken the bands of wedlock.</p>
                     <p>Expect not, we exclaimed, a continuance of thoſe vernal zephyrs, which will fan the genial flame of your early loves: It is true you may embark upon a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's ſea, but the unavoidable evils, the viciſſitudes, and too probably the ſtorms of life, will ariſe—rocks and quickſands await the voyager, and eagle-eyed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion ought to ſet at helm, if you would paſs ſafely between extremes, which may be regarded as equally dangerous!

                     <p>Thus rolled on the weeks, months, and years, until revolving time produced the promiſed era: It took place in the laſt vernal ſeaſon, when the humid ſteps of April were on the point of reſigning their tear gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med empire to the bland and flowery feet of the wreath crowned and odour breathing month of May. Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta had then juſt rounded her nineteenth year; and, much ſooner than would have been our <hi>uninfluenced wiſh,</hi> we reſigned our lovely charge into the hands of him, who had long been the deliberate choice of her heart.</p>

                     <p>We were not ſolicitous to collect a throng about us upon that auſpicious day. With happineſs innate in our boſoms, the <hi>pomp</hi> and <hi>parade</hi> of <hi>joy</hi> we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſpare: and our circle conſiſted only of thoſe, whoſe faces we ſhould have contemplated with pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure upon every riſing morn and ſetting ſun.</p>

But though only a ſelect party were ſummoned to partake our felicity, and to gild, by their preſence, our bridal day, yet we were ambitious of diffuſing the face of gladneſs over our village; and we therefore appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated the ſums which we might have expended in the flowing goblet, and at the feſtal board, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring nuptial preſents for thoſe who mourned beneath the iron ſway of penury, and who, by this well-timed relief, felt their hearts once more attuned to the genial voice of pleaſure; who halted to entwine for us the wreath of gratitude, the perfume of which was as the ſweeteſt incenſe to our ſouls; and who, bending at the footſtool of paternal Deity, ſupplicated Heaven to confer upon us the choiceſt bleſſings.</p>
                     <p>The bride appeared among us arrayed in ſpotleſs white; her robe was a delicate muſlin, drawn in many a flower, from the rich variety of her elegant fancy, and neatly wrought by her own fair hands. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the approach of her wedding day, unconſcious of thoſe terrors attributed to her ſex. Upon the evening preceding the appointed morning, ſhe entertained us, at our firſt requeſt, with many of our favourite airs, upon her piano forte. I did not perceive her heart flying through her bodice! and her tremors being of the governable kind, ſhe was all her own agreeable ſelf. What paſſed between her and her mother, with whom ſhe retired for a few hours, I am yet to learn; but this I know, that the day itſelf was not uſhered in either by fits, or any violently agonized emotions. Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin delicacy only ſerved to animate, to heighten, and to new point the exquiſite beauties which adorn the fineſt face I have ever ſeen; and ſhe accompanied us to the altar, where the ceremony was performed, with a ſober and chaſtiſed expreſſion of complacency, which ſeemed to ſay—<hi>I have taken ſufficient time to deliberate—I am under the direction of my beſt friends</hi>—every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, every paſſion of my ſoul approves the man who is this day to become my huſband. Undoubtedly he is every way worthy; I poſſeſs his tender and entire affection—his entire confidence. I am aſſured, I am ſatisfied; I am happy.</p>

For Hamilton, the unbounded rapture which took poſſeſſion of his boſom, was blended, however, with a dignified and manly manifeſtation of tenderneſs, which ſerved to tranquillize his deportment, and to preſent him in a ſtate of mind becoming the ſacred rites which were to be performed: Yet, when he received the hand of Margaretta, the big emotions of his boſom refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be wholly ſuppreſſed—"Condeſcending excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence!" he exclaimed "may He, who thus enriches me, render me worthy of ſo much goodneſs." The cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, excepting this interruption, paſſed agreeably to its ſacred arrangement; and, after the good Urbanius had pronounced the benediction, we adjourned to our own manſion; and, ſince, what halcyon days, weeks and months have revolved! Not a cloud has yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured our horizon.</p>
                     <p>Laſt week, Margaretta preſented Edward with her firſt born—it is a male infant. Let me ſee—elev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en months of uninterrupted felicity!! Can this laſt? The preſent is a checkered ſtate.</p>
                     <p>Reader, though we bid adieu to Margaretta for the preſent, I would not have thee lament it too ſeriouſly.

the ſtroke is exceeding heavy; the calamity is inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable; it is almoſt unparalleled; every image in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is replete with horror, is ſummoned to <hi>ſhadow</hi> forth the mighty grief; every lyre is attuned, and every minſtrel is ready to fling to the widely-ech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oing fame-breathing gale the iterated, pity-moving, and long reſounding plaints of woe.</p>
                     <p>For the ſoft endearments of their infant progeny, the opening bud of reaſon, which was ſo fondly marked, the intereſting prattle of childhood, the big emotions which ſwelled the parental boſom, as they beheld the forming virtues cluſtering in the progreſſive mind; for the expanſive joy they experienced, while they wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the rapid advancement to an honorary maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for the rich completion of felicity which crowned their wiſhes, when they beheld their ſatisfactory and comfortable eſtabliſhment; for the marked and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acts of duty, they have continued to receive; for for all theſe various ſcenes of heartfelt good, which for a ſeries of years have been ſo richly enjoyed—they are enumerated, it is true, but not as a balance for the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent evil; far from it—they only ſerve to point the poignancy of the diſtreſsful era, and to ſwell the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of ſuch unheard of miſery.</p>
                     <p>Yet it is a fact, that the removal of theſe objects of complacency will ſlope their paſſage to that grave in which the good old man and woman muſt lay down; and a reunion with their children, in future worlds, they confidently expect.</p>
                     <p>Is it poſſible that he who thus tacitly or indirectly arraigns the deſignations elanced upon this globe, can believe in the ſuperintendence of an all-wiſe, all-gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, all-powerful and paternal God? Certainly he does. <hi>Thou, Lord, haſt done this,</hi> is a common expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and yet, ſtrange to tell, he is conſtantly found thus cavilling at the diſpoſitions of the Almighty!</p>
                     <p>Surely it ought to be remembered, that we ſee but a part of the immeaſurable whole; that he who formed the ſpirit, can give it, in a ſingle luxuriant moment, fully to partake an ample compenſation for years of ſuffering.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="140" facs="unknown:034162_0139_0FFC62A401FBD3E8"/>
Thoſe families which are yielded to the hard allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of penurious fortune, experience the moſt lively ſatisfaction, as often as the flowery feet of bland and genial charity viſit their abodes; they have reſources unknown to the affluent; and highly reliſhed is that refection, however homely it may in reality be, which is ſerved up with the ſauce of hunger.</p>
                     <p>Exquiſite is the moment of eaſe to the tortured frame; ineffable are the ſenſations it partakes; and it is well purchaſed by the previous ſufferings which are its price. Thoſe who have laid their children or other friends in the grave, have perhaps enjoyed them <hi>long,</hi> or <hi>much; "they are not loſt, but gone before,</hi>" and in another, and better ſtate of exiſtence, they ſhall receive them again. I ſay, then, it is more becoming to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to mitigate the ills of life, than by the routine of complaints to be impiouſly murmuring againſt the decrees of Heaven, which muſt indiſputably reſult from a righteous and perfectly conſiſtent arrangement; and I aver, that it is a falſe calculation which makes the <hi>ſum total of human evils more than that balance,</hi> which, upon a fair and open eſtimation, would appear at the foot of a regular and well digeſted account, of thoſe pleaſurable or peaceful moments, which are the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mortality.</p>
                     <p>But to ſuch a pitch of infatuated abſurdity has a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of the calamities incident to the preſent ſtate arrived, that we are abſolutely enjoined to hold lightly the moſt virtuous enjoyments, to be conſtantly looking for an evil day, and to tremble when we have attained to the ſummit of our wiſhes! What would be the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of that father whom his child ſhould thus addreſs: "I will forbear to take pleaſure in the portion with which you have endowed me. I am momently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the exertions of your power againſt me. I know that the rod of correction is lifted up, and that you mean to chaſtiſe me. I expect <hi>evil and not good</hi> from your hands; and though you have at preſent gratified me, by putting me in poſſeſſion of the inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for which I have ſighed, yet, as I am confident
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:034162_0140_0FFC62A1A11982C0"/>
you mean ſpeedily to reſume it, I cannot conſider it as my own. I am fearful of beholding it in an eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble point of view; and, knowing you as I do, I ſhrink from the approaches of that tranquil complacency, which would pervade my boſom!!"</p>
                     <p>I would rather ſay, that as I poſſeſs much, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy much; the <hi>virtuous pleaſures</hi> of my ſoul ſhall not meet a barrier; freely I will expatiate, nor will I know a boundary, ſave what rectitude ſhall throw around me; the preſent moment is replete with bleſſings, and though the next may intercept ſome pleaſing view, yet, it is the hand of a Father which will be ſtretched out, and my ultimate felicity will conſequently be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted.</p>
                     <p>It is well that the Creator, enthroned in majeſty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, is beyond the capability of adopting that mode of conduct, to which repeated provocations would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate the lapſed nature; it is well that his ways are not like our ways; it is well that he regardeth with a ſteady eye the creature which he hath made, and that neither the caprices nor the inquietudes of the children of men, can bend the determined purpoſes of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing plans.</p>
                     <p>I have been ſhocked when I have heard the reaſon for conſolation, which is ſometimes offered to the child of ſorrow.—"You have ſuffered much," exclaims the commiſerating friend, "many are the ills which you have been called to encounter, and doubtleſs the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of retribution, winged by hours and days of ſmiling tranquillity, is at hand." Ah! is it then true that we can challenge the Sire of men and angels, as our debtor! moſt irreverent and impious idea! Surely if our calculations were more accurate, and if we were under the influence of gratitude to the Supreme Being, the genuine breathings of our ſpirits would be—In every calamity I have been upheld, and often have I partook the enjoyments of life. Was I aſcertained that the coming hour would ſtrike me from exiſtence, would utterly annihilate the creature, who hath thus long lived, moved, and been endowed with the powers
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:034162_0141_0FFC629E8F9F7F18"/>
of reflection, I ſhould, notwithſtanding, have no claims to make upon Him who hath called me into being. It is true, I have experienced my moments of ſorrow; but they have been abundantly compenſated by innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable felicities, by pleaſures ſcarcely marked, and by gratifications now perhaps forgotten. Witneſs thoſe indulged and rapture crowned months, when I was cradled by maternal tenderneſs, and ſoothed by every blandiſhment, which generally ſhapes and ſtrews with flowers the path of the young adventurer; witneſs all thoſe endearments, thoſe incentives to virtue, and thoſe wife inſtructions, which cheriſhed, which formed, and which brought forward my youth; witneſs every aid and protection I have from time to time received; witneſs the pleaſing circle of friends, which ſo frequently cluſter round me, while my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies find it convenient to ſtand aloof; witneſs thoſe expanſive hopes, which have continued to illume my days, and to fan with genial influence the feathery hours; witneſs the months of peace and eaſe which have been mine—how large their number, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to thoſe upon which I have been called to ſubmit to the <hi>ſevere paroxiſms of pain;</hi> witneſs the many nights I have paſſed in the moſt ſalutary and reſtoring ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.—But, having now by me, a volume of eſſays, that may, in ſome future period, be brought forward, in one of which I have expatiated upon this theme, I forbear to repeat myſelf.</p>
                     <p>And here let us pauſe for a moment. A ſucceeding number may take the ſubject up in a different view, or at leaſt illuſtrate the beauty and propriety of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the moſt lively ſentiments of gratitude to the divine Author of every good.</p>

                     <p>IT is beyond a doubt, that much depends upon our efforts to cultivate an equal and acquieſcent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of the paſſions. We are certainly too prone to be unmindful of benefits, and to ſwell, with cenſurable ingenuity, even to a gigantic ſtature, the ills of life.</p>
                     <p>The jaundiced eye will create the hue that does not in fact exiſt; ſources of tormenting anxiety, to the murmuring and ungrateful man, will grow thick upon every bough, while a mind habituated to a retroſpect of its privileges and exemptions, will gather, from the ſame tree, fruits of the moſt meliorated and delicious flavour. I can hardly conceive of an affliction ſo complicated, as to drive upon the tumultuous waves of deſpair, the ſpirit upon which fortitude hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed its image.</p>
                     <p>The firmly virtuous man will induſtriouſly ſeek the means of conſolation; when ſtripped of all elſe, he will float buoyant upon the ſtrong plank of reſolution; he will revert to the good which is paſt; he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the fluctuating ſcenes of the preſent ſtate; he will recollect the character of the Sovereign Diſpoſer of events; and he will poſſeſs light ſufficient to ſhape his weather-beaten prop, even upon the trackleſs deep. But how often are theſe proper and dignified exertions reverſed! The mind which is debilitated by enervat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purſuits and irrational hopes, which hath formed
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:034162_0143_0FFC6299E8E803F0"/>
the moſt elevated eſtimation of <hi>its own deſerts,</hi> and which hath conſequently plumed its expectation to the higheſt pitch; ſuch a mind, even in the midſt of the moſt happy arrangement, finds itſelf a prey to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and diſguſt; though ſurrounded by almoſt every enjoyment, its feelings are palled, and it experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences all the diſagreeables of ſatiety; a ſtranger to moderation, and unbleſt by contentment, although marked by ſucceſs, and crowned by the completion of many hopes, it is, nevertheleſs, languiſhing under the domination of murmuring inquietude; often it accuſes its God of injuſtice; and it is frequently found exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—"If I am not, in future worlds, to be rewarded for my ſufferings in this, it would have been better I had never known a being!"</p>
                     <p>We do injuſtice to ourſelves, when we ſupinely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that all this is wholly conſtitutional; that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends merely upon the mechaniſm of the mind; and that perſons are born with a yielding, equal, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſpoſition, or with a refractory, peeviſh, ungrateful, and gloomy temper of ſoul: This general aſſertion may be convenient for the indolent; but thoſe who aſſiduouſly cultivate the virtues, and endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate the offending propenſities, which together grow in the ſoil of their own boſoms, while they allow ſomething to nature, will alſo acknowledge, that much depends upon the unwearied and uniform exertions, which it is certainly incumbent upon every child of mortality to make.</p>
                     <p>If the phyſiognomiſt juſtly delineated the mind of Socrates, as that incomparable philoſopher aſſures us he did, we are thus furniſhed with an illuſtrious proof of the ineſtimable acquirements which depend upon, and are produced by, the adminiſtration of reaſon. In truth, there is a ſweet pliability in the mind of man, which can familiarize it even with ſorrow; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating and acquieſcent, cuſtom habituates and almoſt reconciles us to grief; we bend beneath the burſting ſtorm; and though, with the elegant and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely ſuſceptible Philenia, we may "<hi>fling the lorn

pathos to the paſſing gale,</hi>" yet, becoming experimentally acquainted with the <hi>charms</hi> of <hi>melancholy,</hi> we ſhall not fail, with that beautiful and plaintive mourner, to gem our ſorrows with a brightening tear.</p>
                     <p>A friend of mine was once in poſſeſſion of affluence, ſurrounded by friends; he ſeemed the favourite of fortune; and it was ſuppoſed, that the means of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing his utmoſt wiſhes reſted wholly with himſelf; yet vexatious inquietude ſeemed the motto of his life; and a prey to chagrin, amid his ample endowments, he hardly ever taſted the felicity of a tranquil mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! But my friend, by various accidents, was reduced to a ſtate of penury; and I have, in that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, heard him declare without the ſmalleſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of affectation, even when the laſt morſel he could command was produced upon his ſcanty board, that he felt contented and grateful, experiencing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence in the allotments of Providence, and thoſe agreeable anticipations of futurity, to which he had been a ſtranger, in thoſe days which had been regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the epoch of his proſperity.</p>
                     <p>In fact, it is amid the clouds which adverſity throws around the child of mortality, that the efforts of the mind are called forth, and that all the energetic pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſoul are formed to action; and it is alſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragably true, that heart-felt enjoyments depend al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together upon the cultivation of a philanthropic ſpirit, upon cheriſhing ſentiments of general complacency in the economy of Deity, in ourſelves and others, and in thus embodying (if I may ſo expreſs myſelf) the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the mind.</p>
                     <p>I have at this moment my eye upon two gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whom I have perſonally known almoſt from their infancy; they are the ſons of one man and woman; their education was the ſame; their hopes and fears were ſimilar; and they commenced the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer of buſineſs with like eſtabliſhments, like advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and like expectations.</p>
                     <p>Early in life they were both united to deſerving females, to females apparently of their choice; and
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:034162_0145_0FFC6294DABBDB58"/>
they were thus furniſhed with every incitement to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous perſeverance; while the avenues to rational en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment were thrown open before them, and the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of their days ſeemed inſured.</p>
                     <p>For ſome time, fortune, liberal of her favours, acted the part of an impartial parent, diſtributing her emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uments with an equal hand; but her various diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at length predominating, the ſimilitude of her operations was no more.</p>
                     <p>Placidius, the eldeſt of thoſe gentlemen, experienced her frowns; the tide of ſucceſs began to turn; miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes ſucceeded each other; and without the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow of a reaſon, upon which to ground the ſmalleſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of his integrity, or a ſingle circumſtance, upon which even malevolence could call in queſtion his abilities, he beheld his affairs irretrievably embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed, his beſt laid plans fruſtrated, and himſelf advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing rapidly to that ſtate of inſolvency, which his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſoul, glowing with a juſt and high ſenſe of prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, deprecated as a moſt aggravated evil. Gradually the means of buſineſs vaniſhed out of his hands; his ſtock in trade was no more; and even the commodious manſion, which with much ingenuity and taſte, though with a proper attention to frugality, he had reared, with the hope that it would ſtill remain in his family, even this habitation became the property of his creditors!</p>
                     <p>Placidius had ever expreſſed a great deſire to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate himſelf in his lineal deſcendants; and this nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural wiſh, might in him be deſignated as his ruling paſſion: but many revolving ſeaſons paſſed, ere Placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius hailed the accompliſhment of his wiſhes in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; and when at laſt, his Matilda preſented him with her firſt born ſon, the chalice of joy which he had but lifted to his lips, was daſhed from his graſp, by the ſudden death of an infant upon whoſe little form the traces of longevity ſeemed inſcribed. For this ſtroke he was wholly unprepared; and, to complete his cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue of evils, his boſom friend, his long loved, and ever eſteemed Matilda—even at a life ſo precious, the king of terrors too ſurely aimed his miſſive ſhafts! the
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:034162_0146_0FFC62927701DD08"/>
icy darts of <hi>indulged ſorrow</hi> found their way to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtream of life, and, congealing the purple flow, the virtuous and accompliſhed Matilda was numbered with the dead.</p>
                     <p>Placidius now felt as a man; his reaſon was the forfeit; and the hour which reſtored this regent to her accuſtomed operations, only gave her to witneſs the melancholy void in a mind which had once been the feat of expectations bland and cheering, and which had been enriched by every white winged hope, which rectitude could authoriſe. Recollection, gloomy recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection returned; dreadful was the contraſt with the <hi>paſt,</hi> which the <hi>preſent</hi> exhibited! Placidius ſhrunk from the view; his health became the ſacrifice, and for many months he ſeemed to languiſh through all the different ſtages of a gradual and unyielding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline. Fortitude, however, was at laſt triumphant; a calm, and rational tranquillity ſucceeded the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding tumults which had agitated his ſoul. The reſtoration of the health of Placidius, was the happy conſequence of this change; and he reflected as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a man, a philoſopher, and a religioniſt.</p>
                     <p>Fortune, too, ſo far relented as to put it in the power of Placidius to reimburſe his creditors; and he was inveſted with the means of procuring for himſelf a competency. It is true the ſplendour of his former proſpects can never be reſtored; but Placidius is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. "I cannot," ſaid he the other day, "regard life as an evil: I ſhould be moſt ungrateful, did I not own, that to me it hath been more fruitful of pleaſure than of pain. It muſt be confeſſed, that for a time I ſunk beneath the agonizing ſtroke; for a time I was wretched! it is true that the blaſting of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous hopes, which I had arrogantly formed for the meridian of my days, rendered me beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion miſerable; but my youth was ſerenely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; <hi>for a great length of time</hi> I enjoyed the moſt pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proſpects; and though I have laid the wife of my boſom in the grave, yet delicious are the tears which I now ſhed to her memory; and in the faireſt pages
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:034162_0147_0FFC628FF4CAF038"/>
of retention, are treaſured up the days, months, and years, during which I partook with her the higheſt ſtate of felicity, which can fall to the lot of mortality, which can be experienced this ſide that paradiſe of the bleſſed, where I ſhall again meet the virtuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, in whoſe faithful boſom I repoſed the fondeſt hopes and wiſhes of which my being was capable; where I ſhall be reunited to a Matilda ever blooming, ever immortal—united too, by ties which will be then indiſſoluble. And though no ſon or daughter will gem my parting moments with a filial tear, yet the family of mankind is wide, the children of my adoption are many—from one ſource we originated, and my boſom feels and owns the great fraternity.</p>
                     <p>For Agetius, the brother of Placidius, we need ſcarce do more than reverſe the picture. In one even tide of proſperity his commercial tranſactions have glided on; or if a trifling loſs hath ſometimes origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a cloud, his ſubſequent gains, by preſenting abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant compenſation, hath ſpeedily diſſipated it: As a merchant he is eſtabliſhed; his trade is lucrative; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year enriches him; he hath lately completed an elegant dwelling; and the amiable and gentle Anna ſtill remains the ſocial partner of his days. His ſon and daughter poſſeſs pleaſing exteriors, and improving minds; he hath educated them agreeably to plans which he deliberately formed, and they will ſoon take rank with the firſt young people of their circle. Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius hath ſtill poſſeſſed an uninterrupted courſe of health; and no perſon can recollect any ſerious miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune which, as an individual, he hath been called to ſuffer—yet Agetius always appears anxious, and even perturbed; <hi>he ſeems fearful leſt you ſhould ſuppoſe him enjoying a ſingle good</hi>—he will not acknowledge a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil moment—"<hi>no one can ſo well ſay where the ſhoe pinches, as him who wears it,</hi>" is an adage frequently in his mouth; and he ſometimes paſſionately declares that he wiſhes he had never been born!</p>
                     <p>I ſaid that I conceived ſuch manifeſtations of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude peculiar to man; and ſurely, as far as we
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:034162_0148_0FFC628DB2F8ACF0"/>
can obſerve, the children of inſtinct fail not to <hi>enjoy</hi> the good which they poſſeſs.</p>
                     <p>In the early days of Placidius and Agetius their minds diſcovered, to common obſervation, no eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial difference. One remark I have however gleaned: Agetius, when a boy, attempted not to reſtrain a haughty, choleric and unreaſonable ambition, which might be common to both; and his little heart ſwelled with indignation, as often as he encountered a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, in any of thoſe advantages, which are calculated to captivate the inexperienced eye. Upon theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, his brother was ever at hand, to preſent the mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of reaſon; and he hath often been heard to ſay—"Turn, my dear Agetius—turn thine eyes to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude below thee, and from thence let thy compariſons be raiſed; aſpire not to ſuch dangerous heights, but learn to eſtimate properly thy own exemptions, thy own privileges, and to cultivate complacency in that happy mediocrity which is allotted thee."</p>
                     <p>Placidius early habituated himſelf to commune with his own heart; he had a ſerious turn, and was fond of uſeful information; he endeavoured to moderate his deſires, and to entwine, <hi>with every arrangement, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of contentment;</hi> he aimed at regulating his paſſions, at obtaining a due ſubordination in the intellectual ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; and his plan was, to reduce every movement of his ſoul, and every action of his life, to the domination of <hi>reaſon, irradiated by genuine religion.</hi>

                     <p>ALTHOUGH I have conceived a very high idea of the ancient and time honoured inſtitution, which is the boaſt of that reſpectable fraternity, the
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:034162_0149_0FFC628B57F675E0"/>
Free and Accepted Maſons; yet, with all due deference to the worſhipful brethren, and with the moſt profound veneration for thoſe occult myſteries, which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained inexplicable to ſo many ages, I take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to confeſs, that I have not been altogether pleaſed with one or two prominent features in this wonderful order. The firſt which I ſhall point out, (which is, I confeſs, the leaſt commanding) is the contracted ſpirit which their <hi>practice</hi> not ſeldom evinces in the <hi>irrational partiality</hi> they diſcover to men of their own deſcription; whereas, if the advantages of a brother are as great as is inſinuated, an <hi>unworthy maſon</hi> ſhould take rank in the loweſt grade of mankind.</p>
                     <p>I know that maſons make very pompous profeſſions of philanthropy, and that the broad expanſive glow, the ties which bind the univerſal brotherhood, is full often the theme of their lectures. "Upon the unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able region of nature," ſay they "our moſt ancient and honourable fraternity is eſtabliſhed. As this can never be invalidated, diſannulled, or made void; ſo neither can the obligations that render this extenſive ſociety indiſſoluble ever be aboliſhed or in the ſmalleſt degree violated by ſuch as walk in the light of maſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. They that occupy theſe manſions of truth, unity and joy, which the royal craft has furniſhed for <hi>ſocial</hi> delight, may as well annihilate themſelves, as by the leaſt oblique direction to deviate from the ſquare of integrity, <hi>in any imaginable ratio to diminiſh the circle of benevolence;</hi> or in the ſmalleſt inſtance to fail of laying righteouſneſs to the line, and judgment to the plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met."</p>
                     <p>All this is very fine; and if realized, it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed prove the magnificent theatre of ſimplicity, which they boaſt they are employed in rearing, to be founded in the moſt ſplendid region of the orient beam; and we might in truth expect to ſee, in <hi>real characters upon this myſterious ſtage, all the graces and virtues that bleſs and adorn human nature. The exhibitions upon this theatre would doubtleſs inſpire the moſt rapturous compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; and the beholder could not but rejoice, as he marked
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:034162_0150_0FFC62890F5097E0"/>
the kindred ſtreams of devotion and philanthropy, refreſhing the gardens of paradiſe, and reinſtating mankind in that felicity for which the race was firſt created, and to which it is aſſerted the royal laws of maſonry are infallibly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to reſtore them:</hi> But rhapſody apart; who does not know, that example hath ever taken the lead, in <hi>point of utility,</hi> of the faireſt precepts? Yet I repeat that the <hi>appropriation of benefits to a ſelect party,</hi> is not that commanding or diſtinguiſhing trait in the craft of which I <hi>principally</hi> complain; for it is undoubtedly true, that although this <hi>excluſive</hi> diſpoſition is very conſpicuouſly marked in the conduct of the aſſociates of the Lodge, it is not, however, peculiarly maſonic; ſince it more or leſs characterizes every detached body of men, pervading even the moſt liberal codes, and thruſting its forbidding front into every congregated ſociety, enlightened combination, or ſect of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                     <p>But the grand diſcriminating peculiarity which I have particularly in view, and which I have regarded as objectionable, is that impenetrable veil of ſecrecy, they affect to draw over their proceedings. Reaſon, diſengaged from the thin bandeau, with which they aſſay to hoodwink her, naturally interrogates—If the inſtitution conſiſts with rectitude, and is replete with that ſalutary influence attributed thereto, why limit its operations within ſuch narrow bounds? Why cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribe, either by compaſs or ſquare, the progreſs of genuine utility? Why not throw open the doors to inveſtigation? Why not freely communicate? and, unlocking the treaſury of knowledge which they may have accumulated, encourage thoſe, whoſe abilities are adequate, to new light their lamps at a flame ſo refulgent and ſo unextinguiſhable? Who can ſay, what ſuch an event might produce; what flowers might ſpring up; what ſcientific diſcoveries might be made, if, like that <hi>impartial</hi> orb whoſe face of fire dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orates and dignifies the maſonic inſignia, the lights they have obtained, were to become generally diffuſive, extending their genial countenance, and powerful pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronage
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:034162_0151_0FFC628729C41F98"/>
to the meritorious of every age, <hi>ſex,</hi> and deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Thus far reaſon. And ſhould maſonic ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be once more urged; ſhould it be, as heretofore, again aſſerted, that the myſteries of the <hi>royal craft</hi> are too ſacred for the unconſecrated or vulgar eye; holy <hi>truth, which ought to be the rule of ſpeech, as well as action, and every principle of ſelf complacency, which is confeſſedly coincident with benevolence,</hi> will reluct at the very idea of ſubſcribing to a conceſſion ſo humiliating; and the atrocious deviations and paucity of intrinſic worth, or apparent reſpectability, ſometimes exhibited in the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of the free and accepted maſon, will look with a very unfriendly aſpect upon every attempt to hallow his perſon.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps, in this levelling age, which ſeems to be marked as the era for deſtroying all arrogant diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the period is not far diſtant which may throw down every ſeparating barrier, which may annihilate every ariſtocratic elevation, and the terms <hi>worſhipful</hi> and <hi>right worſhipful</hi> may ſound as diſcordant upon the democratic ear of knowledge, as that of monarch, prince, or duke, upon the auditory never of the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal hero. The literary or the maſonic world may hear the voice of liberty; in the empire of arts a Thomas Paine may ariſe; and we may chance to hear of a <hi>cide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant grand maſter,</hi> who may then be content to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh this high ſounding title, for a more humble and equal appellation; the avenues to the goal of wiſdom, being widely expanded, proficients of every deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may throng her ample courts, and to every member of the mental <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> the road to lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary honours may be alike open.</p>
                     <p>But, to be ſerious—for in fact, while thus engaged in the routine of my occupation, I have, almoſt without deſign, wandered through the gate of an encloſure, which the owners have been careful to guard from the approaches of every Gleaner, and at which it was my purpoſe but barely to glance; I confeſs, that in thus trifling, I appear rather the inconſiderable idler, than that careful and pains taking being, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly

employed, in honeſtly acquiring the means of ſupporting his pretenſions to either a natural or literary exiſtence; but the deſultory fugitive, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity eccentric, is ſeldom beſide his vocation; and while I beg pardon for an attempt to ſcale an interdicted wall, I will endeavour to recover my path, to that fair field, to which, in the beginning of this eſſay, I had intended to ſhape my courſe.</p>
                     <p>But before I proceed a ſingle ſtep further, I will preſent the reader with a moſt excellent letter, which carries its authenticity upon its very face; and which, as I am truly ſolicitous for his entertainment, I very ſincerely wiſh may be productive of as much genuine ſatisfaction and heartfelt pleaſure to him, <hi>or even to her,</hi> as it afforded me; although I muſt own, it was the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation of ideas it originated in my boſom, that gave me to leap thoſe hedges, which have ſerved, from the days of the <hi>caſtle builder</hi> in Paradiſe, even unto the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time, as the ancient boundaries of a <hi>ſelf created order.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I think, however, I ſhall not again, even by the faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinating charm of philanthropy, be betrayed into walks, which have been ſo ſeldom trod, except by the hallowed feet of the cloſe and <hi>uncommunicative</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors.</p>
                     <p>Yet, notwithſtanding its influence over my conduct, the <hi>facts</hi> contained in the letter, merit the pleaſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of every feeling heart: Here follows a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful copy thereof.</p>

many years, an irreconcileable enemy to the cuſtom of praiſing a man to his face; nay, I have not to charge myſelf, ſince I could write man, with any thing like adulation, even to a woman, whoſe underſtanding I have conceived one tenth part of a degree above par. No, Mr. Gleaner, nothing of all this; and had you been ten times more excellent than you are, though I ſhould have continued reading you with much avidity, yet, had I not a communication to make, which I have long with much impatience expected to ſee iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the preſs, and which I think will figure, moſt meritoriouſly, in the annals of benevolence,—my pen would have ſtill continued dormant.</p>

that it is very ill judged, to render the dimenſions of the portal more ſpacious than the building, I ſhall therefore come immediately to the point.</p>
                           <p>Captain Mayhew, a very worthy and reſpectable inhabitant of this town, and who is alſo a navigator of conſiderable merit, hath for ſome time been employed in the whale fiſhery, by Captain David Pearce, a very uſeful and enterpriſing merchant, in the town of Glouceſter, commonly called Cape-Ann. He was lately on his return from a whaling voyage, which had been uncommonly prolonged, ſinking under a ſcurvy of a moſt alarming and diſtreſſing nature. That truly ſhocking diſorder, ſo afflicting in its conſequences to the hardy ſons of the ocean, ſeizing him with every indication of a fatal termination, he was reduced to the moſt deplorable ſituation; the ſeamen too, were all languiſhing under the melancholy effects of this debilitating and mind affecting malady; and there was hardly ability left with a ſingle man, to diſcharge the duties which were abſolutely neceſſary to their common exiſtence. Captain Mayhew was deſtitute of every thing, which could be conſidered as a ſpecific, in this cruel diſeaſe; and the ſalted or dried meat, which they were obliged to ſwallow, hourly adding to the evil, gave it the moſt frightful appearance. Thus, in effect diſabled, he was reduced to the neceſſity of putting into the iſland of St. Helena.</p>
                           <p>As the iſland of St. Helena is a domain of the Britiſh crown, and as Captain Mayhew was a ſubject of an American republic, ſo recently eſteemed a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, and now a diſmembered territory, the probabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity was that the rights of hoſpitality would be but <hi>ſparingly</hi> exerciſed toward him; and it was only the urgency of his condition, that determined him to flee for ſuccour to ſo queſtionable a port.</p>
                           <p>It happened for ſome time previous to the arrival of Captain Mayhew at St. Helena, that the fertilizing ſhowers had been withheld, and the inſufferable blaze of day, ſo genial when qualified by their bland and humid influence, now ſpread over the face of nature a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:034162_0155_0FFC627D5D5ADCB0"/>
and deathful hue; the thirſty earth viſibly mourned the continuity of its intenſe and gairiſh rays; no ſilvery dews beſpangled her now yellow mantle; her once velvet covering became parched and heathy; the green vegetable lifted not its head, while even the ſtinted growth which the ground, thus circumſtanced, produced, were by this melancholy drought cut ſo ſurpriſingly ſhort, as to yield the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants but a ſcanty and even penurious ſupport. This intelligence was as a death warrant to Captain May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hew and his company; the fruits of the earth were become indiſpenſably neceſſary to their exiſtence; it ſeemed impoſſible to procure them, and they viewed death as inevitable.</p>
                           <p>Daniel Corneille, Eſq. was at that time (and for the benefit of human nature, unleſs he is removed to a more extenſive ſphere of operation, I truſt that he ſtill is) governor of the iſland, and Henry Brooks, Eſq. deputy-governor. I confeſs I take a ſuperior pleaſure in penning the names of thoſe philanthropic gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and if the general tenor of their lives correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponds with their conduct to Captain Mayhew and his comrades, I pronounce, that both their names, and acts of liberality, ought to be engraved "by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred rays of the ſun, upon the azure ſurface of the heavens."</p>
                           <p>The governor's private gardens, and grounds of every deſcription, were irrigated by means of aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts, which conveyed the water ſeveral leagues, from thoſe immenſe reſervoirs, the mountains; and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of being thus plentifully accommodated by the fructifying ſtreams, the vegetable productions of nature revelled there, in all the pride and vigour of a healthy and rich maturity; the hand of ſkilful and aſſiduous culture had been regularly employed; and in addition to the perfection of the plants, the moſt lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriant abundance laughed around.</p>
                           <p>How many there are, who would have reſerved the ripened fruit of ſuch unremitted care for themſelves, or for others of their own deſcription? How many
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:034162_0156_0FFC627A17594F68"/>
there are, who would have trembled at the very idea of admitting a number of ſtrangers, of a grade, too, not accuſtomed to regularity, into grounds laid out by the hand of judgment, combined with the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite taſte, and kept with a very exact attention to order? How few there are, who would have ſought out the <hi>diſeaſed captain of an obſcure whaleman, and his unpoliſhed aſſociates!</hi> But governor Corneille and his deputy are <hi>citizens—they are citizens of the univerſe;</hi> and it appears that they are perfectly verſed in the rights of humanity.</p>
                           <p>To their beautiful gardens, Captain Mayhew, with the reſt of the ſick, were conducted; they were au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to make an unreſtrained uſe of the neceſſaries with which they were ſtored, and a free acceſs was at all times granted them! The ſick and debilitated ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſtrolled at pleaſure there; under the wide ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tree, upon moſſy ſeats they reclined; or, ſtretching themſelves in the foliage crowned arbour, as they ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered upon the enamelled graſs, they inhaled the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious breeze, which, richly impregnated with the reſtorative effluvia, collected from a thouſand health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſources, new ſtrung their nerves, preſented the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign panacea, communicating to the life ſtream, which had moved with morbid and ſlow paced languor, the animating and ſprightly glow, thus bequeathing to the whole ſyſtem returning agility. The tall, finely formed and white grooved celery; the medicinal wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-creſſes, with every other antiſcorbutic, with benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent avidity were plentifully furniſhed; and when, by theſe ſalutary means, ſuch a meaſure of ſtrength was obtained, as to enable them to purſue, with renovated ſpirit and returning alacrity, a voyage which Capt. Mayhew was ardent to terminate; by the ſame lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral hands they were amply ſupplied with every veg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etable, and other requiſite, which could be procured in the iſland of St. Helena.</p>
                           <p>It is, I conceive, hardly neceſſary to add, that both the governor, and deputy-governor, diſdained a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary reward. The truly philanthropic man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:034162_0157_0FFC62779011F3E0"/>
that he is amply repaid by the feelings of his own heart for every benevolent action, poſſeſſeth too much integrity to accept a ſecond recompenſe; and I have only fervidly to wiſh, that the Corneille's, and the Brooks's, of every age and country, may ſtill find themſelves, from ſo rich and exhauſtleſs a ſource, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſed for every humane and benign interpoſition.</p>
                           <p>It ſeemed as if Capt. Mayhew, who was ſtill in a degree enfeebled by the effects of his diſorder, had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the particular patronage of ſome powerfully propitious inviſible, whoſe agency was employed in cauſing the ſons of philanthropy to paſs in review be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. As he proceeded in his courſe, croſſing the equator, he met with ſeveral European ſhips, making their homeward paſſage from a Weſt-India voyage. By the commander of one of thoſe ſhips, who was a deſcendant of the Gallic nation, (and right ſorry am I, good Mr. Gleaner, that I cannot give you his name) he was hailed, who finding him a ſufferer from a malady ſo common to ſeamen in long voyages, moſt generouſly inſiſted on his accepting wines, cordials, vegetables, and live ſtock, to a very conſiderable amount; and when Capt. Mayhew ventured juſt to hint at the propriety of his receiving ſome kind of compenſation, <hi>this humane Frenchman</hi> nobly, liberally, and in the true ſpirit of <hi>cidevant</hi> French politeneſs, replied, "<hi>Pardonez moi, Monſieur;</hi> my whole ſhip and cargo, were they neceſſary to your relief, ſhould, I aſſure you, be at your ſervice."</p>
                           <p>What truly complacent ſenſations, muſt gladden the expanded heart, as it contemplates remote indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, deſcendants of the ſame ſtock, when acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally collected, thus benignly engaged in the exerciſe of good offices; thus benevolently contributing to the relief of their fellow men. But, Sir, I invade not your province; many a ſcattered reflection you will doubtleſs glean; while I, ſatisfied with having publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this teſtimony of the gratitude of my townſman, Capt. Mayhew, and with an attempt, to the utmoſt of my poor abilities, to do juſtice to characters, which,

                     <p>I HAVE ſometimes been induced to think, after a ſerious attempt to inveſtigate the cauſes which have operated in the production of ſo many needy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents of both ſexes, upon the bounty of, or civil requiſitions made upon, the more ſucceſsful, ſyſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atic or induſtrious members of the community; that the origin of this prevalent evil may generally, with a very few exceptions, be traced to that luxuriant ſource of folly, an unwarrantable, and irrational kind of pride, or falſe notions of gentility. Parents, in a certain line, either educate their ſons with a view to one of the three learned profeſſions, to a purſuit of the fine arts, or, apprenticing them to the merchant, or ſea-faring adventurer, conceive they have placed them in the road, which will moſt probably terminate in crowning them with opulence and reſpectability.</p>
                     <p>It is undoubtedly for the intereſt of ſociety, that a conſiderable proportion of our young people ſhould
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:034162_0161_0FFC626E2B5D5568"/>
be thus appropriated; but when it becomes evident that any particular department is overſtocked, a wiſe father ought certainly to turn his attention to thoſe branches of buſineſs, which, by being leſs occupied, give the youthful candidate a fairer chance of poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf of that competency, which is ſo neceſſary to the ſupporting <hi>real dignity</hi> of character. But gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who conſtitute the particular grade to which I advert, look with diſdain upon every handicraft occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation; the whole routine of arts mechanic, or, in other words, uſeful employments, they regard with ſovereign contempt; and they would eſteem their ſons degraded beyond redemption, if they deſignated them by any one of thoſe callings, which have been appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated ſervile.

During the hours of childhood, by arrangements the moſt ill judged, an undue exaltation is cheriſhed; by degrees he becomes habituated to conſider himſelf as ſuperior to various claſſes of his fellow men; his adoleſcence is paſſed in frivolous purſuits, and if his maturity is ſupine, indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, or deſtitute of enterpriſe; if he wants genius, which is a gem as rare as eſtimable, or even if he is unſucceſsful, or unfortunate, (and who does not know that merit cannot always command its wiſhes?) he is, of neceſſity, thrown a uſeleſs burden upon the public.</p>
                     <p>I ſaid the probability was, that theſe unjuſtifiable prejudices, were more particularly the growth of the American world, than of any other ſoil; and I have hazarded this conjecture, from the compariſon I have been led to make, between a variety of <hi>facts</hi> that have paſſed under my own obſervation, and the records of other nations.</p>
                     <p>"A printer!" ſaid a young ſpruce coxcomb, who poſſibly might have had the honour to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a counter, and who was fortuitouſly jumbled into the ſtage-coach with Mr. Bache, as it performed its tour of duty through a part of Pennſylvania—"A printer!" and, drawing himſelf up into a corner of the vehicle, with a ſupercilious air, he maintained an obſtinate ſilence during the remainder of a journey, which having, previous to his learning the occupation of young Bache, conceived, from his appearance, a high idea of his importance, he had commenced with <hi>inſignificant volubility;</hi> but he was ignorant that he with whom he journeyed, was the lineal deſcendant of the immortal Franklin; otherwiſe, it may fairly be inferred, that the eclat of his birth, might, in the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of this ſuperficial Billy Varniſh, have atoned for the mechanical complexion of his profeſſion.</p>
                     <p>A quondam acquaintance of mine, who is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, not extremely remarkable for the moderation of his deſires to accumulate gain, was, ſome months

ſince, on the verge of ſuffering very conſiderably, from the undue influence of this very prejudice. He had appointed an intelligent young man to the command of a ſhip of his, during a long and intricate voyage. It happened, in the courſe of the navigation which the Captain was directed to purſue, that he found himſelf neceſſitated to put into a port in England, at a diſtance from the metropolis. A variety of circumſtances contributed to produce, in the affairs entruſted to his care, a very embarraſſing and diſagreeable event. He was compelled to depart full ſpeed for London, while his ſhip continued at anchor in Liverpool. An honeſt gentleman, with whom he had commenced an intimacy upon the Albion coaſt, gave him a letter to a trunk-maker in the capital, who, he informed him, was capable of doing him great ſervice. <hi>A trunk-maker! how, in the name of common ſenſe, ſhould a trunk-maker be inſtrumental in effectuating any important pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?</hi> A deciſion upon the Captain's buſineſs remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the high court of admiralty; <hi>could a trunk-maker influence the determinations of that auguſt body?</hi> The ſuppoſition was ridiculous; it could never obtain the ſmalleſt degree of attention <hi>in the ſerious reflections of an American.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Captain proceeded ſyſtematically; he applied to a certain commercial gentleman, well known in America, and whoſe extenſive exports to this new world, ſupply many of our capital dealers with large quantities of European commodities: By this reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble auxiliary, he was introduced to the American con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul reſident in Great-Britain, and the moſt favourable repreſentation that truth could authoriſe, was made. The conſul, however, received him rather roughly. Fatigued, perhaps, by a multiplicity of applications, he ſeemed not diſpoſed to interpoſe his good offices, in order to promote an accommodation of the difficulty; he inſiſted much upon the ill conduct of American ſeamen, and obſerved that if they perſiſted in thus carelesſly involving themſelves in ambiguities, and in flying in the face of thoſe adjuſtments, which had been
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:034162_0164_0FFC6266C2AAA1E8"/>
legally made, they muſt extricate themſelves as they could, or be contented to ſubmit to the conſequences; and he abſolutely declined addreſſing himſelf to the lords of the admiralty, or the adopting of any concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory meaſure, except the Captain returned to Liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool, and brought with him certain evidence, or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, which he inſiſted would be the only proper vouchers of his integrity.</p>
                     <p>It was in vain that our young adventurer remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated; that he repreſented the amazing increaſe of expenſe, which ſuch a journey, and the detention of the ſhip, would accumulate to his employer; it was to no purpoſe he ſuggeſted the poſſibility, that ſuch an enormous expenditure might iſſue in his own ruin. The conſul continued unyieldingly obſtinate, and the ſituation of the Captain was truly diſtreſſing! The merchant, to whom he returned to relate the ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his application, had exhauſted the utmoſt of his influence, in preſenting him to the conſul; he was not particularly known to the officers of the admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and he declined any further interference in the buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>It was in this moment of cruel anxiety, that the <hi>trunk-maker</hi> occurred to our ſea commander; yet the idea was the drowning man catching at a ſtraw; but having got, however, into the narroweſt and moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous frith, it might be neceſſary he ſhould ply his oars, if a full ſail would not avail him. He could at leaſt deliver his letter; and in a ſtate of vexation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt bordering on deſpair, he preſented himſelf at the door of the trunk-maker, which opened, only not ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly, and he found himſelf in a ſhop of a ſpacious and thrifty appearance; it was furniſhed with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious number of trunks, of various ſizes, and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent degrees of elegance; and every arrangement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the <hi>induſtrious and ingenious mechanic. All this looked very well in its place; but all this, ſaid our agitated young man, is nothing to the purpoſe.</hi> The maſter work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſoon made his appearance, and he regarded the ſtranger with intelligent civility. The letter of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:034162_0165_0FFC62649F8B3DB8"/>
was produced, which being peruſed, the trunk-maker with an air of <hi>true old Engliſh hoſpitality,</hi> ſhook the ſon of Neptune by the hand. "Walk in, Sir; walk in: You have got a little diſagreeably entangled, and I ſuppoſe your feelings are all up in arms. To a young man, undiſciplined in the ſchool of misfortune, the firſt onſets of diſappointment are truly painful; but the <hi>viciſſitudes</hi> of life are as well calculated to furniſh a <hi>rational being with hope as with fear; for light as ſurely ſucceeds the darkneſs, as the darkneſs the light.</hi> Probably you may be at a loſs to conceive in what manner my aſſiſtance can be of uſe to you, and as I am at preſent a little engaged, if you will throw your eye over them looſe papers, they may help you to a clue, which may unravel the myſtery."</p>
                     <p>The Captain, it will not be doubted, eagerly availed himſelf of this permiſſion; and ſo regular was the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the different eſſays, which this <hi>uncommon</hi> compting-houſe diſplayed, that a curſory glance was ſufficient to evince the literary abilities of the author; his conſequence to certain perſons high in office was extremely obvious; and it was apparent that his merit, rendering him neceſſary to the <hi>great,</hi> had procured him free acceſs to their private ear, and a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree of influence over their determinations.</p>
                     <p>In two days our Captain received an invitation, to dine in a family way with the trunk-maker; and his reception at his patron's was marked with an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſmile, which indicated a happy termination of his difficulties. <hi>The trunk-maker had converſed with the lords in office, he had made the neceſſary repreſentations,</hi> and he had obtained explicit and indiſputable credentials for his client, who having gratefully partook of a plain, ſubſtantial dinner, received with tranſport his legal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; and, returning to Liverpool, with a heart glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened by the joys of emancipation, immediately reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked, proceeding with all expedition to proſecute his voyage.</p>
                     <p>Was I the father of a family, the trunk-maker ſhould be my model; it would be my wiſh to furniſh the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:034162_0166_0FFC62630D2F9858"/>
reaſon of my children with every help which might be neceſſary to produce them with advantage in the career of knowledge: I would aid them to fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure in the moſt poliſhed circles; I would ſtimulate them to every laudably ſplendid purſuit; the avenues of literature ſhould be thrown open before them, and they ſhould receive as much information as it was in my power to procure for them: But as, with all my gifts, I ſhould be anxious to endow them with the means of obtaining as great a ſhare of <hi>independence</hi> as might conſiſt with humanity, I would certainly aim at inveſting them with ſome uſeful qualification, which might ſerve them in the <hi>laſt neceſſity,</hi> as a fund upon which they might draw ſufficient to command the nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſaries of life.</p>
                     <p>But if the male part of our American world are, in the morning of their lives, too much neglected in this reſpect, females have abundantly more reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. Our girls, in general, are bred up with one particular view, with one monopolizing conſideration, which ſeems to abſorb every other plan that reaſon might point out as worthy their attention: An eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment by marriage; this is the goal to which they are conſtantly pointed, the great ultimatum of every arrangement: <hi>An old maid,</hi> they are from infancy taught, at leaſt indirectly, to conſider as a contemptible being; and they have no other means of advancing themſelves but in the matrimonial line.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps this is one of the ſources, from which orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate the infelicities, too often witneſſed, in wedded life; the young creature, ardent in the purſuit, is ſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulouſly employed in diſplaying all her accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; fearful that if ſhe refuſes the preſent offer, no future ſuppliant may advance his ſuit; ſhe throws her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf away upon the firſt pretender, though, poſſibly, he may be very ill calculated to embark with her upon the voyage of life.</p>
                     <p>Well, but ſhe hath gained her point; and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit over, any further efforts would be uſeleſs; ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery attempt to pleaſe is given up; and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:034162_0167_0FFC6260481BAB18"/>
which muſt follow, are too obvious to need the pen of an obſerver to point them out.</p>
                     <p>I would give my daughters every accompliſhment which I thought proper; and, to crown all, I would early accuſtom them to habits of induſtry and order: They ſhould be taught with preciſion the art economi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; they ſhould be enabled to procure for themſelves the neceſſaries of life; independence ſhould be placed within their graſp; and I would teach them "<hi>to rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence themſelves.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Marriage ſhould not be repreſented as their <hi>ſumum bonum,</hi> or as a certain, or even neceſſary event; they ſhould learn to reſpect a ſingle life, and even to regard it as the <hi>moſt eligible,</hi> except a warm, mutual and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious attachment had gained the aſcendancy in the boſom.</p>
                     <p>If they were thus qualified to adminiſter by their <hi>own efforts, to their own wants,</hi> the probability is, that impreſſions of this nature, would frequently prevent precipitation, and call into exerciſe that deliberation which ought, upon all occaſions, to be the concomitant of every important ſtep.</p>
                     <p>Girls, by the avidity and <hi>marked deſign of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations, generally defeat their own purpoſes.</hi> I would have the fair minds of young women occupied by ſchemes of enjoyment, and by modes of living, which, depending principally upon themſelves and their <hi>nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural connexions,</hi> would involve a greater probability of fruition.</p>
                     <p>Surely the ſituation of that young creature muſt be very pleaſing, who, by her ſweetneſs of diſpoſition, engaging manners, and many accompliſhments, hath endeared herſelf to the circles in which ſhe moves. Why ſhould contingent events be held up to her view, or made an abſolute part of her expectations? and if her hours are paſſed in endeavouring to augment her little income, whatever it may be, or in cultivating the means which may render her, as an individual, ſuperior to the caprices of thoſe about her, ſhe will certainly be leſs likely to look out of herſelf for happineſs.</p>

They were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and frugal, realizing, in conſequence of their own exertions, an income which enabled them to live in a genteel ſtyle; and as they were of that grade which is termed <hi>well born,</hi> their right to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in the politeſt circles was indiſputable. But, as I ſaid, living within compaſs, they were eaſy in their circumſtances, they were affectionate to each other, and always ready to relieve, to the utmoſt of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, the neceſſitous of every deſcription.</p>
                     <p>My friend, at length, after making frequent viſits to New-York, preſented them with a daughter and a ſiſter, who, though both a beautiful and an amiable woman, had nevertheleſs received from education, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ideas of life. Gay, unthinking, and profuſe by nature, ſhe had never been accuſtomed to ſet bounds
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:034162_0169_0FFC625AE1894808"/>
to her inclinations; and though ſhe truly loved her huſband, ſhe was conſtantly involving him in difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in order to ſupport a ſtyle of life to which his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances were inadequate, and which, however, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocality of his attachment induced him to exert eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nerve to maintain. All his connexions ſaw with pain that his ruin was, by haſty ſtrides, approaching; but the ſubject was delicate, and it was ſuppoſed that an interference would be ineffectual.</p>
                     <p>A period of ſeventeen years was marked by dreſs, equipage, and entertainments, while even the <hi>idea of economy</hi> never once moleſted the pleaſurable arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the fair Amanda. At the expiration of this term, that ill-directed female was ſeized with the ſmall pox, of which ſhe ſoon became the victim; and her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate companion, (who was before ſinking under the united preſſure of broken health and ſpirits, that were doubtleſs produced by a certainty of the rapid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of thoſe calamities which his good ſenſe could not but acknowledge as the procurement of folly) was, in the courſe of a few ſucceeding weeks, inhumed in the ſame vault with the beloved object who had coſt him ſo dear.</p>
                     <p>Two beautiful females were the iſſue of this ill-fated marriage; they were not however deſtitute; for though the effects of the deceaſed Henry would not give his creditors ten ſhillings in the pound, yet the rites funere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al due to the hapleſs pair, being decently performed, and the hallowed earth that encircled their cold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains embalmed by a filial tear, theſe lovely orphans were immediately ſheltered in the boſom of their friends.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Helen, then juſt fifteen years old, accompanied the ſiſter of Amanda to her abode in the city of New-York; and Miſs Penelope, who had nearly attained her fourteenth year, continued with the relations of Henry.</p>
                     <p>By way of exemplifying the force of example and the different characters, which the two young ladies from that period aſſumed, I ſelect, from a correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that continued unbroken during their ſeparation, the ſubjoined letters.</p>

                           <p>I DECLARE, my dear Pen. I am utterly at a loſs to comprehend the meaning of your laſt letter; and indeed, if I made up my judgment by your general ſtyle of writing, I ſhould certainly conclude that you had paſſed your grand climacteric; but the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contained in your laſt, are abſolutely intolerable. Let me ſee—I want, at this preſent writing, one month of nineteen; and, if I miſtake not, unleſs ſhe hath very unceremoniouſly, and even <hi>irregularly,</hi> taken a miraculous leap over my head, my dear, good, ſober ſiſter Pen. will not have reached the very grave age of eighteen, until two tardy months have fully meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured their ſlow paced round! I vow I would relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh the pleaſures of the next ball night, juſt to take a peep at your ſweet face, were it only to count the wrinkles which I preſume your <hi>deep thinking</hi> muſt have implanted there!</p>
                           <p>But to be ſerious—for once I will endeavour to meet my lovely Monitreſs (and dearly do I love my Penel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ope, notwithſtanding the air of ſuperiority, and ſtyle of reprehenſion, which her letters aſſume) upon her own ground; and, by way of reſponding in the moſt explicit manner to her catechiſing epiſtle, I will take a ſlight glance at the years which have elapſed ſince our ſeparation.</p>
                           <p>Upon my arrival in this city, the preſſure upon my ſpirits which I have already recounted to you, and which was occaſioned by the lamented death of our parents, by my removal from my native place, and from a ſiſter whom I held dearer than any thing elſe which this world contained, was almoſt inſupportable. However, the efforts of my kind aunt, with the united good offices of my numerous relations and friends, by degrees reſtored me to tranquillity; and as I have nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally a great deal of vivacity, my wonted gaiety did not long ſtand aloof.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="172" facs="unknown:034162_0171_0FFC625563C53A00"/>
Since that period—what hath taken place ſince that period? Poſitively I am a mortal enemy to reflection; and my couſin Caroline declares a young lady hath no buſineſs with it. So, my dear Pen, you muſt even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as the ſum total of viſiting, cards, balls and plays, that faſcinating comprehenſive little word, <hi>pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure;</hi> and this very <hi>pleaſurable mode of enjoying life,</hi> you, forſooth, preſume to chriſten by the odious term <hi>diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation;</hi> and my poor ſuperannuated grandmother, and my good old aunt Dorothy are alarmed at the <hi>diſſipated</hi> life which I lead; and becauſe, truly, I have no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, I am to make a mope of myſelf altogether. I remember this aunt Dorothy of ours never viſited my mother but ſhe left her in a fit of the vapours; yet if ſhe had intended us for the humble dependants of ſome wealthy fool, ſhe ſhould have forbid our receiving ſuch inſtructions as were calculated to unfit us for ſo ſervile a deſtination, though it is well known that the good old ſoul was always fond of our attaining every accompliſhment.</p>
                           <p>For my part, though perhaps I may lay in bed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ten in the morning, and though I am not ſo egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious an ignoramus as to be governed by any of your ſtupid rules, and plodding regulations, yet I can make ſhift, when I am up, to work a ſprig upon my muſlin; to chant to the ſound of my piano forte, upon which, by the way, I am much improved; to put on the head-dreſs which I have received from my milliner with elegance; to figure in any polite aſſembly; or if, by way of variety, I ſhould chooſe to paſs an hour in my own dreſſing-room, I have always the prettieſt ſentimental novels imaginable at hand, to amuſe me. Now theſe qualifications my dear aunt M—, who hath been as the tendereſt mother to me, declares are quite ſufficient for a perſon in my line of life; and for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of every kind, and all peeps into futurity, as I pretend not to the leaſt ſkill in aſtrology, I leave all theſe occult matters to the wiſe penetration of my ſiſter Pen.</p>
                           <p>One thing, however, my dear, that you may not be unneceſſarily concerned for your giddy ſiſter Helen,
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:034162_0172_0FFC6253DF6F87F8"/>
I will juſt whiſper you—I can, whenever I think prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, procure myſelf the moſt genteel eſtabliſhment. Many ſighing ſwains are in my train; they do full juſtice, both by words and actions, to my charms; and though they have not yet <hi>ventured an explicit decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they wait but my imperial nod to ſubmit themſelves implicitly to my deciſive election.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the mean time, any little articles of which I ſtand in need, are liberally ſupplied by the ready generoſity of my friends; and I really experience much compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in my ſituation, except (you will excuſe me, my dear) when I am broken in upon, by your wiſe lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and after all, my dear girl, though you riſe early, live ſyſtematically, and are as grave as the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified wife of a ſober country parſon, yet I do not ſee that your proſpects are in any ſort better than mine; and I think the only advantage which you ſeem to have acquired over me, is the privilege of document<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your eldeſt ſiſter, whenever your economical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of your time will permit you to ſpare an hour.</p>
                           <p>Say, Pen. is not this true? Have you any matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial ſcheme in your little head? if you have, do in the name of laughter let us have it. O how delighted I ſhould be to ſee my dear ſage ſiſter ſoberly pacing to church with one of the ſtill life methodical enamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato's by whom ſhe is ſurrounded; but I rather think, and if ſhe will indulge me ſo far, I will ſay, hope, that ſhe will have judgment ſufficient to ſpare my riſibles this trial.</p>
                           <p>Now I talk of <hi>judgment,</hi> and am impelled by your remonſtrances to a kind of retroſpect, I recollect but one <hi>capital tranſaction,</hi> in which my <hi>judgment</hi> hath ever been called into action—You remember, upon the day of my departure from H—, that our uncle Horatio, one hour before I took my leave, preſented me with a hundred pounds, adviſing me to conſult my uncle and aunt M—in the diſpoſal thereof: But my indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent benefactors thinking it right that I ſhould have the ſole and abſolute direction of this ſum, I locked it up ſafe in my dreſſing-box, until it was proper for me
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:034162_0173_0FFC6251B3FEBAE0"/>
to appear in colours, when I expended it in purchaſing as complete and as elegant a ſuit of clothes, if not as rich with blond lace, and every other appendage, as New-York can produce! There, my girl—as I know that my uncle Horatio preſented you with a like ſum, let us hear if yours was more advantageouſly diſpoſed of.</p>
                           <p>In ſhort, dear Pen. I doubt not but I ſhall make out very well: We ſhall continue to exhibit the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting contraſt in the world; I with my <hi>Caro Spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> (for married I intend to be) figuring in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteſt circles, and you ſoberly ſitting at home, darning your huſband's ſtockings, or combing your children's heads.</p>
                           <p>Yet, however we may continue antipodes in every thing elſe, I truſt that we ſhall meet in the centre of mutual affection; at leaſt I know, that in all events, I ſhall ſtill continue your truly attached ſiſter,</p>

                           <p>I THANK you very ſincerely, my dear Helen, for every tender expreſſion which your letter contains. It is in vain you would aſſay to ſmother the feelings of your ſiſterly heart; the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In your laſt half angry letter, it breaks forth in a variety of places; and I am ſoothed by the concluding aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that you will ſtill continue my tenderly attached ſiſter.</p>
                           <p>I do aſſure you, my dear, I have learned to reſpect the ſuperior rights, with which ſome months elderſhip have inveſted you; and if I have been betrayed into any undue warmth, I am poſitive that your never queſtioned generoſity will forgive me, when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the fervour of my remonſtrances hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

entirely from my ſolicitude, reſpecting my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Helen. Perhaps, in my reſponſes, I may again be ſo unhappy as to offend; but pleaſingly confident of the advocate which I retain in your breaſt, and penning my remarks with all the frankneſs of ſincer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, I ſhall rely wholly upon your invoked candour, to award my pardon.</p>
                           <p>No, my facetious ſiſter, <hi>deep thinking</hi> hath not yet furrowed my cheek; and had I no other view than the preſervation of the ſmooth poliſh of my complexion, it would be incumbent upon me to realize ſuch a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal fund, as would enable me to encounter with due equanimity the ills of life, thereby avoiding that hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane of the paſſions, which in its progreſs not only levels intellectual tranquillity, but makes alſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ravages in the beauty of the fineſt face.</p>
                           <p>I paſs over, without a comment, your account, with its ſum total, of your manner of paſſing your time; but I cannot forbear expreſſing the keen regrets I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, when my honoured grandmamma, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth her hand for the letter, that had been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced from the child of her affection; from that child, for whom her revered boſom hourly heaves the tender and apprehenſive ſigh; my feelings, I ſay, were perfectly agonized, when I found myſelf neceſſitated to deny her a gratification which ſhe had fondly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated; but when I beheld the venerable matron, matured by wiſdom, and dignified by a length of years, every hour of which had been marked by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and elevated by a uniform purſuit of virtue, when I was daily receiving proofs that her ſtrong mind, ſuperior to the decays of nature, was ſtill augmenting its acquirements, was ſtill more invigorated by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, could I ſo far outrage her tenderneſs, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that deference which was due to her experience, as to put a letter, in which ſhe was ſo unworthily men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, into her poſſeſſion? Neither to my aunt Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>othy could I be more communicative—Alas! alas! But I will only ſay, that in the <hi>name of ſacred duty I conjure you</hi> no more to pen a line which I cannot read
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:034162_0175_0FFC624CF7F43BE8"/>
for perſons, who are at leaſt entitled to your inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſpect.</p>
                           <p>Our aunt Dorothy, my dear, wiſhes not to ſee us dependant upon any one; ſhe is anxious to inſpire our boſoms with the <hi>noble ardour of independence;</hi> and, to this end ſhe is ſolicitous that we ſhould cultivate, to their utmoſt extent, the talents we poſſeſs.</p>
                           <p>The ſupplies which you receive from our York friends, are pleaſing inſtances of their generoſity; but can you not conceive a <hi>ſuperiour pleaſure</hi> in being able to <hi>adminiſter to your own wants?</hi> And do you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that agreeably to the courſe of nature the probability is, that thoſe neareſt to you in conſanguin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, will be removed; and will you be content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the dependant upon the caprice, or even bounty, of more diſtant relations?</p>
                           <p>You ſeem to queſtion if the arrangements which I have been directed to make, are more promiſing. I proceed, my dear, to ſketch them for you, and you may then be able to form an accurate judgment, rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative to the comparative eligibility of our proſpects.</p>
                           <p>To begin with the hundred pounds, of which you require an account. It was, agreeably to the direction of my aunt Dorothy, the very next day after its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, put into the hands of a ſubſtantial friend, who accounts with me for it, upon legal compound intereſt; if it had been a <hi>leſs ſum,</hi> I ſhould have diſpoſed of it preciſely in the ſame manner; nor have I ever yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed myſelf of the profits of a ſingle penny ariſing therefrom.</p>
                           <p>I will confeſs to you, that having obſerved the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral approbation by which my aunt Dorothy was diſtinguiſhed, I have regarded her as my model.</p>
                           <p>My time, ſince our melancholy ſeparation, hath been divided among my numerous friends; and they are ſo indulgent as to conſider my viſits rather as a pleaſing circumſtance. But though they are in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral poſſeſſed of the means of living genteelly, yet I know that they are in the practice of economy. I do not chooſe to leſſen the patrimony of my couſins; and
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:034162_0176_0FFC624A163E5DD0"/>
if I conſent to receive any pecuniary mark of their favour, it muſt be <hi>ſome trifle,</hi> which I accept as a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento of their affection.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>One month's perſeverance, enabled me to riſe each morning, mechanically with the ſun; and this habit now conſtitutes one of the pleaſures of my life, nor would I relinquiſh it, was I empreſs of the globe. I do not neglect to purſue thoſe ſtudies, of which my dear and tender parents were careful to furniſh the rudiments; neither my reading, muſic, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or geography are forgotten; they make a part of the employments of every day; they ſerve to improve and to poliſh my mind; and when I have made ſufficient progreſs therein, they will open to me, ſhould there be occaſion, new ſources of emolument as well as pleaſure.</p>
                           <p>With regard to my apparel, the handſome dividend of that which was the property of my beloved mother, and which fell to my ſhare, is to me an ample ſupply of almoſt every article. You will perhaps be ſurpriſed, when I tell you I do not wear wrought muſlin; it is true, much of my time is devoted to the proſecution of this faſhionable and elegant employ; but my younger couſins are ornamented by the product of my induſtry, while I receive, for every hour of needle work, not neceſſarily appropriated to myſelf, a liberal compenſation; and, from ſums thus accumulated, I not only command the articles of which I am in want, I have not only made handſome additions to my original fund, but I always have in reſerve, little ſums, which I conſecrate to the relief of the neceſſitous; and, believe me, my dear Helen, that when I am ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed in my decent plain muſlin, or milk white muſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, fitted cloſe to my little waiſt, I feel an innate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of much greater propriety of character, <hi>the mediocrity of my circumſtances conſidered,</hi> than if I was arrayed in flowing robes of the fineſt texture which ever iſſued from the loom, in the moſt variegated tiſſue which art hath ever yet invented.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="178" facs="unknown:034162_0177_0FFC6246DBDFD188"/>
It is really ſurpriſing, how much <hi>order</hi> and <hi>induſtry</hi> will accompliſh; and my retroſpect is truly pleaſing, when I reflect upon the different pieces of needle work, which I have, in the courſe of a few years, ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly completed. Yet my application is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remitted; and I viſit, as often as is neceſſary, though I muſt confeſs, that upon ſuch occaſions, my ſingers are generally employed.</p>
                           <p>I ſometimes mingle in a ball-room; dancing is an amuſement of which I am peculiarly fond; and I have <hi>literally murdered</hi> ſome evenings at cards. An oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſeeing a good play, as they are with us ſo unfrequent, I have not to charge myſelf with ever miſſing; and I am careful to take as much exerciſe as will conduce to my health. Stimulated by my aunt, in every action, <hi>independence</hi> hath been my ardent purſuit; and I am ſolicitous to realize ſufficient, ſhould I be overtaken by ill health, to prevent my devolving as a burthen upon others.</p>
                           <p>It is the wiſh of my aunt, as ſhe hath no immediate deſcendants of her own, to dedicate her little fortune, upon her demiſe, to charitable uſes; and as ſhe cannot conſcientiouſly gratify this her favourite plan, if ſhe leaves behind her any needy relation, ſhe is the more deſirous that her family ſhould, individually, poſſeſs the means of obtaining for themſelves an honourable ſupport. God forbid, that ever my dear Helen, or myſelf, ſhould, however remotely, curtail the ſums that may be employed for the ſalutary purpoſe of wiping the tear from the cheek of indigence.</p>
                           <p>With regard to my matrimonial expectations, upon which you are ſo ludicrouſly playful, I have to ſay, that the idea of marriage makes no part of my <hi>preſent</hi> plans; this, my dear, is a <hi>calculation, at which you ſeem to be abundantly</hi> more expert than myſelf; it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingence which, being within the chapter of poſſibilities, may, or may not happen; if it ſhould, my arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt, in ſome reſpects, be different; if it ſhould not, I am contented; at any rate, I eſteem it an error; to reckon upon an event, which is at beſt but uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:034162_0178_0FFC6244785927D8"/>
I am ignorant, if I have ever yet been regarded with particular attention by the other ſex; no one hath <hi>profeſſed himſelf a candidate for my election; and, however aſſiduous any gentleman might be, I ſhould not deem myſelf authorized to ſet him down as a lover, except his declarations were of a nature the moſt explicit.</hi>

                           <p>To ſay truth, I am not over ſolicitous upon this head; having before me ſuch an example as my aunt Dorothy, I know that reſpectability, uſefulneſs, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, independence, ſocial enjoyments, and holy friendſhip, are to be found in a ſingle life; and I am induced rationally to conclude, that if minds are not congenial, if they are not diſcreetly, mutually, and permanently attached, a ſtate of celibacy is by far the moſt eligible.</p>
                           <p>But having, by my circumſtantial replies, dimpled the blooming cheek of my charming Helen, perhaps by a ſmile of pity; I only add, the warm and tender ſalutations of her ſincerely affectionate</p>

                     <p>Miſs Helen put up her pretty lip—her ſiſter's letter was unanſwerable; but ſhe was unconvinced, or at leaſt uninfluenced, and they both progreſſed on, in the different paths in which example had produced them.</p>
                     <p>The virtues of Penelope were ſoon diſtinguiſhed by an amiable man, who was indeed her congenial ſoul; his fortune was moderate, and his proſpects were good: A happy hymen was the conſequence, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as amiable a pair as over exchanged the matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial vow.</p>
                     <p>The diſſipated manners of Helen, her fondneſs for dreſs and ſhow, with the extravagant ſentiments which ſhe at all times avowed, deterred the ſenſible part of the male world from cheriſhing an idea of a ſerious connexion with a young perſon whom they conceived

it impoſſible to domeſticate. Her uncle and aunt are no more; and their prodigality expended even the patrimony of their children. A ſimilar mode of living hath circumſcribed the career of all her boaſted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal connexions; and Miſs Helen, now rapidly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the decline of life, hath become a fixed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendage to the family of her ſiſter; <hi>a dependant upon the liberality of thoſe, whom ſhe regarded with ſenſations bordering upon contempt:</hi> But their fine qualities will doubtleſs render that dependance as ſilken as poſſible.</p>

                           <p>I DO ſeriouſly confeſs unto thee, that I am not a little pleaſed with the light which <hi>ſeemeth</hi> to be within thee; yet feeling myſelf wonderfully at a loſs, what concluſion to draw concerning thee, I am jealous over thee with a godly jealouſy. From ſome precious gems which have been ſcattered up and down thy publications, I have been ready to think, that thou wert truly of the fraternity of Friends, that thou hadſt obtained uncommon lights, and that thy heart was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:034162_0180_0FFC624098917978"/>
touched by that ſeraph, who, taking a coal from the altar, conſecrated therewith the till then unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed lips of the prophet Iſaiah. I muſt acknowledge that I have aſſiduouſly, and perhaps vainly, encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged this idea; and moreover, that when I ſaw thee lead the comely maiden, whom thou haſt cheriſhed, to the altar, after the manner of the profane, with no ſmall inquietude I relinquiſhed my hopes in regard to thee.</p>
                           <p>But if thou art not a Friend, the queſtion remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, What then art thou? I believe that thou meaneſt very well; and that thou haſt great goodneſs of heart at the bottom; but ſuffer an honeſt obſerver to ſet up for thee a land-mark; take care that thou art not miſled thereby, that thou ſtickeſt not faſt in the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of error, or, that following an <hi>ignis ſatuus,</hi> thou runneſt not on ſhore upon the ſhoals of miſconception. There is a fatal deluſion, which is now but too preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in our country; a deluſion, the fundamental principle of which, reſtoring the lapſed nature, finally returns every individual of the degenerate children of men to the ſtate of felicity which they have ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly forfeited: Verily I ſhudder at the bare penning of ſo pernicious and heterodox a vagary; and I am rendered the more fearfully apprehenſive, from a knowledge of the plauſibility with which its enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic advocates enwrap the ſoul-deſtroying hereſy! Many paragraphs in thy lucubrations, render me ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious that, under the influence of benevolence, thou haſt inhaled the ſtreams which have iſſued from ſo poiſonous a fountain; but again, from a number of choice ſentiments, which thou haſt occaſionally inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed, I am led to ſuppoſe that thou lookeſt upon thyſelf as a reſponſible being, that thou conceiveſt thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf accountable for thy actions, and that thou ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concludeſt thou ſhalt receive a reward according to the deeds done in the body.</p>
                           <p>Thus am I continually toſſed about in my opinion concerning thee; and thus am I induced to aſk thee two important queſtions. What doſt thou think of

the final ſtate of mankind? What are thy ſentiments of Jeſus Chriſt, and his redemption? I hope, friend Vigillius, that thou wilt excuſe this plainneſs of ſpeech, and that thou wilt not fail to number, among thy ſincere well-wiſhers and faithful friends,</p>

                     <p>As a general anſwer to friend Doubtful, it may be ſufficient to ſay, that the Gleaner aſpireth not to the dignified chair of the theologician; that whatever are his ſentiments, he hath entire complacency therein; that he is content with propoſing them to the reaſon of his family, without parading them to public view, or enforcing them upon any one.</p>
                     <p>Yet, thus called upon, though he doth not propoſe himſelf as a ſectarian, and though <hi>upon this occaſion,</hi> he may not avow the creed of the chriſtian Univerſaliſt; he yet craves the indulgence of his readers, while he takes leave to hazard a few remarks.</p>
                     <p>He is free to own, notwithſtanding the deſpotiſm of tradition, the prejudices of education, and the predom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inating ſway of revered opinions, that he cannot help regarding that plan as the moſt eligible, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Father of eternity, as beneficently planning, before all worlds, the career of a race of beings, who however they were immerſed in ills, and from the various viciſſitudes of time, plunged into a ſeries of misfortunes, were deſtined, nevertheleſs, to progreſs on to a ſtate of never ending felicity. Jehovah, while thus employed, appears auguſtly <hi>good,</hi> as well as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtly <hi>great,</hi> and every faculty of the mind rejoiceth to adore the paternal Deity.</p>
                     <p>We heſitate not to combine, in our ideas of the great Firſt Cauſe, with an unrivalled ſovereignty of power, that unerring <hi>preſcience,</hi> which, indeed, ſeems truly neceſſary to infinite wiſdom, and the fullneſs of the Godhead.</p>
                     <p>Would it not be impious, to ſuppoſe the Creator originating the vaſt deſigns of creation with a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition unpropitious to the well being of his creatures?
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:034162_0182_0FFC623B6BC39D00"/>
Would it not be moſt abſurdly irreverent, to repreſent the creature as independent of the power which had formed him, and as unexpectedly eſcaping from the orbit in which he was placed? Would it not be blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous to arm him with ſtrength ſufficient to fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the benevolent purpoſes which primarily gave him exiſtence? Is not that conjecture highly irrational which renders him capable of obtaining the knowledge of good and evil, without the permiſſion of that om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Father of univerſal nature, who had moulded him agreeably to his own deſignation, who had ſhaped for him his little part, who had commanded him into being, who could make him whatever he pleaſed, and who could, in a ſingle moment, recal the animating breath of life, which he is ſaid to have breathed into him? We can eaſily reconcile, with the arrangements of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, allotments which may be clouded with miſery, through the lengthening period of many revolving years, provided that the horizon at length brightens upon us, and we are finally preſented with a happy termination.</p>
                     <p>The ſoul of man is indeed capacious; it can inhale, in one luxuriant moment, ſuch large draughts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine enjoyments, as may in effect obliterate the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remembrance of calamitous centuries; and, in a future deſtination, we may awake only to the ſacred rapture of corrected pleaſures. Nor do we know that ſentiments of this complexion are unfriendly to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of virtue; for, beſides the oft cited obſervation, that rectitude inſures its own reward, and that a ſtate of ſuffering muſt ever be conſidered as an appendage to vice; there is a view in which we may ſtill be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as probationers, as accountable beings; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments muſt ever remain in the hands of our common Father.</p>
                     <p>We conceive that the ſyſtem, which, bounding the ſalutary operations of Deity, confines his gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terference to an <hi>elected few, while the many are conſigned to perdition,</hi> and which conſiders this awful decree as irreverſible, looks with a much more unfavourable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect upon the moral walk, than the denounced ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:034162_0183_0FFC6238F19FCFC8"/>
of the Univerſaliſt; ſince it as effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys every exertion to obtain the prize of future be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atification, for the immutable determination of Jehovah hath unalterably fixed the deſtiny of every candidate. This diſcriminating plan, while it merits, in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the accuſation of unwarrantable partiality, (the moſt reprehenſible characters not ſeldom becoming the objects of its predilection) throws open, at the ſame time, the widely terrific gates of deſpair. It is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the parent of ſchiſm; and it inveſts the arrogant mind with every incentive to pride and undue ſelf-eſtimation, authorizing the ſuppoſed privileged being to believe, that the eternal difference, which muſt of neceſſity forever exiſt between himſelf and the greater part of his fellow-mortals, may juſtify proceedings againſt them, for which a jury of philanthropy would find him guilty of high treaſon againſt the Rights of Man.</p>
                     <p>We think the hypotheſis, which is ever goading us to the performance of duty, by threats of the uplifted laſh, is not a little derogatory to the dignity of our nature. Generoſity and gratitude are plants which we wiſh to ſee cultivated in the ſoil of humanity. We would wiſh to ſee perſons proſelyted to the <hi>beauty of virtue;</hi> we would wiſh to ſee them in <hi>reality, ſenſible of the charms of a regular and meritorious life;</hi> in one word, we would wiſh to ſee them <hi>embrace innate good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, merely for the ſake of its intrinſic worth.</hi>

                     <p>I remember, ſome fifteen or ſixteen years ſince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a viſit to a friend in the capital of the State of Rhode-Iſland, that chance threw me one evening into a company, in which a certain tranſatlantic preacher,<note n="*" place="bottom">The author's deſign in thus expreſſing herſelf of a perſon with whom ſhe boaſts the moſt intimate connexion, will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to every intelligent reader. Concealment, even from the gentleman alluded to, was eſſential to her plan; and this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of giving the anecdote, appeared the ſureſt path to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of her wiſhes.</note> well known for the liberality of his ſentiments, made no inconſiderable figure; this gentleman did at that
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:034162_0184_0FFC6237534AD3D8"/>
time, and I am told that he ſtill continues to attract much attention in the religious world. Perhaps he may juſtly be ſtyled the father of the Univerſaliſts in this country; and however cenſurable I may be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I freely confeſs that I was not, upon the occaſion adverted too, diſpleaſed at his ideas. Among other curious anecdotes and obſervations, which conſtituted his quota of the converſation, he produced a dream, which made no ſmall impreſſion upon my mind; wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he himſelf was favoured with this nocturnal viſion, or whether it was the privilege of a friend, I do not recollect; nor is it of importance to determine.</p>
                     <p>Its outlines were as follows: Sleep had ſpread over the cloſed eyelids its ſombre veil, and the illimitable region of fancy became illumined by a prodigious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of luſtres; myriads of winged beings ſeemed to flit around; now, the empreſs of the ſlumbering hour crowded the ſcene with motley ſketches of every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which a teeming imagination could deviſe; and anon, as if ſolicitous to vary the entertainment of the night, a ſplendid ſolitude gradually pervading, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended itſelf around. It was at this moment that an intereſting form, robed in ſpotleſs white, and moving with inexpreſſible velocity, preſented herſelf before the ſleeper: Dignity was inſcribed on her very mien, her aſpect was majeſtic, and every look became expreſſive of ſome important deſignation; in her right hand ſhe graſped a blazing torch, and in her left ſhe bore a tranſparent vaſe, which, conſtantly iſſuing a copious ſtream, ſeemed to poſſeſs the properties of a living ſpring. Haſting along, with inconceivable rapidity, ſhe preſſed forward, and it was with difficulty that he detained her, while he humbly requeſted information reſpecting the nature of her office and employ; briefly ſhe replied, "Know, inquiſitive mortal, that, commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the Ancient of Days, I go forth, with this flaming torch, to light up a conflagration which ſhall conſume the heaven of heavens, while the exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs fountain in my left hand ſhall pour forth a flood, whoſe waters ſhall utterly extinguiſh the devouring,

fires of Tartarean hell; and, know alſo, that when my miſſion is accompliſhed, then will the era be produced, in the which our God ſhall recognize <hi>ſome diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſincere worſhippers."</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The conſternation produced by this aſtoniſhing piece of information, diſpelled the ſomnific influence of the drowſy goddeſs; and the reflections which it originated in his boſom, muſt occur to every ſerious mind.</p>
                     <p>I have been amazed when I have liſtened to the declarations of thoſe, who have proteſted, that if a ſtate of retribution was not in reſerve, they would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark, with a full ſail, upon what they have termed the ocean of unlicenſed pleaſure, and that they would take in large draughts of illicit gratifications!—Surely, ſuch perſons have never yet awaked to the beſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life—are yet to receive the perceptions, which alone can entitle them to a rank among the dignified order of rational beings.</p>
                     <p>Independent of every future conſideration, how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renely rolls on the days of that individual, who is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to employ his time, his talents, and his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of every deſcription, in a manner calculated to do honour to himſelf, and to conduce to the beſt intereſts of his fellow mortals!</p>
                     <p>View the well regulated family; no ſooner do their eyelids uncloſe, than their grateful oriſons ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and individually aſcend the vaulted ſkies; with the firſt upriſing of the orient beam, they are aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the neatly furniſhed parlour, where, from the ſacred oracles, a portion for their improvement and conſolation is ſelected; where their common teacher, in words fitly choſen, energetic and conciſe, and in a manly and endearing tone of voice, offers up their unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and early thankſgivings, ſupplications and praiſe, to the univerſal Sire of angels and of men.</p>
                     <p>This ſeparate and collected intercourſe with Heaven, will conſtitute them reciprocal guards upon themſelves and each other; they will be cautious of offending; their words and their actions they will conſider, and
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:034162_0186_0FFC62322CCA7DE0"/>
they will be anxious to conduct as perſons privileged by a frequent acceſs to the Sovereign Diſpoſer of events.</p>
                     <p>The domeſtic departments will be filled in an allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and regular manner; the affairs of the houſehold will go ſmoothly forward; the individuals will recip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocally aſſiſt each other; and plaſtic order, with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate harmony, will preſide among them. They will look abroad, and, finding a complacency in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating good, they will feel it their intereſt, as well as their duty, to relieve, to ſoothe, to ſuccour, and to ſupport, to the utmoſt of their ability, the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſons and daughters of men; and while thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in mitigating foreign woes, in extending the extricating hand, they will find that the bleſſings of heaven-born peace have become natal in their boſoms.</p>
                     <p>In the varied and intereſting offices of ſocial life, they will cheerfully engage; they are apprized of what their characters demand of them; and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of their extenſive connexions, they are careful to promote. As members of the community, they will diſcharge with propriety their parts, and they will ever reflect the higheſt honour upon their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. When they are overtaken by the unavoidable calamities incident to the preſent mode of exiſtence, in every affliction, they will naturally pour out their ſpirits in prayer: This is a privilege which will meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orate their ſufferings; and, accuſtomed to addreſs the great Origin of being, they will haſten with alac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the throne of grace. Whatever may be their employments or amuſements, in the courſe of the day, or during the cloſing evening, being careful to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine innocence withal—they will gladly turn from every inferior or trivial purſuit, and when the empire of night is commencing, they will re-aſſemble in the peaceful apartment, that will be thus conſecrated, and, by the mouth of their revered head, they will perform the evening proſtrations of their devoted ſpirits, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping with ſincere hearts, enumerating the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied bleſſings of the day, and offering up their ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:034162_0187_0FFC62304DB3E770"/>
hallelujahs, thankſgivings and adorations. Their errors, of whatever nature, they will deplore with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite hearts; but with child-like diſpoſitions they will approach, and they will be confident that their auguſt Father, who pitieth their infirmities, bendeth to their ſupplications a gracious ear. Calm, grateful, and diſburthened of their heavieſt load, they will retire to preſent their ſeparate ejaculations, and they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to the ſlumbers of the pillow with heart felt tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>The theme is copious; I have rapidly hurried along; I could dwell untired upon the charms, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable utility, attendant upon the preſent hours of an unoffending and uſeful life.

A thouſand painful ideas ruſhed in a moment upon my mind, and they originated the moſt alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and affecting conjectures.</p>
                     <p>I had obſerved, that a kind of penſive melancholy had for ſome time clouded the fine open countenance of my wife; that her wonted equanimity was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; that her ſlumbers were diſturbed and broken;
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:034162_0188_0FFC622E32E4F9F8"/>
and that the admirable regularity of her move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were evidently diſcompoſed. As I poſſeſſed a perfect confidence in her prudence, I had forborne to preſs her upon ſo diſtreſſing a change, well knowing, that whenever it was advantageous or proper, diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not fail of prompting her to pour into my ear the ſorrows of her heart.</p>
                     <p>Maternal affection had armed her with an anxious and vigilant attention to her daughter; ſhe had for ſome months marked a viſible alteration in her child; the dimpling ſmile of complacency no more ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly welcomed her approach; thick glooms en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled her brow; and while ſhe viſibly ſtruggled to preſerve appearances, the tenor of her ſoul was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently loſt! Whenever Mary occaſionally looked in upon her Margaretta, if her viſit was unexpected, ſhe was ſure to find her bathed in tears; and the apologies which ſhe ſeemed to ſtudy, but ill concealed the diſcompoſure of an agonized boſom.</p>
                     <p>Mary, with all her penetration, could not divine the cauſe of an event, which ſhe ſo greatly deplored; ſhe imagined that her daughter was in poſſeſſion of every thing which could conduce to the moſt pleaſing kind of tranquillity; and ſhe conceived that the grateful affections of her heart ought to be in conſtant exerciſe. Competency beamed its regular, mild, and equal bleſſings upon her; her infant was not only lovely and promiſing, but he ſeemed almoſt exempted from thoſe diſorders, which are uſually attendant upon his imbecile age; her own health was uniformly good; and though Edward Hamilton partook, of courſe, the morbid contagion of her grief, yet he was ſtill the penſively pleaſing and entertaining companion.</p>
                     <p>Mary concluded, that nothing remained, but for Margaretta to re-aſſume the accuſtomed equability of her temper, in order to the perfect reſtoration of that ſunſhine, which had for a ſeaſon illumed her hours; and tenderly intereſted, while her heart was torn by anxiety, ſhe could not forbear to interrogate—but the only replies ſhe could obtain were ſighs and tears,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:034162_0189_0FFC622B5B035050"/>
interrupted by broken aſſurances, that indeed ſhe was—ſhe was very happy; and that ſhe ſupplicated her dear Mamma to put upon every appearance the moſt candid conſtruction. Her mother, however, made wiſe by the obſervations ſhe had collected from books, from the ſtudy of her fellow mortals, and from a large ſhare of natural diſcernment, could not be thus eaſily deceived.</p>
                     <p>Curioſity was, upon this occaſion, her ſmalleſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement; and ſhe trembled at the impervious dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a cloud, which ſhe rationally apprehended involved the deareſt hopes of her Margaretta! Baffled in repeated attempts to fathom a myſtery, which had yielded her boſom a prey to the keeneſt anguiſh, ſhe changed the mode of her attack; and, addreſſing her daughter by letter, in the language of diſcretion, in the language of tenderneſs, ſhe penned the feelings of her ſoul.</p>

                           <head>To Mrs. HAMILTON.</head>
                           <p>IS it poſſible for Margaretta Hamilton to conceive her mother a calm ſpectator of that corroding inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etude, which is gradually and too ſurely undermining the peace of a child, who is, ſhe had almoſt ſaid, dearer to her than any other human being? As I have not been ſtimulated by an idle wiſh to obtain your ſecret, I am hurt that my inquiries have proved ſo ineffectual. Can Margaretta wiſh to veil herſelf from the eye of the guardian friend of her early years? Believe me, I ſeek only to probe the wound, that I may the more aſſuredly arreſt the progreſs of the envenomed poiſon, and be enabled to judge what preſcription may operate as a ſpecific.</p>
                           <p>But, for the tender age of innocence, the advice of the phyſician is the ſuperſtructure of conjecture; and in this inſtance I am neceſſitated to follow the example of the benevolent practitioner, at all hazards aſſaying to throw in ſomething, which may poſſibly preſerve the opening life of thoſe budding joys, the growth of
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:034162_0190_0FFC6228EF92E4E0"/>
which I had fondly hoped to have watched, until I had gratulated their confirmed maturity.</p>
                           <p>When we gave our Margaretta to Edward Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <hi>we conceived that we had yielded her to the man of her heart;</hi> and, believing him to be every way worthy, we congratulated ourſelves upon the eſtabliſhment of the felicity of our child. What, my love, can have produced a change ſo affectingly agonizing? When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you <hi>appear</hi> tolerably compoſed, it is <hi>evident</hi> that you are <hi>acting</hi> a part.</p>
                           <p>I tremble leſt your father ſhould penetrate the thin diſguiſes which you aſſume; and, ſanguine as his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations in regard to you have been, it is difficult to ſay, what ſerious conſequences his diſappointment might produce.</p>
                           <p>Oh, my child, my ſoul is torn by the moſt fearful conjectures! will you not endeavour to aſſuage the ſorrows of my heart? will you not at leaſt relieve me from the pangs of ſuſpenſe? Can it be, that Mrs. Hamilton is ſo far ſubjected to ſexual weakneſs, as to have delivered herſelf up to the moſt alarming cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grin, merely becauſe, perhaps, ſhe receives not from the huſband ſuch <hi>adulatory devoirs</hi> as diſtinguiſhed the lover? Surely I ought to regard this idea as inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible; and yet, the ſtrongeſt minds may have their moments of imbecility; and, my Margaretta, all accompliſhed, all lovely as ſhe is, muſt nevertheleſs ſtill be conſidered as a young and inexperienced woman.</p>
                           <p>If this is indeed the ſource of your perturbed anxiety, I perſuade myſelf that ſome ſuch reflections as the following, will ere long awaken you to reaſon.</p>
                           <p>It is impoſſible to change the order of nature. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted admiration of pleaſing novelties, is the ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous growth of every boſom; a ſecond view finds us more calm; a third, a fourth, may poſſibly rouſe us to pleaſure; but a conſtant repetition will create that indifference, which will conſtitute a perfect contraſt to the keen edge of our new-born feelings. The impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned ardours of the ſoul muſt of neceſſity ſubſide;
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:034162_0191_0FFC62260314D568"/>
                              <hi>they are but created to expire:</hi> But I pity the mind which prefers not the calm rational affections that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, to all the hurricane of the paſſions.</p>
                           <p>Love, as it is commonly deſcribed, is undoubtedly a ſhort-lived being; it is a luxurious glutton, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably gormandizeth to its deſtruction; but from its perfumed aſhes ariſeth a ſtar-gemmed ſoother, that the wedded pair may either cruſh in the birth, or agree to cheriſh, as the ſecurity of their mutual happineſs. Eſteem may ſometimes be traced as the <hi>parent,</hi> but I think it will be found that it is oftener the <hi>offspring</hi> of love. Young eſteem, entwined by ſmiling confidence, enwreathed with ſweet complacency, how fragrant is its roſy breath, how neceſſary to the hymeneal career, and how much is it in the power of the affianced friends to render its exiſtence permanent!</p>
                           <p>Behold your Edward in a large circle of ladies; doubtleſs, he is all attention; his features are animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if they are young, beautiful and ſentimental, he is all ſoul; he ſeems to tread on air, and he hath no eyes or ears, but for them; he will addreſs to them the moſt refined gallantries, and he will appear loſt amid a conſtellation ſo ſplendid. But think you, my love, that he would experience ſenſations thus highly wrought, were he to mingle every hour in their ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety? and would you wiſh to exchange for ſuch <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal gewgaws,</hi> if I may ſo expreſs myſelf, the ſolid pleaſures of endearing familiarity; the advantages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from unbroken confidence, from a ſocial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, uninterrupted by the fopperies of language, and from all the matchleſs and ſerene enjoyments which wedded friends may know?</p>
                           <p>Are you not apprehenſive that the continued clouds which gloom your lovely face, may prematurely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy your bloom, and, by imperceptible degrees, alienate the affections of your huſband? If once you relinquiſh your place in his boſom, it will require a ſeries of the moſt arduous efforts to reſtore you to the poſſeſſion you will have thus imprudently ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated!</p>
                           <p>

I am not an advocate for undue gentleneſs, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive acquieſcence; ſuch conduct may border upon meanneſs; a woman ſhould be <hi>juſt too, ſhe ſhould reverence herſelf:</hi> I am far from conceiving that the female world, conſidered in the aggregate, is inferior to the male; but cuſtom hath eſtabliſhed a certain or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in ſociety, and cuſtom is a deſpot, whoſe chains, I am fearful, it will be in vain that an individual will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay to burſt.</p>
                           <p>I know too, that it is for the intereſt of every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who ſingly conſiders either him or herſelf, to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate an <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>ſerene</hi> temper of mind. If you array yourſelf in the garments of tranquillity, if you ſeek to clothe yourſelf with innate cheerfulneſs, <hi>habit</hi> will at length render you in <hi>reality complacent,</hi> and it will not be you who will derive the ſmalleſt ſhare of advantage therefrom.</p>
                           <p>In ſhort, my dear girl, you have every inducement to call forth your moſt unremitted exertions. Parents tenderly anxious for your welfare—Parents, whoſe fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity is inſeparably entwined with your own; a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band acknowledged as highly deſerving, and a beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous infant, whoſe little eyes are raiſed to you for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, for inſtruction, and for peace: Oh! cloud not his budding life by a grief ſo ſtrange and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; his lovely cheek ſhould not thus early be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the tear of ſorrow. Oh, pierce not thus the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of her who hath reared you to womanhood, whoſe prime hopes of temporal enjoyment reſt with you, and who, in conſequence of that authority, which by high Heaven is veſted in her, demands of you an account of that latent woe, which, <hi>gaining ſtrength by conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is thus preying upon all your promiſed joys. Speak, I conjure you, ſpeak; and let your communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations mitigate the pangs, which ceaſe not to lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the boſom of your afflicted and commiſerating mother.</p>

                           <p>PITYING angels—and muſt I then ſpeak? aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly I muſt—every conſideration unqueſtionably points out an explanation.</p>
                           <p>I have ſunk, mortifyingly ſunk, in the eſtimation of her whoſe <hi>approbation</hi> I would die to preſerve; and I have inflicted upon her the ſevereſt anguiſh; yet, prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, her tender boſom may be diſburthened, by a knowledge that her Margaretta is not altogether ſo culpable as ſhe hath apprehended: And duty ſeems to impel an unreſerved confidence; for the honoured woman, to whom I am primarily indebted for every thing that can render life valuable, hath commanded me to be explicit.</p>
                           <p>But ſtop!—can duties claſh? Ought the diſcreet female to accuſe him to whom ſhe hath voluntarily yielded her moſt ſacred and ſolemn vows? Can Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetta criminate her Edward!!!!</p>
                           <p>Yet, poſſibly, what I have to urge in my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, may not exhibit my Hamilton in a cenſurable point of view; from a mutable being we are not to expect immutability; and, if my conjectures have their foundation in truth, though I may be wretched, I will not be unjuſt. It is neceſſary that I juſtify my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to my mother; but I will not dare to caſt a ſhade upon the character of a man, whom I regard as the firſt of created beings.</p>
                           <p>Hardly three months after our marriage had elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when Edward exhibited marks of a growing and deep-felt inquietude! an impenetrable gloom over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed every feature! Had you witneſſed, as I have done, and ſtill do, the laſting and ſerious ſorrows of his boſom, your maternal remonſtrance would have been addreſſed to him, rather than to your unfortunate child. Often hath he regarded me with a fixed and melancholy attention: and when, alarmed and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, I have ſought the cauſe of his myſterious deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if unable to command his grief, he hath fled with precipitation from my importunities. To induce
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:034162_0194_0FFC62247ACE5628"/>
him to diſcloſe the fatal ſecret of his heart, no means within my power have been left unaſſayed; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though failing in my well intended efforts, I have ſtill endeavoured to ſoothe and woo his ſteps to the ſweet and flowery paths of peace.</p>
                           <p>With the ſevere eye of unrelenting rigour, I have examined my own conduct: Probably I am under the dominion of <hi>ſelf-partiality;</hi> for, in regard to him, I cannot view myſelf as reprehenſible either in thought, word, or deed.</p>
                           <p>When, by your direction, I announced to him my expectation of preſenting him with a little being, who would bring into the world with it, its claims to his fondeſt affections,—Oh, Madam! inſtead of the effect which we naturally imagined, the ſorrows of his heart became ungovernable; with convulſed and agonized emotions, he claſped his hands—Never ſhall I forget his exclamation; it ſounded like a death-warrant to my ear—"<hi>Gracious God! wretch, wretch that I am!</hi>"—What he would have added, I know not; for, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by my grief and my ſurpriſe, I ſunk lifeleſs at his feet; and when, by his endeavours, and thoſe of the attendants whom he ſummoned to my relief, I was recalled to ſenſe and to recollection, I found him kneeling by my bed ſide, aſſiduouſly and tenderly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in my reſtoration, and his tranſports at behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, as he expreſſed himſelf, once more open my eyes to love and to him, at ſeeing the bloom again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſit my cheeks, were, he declared, the moſt exquiſite he had ever experienced!</p>
                           <p>You will not doubt, that I ſeized this tender mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to expoſtulate with him relative to his heart-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and ſoul-piercing expreſſions of grief, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued melancholy; but, although he beheld me, as I then ſuppoſed, with unabating affection, although he ſoothed my ſpirit by the moſt delicate and unequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal aſſurances, he nevertheleſs turned a deaf ear to the voice of my ſupplication! Edward Hamilton hath a ſtrong and determined mind; fortitude is innate in his boſom; he can wear to the public eye, and even to
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:034162_0195_0FFC622251D66BE8"/>
the circle of his friends, a face of tranquillity, while his breaſt is a prey to the moſt perturbed ſenſations.</p>
                           <p>Fearful of diſguſting him by my perſecutions, I ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed from my lips every expreſſion of my anxiety; and, as far as was in my power, I diſmiſſed from my features the inquietude of my boſom. I ſtudied, by my every movement, his pleaſure; and I flattered my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that the birth of my child, by giving a new turn to his ideas, would reſtore my felicity. It is true that I had nothing to complain of, except the corroding grief, with which he evidently ſtruggled, and which, notwithſtanding his efforts to conceal it, was generally the companion of his private hours: For the reſt, I judged myſelf in poſſeſſion of his heart, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment was deſcriptive of the moſt refined and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attachment.</p>
                           <p>Thus paſſed the days, until the arrival of my pang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hour. You, dear Madam, were a witneſs to the diſtreſſing agitation of his ſoul, during that perilous and tremendous period; you heard and repeated his fervid vows for my ſafety; they were muſic in my ears; doubtleſs they were ſincere, for the heart of Edward Hamilton is as tender as it is manly. You alſo witneſſed the rapt ſenſation of his grateful ſpirit, when he received his ſon; you heard and marked the paternal bleſſings, which he poured upon his young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling head; and, it is true, that the little creature is as dear to him, as the vital ſpark which warms him to exiſtence—<hi>but alas! this is the ſum total of my enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments!</hi> The anguiſh of heart, which is deſtroying the <hi>father of my child,</hi> ſeems daily to augment! The tears, of which he is apparently unconſcious, often bedew the face of my infant! Frequently, as if by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, we gaze in ſilent ſorrow upon the dear innocent, and when Hamilton ſuppoſes himſelf unobſerved, his eyes and hands are raiſed toward heaven; and in all the majeſty of innate woe, he pathetically makes his appeal to the Searcher of all hearts, while rectitude, it ſhould ſeem, is the motto of his life.</p>
                           <p>

Yet, I will not withhold ſome circumſtances, that have produced inferences, which my full ſoul hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiled at admitting. Alas, my mother! will you not eſteem me wretched, when I confeſs to you, that I have but too much reaſon to ſuppoſe <hi>myſelf the origin of his misfortune.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Some weeks after the birth of my little William, I was alarmed by the frequent abſence of Hamilton; and as I <hi>forbore any remarks thereon, being unwilling to embitter, by my expoſtulations, the few moments which he allowed me,</hi> I continued ignorant of the manner in which he appropriated his time. <hi>Accident,</hi> at length, informed me that all thoſe hours of which he had rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed me, were devoted to Serafina! and from her he always returned a prey to the deepeſt and moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful chagrin.</p>
                           <p>The ſhock which my tenderneſs and my ſenſibility received, in a moment ſo replete with anguiſh, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay not to deſcribe; but reaſon, I bleſs God, darted athwart the region of my ſoul her beamy influence. Serafina was the ſiſter of my heart; ſhe was a lovely and an amiable woman. Edward and Serafina had been educated together from early life; their habits of intimacy were confirmed; and I conſidered, that if her ſociety poſſeſſed more charms than mine, Edward was unfortunate, but not culpable.</p>
                           <p>I immediately formed the reſolution of ſoliciting her to become an inmate in our houſe; and when I made my propoſal to Hamilton, <hi>he received it with more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction than my feelings could well tolerate;</hi> he kiſſed my hand with rapture; a gleam of joy vermilioned his cheek, and he flew to acquaint Miſs Clifford with the wiſhes which I had expreſſed.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Serafina too demonſtrated the higheſt complacency; a reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with her Margaretta, ſhe was pleaſed to ſay, would complete her felicity; and ſhe could not heſitate, when a ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation every way eligible way tendered to her acceptance.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Our plan was no ſooner concerted than put into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution; Miſs Clifford was eſtabliſhed in this manſion, and Hamilton no longer wandered abroad! When I
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:034162_0197_0FFC621EA225FD38"/>
am preſent, Hamilton hath never, for a ſingle moment, abated his marked attentions to me; and he regards Serafina in his accuſtomed manner; but if I unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly join them, although they have apparently been engaged in the moſt affectingly intereſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, they are immediately ſilent, embarraſſed and uneaſy!</p>
                           <p>The fine eyes of Serafina are often drowned in tears, and the grief of Hamilton ſeems to know no bounds! Two weeks ſince, upon the morning of the day on which you ſurpriſed me yielding up my whole ſoul to ſorrow, ſuppoſing Hamilton in his cloſet, I took my needle-work, with a deſign, while ſitting beſide him, to make one more effort to allure him into the ſweet and flowery walks of tranquillity. He was not there—but an open piece of paper lying upon his ſcrutoire, written by the hand of Serafina, in which I ſaw my name in large characters inſcribed, caught my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I read it—its contents are indelibly engraven upon the tablets of my heart; and, with a trembling hand, I tranſcribe them for your peruſal.</p>

                           <p>I read, I ſay—and the agony of my ſpirit was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible—with a wild air I turned toward the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and, as if fate had determined to make me completely wretched, I beheld Edward and Serafina, arm under arm, walking down the gravel-walk of our little flower garden: This, at ſuch a moment, was too

much. With precipitate and unequal ſteps, impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned almoſt to frenzy, I haſted from the cloſet, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as for refuge, to my own. It was at this diſtreſſing juncture, that you, Madam, looked in upon me; you ſaw, and your eye condemned the irregular expreſſions of a ſorrow to which you was a ſtranger; but I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf that you will, in future, rather pity than cenſure your Margaretta.</p>

                     <p>SITTING, laſt evening, in the little apartment which I have devoted to pleaſures, properly term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſentimental, I was endeavouring, while Mary was ſeated by my ſide, to amuſe the hours which ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at her needle, by a re-peruſal of Gibbon's Roman Hiſtory. We had paſſed our afternoon, in a vain attempt to inveſtigate the cauſe of the infelicity of our daughter; we went over and over the ground, we traced and re-traced, we exhauſted the powers of retroſpection, until wearied amid the wilds of conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we attained the preciſe point from which we at firſt ſat off.</p>
                     <p>I had forborne to queſtion either Mr. or Mrs. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilton, imagining that the diſcretion of Margaretta muſt inevitably become finally triumphant; and I conceived, beſides, that any interference, conſidering the exquiſite ſenſibility and delicate circumſtances of the parties, muſt unavoidably increaſe the evil we lamented.</p>
                     <p>But to delineate the agonized perplexity which tempeſted the boſom of Mary, is impoſſible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed ſigh, humid cheek, and ſwoln eye, proclaimed the anguiſh of her ſpirit; while ſhe in vain endeavoured to reaſſume the wonted fortitude and equability of her diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>Laſt evening, however, wiping from her face the tear of maternal woe, and calling into action all thoſe efforts which it is the privilege of tender eſteem to embody, I ſo far ſucceeded in my attempts to ſoothe her mind, as to procure a temporary calm; and preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as an auxiliary, my admired hiſtorian, my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was to draw her off, at leaſt for the moment,
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:034162_0200_0FFA6535026CED08"/>
from the contemplation of the melancholy conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of her daughter's marriage.</p>
                     <p>We had but juſt inveſted our penſive <hi>tete-a-tete,</hi> with a degree of apparent ſerenity, when Mrs. Hamilton, without being announced, ruſhed haſtily into the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Our aſtoniſhment at ſo unexpected a viſit, was in no ſort abated by the wild extravagance of which her air and manner were deſcriptive; it was, however, the mania of joy; and, without giving us time for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection or interrogation, throwing herſelf ſuddenly at my feet, with claſped hands, and all the delirium of rapture, ſhe exclaimed—<q>O Sir! O my father! bleſs, bleſs, your happy child!—delay not to beſtow your benediction upon this, the moſt bliſsful period of her life; thus giving the paternal voice, to ſanction and complete that meaſure of felicity, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps her wayward and deſponding heart hath but ill deſerved.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Alarmed and apprehenſive, I would have folded her to my breaſt, at no moment heſitating to pronounce a bleſſing, which was ever the ſpontaneous dictate of my heart; but ere I could utter a word, ſpringing up and haſting forward, ſhe threw her ſnowy arms around the neck of Mary. <q>O my mother, my more than mother! embrace your now not ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but perfectly aſſured and extaticly enraptured Margaretta!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mary, alternately claſping her to her boſom, and regarding her with looks of agonized terror, ſtruggled in vain for utterance; the impaſſioned feelings of her ſoul diſdained language, and the perturbed emotions which agitated her ſpirit, were expreſſed only by an affecting and deſcriptive ſilence.</p>
                     <p>For myſelf, I am free to own, that the ſcene had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unmanned me; and, that trembling equally for my wife and daughter, I could not have ſupported it a moment longer. It was interrupted by the entrance of Edward Hamilton and Serafina. "Ah, my love!" cried Hamilton, <q>why do you thus cruelly deprive me of your preſence; at a moment too, when you
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:034162_0201_0FFA6550355AA160"/>
have, as it were, renovated my exiſtence; when you have relieved me from a burthen that, by its mighty preſſure, had well near cruſhed my every hope of happineſs this ſide the eternal world; when you have new pointed every felicity, and taught me ſtill more highly to appreciate the ineſtimable worth of yourſelf, and of your ennobling affection! Were it poſſible I could call my Margaretta unkind, her abſence at ſuch a time, would be the only plea that could juſtify my accuſation. <hi>But who talks of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation?</hi> Margaretta, like the Being from whom ſhe originates, and who hath formed her a near reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of his bleſſed ſelf, <hi>unreſervedly forgives;</hi> and, influenced alſo by an example ſo fair, while urged by their own lenient benevolence, our revered bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, parents, friends, will likewiſe condeſcend to ſign my acquittal; and thus their once almoſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing culprit, reſtored to peace and to them, will new plume his hopes, and, re-embarking upon the voyage of life, he will truſt that proſperous gales may attend his once ſhipwrecked proſpects.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Margaretta, encircled in the arms of her huſband, bent her ſweet face upon his boſom, while Serafina, enthuſiaſtically preſſing her hands to her lips, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </p>
                     <p>But not to fatigue the reader, by the incoherently agitated manner, in which we finally obtained an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of theſe myſterious appearances, I will piece together materials which, through many breaks and pauſes, I received, and preſent a ſuccinct narrative of circumſtances, that have produced an ecclairciſement, which hath rendered Margaretta, in her own eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the happieſt of women.</p>
                     <p>The opening dawn of yeſterday preſented a ſerene autumnal morning, and the advancing day confirmed the pleaſing indications of its roſy harbinger.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="203" facs="unknown:034162_0202_0FFC65553A7583E0"/>
The ripened fruits of autumn gathered in, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious ſwain once more hailed the interval which, crowning his hopes, permitted him to indulge a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of his labours; the very air, gently moving the motley foliage of the grove, impregnated with the ſeeds of bland and ſocial peace, and diſburthened of the undulating and buſy clang, ſeemed to breathe the true ſpirit of grateful and unmoleſted contemplation; while all varying nature apparently wore the ſemblance of tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>Margaretta made the compariſon—ſhe could no longer ſupport the dreadful contraſt which her boſom exhibited; and, aſſerting herſelf, ſhe determined to be peremptory in her demand of an explanation. For many hours ſhe revolved her important purpoſe; her ſpirit laboured with its intereſting deſign; her breaſt was the ſeat of inquietude, and her ſoul was heavily oppreſſed. How to preſent herſelf; how to introduce her ſubject; in what language to clothe thoſe ſorrows which ſhe had hitherto ſo aſſiduouſly ſought to veil from the eye of Hamilton—theſe were queſtions which ſtrongly agitated every faculty of her mind; but all her attempts to concert a plan of operation were inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, until at length, tortured by reflection, heſitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, trembling and irreſolute, ſhe bent her ſteps toward that ſaloon, which Edward had conſecrated the ſcene of his moſt retired moments; thither, at certain hours of the day, ſhe knew that he repaired; upon this ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhe had never before ventured to intrude; yet, by ſlow and ſolemn movements, urged by deſpair, ſhe now approached: She drew toward the receſs, the door was but half cloſed; Edward and Serafina, for the purpoſe of obtaining an uninterrupted conference, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly retired there. Serafina was ſeated on a ſofa, her face bathed in tears; Edward, evidently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by grief, reclined by her ſide; he preſſed the left hand of Serafina to his lips, while her right was thrown affectionately over his ſhoulder!</p>
                     <p>"O Edward!" with a voice almoſt choaked by ſorrow, exclaimed Miſs Clifford, <q>why are you thus
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:034162_0203_0FFC6553A69B4918"/>
unkindly perſevering? Falſe ſentiments betray you. My attachment to you is cloſely interwoven with my exiſtence. I ſtand upon the brink of a precipice, down which your unyielding obduracy will not fail to plunge me! Again I aſſure you, that my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or miſery is involved in yours! If you become an exile from your country, doubtleſs I ſhall be the companion of your flight; but whither ſhall we go? in what receſs can we hide ourſelves? Is it poſſible that we can voluntarily conſign to irremediable ruin, the <hi>lovely and affectionate Margaretta?</hi> Is it poſſible that <hi>you, that a father,</hi> can deliberately reſolve to blaſt the juſt budding proſpects of him, who now, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious of the threatened danger, lulled in the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of innocence, ſmiles with celeſtial ſweetneſs?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Margaretta had entered unobſerved; ſhe had beheld the attitude of two perſons whom ſhe had accuſtomed herſelf not only tenderly to love, but reveringly to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem. The moſt envenomed pangs of deſpair at that moment pervaded her boſom—a feveriſh kind of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh ſeemed to drink up the purple ſtream of life—her voice was loſt, and her ſight well near abſorbed. Unable to proceed, ſhe ſunk upon the ready ſettee, which the ſecond ſtep preſented—ſhe diſtinctly heard the exclamation of Serafina!!—and the powers of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imation ſuſpending their operations, ſhe ſunk motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon the ſettee—a ſigh burſt ſpontaneouſly from her boſom—a ſigh, that might well be imagined the immediate harbinger of death; it firſt drew the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Serafina—Hamilton ſtarted from his ſeat, and with mingling ſurpriſe, anguiſh and terror, they mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally flew to the ſuppoſed expiring ſufferer. Their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications were in part ſucceſsful; the active principle of life reſumed its functions, and a gradual reſuſcitation pervaded the ſyſtem. Reaſon, nevertheleſs, as if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignant at the outrages which ſhe had ſuſtained, ſtood aloof; and it was but too evident, that Margaretta poſſeſſed not that fine arrangement which had hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto regulated the feelings of her dignified and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="205" facs="unknown:034162_0204_0FFC655223575148"/>
Her wanderings, however, imbibed the hue, and partook the prevailing bent of her natural diſpoſition; and amid her incoherent ramblings, the true ſituation of her ſoul was expreſſed.</p>
                     <p>In pathetic language ſhe lamented her own hard fate; and, addreſſing Serafina, whom ſhe believed to be Mary, ſhe queſtioned her in regard to the propriety and eligibility of a ſeparation from Edward. She ſaid that her attachment to her huſband could never know abatement; but (lowering her voice, as if fearful of being overheard) as he was devoted to another, ſhe thought it was becoming her character to relinquiſh her claims; ſhe wiſhed, indeed, that Edward and Miſs Clifford had ſooner underſtood the nature of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual attachment—But perhaps they might have much to plead in their own defence; and that, for her part, though ſhe was at a loſs to trace the origin of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity which had overtaken her, and could not juſtly accuſe herſelf of intentional error, yet ſhe wiſhed ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery body well. That they need not be reduced to the neceſſity of abandoning the country; for if ſhe could but obtain one of thoſe moſs-grown caverns, which ſhe had heard were ſo numerous in the dominion of Old Ocean's God, in thoſe watery abodes ſhe would ſeek her deceaſed father; poſſibly too, her ſupplications might draw down the ſainted ſpirit of her injured mother; and if ſhe might be permitted to take with her the darling boy, for whom her laſt ſigh would ariſe, they would be a family of love—ſhe would ſoothe the woe-fraught boſoms of her parents—ſhe would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for her infant ſon an oozy bed, the ſea-green turf ſhould pillow his little head, and, by the murmuring waters of ſome coral grove, he ſhould be lulled to reſt.</p>
                     <p>Hamilton, agonized beyond expreſſion, in the fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy of the moment, would have put a period to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; but by Serafina, who is ever preſent to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he was wooed, and awed to ſome degree of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure.</p>
                     <p>Serafina, by the aſſiſtance of a faithful female, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted Margaretta to her chamber; and, while ſhe
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:034162_0205_0FFC654D5BEBC038"/>
offered up to Heaven her ſilent and fervid vows for the perfect reſtoration of her friend, ſhe availed herſelf of the idea ſhe entertained that ſhe was her mother; and, aſſuming the mildly commanding air, ſhe had ſo frequently obſerved Mary to wear, ſhe gently remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, preſſed and ſoothed, until ſhe had placed Mrs. Hamilton upon her pillow, when, ſeizing the exact criſis, in the ſofteſt key, ſhe proceeded to chaunt the moſt plaintive, harmonizing and dulcet ſtrains, within the compaſs of her muſical voice, until ſhe beheld the diſordered mourner embraced by thoſe ſlumbers, from which ſhe doubted not ſhe would awake, in the full poſſeſſion of her charming intellects. Having thus ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuated this ſalutary purpoſe, leaving Margaretta to an attendant, her next care was to rejoin Hamilton.</p>
                     <p>It was impoſſible not to underſtand the nature of the ſuſpicions, which, it was apparent, had ſo deeply impreſſed the ſoul of Margaretta; and a retroſpection convinced them, that even in the boſom of apathy, reaſon, from a variety of circumſtances, would have originated conjectures. Edward acknowledged, that a deſperate diſeaſe demanded a deciſive remedy; he trembled for the conſequences; but his deareſt hopes now pointed out the moſt unreſerved confidence. Alas! had he known the heart of my daughter, how many pangs he might have ſpared her. But the lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited pages of this publication forbid remarks.</p>
                     <p>Serafina, obtaining full power to act agreeably to her own diſcretion, returned to the chamber of Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta, fraught with a ſovereign ſpecific for her wounded ſpirit; when, diſmiſſing the girl, and ſeating herſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide her, ſhe impatiently waited her releaſe from that ſalutary repoſe, to which ſhe had been ſo ſolicitous to conſign her.</p>
                     <p>Margaretta at length opened her grief-ſwoln eyes; the traces of deep-felt melancholy were viſible in her countenance; but reaſon, it was evident, had reſumed her operations, and the expreſſion of every feature was deſcriptive of a mild and affecting kind of reſignation.</p>
                     <p>"How are you, my ſweet friend?" ſoothingly queſtioned Serafina.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="207" facs="unknown:034162_0206_0FFC654BD89198B8"/>
"Not well, Serafina;" returned Margaretta; and, after a moment's pauſe, letting fall ſome tears, in an affecting tone of voice, ſhe added; <q>I am, Miſs Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, the daughter of misfortune; my parentage was early announced; and though the interpoſition of my bleſſed friends and benefactors, would, by adopting me into their family, have ſnatched from me the bitter cup of adverſity, yet, to ſtruggle againſt the unalterable decrees of an all-wiſe Providence, it is in vain we aſſay!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Serafina, inexpreſſibly affected, delayed not her rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edy, but immediately taking her hand, which ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with her tears, ſhe delivered herſelf to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing effect:—</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>You are undoubtedly an angelic woman; hardly any lot could be conſidered as fully adequate to your uncommon merit; yet, if my admeaſurement of the mind of Margaretta is juſt, the ſecret which I have to communicate, will baniſh from her boſom its moſt corroding ſorrows.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall make my recital in as few words as poſſible; and, although I may criminate the everlaſtingly abſent, yet I will not be ſo unjuſt to myſelf, as to ſuppoſe that the fact which I have to ſtate, will leſſen me in your eſteem. The boſom of my Margaretta is the natal habitation of candour; and, while I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her that Edward Hamilton and myſelf, owe our being to the ſame father, the ſenſation that is moſt prevalent in my breaſt, is a pleaſing kind of conſcious pride.</p>
                        <p>While Mr. Hamilton, the elder, tranſacted buſineſs in Europe, he ſaw and diſtinguiſhed my unfortunate mother. A circumſtantial narrative of the tender, though unwarrantable connexion, which was the conſequence, you will find in theſe ſheets, <hi>which are the hand-writing of my father; the characters are familiar to your eye,</hi> and I yield them cheerfully to the peruſal of ſome ſerene hour.</p>
                        <p>It appears, that the only fault of which my ill-fated mother could be accuſed, was her unjuſtifiable and
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:034162_0207_0FFC65489D544530"/>
fatal attachment to my father: the ſtruggles of her ſoul were great; her ſufferings were accumulated; a number of <hi>extenuating facts</hi> the narrative faithfully records; and the filial feelings of a daughter's heart, naturally ſuggeſt a perſuaſion, that when, at the moment of my birth, ſhe yielded up her life, the ſacrifice may be regarded as an expiation for her indiſcretion.</p>
                        <p>My father called me by her name; and, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to America, preſented me, then only ſix months old, to his lady, as an orphan, whoſe perſon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune were entruſted to his care by her expiring pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and to whom he was determined to diſcharge the part of a tender and faithful guardian.</p>
                        <p>The ſoul of Mrs. Hamilton was the ſeat of <hi>unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting virtue,</hi> and ſhe received me to the boſom of commiſerating affection; but I had not paſſed my third year, when this excellent lady was ſummoned to the manſion prepared for her; and my father ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed no ſecond vows. The attention which he paid to my education, hath often been remarked to you; and though, until I had completed my twelfth year, I viewed him only as my guardian friend, yet upon the tablets of my heart the ſincereſt veneration for his character was inſcribed. Edward, born dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the abſence of his father, had only one year the advantage of me, and it was on the twelfth return of my natal day, that, leading us to his library, and putting into my hands thoſe papers, which I have now committed to yours, he thus expreſſed himſelf: Receive—Serafina Clifford—and the big tear rolled down his venerable cheek—receive the recital of your mother's woes. I have marked, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed and anxious kind of pleaſure, the uncommon attachment by which my children diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yours is the age of innocence, and your affections bud on the ſtem of virtue; but a little on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the paſſions of youth too often aſſume a baleful and fatal hue—theſe, alas! may perhaps pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate you into a gulph of ruin—I judge it
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:034162_0208_0FFC654608042B78"/>
proper to commit to you a <hi>ſecret</hi>—that I command you never, but in an hour of <hi>unavoidable neceſſity,</hi> to divulge—<hi>Know, Edward Hamilton, that Serafina Clifford is your ſiſter; ſhe is the daughter of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—Know, Serafina Clifford, that Edward Hamilton is your brother; he is the ſon of your father; and upon the heads of my children may the bleſſings of Heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend!</hi> Here the emotions of his ſoul became too big for utterance; he was unwilling to ſubmit them even to the eye of duteous affection, and he haſtily withdrew.</p>
                        <p>For us, our boſoms were awake only to the ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſenſations of ſurpriſe and joy. I, for my part, never experienced a rapture ſo ſincere; and, no longer reſtrained by the preſence of our father, we flew into each other's arms, eager to exchange thoſe vows of eternal amity, which we have ever ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably obſerved.</p>
                        <p>With one half of his ample fortune, my father, by gifts, inveſtitures and laſt teſtament, ſcrupulouſly endowed me; and, as I enjoy no maternal inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, my every pecuniary emolument is derived from him: Yet, he ſo well concerted his meaſures, as to lead every one concerned to imagine, that he was only relinquiſhing a truſt that had been repoſed in him.</p>
                        <p>The remainder of my account I ſhall paſs rapidly over. When Mr. Courtland's pretenſions were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently approbated by you, my brother, ſtruggling in vain to riſe ſuperior to an attachment, which he then deemed unfortunate, ſought a remedy in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and, flying for refuge to the ſouthern States, melancholy, and almoſt deſpairing, he aſſayed the various rounds of diſſipation; gaming became his favourite amuſement; and, in a few weeks, it is ſcarcely credible what immenſe ſums of money were ſquandered! Mortifying embarraſſments were the conſequence; and had it not been for the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary interpoſition of a friend of uncommon merit, his immediate ruin would have ſucceeded.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="210" facs="unknown:034162_0209_0FFC6541D03064D8"/>
Viewing himſelf, however, as young, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, he was prepared to meet the frowns of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and ſuppoſing he had obtained the cure of a paſſion, that had gained ſtrength with almoſt every added year of his life, he returned home, well pleaſed with his expedition. The event proved what an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous calculation he had made; and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your hand at the altar, he truſted that future ſucceſſes, economy and application, would retrieve his affairs. What ſhall I ſay?—every month he hath accumulated misfortunes; and the rapid decline of his finances hath operated as a ſevere check upon his deareſt pleaſures. When you communicated to him your expectation of augmenting his felicity, by preſenting him an invaluable pledge of love, he was then ſtruggling under the preſſure of a recent diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; he reflected upon himſelf as a prodigal, who had waſted the patrimony of the unborn. You muſt recollect his unguarded and impaſſioned expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, with the alarming effects which they produced upon you. He accuſes himſelf as a wretch who hath deceived you; and he is miſerable. The generous forbearance of his ſouthern friend, hath hitherto up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him; but that benevolent creditor hath himſelf become a bankrupt, and the ſtate of my brother's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs can no longer be concealed. My lovely ſiſter muſt ſoon have known, that her huſband is ſome thouſands in arrears, which he hath not a ſhilling to diſcharge. My fortune would completely reinſtate him; often have I tendered it—Interrupt me not, my love;—for Margaretta was eager to expreſs her feelings; I have written, I have repeatedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated: To effectuate this favourite purpoſe of my ſoul, I have revolved a variety of plans; my nights have been ſpent in tears, and my days in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to conceal from you my chagrin.</p>
                        <p>Edward is withheld, by falſe principles of delicacy, from availing himſelf of what the laws of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but for the regulations of his father, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have inveſted him with: Gladly would I
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:034162_0210_0FFC65404DBCCCC8"/>
commit myſelf wholly into the hands of my brother. The good or evil which awaits him, I would wiſh to ſhare; I would have but one intereſt between us, and I would be regarded only as the ſiſter of his heart.</p>
                        <p>But for him, he ſtyles himſelf a wretch who hath deceived and betrayed you, and, under this appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſhuns your preſence; he cannot bear to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before your parents, the victim of extravagance; he meditates abſconding from. America, and if he cannot be induced to relinquiſh his deſign, his ſiſter will bear him company in exile: But if matters can be adjuſted, Edward may receive my intereſt, at leaſt as a loan. If Margaretta can forgive, and will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my auxiliary, ſhe may yet poſſeſs tranquillity; and ſhe will enſure to herſelf the eternal gratitude of two perſons, who will, upon all occaſions, devote themſelves to the promotion of her felicity.</p>

                     <p>As Miſs. Clifford proceeded in her narrative, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetta had quitted her couch; ſhe had continued highly agitated, traverſing up and down her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now her claſped hands, raiſed eyes, and accel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated movements, expreſſed the big emotions which ſtruggled in her boſom; now ſhe threw abroad her hands in admiration, and now raiſed them to Heaven, in a delirium of joy: Vehemently ſeizing the firſt pauſe, ſhe repeated—<q>
                           <hi>Tranquillity!</hi>—Gracious God!—Can Serafina Clifford Hamilton—my divine ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—my angel friend—my peace-ſpeaking, hope in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring genius—can <hi>ſhe give ſo cold a term to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatic rapture of this bliſsful moment?</hi> Creator, and Almighty Preſerver of my life, how have I deſerved this fullneſs of felicity, which, like a mighty torrent, now burſts upon me? O Edward! my <hi>faultleſs, my injured huſband!</hi> but inſtantly, on my knees, I will ſupplicate the benign tenderneſs of that manly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, to intercede in my favour.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Margaretta glided through the paſſage—Hamilton met her in an adjoining chamber; where, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed and anxious ſpirit, he had waited the reſult of what he termed the criſis of his fate. It was not in
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:034162_0211_0FFC653CD04EF8F8"/>
his power to prevent the humble poſture of his charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wife; Margaretta bent before him; and, with ſtreaming eyes and ſupplicating hands, beſought his pardon for the error, into which a haſty, inexperienced and ſuſpicious ſpirit had precipitated her. Edward in vain aſſayed to raiſe her; by the events of the day her reaſon was ſtill in a degree diſordered, and ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon receiving her forgiveneſs in form.</p>
                     <p>"My God!" cried Edward, flinging himſelf beſide her, <q>this is too much; receive once more your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Hamilton; endeavour to eraſe from thy lovely boſom every painful remembrance of his paſt irregularities, and you may then number him among the happieſt of human beings. Dearer to my ſoul than the light of heaven, my Margaretta hath ever been: All amiably conſiſtent; and mildly good as ſhe is, ſhe hath not, ſhe never could be found in a reprehenſible walk; and conſequently, her huſband muſt have marked her progreſs with an approbating eye; conſequently, he can have nothing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, nothing to forgive.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The appearance of Miſs Clifford ſuſpended the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> tender contention; and Margaretta embraced the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of haſting to impart to us, the aſtoniſhing change which had taken place in her favour.</p>
                     <p>The ſubſequent ſcene, in my reading parlour, nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally reſulted; and, I only add, that if there are, who do not greatly admire, and highly applaud the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal demonſtrations of joy, with which my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter received the knowledge, that ſhe muſt relinquiſh the independence of affluence, and deſcend to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling grade, which <hi>ſcanty and precarious circumſtances enrolls,</hi>—I pity the frigidity of their boſoms.</p>

                     <p>MY mind, much occupied and greatly exerciſed, by the deranged ſtate of Mr. Hamilton's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, together with ſome other very painful and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lacerating events, hath not found itſelf at liberty to purſue, with wonted avidity, its accuſtomed avocations.</p>

lately picked up, in one of my ſolitary rambles; and which, being without a ſignature, it is not in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to reſtore, in any other way, to its original proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. The ſentiments and language of this little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, are evidently the devout and ſpontaneous breathings of a chriſtianized mind. And, as I think that the piece, altogether, may properly enough be characterized, a Eulogy upon the month of December, I have choſen to chriſten this Gleaner by the name of that celebrious portion of time.</p>
                     <p>[<hi>Here followeth the Paper.</hi>]</p>
                     <p>"DECEMBER—it is true thou haſt been fruitful to me of misfortunes; many a time haſt thou lacerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my boſom, by raviſhing from me my deareſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; thou haſt ſtabbed me in the tendereſt part, and thy broadly wild and congealing eye hath ſeemed to glut itſelf with my tears; into thy frozen ear it is in vain that I have poured my ſorrows; harder than adamant, thou ſeemeſt to arreſt the ſtream of pity, and thou regardeſt my lamentations with ſtern and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting ſeverity; thy ſtorms have been as a whirlwind to my ſoul; and thy tempeſts, up-rooting my peace, have well near whelmed, beneath the barren heaths of deſpair, my every hope.</p>
                     <p>Fell Deſpoiler I have called thee—for thy hoary viſage hath ſtill for me been marked with terror—But hark! what ſweet voice is that which iſſues from yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Angel of peace?—it ſoothes my ſpirit by the moſt conſolatory aſſurances—reaſon and religion it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines—with the Shepherd of Iſrael the commiſſion originates—and, with bland and gentle pity, deep in my boſom it implants immortal Hope.</p>
                     <p>December—bleſt era!—thou art the natal month of the <hi>Saviour of the world—Let thy winds convey my individual ſufferings</hi> to that oblivion, to which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer hath, eventually, conſigned the woes of the exonerated children of men.</p>
                     <p>To the private conſiderations of corroding ſorrow, let me no longer liſten—Let me gird up the loins of
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:034162_0214_0FFC653553715350"/>
my mind, and look forward to that bliſsful conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the dawning of which was preſented in thy adminiſtration.</p>
                     <p>Hail! returning period—white-garbed month!—thou ſhalt ever be right welcome to my devoted bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom—Every moment which conſtitutes thy admeaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould be conſecrated as ſacred to the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined enjoyments of the ſoul—Henceforth, waving my accumulated griefs, I will love thy flaky footſteps—I will anticipate their approach; and my ſpirit ſhall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace itſelf, by a confiding view of the accompliſhment of that arrangement, which was deſignated in thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned round.</p>
                     <p>December—bleſt period!—moſt illuſtrious in the order of time!—thou containeſt the natal day of the Son of God—and thy broad encircling eye extendeſt from the man of paradiſe, to that infant who ſhall lateſt ſwell the ſigh of humanity.</p>
                     <p>Yes, I will love thy flaky footſteps—darkneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not overſhadow thee—Thy ſhades but ſerve to render the brightening ſplendours of thy courſe the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous. <hi>The natal day of the Son of God!</hi>—what records have engraven ſo ſtupendous, ſo ſalutary, ſo momentous a truth!—Thy hours regiſter his birth—the birth of the Prince of Peace—During thy prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, the Virgin brought forth her <hi>firſt-born ſon</hi>—and renovated nature ſmiled extatic—healing breezes chaſe the chills of winter—and celeſtial ſpirits cluſter round the haunts of men.</p>
                     <p>Soft as the vernal ſhower his doctrine diſtilled—and the plant of perfection attained maturity—From the ſtorm he is a Hiding Place—and the burning eye of Divine Juſtice can never pierce that invulnerable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velopement, by which he hath encompaſſed the ſons and daughters of men—Sickneſs fleeth before him, and imbecility dwelleth not with him—Evil ſhall be exterminated from his dominion—rectitude ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter unto him—peace ſhall erect an immortal ſtandard—and innocence, adorned with chaplets of equity, ſhall be the gift of the Moſt High.</p>

The deaf ſhall hear his voice—the blind ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his day, rejoicing—the lame ſhall ſpeed before him—the dead, even the dead, ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God—<hi>and they who hear ſhall live!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Bleſt thought!—<hi>the dead ſhall again be raiſed</hi>—And the hour approacheth, when, inmingling with depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſaints, we ſhall rejoin that privileged and beloved circle, over whoſe open graves we have poured the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs, unavailing and corroding ſtream of ſorrow—But from every eye every tear ſhall be wiped away—nor ſhall the wide extended univerſe contain a ſon or daughter of adverſity.</p>
                     <p>Such will be, <hi>ſuch is,</hi> the effects of his ſway, who firſt breathed in mortality during the diviſion of hours, which make up thy allotment. Hall, firſt of months! when I forget thy diſtinguiſhed auſpices may I be dead to the voice of the charmer—when I ceaſe to mark with gratulations thy annual return, may the bleſt ſounds uttered by the tongue of our holy, ſacred, and animating religion, no more vibrate upon my heavy ear.</p>
                     <p>Toward the cloſe of the month, which cloſeth our year, the Saviour was born—ſo, in the laſt day of time, when the divine arrangements are well near completed, the reſtitution of all things ſhall be made manifeſt, and the winding up of the great drama, bringing forward the accompliſhment of the deſigns of an all-wiſe Creator—Crimes of every kind ſhall be baniſhed from the family of man—the train of ills, which have infeſted the works of the Eternal Mind, ſhall accompany their origin; and ſin being annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, ſorrow ſhall be no more.</p>
                     <p>Evangelic month!—again I repeat it—ſurely I will love thy days, O December! and the event produced under thy domain ſhall ever be right precious to my ſoul!"</p>

                     <p>TAKING my ſeat, the other evening, in a front box at the play-houſe, I was, previous to the drawing up of the curtain, not a little amuſed by the chit-chat of a couple of ſprightly girls, who occupied ſeats at my right hand. The houſe, the company, and the expected entertainment, alternately engaged their attention. I found, by their converſation, that they, as well as myſelf, were ſtrangers in the metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, and that the witneſſing the repreſentation of a play, was rather an extraneous occurrence in their catalogue of enjoyments.</p>
                     <p>"In the name of wonder, ſiſter Peggy," exclaimed the youngeſt of the girls, "who is that figure that ſeems placed as a ſentinel over yonder avenue, and who is at the ſame time ſo curiouſly bandeaued, that one might be ready to imagine him juſt ſtarting off upon a game of blind-man's buff?" "That figure? ſiſter Clary," replied Peggy, "why that figure, my dear, is the figure of Juſtice." "O my conſcience, ſiſter," cried Clary, "<hi>Juſtice, do you ſay?</hi> Why ſurely, Peggy, you muſt have made a monſtrous blunder; for I have heard a thouſand and a thouſand times, that <hi>Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> was nothing but eyes, and that ſhe could ſee every way at once." "You are thinking of Argus, Clary: The poets indeed deſcribe him with his hundred eyes; but <hi>Juſtice,</hi> believe me, is always painted blind." "Poh, poh, Peggy, you are certainly in the wrong; or, if it is as you ſay, your great writers, or painters, or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, muſt certainly all have been in a dream: Why I would not ſuffer a blind man to chooſe me a ſet of ribbons, much leſs ſhould he decide upon a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:034162_0217_0FFC652EB3FEE1F0"/>
which involved my life, my character, or even my eſtate."</p>
                     <p>The girl's obſervation was the ſpontaneous lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of nature, and truth and nature are generally upon the ſame ſide.</p>
                     <p>How long my fair neighbours continued their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining confab. I know not, for the ingenuity of Clary, throwing me into a train of thinking, from which I was only rouſed by the appearance of the players, I unfortunately loſt the remainder of their remarks.</p>
                     <p>The ſentiments of the lively Clary are certainly authorized by reaſon. Fortune is deſcribed as blind; and ſhe is ſaid to beſtow her benefactions moſt capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly. The rich, it is thought, conſidered in the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate, derive not their claim to the diſtinctions with which they are inveſted, from the ſuffrage of virtue; Fortune is frequently laviſh of her favours to vice, while the good man is ſeen ſtruggling with all thoſe ills which are the accompaniments of penury. Yet did Fortune always thus deſignate, we might be ready to ſay ſhe had undoubtedly the gift of ſight, and that the depravity of her taſte led her to ſelect her favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites from the children of error. But to ſhield her god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſsſhip from a concluſion ſo derogatory to her mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al character, inſtances may be produced, where the votaries of rectitude baſk in the ſunſhine of her ſmiles; integrity is ſometimes crowned by her with affluence, and the upright, being liberally endowed, are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to adminiſter to the neceſſities of the ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of adverſity.</p>
                     <p>Fortune, moreover, is extremely variable in her diſpoſitions, and in the conſtant revolutions of her wheel, thoſe who are to-day ſtanding tip-toe, upon the higheſt eminence, may to-morrow be precipitated into the abyſs of entanglements, embarraſſments, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs deſpair. Ingenious therefore is the allegory which permits us to attribute the caprice of Fortune to her deficiency of viſion; and thoſe ancients were happy, who, thus regarding her diſtributions, conſoled themſelves in the deprivation of her favours, by the
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:034162_0218_0FFC652B2AD076E8"/>
poſſeſſion of that intrinſic worth, which it is not in the power of ſo uncertain a being to deſignate or to beſtow.</p>
                     <p>But whatever may be urged for veiling the optics of dame Fortune, is undoubtedly point blank againſt hood-winking the goddeſs Themis, or Juſtice. I am aware that the deciſions of Juſtice ſhould ever be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, and that her viſual ray is ſaid to be thrown into the ſhade, to prevent the bias in favour of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, that her judgment would otherwiſe have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but it ſhould be remembered that Juſtice, <hi>diveſt of fable,</hi> is one of the moſt dignified attributes of Deity; that it partakes the nature of its auguſt Original; and that it is, by conſequence, infinitely ſuperior to party.</p>
                     <p>Juſtice is enthroned far above all law, ſince no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man arrangements can take cognizance of every poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble event, and much muſt at all times be left to the ſpontaneous dictates of this illuſtrious vicegerent of Omnipotence.</p>
                     <p>Were I to perſonify Juſtice, inſtead of preſenting her <hi>blind,</hi> I would denominate her the goddeſs of fire; ſhe ſhould poſſeſs a ſubtle eſſence, which ſhould pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate through, and pervade the inmoſt receſſes of the ſoul; by every inſignia of light I would ſurround and deſignate her; while among the ornaments which compoſed her creſt, a broad and never cloſing eye ſhould ſtand conſpicuous; ſhe ſhould poſſeſs the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to unravel the knotty entanglements of the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticated web; piercing as the forked lightning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous and penetrating, ſhe ſhould diſcloſe, at a ſingle glance, the ſecret and crooked windings of the moſt profound labyrinth, while, patient and unerring, ſhe ſhould liſten with calmneſs to the various diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the intereſted claimant; and, careful to inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate, her deciſions ſhould always accord with her own important nature and office.</p>
                     <p>Uniform in her awards, neither youth, beauty, nor innocence, ſhould poſſeſs a charm to ſoften her firm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibility; dignity, age, the venerable head of ſnow, theſe ſhould not awe; adverſity ſhould not excite an
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:034162_0219_0FFC65298C0C1758"/>
                        <hi>improper compaſſion,</hi> nor ſhould the tears of the widow, or of the orphan, unduly perſuade. Of unbending integrity, Juſtice ſhould <hi>feel, hear and ſee,</hi> but <hi>truth</hi> alone ſhould be the pole ſtar, by which ſhe ſhould ſhape her movements, and equity only ſhould conſtrain her determinations. To the ravages of wayward paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſhe ſhould be at all times ſuperior; and her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration ſhould be under the regulation of wiſdom. Elevated beings are diſhonoured by the ſuppoſition, that they can poſſibly be influenced by improper or foreign repreſentations, and my delineation of Juſtice, armed at all points, ſhould be inacceſſible even to the <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> of imbecility.</p>
                     <p>Auguſt and dignified delegate of the great Firſt Cauſe! to thee the nations appeal, whatever form their governments may aſſume, whether democratical, repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, oligarchal, monarchical, or deſpotical—ſtill they are careful to give their doings the inveſtiture of thy ſacred name; they affect thy ſanction, they arreſt thy ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; the violation of thy laws, is the <hi>oſtenſible</hi> reaſon for the battles which they ſeek; and, aſſuming thy ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they anticipate ſucceſs, exulting in victories, which, agreeably to thy allotments, the iniquity of their cauſe may forbid their ever obtaining. Nor is the general diſpoſition of great events alone under thy direction; thou takeſt cognizance of the minutiae of human life, and with an unerring hand, thou directeſt all thoſe occurrences in the career of being, which the infidel is accuſtomed to aſcribe to the agency of a blind and undeſcribable chance. To thee the good man raiſes the eye of confidence; virtue is ſure of thy award; and the oppreſſed of all ages have flown to thee for refuge.</p>
                     <p>Thus far I had written, aiming, gentle reader, at thy amuſement—when Edward Hamilton looked in upon me. "You are buſy, Sir, and I will not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt you." No, my ſon, I have always leiſure to receive your viſits. Sit down, Sir, and unfold the tale, to which your perplexed countenance is a preface.</p>

"I come, Sir, to take your direction in regard to the line of conduct which the untoward ſtate of my affairs renders it proper for me to purſue." I threw down my pen which I had till then held in my fingers; and, graſping his hand, I eagerly exclaimed—<hi>Juſtice,</hi> Sir, <hi>Juſtice</hi> muſt be your guide—you are an excellent young man, Mr. Hamilton; and I am happy in the aſſurance, that you will find no difficulty in following the courſe of the radiant director, which I take the liberty to point out as the guardian of your every ſtep. Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as you are to me, Sir, your very fault, the occaſion conſidered, ſerving to intereſt me ſtill more in your happineſs, I could at this moment with pleaſure diveſt myſelf of my little inheritance in your favour: Start not, Sir, (for he was extremely agitated at this ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion) conſiderations of tenderneſs to the <hi>unborn,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid my taking this ſtep, and the poſſeſſions of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt be ſecured to the children of our Margaret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta. I approve much of your declining to avail your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the generoſity of Miſs Clifford. <hi>Juſtice</hi> would redden indignant at ſuch a ſacrifice. <hi>Nature,</hi> howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, legiſlators may have ordained, gave that young lady a right to the patrimony ſhe enjoys; and your fraternal affection ought not to ſuffer you to riſk prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, the loſs of which would render ſo amiable a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man dependent and uneaſy.</p>
                     <p>Such, my ſon, hath been the uniform integrity of your commercial tranſactions, that, to abridge you of your liberty, not a ſingle creditor will preſent himſelf. Poſſibly you might go on to accumulate arrears; but <hi>Juſtice,</hi> inflexible and unyielding <hi>Juſtice,</hi> muſt here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe; a full ſtatement of your embarraſſments, with an eſtimate of your poſſeſſions, muſt be immediately given in; not a ſingle article muſt be withheld; your family ſeat, which hath, for ſuch a number of years, continued the reſidence of hoſpitality, if you are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time to attempt its redemption, you will confeſs an obligation; meanwhile, it muſt be occupied to the beſt advantage; it may be converted into an annual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, which will conſiderably augment your finances;
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:034162_0221_0FFC65273384D3D8"/>
this houſe is large, and the hearts of your parents are open to receive you; hither, until the ſtorm be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blown, you muſt retire; and by the reſtoration of that ſociety, the loſs of which, I do aſſure you, we have not ceaſed ſecretly to regret, our domeſtic enjoyments will be inexpreſſibly advanced. <hi>Fortune is blind,</hi> and her diſpoſitions are extremely variable; you muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveringly purſue her; poſſibly ſhe may relent, and ſhould ſhe in future beſtow upon you her gifts, you muſt not fail to diſcharge, to the laſt farthing, every juſt demand which can be made upon you. I bleſs God that your own habits, and upright way of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will irreſiſtibly ſtimulate you upon this occaſion. Bankrupt and limitation acts may ſucceed each other, and all theſe may be very well in their place; but the honeſt man will hear the voice of Juſtice, he will bend his ear attentive to her pleadings, and Virtue will be the motto of his actions.</p>
                     <p>Fame once wafted to my ear, a little narrative, which indelibly impreſſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> mind; and I have never reflected upon it, without the accompaniment of an exquiſite kind of complacency. I will give it you, my ſon, as an example.</p>
                     <p>A gentleman, engaged in the mercantile line, had followed buſineſs with little ſucceſs; his integrity, his efforts, and his abilities were unqueſtionable, and for many years they enabled him to make head againſt a tide of misfortunes, which would have overwhelmed a common capacity; his creditors themſelves, well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the propriety and frugality of his arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, readily contributed the means, which his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued loſſes only converted into an accumulation of his arrears. Weary, at length, of a warfare that fate ſeemed to render ſo unequal, he ſummoned all thoſe to whom he ſtood indebted, and forcing upon them, according to the amount of their demands, an exact proportion of the intereſt which remained with him; after thus voluntarily diveſting himſelf of every ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of property, he found, to his great regret, that it was only adequate to the diſcharging of a very ſmall
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:034162_0222_0FFC6524DB40D268"/>
part of his arrears; he received, however, from his approbating creditors, receipts in full; and, thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onerated in the eſtimation of the law, he very ſoon made up his mind, relative to his future deſtination. A generous friend ſupplied him with a ſmall ſum, by the means of which he embarked upon a foreign voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; proſperous gales ſoon wafted him to his deſired port, and he preſented himſelf with ſuch credentials as he merited. Shakeſpeare ſays, there is a tide in men's affairs! he had embraced the favourable moment of opportunity; every thing he undertook was proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; all his tranſactions were marked and crowned by ſucceſs, and a few years ſaw him maſter of a very handſome property. He had kept no correſpondence with his friends during what he termed his period of exile; but he no ſooner attained that independence, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which his noble ſpirit had ſo long and ſo ardently ſighed, than he departed in a ſhip of his own, richly freighted, full ſpeed for his native country. Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his return was conveyed to his creditors, through the medium of a card, ſoliciting their preſence at a public houſe, to partake of an entertainment which he had ordered for them. His creditors remembered him as an unfortunate, but an honeſt man, whoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival they ſhould gladly welcome, and they obeyed with avidity his ſummons. The firſt compliments were marked by mutual expreſſions of ſatisfaction, and from the lips of the welcome claimants the warmeſt gratulations ſpontaneouſly iſſued. A ſuperb dinner, with much elegance, was ſerved up, and the covers being removed, the bottle was briſkly puſhed about; but who can expreſs their aſtoniſhment, when, in the midſt of their hilarity, every man was preſented with the full ſum he had ſo formally relinquiſhed, together with every ſhilling of intereſt, which would have been legally due, had they received promiſſory notes inſtead of the releaſes they had ſo voluntarily given! A gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous contention immediately enſued; but our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant convincing his friends of his ability, they finally yielded to his remonſtrances.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="224" facs="unknown:034162_0223_0FFC6521A5DE5218"/>
They were, however, determined to exhibit a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their admiration and their gratitude; and they ſolicited and obtained permiſſion of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to erect, in a public ſtand, a magnificent obeliſk, the faces of which were inſcribed with the name of the upright debtor, and with a circumſtantial account of the whole tranſaction.</p>
                     <p>How much more honorary is a virtuous fame, than the poſſeſſion of houſes or of lands. The law was not made for the votaries of integrity; their own feelings are ſufficient to them as a rule of action; and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> unerring <hi>Juſtice,</hi> is the great ſtandard of their lives.</p>

                     <p>THE various parterres, now putting forth their promiſing buds, in many ſections, in this our country, looks with a very favourable aſpect upon a man of my profeſſion; and I cannot but hope, that in the occupation of a Gleaner, I ſhall be able to cull many a fragrant flower, wherewith to compoſe a bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, that may throw an agreeable perfume over the leiſure hours of the ſentimental ſpeculator.</p>

<pb n="225" facs="unknown:034162_0224_0FFC651FDBA9AA40"/>
in the courſe of my perambulations, pick up many obſervations, that may poſſibly ſerve for the amuſement of my readers.</p>
                     <p>The great queſtion which does, and <hi>ought</hi> to occupy the mind of every patriotic moraliſt, is the <hi>utility</hi> of licenſed ſtage-playing. Perhaps I may as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the word <hi>licenſed;</hi> for, in the preſent enlightened era and adminiſtration of liberty, the citizen would hardly conſent to an abridgment of thoſe amuſements, the evil tendency of which could not be unequivocally demonſtrated to his underſtanding; and the late ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in the State of Maſſachuſetts, evinces the futility of erecting barriers, not ſubſtantiated by reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The law in that State was outraged in its very face: the flimſy ſubterfuge of <hi>moral lectures</hi> deceived no one; and though, as I am informed, the theatrical prohibition is but <hi>partially repealed reſpecting the Boſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, and remains in full force upon the reſt of the State,</hi> yet it is notorious, that itinerant players are conſtantly marching and counter-marching from town to town, to the no ſmall diverſion of the good people of this very reſpectable member of the Union. But, without preſuming to intermeddle with the policy of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, my deſign is, to hazard a few remarks upon the ſubject in general.</p>
                     <p>As I abhor the domination of prejudice, and, upon the ſtrongeſt conviction, regard it as a tyrant, that if once brought to the guillotine, would <hi>(provided it is not of the Hydra kind)</hi> leave an opening for the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of an era far more friendly to the progreſs of <hi>genuine</hi> and <hi>corrected</hi> liberty, than the murder of all the <hi>humane, virtuous,</hi> and <hi>religious princes in the univerſe;</hi> ſo I moſt ſincerely deprecate its deſpotiſm; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſeat myſelf, with the pen of inquiry, I am ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to raiſe a rebellion againſt encroachments, that, however ſanctioned by time, cannot, in my opinion, be conſidered in a court of equity, as legal or natural. The objections to theatrical amuſements are many and plauſible. I pretend not to decide for others; I would only inveſtigate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="226" facs="unknown:034162_0225_0FFC651D77BDB6E0"/>
If I miſtake not—<hi>Waſte of time—Imprudent expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditures—Encouragement of idleneſs</hi>—and, <hi>Relaxation of morals,</hi> ſtand foremoſt in the catalogue of objections.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prodigality of time,</hi> is indeed an irremediable evil; and if it can be proved, that an hour devoted to the theatre would certainly have been appropriated to any beneficial employment, for which no moment of leiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure will in future preſent, I, for one, ſhall be impelled to allow the validity of the allegation; and, I do hereby inveſt ſuch plea with full authority to detain every ſuch perſon from all dramatical repreſentations whatever: But, with the ſame breath I contend, that thoſe evenings which are immolated at the ſhrine of Bacchus, which are loitered in a tavern, in unneceſſary goſſiping, cards, ſcandal, and the numerous vagaries of faſhion, will be <hi>comparatively redeemed,</hi> if marked by an entertainment ſo incontrovertibly rational.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The complaint of exorbitant expenditures,</hi> is of a ſimilar deſcription. A friend of mine, who reſided for ſome time abroad, once informed me, that he had frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been ſtopped, when in full career to the play-houſe, by a conſideration that the indulgence he was about to procure himſelf, would ſupply ſome tearful ſufferer with bread, for at leaſt one whole week. Now, all ſuch perſons, provided they can make it appear, they are not in the uſe of any <hi>as expenſive and more ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous gratification,</hi> ſhall be releaſed, upon their parole given, that they will abſolutely and <hi>bona fide</hi> employ their ſix ſhillings to the aforeſaid purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>To the third objection I cannot allow the ſmalleſt weight: <hi>Who, I would aſk, are the Idlers?</hi> Perhaps there is no mode of life which requires more aſſiduous and laborious application, than that of a <hi>good</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent</hi> actor.

devoted to ſtudy: By frequent repetitions, ſuch is the conſtitution of the mind, the fineſt ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments too often pall; and the well informed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and meritorious performer is in danger of loſing his taſte for the higheſt mental enjoyments; while the entertainment which he produces for oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is the reſult of unremitted and painful labour to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Why then, permit me to aſk, if he is ſolicitous to blend, with our amuſements, the higheſt poſſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement; if he profeſſedly purſues the means of living; if his manners and his morals are unblemiſhed; and if, by becoming ſtationary, he in effect takes rank with our citizens—why, I aſk, is he <hi>ſo lightly eſteemed?</hi> Surely, if, under the influence of reaſon, of gratitude and impartiality, I muſt unheſitatingly acknowledge, perſons ardently engaged in procuring for us a <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional entertainment,</hi> are entitled to a <hi>degree of genuine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,</hi> to encouragement, and even to patronage.</p>
                     <p>It is aſſerted, and the aſſertion does not appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, that a <hi>virtuous theatre</hi> is highly influential in regulating the opinions, manners, and morals of the populace.</p>
                     <p>Here we are naturally led to the fourth and laſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of our ſubject.</p>

I take it for granted, that none but a <hi>virtuous and well regulated theatre</hi> will be tolerated. In the ſouthern and middle States, Philadelphia particularly, no performance can make its appearance upon the ſtage, without paſſing under the previous examination of the governor and two other reſpectable magiſtrates, who, by their avowed appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, become reſponſible to the public for the merit of the piece. Similar reſtrictions will, perhaps, be adopted, wherever the Drama ſhall progreſs; and my confidence in the truſtees of the Boſton theatre, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to my view every apprehenſion, not only as ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, but abſolutely injurious.</p>

Virtue then will be adorned with all her native love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and vice exhibited, deformed and miſhapen, as that deteſted hag, which Milton's energetic pen hath ſo hideouſly pourtrayed. Is there a boſom that will not haſten to embrace the one? Is there a mind that will not ſhrink with horror from the other? The man of firmneſs, of principle, and of worth innate; the mild, the conſiſtent, the regular, the maternal fair one; theſe ſhall be rewarded with burſts of heart-felt applauſe; while the imbecile or irreſolute votary of error, the unprincipled betrayer, the fraudulent villain, the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, perverſe and abandoned female; theſe <hi>charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> ſhall be ſtigmatized with reproach, exhibited in their native atrocity, and ſet up as beacons to deter our young people from purſuing a path, which will render them odious to every perſon poſſeſſed of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and virtue.</p>
                     <p>Socrates, Cicero, and even Cato, have mingled with the audience in a theatre; and as it is preſumed that the buffoonery of an Ariſtophanes will not be tolerated upon an American ſtage, it is pleaſingly believed, that the dignity of years, of wiſdom, and of virtue, will, in no inſtance, be outraged by the children of the Drama.</p>
                     <p>The Pompeys of our day, it is to be hoped, will learn many a uſeful leſſon; they will commence ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in the ſchool of the <hi>rights of man;</hi> and, becoming proficients in the laws of equity and of nature, like the Roman general, they will retire from the theatre, converts to the virtuous and impartial deſignations of equality.</p>
                     <p>Religious worſhip, it is ſaid, gave birth to the Drama; and under proper regulations, it may ſtill conduce to acts of devotional piety. To Athens and to Rome, the theatre became a ſource of information, refined perception, and genuine morality; and we have only to avoid the cauſes which finally produced its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy in the elder world, to continue it among us, in theſe States, an excellent exemplar and preſervative of rectitude. The theatre opens a wide field for litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exertions; and we anticipate a rich harveſt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual

pleaſure and improvement. The ſons and daughters of fancy, the ſentimentaliſt, and the moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt; theſe will engage in the intereſting competition. They will conſider that their productions are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended barely for the amuſement of a ſolitary hour; that the Drama, pointing every excellence, will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print upon the heart the ſentiment of worth; that it may be in their power to faſhion, and to lead, a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional taſte;</hi> that by <hi>exalting virtue, and adorning reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, rendering vice diſguſting, and ſtigmatizing infidelity,</hi> they will moſt effectually ſecond the endeavours of that revered body, profeſſedly engaged to beautify mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and elevate religion.</p>
                     <p>We truſt that a ſpirit of <hi>laudable emulation</hi> will be excited; and while the ſummit of fame, in brighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſpective, uprears its wreath-crowned head, writers will be animated to the ſplendid career, and with glowing ardour they will haſten forward to the deſired goal. How delightful the employ! the mind, while engaged in painting the native charms of genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and philanthropic religion, catching the fervour of divine inſpiration, will neceſſarily become rectified and ameliorated by the delineation. Rectitude, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned by her ſiſter graces, heaven-born contentment, conſequent felicity, and ever blooming joy—theſe will captivate every beholder. Economy, attired by her handmaid competence, with ſerene tranquillity, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to view the peace reflecting mirror, will not fail of reclaiming from the paths of profligacy the moſt diſſipated wanderer; and frugality and equity will remain prevalent in the mind. Nor will the exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vice be unattended with its ſalutary effects. Conviction will be pointed to the boſom of the aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor; the deformity of atrocious offences, ſtriking by illuſtrating examples, will preſent the diſguſting figure, which the conſcious culprit will aſſuredly recognize, and the probability is, that abhorrence and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will enſue.</p>
                     <p>Shakeſpeare, that penetrating obſerver, ſkilful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigator, and indiſputable judge of the human heart,

makes his Hamlet ſay, "<hi>I've heard, that guilty creatures, at a play, have, by the very cunning of the ſcene, been ſtruck ſo to the ſoul, that preſently they have proclaimed their male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions. I'll have theſe players play ſomething like the murder of my father, before my uncle.</hi>" And again; "<hi>The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the conſcience of the king.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>If it may be preſumed, that the ſtated objections, thus conſidered, are obviated, I conceive it will not be denied that, from a <hi>chaſte and diſcreetly regulated</hi> thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, many attendant advantages will indiſputably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. Young perſons will acquire a refinement of taſte and manners; they will learn to think, ſpeak, and act, with propriety; a thirſt for knowledge will be originated; and from attentions, at firſt, perhaps, conſtituting only the amuſement of the hour, they will gradually proceed to more important inquiries.</p>
                     <p>Clarinda Meanwell, the daughter of a gentleman whom I highly reſpect, whoſe education hath been upon the very beſt plan, continued nevertheleſs, for the firſt twenty years of her life, without manifeſting the ſmalleſt literary curioſity. It was impoſſible to intereſt her, even in the pages of a novel; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe learned, was more the reſult of a diſpoſition naturally conceding, than of voluntary application. A company of itinerant players viſited her native vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage; the night of exhibition was announced, <hi>every body,</hi> as they phraſed it, was going; but Miſs Clarinda could not be animated to a wiſh for the entertainment; her accuſtomed complacency of diſpoſition yielded her, however, the companion of her aſſociates; the piece was intereſting; it forcibly ſeized her faculties; it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, to <hi>her,</hi> in every ſenſe, the charms of novelty; for the world ſhe would not be abſent upon any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture occaſion. In the courſe of the day preceding a theatrical entertainment, that ſhe might the better comprehend the ſeveral parts, the play-book was in her hand, a laudable ſpirit of inquiry obtained in her boſom, and with amazing rapidity ſhe ran through, and compaſſed the ſenſe of every volume within her

reach. Hiſtory, geography, aſtronomy—in all theſe, her proficiency is prodigious; and, in one word, I hardly know a better informed, or more amiable young woman in the circle of my acquaintance. But Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda Meanwell is not a ſolitary inſtance; and as I have very frequently obſerved the good effects of dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical repreſentations, I truſt that my readers are enough acquainted with a heart, the feelings of which I have, upon various occaſions, eſſayed to ſketch, to give me full <hi>credit,</hi> for that throb of deep-felt compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, which I experienced upon receiving informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the elegant and ſuperb theatre, which hath ſo recently been erected for the reception of the Drama, in the State of Maſſachuſetts.</p>
                     <p>And here, gentle reader, I would with all my ſoul gratify thee by a full and complete deſcription of this well built and beautifully decorated manſion of the Muſes—ſuch as it appeared upon the firſt drawing up of the curtain; but from the multiplicity of ideas which then crowded the mind, it is impoſſible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare an accurate deſcription, and as I <hi>write for poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> I would not willingly leave a ſingle pillar, capital, architrave, entablature, or cornice, unnoted: Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture opportunies may preſent, and, if I am not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled, a future Gleaner may delineate the building. My brother Ruſſell hath already informed thee, that "the houſe was filled from the loweſt note to the top of the compaſs;" and his obſervations upon the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be recognized by truth. The long expected era arrived; it was indeed replete with expectation—the interpoſing veil was thrown back, and that pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing actor, whoſe eulogy hath been ſo frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, made his entrance amid the moſt unequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal demonſtrations of ſatisfaction which a ſenſible, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating, and admiring aſſembly could exhibit. The effects of a reception, which muſt have been every way adequate to his wiſhes, were pleaſingly evinced, by a ſuſceptibility honorary to the manly character; and the prologue then firſt vibrated upon the public ear,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:034162_0231_0FFC650B3AAF8770"/>
with every advantage, which that truly claſſical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance ſo indiſputably merits.</p>
                     <p>That this prefatory addreſs is a genuine prologue, notwithſtanding every objection which hath been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, I take leave to affirm. What can ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be conſtituted the harbinger of a dramatic perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as a ſuccinct account of that drama it is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to introduce? and what ſo natural for a general dedication of a theatre, as a delineation of the prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs of the art, to which it is conſecrated? If variety, and richneſs of imagery, claſſical alluſions, found mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, nervous expreſſions, beauty of diction, and much information, conſtitute a firſt rate poem, the prologue is certainly inveſted with the faireſt pretenſions to the honorary palm. To point out all its beauties, it would be neceſſary to inſert the compoſition entire; yet I cannot forbear repeating the following charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly figurative lines:
<q>
                           <l>Warm to the heart the chymic fiction ſtole,</l>

                        </q>
And again,
<q>
                           <l>The globe's proud butcher grew humanely brave!</l>
                           <l>Earth ſtaunch'd her wounds, and ocean huſh'd his wave.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The alluſion to the general deluge is ſtrikingly and inimitably beautiful. The poet was moſt happy in this thought: I think I have not ſeen it ſurpaſſed; and I queſtion if the Shakeſpearian panegyriſts have ever yet done that immortal bard more ample juſtice, than he hath received in theſe finely expreſſed lines:
<q>
                           <l>But hark! her mighty rival ſweeps the ſtrings:</l>
                           <l>Sweet Avon, flow not! 'tis thy Shakeſpeare ſings!</l>
                           <l>With Blanchard's wing, in Fancy's heaven he ſoars;</l>
                           <l>With Herſchel's eye, another world explores!</l>
                           <l>Taught by the tones of his melodious ſong,</l>
                           <l>The ſcenic muſes tun'd their barbarous tongue;</l>
                           <l>With ſubtle pow'rs the crudeſt ſoul refin'd,</l>
                           <l>And warm'd the Zembla of the frozen mind.</l>
                           <l>The world's new Queen, Auguſta, own'd their charms,</l>
                           <l>And claſp'd the Grecian nymphs in Britiſh arms.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have a ſtrong propenſity to go on tranſcribing; but, full many a time, hath the recollection of the
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:034162_0232_0FFC650985D27698"/>
ſtinted pages of a Magazine, damped the moſt fervid wiſhes of my ſoul. Mr. Paine hath certainly done himſelf great honour; and I congratulate my country on the poſſeſſion of a genius, which, in the very morn of manhood, hath boldly ſeized the <hi>golden fruit</hi> of maturity. The Poet muſt doubtleſs feel himſelf much exhilerated, as he contemplates the well earned <hi>guerdon</hi> of ſuperior talents; yet I dare ſay that he will wear his honours with becoming meekneſs; and when it is remembered, that Sophocles, the illuſtrious ornament and patron of the Grecian drama, abſolutely <hi>died of joy,</hi> upon obtaining from his competitors the prize of merit, adjudged him for one of his tragedies, our youthful hard will be tolerated in a conſiderable expanſion of pleaſurable feelings.</p>
                     <p>The play was admirably choſen; it is a <hi>time hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured piece;</hi> and it contains many ſentiments, which can never reverberate upon the ear of ſenſibility with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking to the fineſt feelings of the ſoul. In the very firſt ſcene, in the firſt act, our attention is forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly arreſted, and we cannot avoid taking the deepeſt intereſt in the diſguiſed hero, although immured in the mines of Dalecarlia; and while "<hi>ſtretch'd there, where reigns eternal night, the flint his pillow, and cold damps his coverings; yet we behold him bold of ſpirit, and robuſt of limb, throwing inclemency aſide, ſuperior to the lot of human frailty.</hi>" With Anderſon, ſpontaneouſly, "<hi>we breathe the voice of virtue, of cordial amity, from man to man, and that benignity that whiſpers to the ſoul, to ſeek and cheer the ſufferer.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>The ſentiments of Anderſon, of Arnoldus, and of Guſtavus, are the very ſoul of valour, benevolence, patriotiſm, and every ſhining virtue. The ſubſequent diſcovery, the entrance of Arvida—the tenderneſs, the amity of heroes is perſonified, and we experience an exquiſite ſatisfaction, in yielding our applauſe to thoſe Dalecarlians, of whom Guſtavus ſays, "<hi>I've ſearch'd theſe men, and find them like the ſoil, barren without, and to the eye unlovely; but they've their mines within them, and this the day I mean to prove them.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="234" facs="unknown:034162_0233_0FFC6507C18BD408"/>
The character of Criſtiern is a complete exemplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of whatever is deteſtable in a tyrant: Perhaps no language can more conciſely group the traits, which go to the compoſition of the inſufferable deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot, than the following: "<hi>Wretches! ſhall I go por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the earth, leſt my imperial foot ſhould tread on emmets?</hi>"</p>
                     <p>The trial of Arvida is admirably conceived; it was an ordeal adequate to the warrior, the lover, and the friend. In the ſtruggles which lacerate his manly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, we take a deep and affecting part, and every feeling of benevolence would inveſt him with that hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ied balm, which he ſo well deſcribes—"<hi>Yes, peace has ſweets that Hybla never knew: It ſleeps on down, cull'd gently from beneath the Cherub's wing—no bed for mortals—Man is warfare—all a hurricane within.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Chriſtina's deſcription of Guſtavus, is the breathings of virgin purity, and it cannot fail of captivating the boſom of virtue—"<hi>But,</hi> O Heaven, <hi>what then was my amazement!

<pb n="235" facs="unknown:034162_0234_0FFC65063B5BE858"/>
and he arreſts, from every ſentiment of the ſoul, the full tide of approbation. "<hi>Approach, my fellow ſoldiers, your Guſtavus claims no precedence here; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip like mine throws all reſpect behind it—'Tis enough—I read your joys, your tranſports in your eyes; and wou'd, O wou'd I had a life to ſpend for every ſoldier here! whoſe every life's far dearer than my own; dearer than aught, except your liberty, except your honour.</hi>" But it is not enough that Guſtavus is the finiſhed patriot and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted warrior; the milder virtues too are natal in his boſom: Suſpicion cannot take root in a ſoil ſo noble. "<hi>If thou haſt aught to urge againſt Arvida, the man of virtue, tell it not the wind, leſt ſlander catch the ſound, and guilt ſhould triumph.</hi>" The interview be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the matchleſs friends, is uncommonly high wrought, and ſupported too upon the beſt principles. Unlike our modern votaries of an <hi>illuſion,</hi> which they <hi>blaſphemouſly term honour,</hi> Guſtavus, innately elevated, eſteems it no diminution of his glory, to develop a myſtery, which was on the point of precipitating his Arvida into irretrievable ruin. How doth the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation dignify the hero, and how generouſly pathetic is his defence of the beguiled chief: "<hi>Unhappy man! my heart bleeds for thee: falſe I had ſurely been, had I like thee been tempted.</hi>" But the ſelf-reproach which had planted all its daggers in the boſom of Arvida, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims him the proper object of a hero's confidence, and we moſt ſincerely join iſſue in his concluſion: "<hi>Pardon can expiate; it is the lethean ſweet, the ſnow of heaven, new blanching o'er the black'ning front of guilt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>To the boſom of filial piety, the apology of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina is a neceſſary and timely relief: "<hi>Had I to death or bondage ſold my ſire, or had Guſtavus on our native realms made hoſtile inroad! then, my Mariana! had I then ſav'd him from the ſtroke of juſtice, I ſhould not ceaſe my ſuit for pardon.

lov'd, I might have ſtaid with honour.</hi>" This finiſhing of the character of Chriſtina, is unexpected, and, in my opinion, completes the beauty and ſymmetry of the performance.</p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible to give language to the feelings of an attentive and ſuſceptible audience during the rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentation of this maſterly compoſition. The finiſhed elegance of the building, the ſurrounding lights, the brilliant aſſembly, ſo ſtrikingly contraſting the ſtage ſcene, where was exhibited the country of Dalecarlia, the tents in perſpective, the hardy veterans, arrayed in martial order, paſſing in review, &amp;c. &amp;c. all this, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the novelty of arrangements, ſo far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing what we had ever before witneſſed, was, in truth, inexpreſſibly captivating.</p>
                     <p>The diſtant country of the admired chief ſeemed in reality extended to our view; and, for myſelf, I am free to own, that as I glanced my eye from the ſtage, to the throng of reſpectable citizens, occupying the pit, boxes, and galleries; as I obſerved the marked attention in the <hi>never deceptive eye,</hi> the ſolemn ſtillneſs, the tender tear upon the cheek of beauty, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid eye of manhood, with the alternate burſts of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, betokening <hi>congenial virtues</hi>—as I marked theſe effects, the agitation of my boſom became well near ungovernable.</p>
                     <p>On the performers, perhaps, I ought not to hazard a remark. As an American, <hi>comparatively new</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of this nature, I cannot be ſuppoſed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judge; yet, ſo complete was my ſatisfaction, that I did not hear without pain, that many individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als expreſſed diſpleaſure; and I can only account for this by a ſuppoſition that there expectations were too high raiſed to admit of gratification in the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of our Drama.</p>
                     <p>Surely it ought to be remembered, that the plant, however luxuriant, doth not, immediately on being removed to a foreign ſoil, continue its priſtine vigour; and candor hath already obſerved that the <hi>prohibited play then firſt</hi> arreſting the attention of the performers,
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:034162_0238_0FFC64FFAC9A2AC8"/>
could not, in ſo early an exhibition, obtain, in the rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentation, the perfection of which it is doubtleſs ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible. Yet we think it muſt be acknowledged, that Mr. Powell, in the character of Criſtiern, inſpired all thoſe abhorrent feelings which the poet intended to originate; that Mr. Jones ſupported with admirable kill the part of Trollio, and that the Swediſh prieſt, by ſo finely contraſting the treachery and baleful tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of the infamous biſhop, preſented to the mind a moſt agreeable relief. Such ſhould always figure a herald of genuine religion.</p>
                     <p>Gratitude and faithfulneſs, in the character of Laer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, were perſuaſively delineated by his repreſentative. Mr. S. Powell ſeemed indeed Arvida; and Guſtavus ſhone upon us enriched with native ſplendour.</p>
                     <p>In the female parts, the beauty and propriety of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ial piety, the captivating magic of the tender paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the dignity of the princeſs and the woman, were ſtrikingly exemplified by Miſs Harriſon; her pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation was diſtinct, her emphaſis generally proper, and her geſtures naturally expreſſive.</p>
                     <p>The Spartan virtues perſonified in Auguſta, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twining all the tenderneſs of the maternal character, demanded the moſt glowing, dignified, and deeply <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The young Guſtava was truly intereſting; nor was there a ſympathizing mother preſent, whoſe boſom did not throb to ſnatch from the envenomed talons of the fell deſtroyer the ſoul-affecting innocent. Mariana was not deſtitute of merit; ſhe ſeemed to deſerve the place ſhe occupied in the confidence of the royal virgin.</p>
                     <p>To the comic powers, exhibited upon that evening, ample juſtice has been done. Unequivocal demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of applauſe reſounded from every corner of the houſe, and, for my part, I congratulate the ſons of Momus with all my heart; for, having never yet been

able to conceive the ſmalleſt evil in laughter, ſimply conſidered, I cannot but give my vote in favour of <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected mirth.</hi> Mr. Collins, Miſs Baker, &amp;c. &amp;c. theſe have all received the tributary laurel; and I do not feel in the leaſt diſpoſed to enter my caveat upon this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>The Gleaner confeſſes that his expectations were more than anſwered; but the Gleaner hath never wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the theatrical abilities of a Garrick, or a Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons; nor is he certain he ought to regard this as a misfortune.</p>
                     <p>It is always invidious to point out faults; at leaſt it is to me an unpleaſing taſk. From an infant ſtage I look for improvement. The time will arrive when the performers will <hi>in no inſtance "O'erſtep the modeſty of Nature.</hi>" Even tragedy may deal too much in ſtarts: It ſhould be energetic; it ſhould be pathetic; but the pompous ſwell and ſtrut, make no part of its excellence. Eaſe and elegance are the naivette of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edy, and its features are the features of poliſhed and corrected nature.</p>
                     <p>But I repeat, I look for improvement; gradually we ſhall progreſs; the performers will think more of the audience, and they will, by conſequence, <hi>appear</hi> to <hi>think leſs;</hi> in other words, they will <hi>ſeem</hi> to forget the circles that attend them. <hi>Their frequent appeals by eye and hand</hi> will inſenſibly ſubſide; and, through the whole of the repreſentation, they will ſee the propriety of addreſſing the perſon, or perſons, to whom they are <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> particularly to ſpeak. In one word—the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience will refine the players, and the players will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the audience.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE often thought, that ſerious and well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed believers of the heathen mythology, muſt have found themſelves wonderfully impelled to acts of devotional piety. It was ſcarcely poſſible for ſuch perſons to purſue their courſe in any direction, which did not preſent to their external optics, or to the eye of their imagination, beings who were, <hi>in their eſtimation,</hi> proper objects of adoration. A reſpectable writer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the vaſt univerſe as the ſolemn temple of the pagans; and, we may add, that in every diviſion of this ſuperb fane, altars, ſacred to their various rituals preſent. The empire of fancy is thronged by perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified ideas; the proſopopoeia is eaſy, and gods and goddeſſes cluſter in every walk. Heſiod, in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogical hiſtory of the heathen deities, delineates thirty thouſand of theſe dignified beings, and an indulgent imagination readily inveſts them with their peculiar properties and offices.</p>
                     <p>To the child of fancy, ſheltered in the ſequeſtered grove from the intenſe heat of ſummer, the ſalutary breeze which gently agitates the leaves is the roſy breath of the winged zephyrus, and the murmuring of that ſtream, which winds its glaſſy courſe, is the ſoft ſighing of a river nymph, while, with equal ingenuity, amid the pelting ſtorm, he conſiders the hoarſe bellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the winds as the ſonorous voice of ſome potent god.</p>
                     <p>Neptune graſps his trident, and holds dominion in the vaſt world of waters. Pluto, borne in his ſable chariot, bears the keys of ages and of dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>; while Jupiter, aſcending the ſkies, mounts his throne of ivory, extending in his right hand the avenging thunder-bolt,
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:034162_0241_0FFC64F89287FCF0"/>
and in his left the ſceptre of ſovereignty. To theſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a train of ſubordinate immortals, all poſſeſſing their peculiar attributes, and occupying their various departments. Of the ſeaſons of the year, the fruits of the earth, and the different ſtages of life, infancy, adoleſcence, maturity, and old age, a preſiding deity took charge. In the catalogue of divinities, every virtue found its patron and its patroneſs; nay, among this multifarious generation of immortals, even the reprehenſible paſſions were not deſtitute of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors. The ſincere votary of this mythology, I ſay, muſt have been continually ſtimulated to acts which his directory aſſured him were proper and neceſſary; and, for my own part, I am free to own, that however fanciful <hi>reaſon</hi> may conſider this fabulous hierarchy, I ſee no impropriety, in ſtill allowing it, in the works of imagination, a <hi>viſionary being;</hi> and poetry, certainly, even to the preſent era, gathers ſome of its moſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental flowers from this magical, or legendary garden of antiquity.</p>
                     <p>The hiſtory of the heathen gods and goddeſſes is ſo interwoven with the occurrences of ancient times, that it is impoſſible to peruſe thoſe venerable pages with advantage, without a competent knowledge of their various characters and powers. I remember, when Margaretta was a child, I began a little biographical volume, which entitling a Theogeny, the better to captivate her attention, I threw into doggerel verſe. My deſign was, to give a ſuccinct account of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities who had figured in hiſtory, and who ſtill hold their rank in ſome of our beſt poetical performances. An attention to buſineſs prevented my completing this <hi>bagatelle;</hi> but I am not ſure that I ſhall not look it up, giving it a form, and the laſt poliſh, for the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit of her children.</p>
                     <p>If we trace the traditionary fables which make up the bulk of the pagan ſyſtem, we ſhall generally find they originate in ſome momentous and incontroverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truth; and however they may have been combined and adulterated, in the various channels through which
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:034162_0242_0FFC64F65EA77D08"/>
they have adventitiouſly paſſed, they ſtill retain ſome features, which, to the eye of obſervation, ſufficiently evince their auguſt parentage.</p>
                     <p>Through the labyrinth of error, the ſcriptuarian often follows a clew, which leads him directly to the fundamental principles of that <hi>revealed religion,</hi> which he reverences as of God, which he believes to be moſt holy, and which he receives as the ground of his preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent tranquillity, and his future hopes.</p>
                     <p>That chaos, which Heſiod dignifies by the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of The Father of the Gods, Moſes ſimply calls <hi>The earth, without form and void.</hi> Heſiod's relation is undoubtedly an allegorical account, wherein the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of nature are perſonified, of that hiſtory of the creation, which the Hebrew writer; in language na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and beautifully ſublime, ſo inimitably narrated. Writers have appeared, who have ſuppoſed the fable of Prometheus to have taken riſe in the character of Noah; others imagine they trace the features of the ſecond founder of mankind in Deucalion. Plauſible reaſons are adduced for theſe conjectures; but perhaps we hazard leſs, in yielding credence to the reſpectable Boc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>art, who conceived this favourite of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to have been worſhipped, in ſucceeding times, by the name and attributes of Saturn. The golden age which is placed under the adminiſtration of that deity; the tranquillity, friendſhip, and innocence, which is ſaid to have reigned in the boſom of every deſcription of mankind; the perpetual ſpring which invariably flouriſhed; the temperate ſerenity of the atmoſphere, neither veiled by gathering clouds, nor deformed by burſting ſtorms; theſe, and ſimilar arrangements, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly proclaim the interpoſition of ſome philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropic prince, or benefactor of the race.</p>
                     <p>The hiſtory of the Deucalion flood, if not a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by another name, of the general deluge, bears, nevertheleſs, ſtrong marks of affinity thereto. Lucian, giving ſome account of Syria, where it is ſaid the del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uge of Deucalion originated, aſſures us, <q>That the Greeks aſſert in their fables, that the firſt men being
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:034162_0243_0FFC64F406A60E90"/>
of an inſolent and cruel diſpoſition, inhuman, inhoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable, and regardleſs of their faith, were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by a deluge—the earth pouring forth vaſt ſtreams of water</q>—(in the Moſaic language, the fountains of the great deep were broken up)—<q>ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the rivers, which, together with the rains, made the ſea riſe above its banks and overflow the land, ſo that all was laid under water: That Deucalion alone, ſaved himſelf and family in the ark: That two of each kind of wild and tame animals, loſing their animoſity, entered into it of their own accord: That this Deucalion floated upon the waters, until they became aſſuaged, and that he then repaired the human race.</q> Writers alſo deſcribe the eminence which arreſted the courſe of this veſſel; and by the authority of the celebrated biographer, Plutarch, we catch a glimpſe of the iſſuing dove which Abydenus denominates a certain fowl, that being twice let out of the ark, and finding no place of reſt, returned into the veſſel.</p>
                     <p>The metaphor of Pandora, it is conceived, may be eaſily developed. The beauty, wiſdom, various intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual endowments, matchleſs eloquence, and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic powers, with every other combining charm, which ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed that accompliſhed viſion, are pictureſque of the aſſemblage of graces that digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and adorned our general mother, while yet, array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſpotleſs innocence, ſhe preſided the ſovereign lady of thoſe bliſsful regions, which her preſence rendered ſo truly intereſting, and which ſhe was ſo well calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to embelliſh. The miſchief conſequent upon the diſobedience of the firſt woman, are exactly figured by the catalogue of ills which followed the opening of Pandora's box; and <hi>poor humanity</hi> hath ever ſince been doomed to lament the diſcord, anarchy, anger, envy, calumny, <hi>crimes in their variety;</hi> wars, famine, diſeaſes, peſtilence, decrepitude, old age, and death, which eſcaped thence—yet hope, bleſt hope, remained at bottom, and the chriſtian inveſtigator will not fail, in this expreſſive figure, to recognize the promiſe given
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:034162_0244_0FFC64F0E7433D30"/>
to the fair delinquent, ere yet her trembling footſteps were exiled from that elyſium, which, previous to her devious wanderings, ſhe was ſo well ſkilled to cultivate and beautify.</p>
                     <p>The fable of Typhon, and the reſt of the giants, with the daring temerity of thoſe hideous monſters; their audacious inſult upon the reſidence of the celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, and their levelling war with the gods; all theſe aſtoniſhing circumſtances may find their origin in the Hebrew hiſtorian, who deſcribes the earth as bearing a race of men of uncommon ſtature, and complicated atrocity; who delineates the tower of Babel, and the defeat of that impious confederacy. The deſign form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Agamemnon, of immolating, upon the altar of idolatry, his unoffending daughter, may be nothing more than a vitiated tradition of that illuſtrious period in the life of the patriarch Abraham, which exhibits him as preparing, at the command of the Almighty, to ſacrifice as a burnt offering, that ſon, then a beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs youth, among whoſe deſcendants he had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>It is evident from ſacred and profane hiſtory, that in the beginning, one only Omnipotent, Omnipreſent, and Omniſcient Sovereign of the univerſe, was deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a proper object of adoration; and this unknown Being was devoutly hailed as life, light, and wiſdom. All created beings were ſuppoſed to be beneficently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by a ſelf-exiſtent and eternal mind to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, protection, and final felicity of the whole. This great Firſt Cauſe, ere yet the imagination of men had clothed him in the habiliments of caprice, was addreſſed under ſeveral appellations.

Would you call him <hi>Fate?</hi> you will not err; for he it is on whom all things depend: <hi>The Cauſe of cauſes.</hi> Would you call him <hi>Providence?</hi> you are in the right; for by his wiſdom is the <hi>world directed;</hi> hence it moves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken, and performs its every office.

It is not ſtrange that a lively and pious imagination, ſhould gradually deify the attributes and favours of ſo unſearchable, auguſt, and beneficent a being. Thus the family of the gods claim their origin; and, in proceſs of time, the depravity of mankind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing them with abſurd and reprehenſible paſſions, rendered them in their deſcriptions altogether like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves. Reſpectable perſons of both ſexes were next preſſed into this ſacred order, and thus the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farious catalogue was ſwelled to an enormous ſize. The joys, the ſorrows, the apprehenſions, and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of mankind, ſupplied the materials from which the convenient deity was ſhaped; the apotheoſis was conferred, and divine honours were next in courſe.</p>
                     <p>It is needleſs to inform thee, gentle reader, that I am no pagan. The heathen ſyſtem is long ſince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded; and we have, by common conſent, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed their deities within <hi>comparatively</hi> narrow bounds; but yet it may be a queſtion, whether in ceding to them the empire of imagination, in leaving the domain of fancy open to their juriſdiction, we have not aſſigned them circles which are ſufficiently ample. However, be this as it may, I am free to own, that while I trace in the Jupiter of antiquity many of the features of that Omnipotent, who preſideth over the informed mind of more refined ages, arguing from analogy, I am fond of conceiving, that not a few of their ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate traditions originating in truth, may thus poſſeſs a right to claim their anceſtry in the inviſible world.</p>

A plaſtic and beneficent hand, faſhioning and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the great and various productions of nature, is momently evinced, both to ſenſe and to reaſon. A thouſand circumſtances aſſure me that I exiſt by the omnific power of a <hi>ſelf-exiſtent</hi> Being; an innate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of immortality triumphs in my boſom; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently expect a never ending futurity. Thoſe who are departed are not loſt: they have only obtained an earlier emancipation; in the general aſſembly I ſhall rejoin them—the ſocial virtues, commencing on earth, ſhall be perfected in heaven; amity ſhall wear a never dying wreath; and, progreſſing in knowledge, we ſhall of courſe recognize thoſe with whom, while habited in garments of mortality, we have taſted the pleaſures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from a ſentimental intercourſe.</p>
                     <p>The doctrine of guardian ſeraphs—this alſo makes a part of my creed. Some bright celeſtial was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned at my birth, to preſide over my infantile years, and to continue the attendant of my mortal ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer. During the hour which ſhall terminate my preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent mode of being, he will be buſy round the bed of death, and he will gratulate, with ineffable tranſport, the liberated ſpirit. "<hi>Myriads of beings tread this globe unſeen, both when we wake and when we ſleep.</hi>" I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade myſelf that truth guided the pen of the poet in this aſſertion. The groſs film of mortality veils for the preſent the viſual ray; yet there are, who have been ſo favoured, even while ſojourning in terreſtrial abodes, as to catch a glimpſe of thoſe natives of Elyſium; and the period haſtens when the wide expanſe ſhall be outſpread before us. But beſide thoſe beneficent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphs who, with angelic vigils guard our path, the ſhades of departed friends hover round; and, when worn by ſickneſs or by ſorrow, the gradually attenuated machine admits, through apertures thus made, the dawning light of paradiſe. Theſe tenderly intereſted and ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathizing denizens of the celeſtial world, not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, with mildly ſympathizing aſpect, ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to the patient ſufferer, pointing him, with the finger of affiance, to that opening heaven, upon which
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:034162_0247_0FFC64E9948094B8"/>
he is ſo apparently verging: And hence perhaps it is, that the period of diſſolution is ſeldom to the expiring individual, marked with thoſe horrors, which in a ſtate of health and vigour are commonly anticipated. Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly the felicity of thoſe who have bid adieu to time, may not be completed until the final conſummation, which ſhall preſent the family of man entire. They may witneſs our actions; when our conduct is marked by regularity and propriety, we inſure their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When, deviating from the line of rectitude, we engage in reprehenſible purſuits, we incur the cenſure of beatified ſpirits, and they experience that kind of pain to which immortals of this deſcription may be ſubjected; the luſtre of celeſtial viſages are dimmed; a tranſient cloud obſcures their brightening joys, and the pearly drop of regret ſuffuſes the radiant eye of ſeraphic pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>What a forcible incentive to a perſeverance in the career of virtue, do conſiderations of this nature fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh! The eye of my mind is at this moment thrown upon an amiable and elegant woman, whom I have long known; her whole life hath exhibited a uniform exemplification of every ſocial, every humane, and ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery endearing excellence; her conjugal engagement hath been remarked, for ſome uncommonly ſplendid traits, and the chaſte correctneſs of her manners have been regarded as the pattern of feminine demeanour. Her married life hath compriſed a period of forty years. She has never been a mother, and yet perhaps the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of her ſex cannot produce a more perfect model of the maternal character. No leſs than twenty or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan girls, at different periods of time, with great care, aſſiduity and tenderneſs ſhe hath genteelly edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. By her aſſiſtance and patronage, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably eſtabliſhed, and they look up to her, as the revered ſource of their every enjoyment.</p>
                     <p>She is even now, in the preſent advanced ſtage of her life, ſurrounded by a virgin train, who pay her honours, ſurpaſſed only by thoſe which they devote to heaven. She hath her ſtated days of feſtivity, the
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:034162_0248_0FFC64E6F4D4F2B8"/>
return of which are very frequent, when ſhe ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her children, as ſhe calls them—all thoſe who have taken rank in families of their own, to join with her in tender and grateful commemorations. No ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, attended by the dependants upon his bounty, ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er looked round with half the exultation, which, upon theſe occaſions, glows in, and elevates her boſom. The figure is not good—ſhe is not a ſovereign, ſhe is a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der parent, regarded with the cheerful eye of duteous affection, by the little community which her own hand hath formed to virtue and to happineſs.</p>
                     <p>It was on one of thoſe convivial days, that, induced by curioſity, I lately looked in upon her. She was ſeated in the midſt of the pleaſed and pleaſing aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Methought I had never ſeen an object more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſtingly beautiful: <hi>Yes, beautiful,</hi> for the <hi>wrinkles</hi> of her face poſſeſſed more charms, than adorn the red and white of the poliſhed ſkin of that giddy flutterer, whom all the energy of ſentiment could never raiſe to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobling ſwell of elevated thought or exemplary action. Dignity was impreſſed upon her every feature, and it was impoſſible ſhe could fail of inſpiring the venerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glow of admiration. I was coxcomb enough to pay her a flouriſhing compliment, which I concluded with pronouncing deciſively—The reward of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, undoubtedly, Madam, will be very great.</p>
                     <p>Echoing my laſt words with inimitable grace, ſhe replied, "<hi>Will be very great?</hi> Truſt me, dear Sir, I have <hi>no arrearages to demand.</hi> If, as you ſay, I have obtained the approbation of the good, that approbation is of itſelf a rich reward; and, Mr. Vigillius," placing her hand upon her breaſt, "<hi>I have peace at home;</hi> the plaudit of my own boſom is indeed of countleſs worth; beſides which, the duteous complacency at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment imprinted upon the countenances of theſe dear girls, is in truth a great and immeaſurable reward; every decent geſture, every proper action, every grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expreſſion, have ſtill continued to me, through a courſe of many years, a ready ſource, from which I have momently derived a ceaſeleſs and abundant rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ompenſe.
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:034162_0249_0FFC64E539D71548"/>
And, Sir, if you will indulge me ſo far, I will confeſs a ſentiment which hath, through life, very forcibly operated upon my mind. I have ever ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf conſtantly under the inſpection of numerous, although viewleſs, witneſſes of my actions. Theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circling ſpectators I have regarded as beings of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic order, aſſociating with thoſe ſpirits who were once clothed in mortality; and the approbating ſmile of celeſtial joy, which I have conſidered as illuming the ſeraphic countenances of the progenitors of theſe my adopted children, while they have ſeen me buſied about their offspring, engaged in eradicating the evil, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the luxuriant growth of ſentiments, equitable in their ſource, and in directing and cheriſhing the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of rectitude. Such obſervance, and ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placent applauſe hath frequently given energy to my efforts, placed me buoyant upon the utmoſt ſtretch of that invention, which is ſometimes neceſſary to allure to virtue the ſteps of youth, and abundantly ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, encouraged, and confirmed me in thoſe walks, which lead, as I conceive, to the paradiſe of the good. And, Sir, you will give me leave to add, that ideas of this kind obtaining in my mind, operate at once as an incitement to regularity of conduct, and conſtituteth a fund, from which I can freely draw the largeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation."</p>
                     <p>The Gleaner joins iſſue with theſe conjectures; by this controverted hypotheſis, he confeſſeth his mind is eſſentially influenced; nor can he, gentle reader, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it dangerous to embrace opinions which <hi>probably</hi> are the offspring of truth, which wear an auſpicious aſpect upon the intereſts of mankind, which produce benevolence in their operation, which furniſh motives for goodneſs, and which ſtimulate to every proper, ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery becoming action.</p>
                     <p>That ſcepticiſm, which is the growth of falſe reaſon and degenerated philoſophy, may abide during the calm ſerene of the vernal or ſummer breezes, which make up the gentle and proſperous gales of life; but, being the ſuperſtructure of falſe and inſidious conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:034162_0250_0FFC64E3A37BD4F0"/>
in other words, being bottomed upon the ſand, it will fall before the mountain torrent, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined and deſolating ſtorms of wintry time; and, bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the accumulated preſſure of mighty ills, the dweller in humanity will of neceſſity lift up his men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal eye to ſome propitious, although inviſible power, who, he will conceive, is adequate to his aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>By the ſelf poized hero, and the worſhipper of chance, the Gleaner, henceforward, may be accounted a <hi>ridiculous viſionary:</hi> But he is perſuaded that the Chriſtian religioniſt will enliſt upon his ſide—for in the oracles of his God, the ſcripturian will find, that the Author and Finiſher of his faith, hath ſanctioned the idea of guardian ſpirits, where he pronounces that the <hi>angels of the ſojourners in mortality, do always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the face of Omnipotence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The immediate diſciples of the Redeemer ſpoke <hi>confidently of the angel of Peter:</hi> And the apoſtle to the Hebrews characterizes the angels, <hi>as ſpirits, miniſtring unto the heirs of ſalvation.</hi> Upon our knowledge of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed perſons, the ſcene diſplayed upon the mount of transfiguration, decides: For Peter ſaid—Lord, if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for Moſes, one for Elias, and one for thee. And Jeſus ſpeaketh of ſitting down in the kingdom of heaven with Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob.</p>
                     <p>The Gleaner perceives, while embracing this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, viz. the doctrine of angels and of ſpirits, that a moſt pleaſing tranquillity pervades his mind; and he cannot willingly relinquiſh it, except, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for ſentiments, that he can conceive more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely conſolatory, or more morally influential.</p>

                     <p>THAT melancholy pauſe, and <hi>extreme</hi> dejection, which at this preſent ſo apparently pervades every order of citizens among us, is, methinks, rather derogatory to the American character. The queſtion, relative to opening the temple of Janus, ſeems to be agitated with unbecoming warmth; and a zeal, not properly tempered by knowledge, is, I conceive, ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly exemplified by every party.</p>
                     <p>That our country hath, during a moſt auſpicious period, been borne forward upon the full tide of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, no one but the embittered, the cynical, or the intereſted incendiary, will deny. Peace, with her ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive wreath, was to us the celeſtial harbinger of unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled felicity; agriculture hath flouriſhed in prime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val beauty, foſtered on the boſom of liberty, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the genial airs of the meek-eyed goddeſs, it is rapidly approximating the higheſt perfection of which it is ſuſceptible. Our manufactures have ſurpriſingly advanced. Our navigation is extenſive; almoſt every ſtream conveys the well freighted bark; and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, wafted by the breezy gale, hath accumulated riches upon the far diſtant ſhore. Whether trade ought not to partake in <hi>ſome degree</hi> the nature of its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite elements; and whether under the general reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulations of rectitude, it would not find its own <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous</hi> and <hi>equal</hi> balance, may be conſidered as prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lematical: at any rate, unaided by <hi>treaties of commerce,</hi> our merchants, obtaining the object of their wiſhes, have, in many inſtances, found their enterprizes crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with uncommon ſucceſs.</p>

The arts and ſciences are alſo attaining naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our ſoil; and <hi>literature, bleſt ſource of rational elevation,</hi> literature hath enliſted its votaries: The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and energetic movements of the ſoul are afloat; the ſciences and the virtues love the venerable ſhades and ſequeſtered haunts of liberty; and, cultivated ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully in this new world, we had hoped they would become patrons of frugality, temperance, and that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religion, which ſmootheth the bed of death.</p>
                     <p>Our citizens, intuitively, as it ſhould ſeem, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſenſible of that <hi>indiſcriminate</hi> advantage, derived to the <hi>community</hi> in general, where <hi>each individual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from the common fund,</hi> and <hi>where every member con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes his quota, for the benefit of the whole;</hi> in one word, every one ſeemed ſenſible of the bleſſings of a good government, and <hi>federaliſm</hi> was the baſis, on which we were ſucceſsfully building the ſuperſtructure of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing uſeful, every thing virtuous, every thing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental. What a fearful and deſtructive hydra is faction! War is its eldeſt born, and with the eye of the baſiliſk it ſeeketh to annihilate the cherub peace. Dreadful is the progreſs of war; it is retrograde to almoſt every virtue; the duties of benevolence it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth; it enjoineth upon every individual to afflict and haraſs by every poſſible means. Cultivation is no more. Deſtruction, with ſhocking exultation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth in every goodly walk its fatally blaſting influence. Population laments its murdered millions; the earth is humectated by the blood of our fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and thoſe infernal demons, diſcord and malice, are glutted by the calamities of the human ſpecies. A late elegant writer inimitably pourtrays the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences even of <hi>ſucceſsful war;</hi> perhaps a review of the picture may be of uſe.—<q>We muſt fix our eyes not on the hero returning with conqueſt, nor yet on the gallant officer dying on the bed of honour, the ſubject of picture and of ſong; but on the private ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, forced into the ſervice; exhauſted by camp ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fatigue; pale, emaciated, crawling to an hoſpital with the proſpect of life, perhaps a long life,
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:034162_0253_0FFC64DB1F1E2BD8"/>
blaſted, uſeleſs, and ſuffering. We muſt think of the uncounted tears of her who weeps alone, becauſe the only being who ſhared her ſentiments is taken from her; no martial muſic founds in uniſon with her feelings; the long day paſſes, and he returns not! She does not ſhed her ſorrows over his grave, for ſhe has never learnt whether he ever had one. If he had returned, his exertions would not have been remembered individually, for he only made a ſmall imperceptible part of a human machine, called a regiment. We muſt take in the long ſickneſs which no glory ſoothes, occaſioned by diſtreſs of mind, anxiety, and ruined fortune. Theſe are not fancy pictures; and if you pleaſe to heighten them, you can every one of you do it for yourſelves. We take in the conſequences, felt perhaps for ages, before a country which has been completely deſolated, lifts its head again; like a torrent of lays, its worſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is not the firſt, overwhelming in ruin towns and palaces, but the long ſterility to which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the track it hath covered with its ſtream. Add the danger to regular governments which are changed by war, ſometimes to anarchy, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to deſpotiſm. Add all theſe, and then let us think when a General performing theſe exploits is ſaluted with <hi>Well done, good and faithful ſervant,</hi> wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the plaudit is likely to be echoed in another place.</q> But however deplorable the calamities of war, ſuch is the nature of the preſent ſcene of things, that there <hi>are circumſtances</hi> which fully involve the <hi>neceſſity of appealing to the ſword.</hi> When our deareſt, eſſential, and moſt important intereſts are invaded, when our exiſtence, as a nation, is put to the hazard, <hi>when negociations fail,</hi> when we are ſubjected to contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious indignities, when we are deſpoiled of our prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, and ſtripped of the hopes of redreſs—in emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies thus preſſing, every ſentiment of <hi>ſelf-defence</hi> will throw the gauntlet for the battle. That it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely upon theſe evil times we have fallen, many <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentfully</hi> and <hi>vehemently</hi> pronounce; and, not yet freed
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:034162_0254_0FFC64D890CD73E0"/>
from the jealouſies and entanglements of European politics, while the hemiſphere of the elder world is thus dreadfully tempeſted, nothing but an overween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſelf-partiality, could lead us to expect eſcaping at leaſt the outſkirts of the hurricane; but if we have been unwarrantably and unneceſſarily injured, and if our abilities are adequate to the contention, let every American play the man for his country. Let not our faces thus gather paleneſs; but, when properly author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed by the authority which we have conferred, let us combine, hand and heart, to work out our own polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical ſalvation; and if our cauſe is thus righteous, the God of armies will again lead us forth, and doubtleſs the palm of victory will be ours.</p>
                     <p>But deliberation here maketh a pauſe—Againſt whom ſhall we commence hoſtilities? So many are the wrongs which we are ſaid to have ſuffered from the maritime belligerent powers, that an unprejudiced American will heſitate againſt which to prefer the loudeſt complaints; and the inveſtigations made in the general council of our nation, ſo nearly poizeth the ſcale of depredation, that the cloſeſt obſerver, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>influenced by party, is at a loſs to decide upon the queſtion. Yet, it is ſaid, our obligations to France, furniſhing a balance in her favour, ought in equity to deſtroy the equipoiſe; and indeed it is greatly to be wiſhed the conduct of that nation had been ſuch, as to have ſanctioned the moſt unlimited election of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. If, when emerging from the benighted clouds of deſpotiſm; if, when exonerating herſelf from the intolerable oppreſſion of unlimited authority, ſhe had known where to erect the barriers; if ſhe had not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged every feeling of humanity, moſt atrociouſly committing acts, at which even the boſom of ſtoiſm agonizes at every pore, over which rectitude muſt pour the never failing tear, and at which fortitude hath learned to weep; if ſhe had ſupported the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution which ſhe ſwore to maintain, we ſhould doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have felt for her like veneration, as when the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and virtuous La Fayette, directing her councils,
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:034162_0255_0FFC64D59548A390"/>
led forth her armies, and, pointing her ſteps to victory and fame, extorted the mingling and unheſitating ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of an admiring world. But alas! France ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits, at this period, a ſpectacle, from which lacerated truth indignantly haſtes, at which reaſon ſtands aghaſt, while morality and holy religion have received from baſe and murderous hands a fatal ſtab.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps the only advantage which the revolutiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tribunal can boaſt over the <hi>lettre de cachet,</hi> or the juſtly <hi>execrated Baſtile,</hi> is, that not prolonging the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of its victims, it haſteth to beſtow upon them, through the inſtrumentality of the executioner, a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy emancipation from its tyranny. Whole hecatombs have been immolated; every perſon who differeth in opinion from the ruling faction is arreſted, tried, and executed. The <hi>federaliſt</hi> findeth no mercy; and even an <hi>avowed wiſh</hi> to qualify their <hi>boaſted indiviſibility,</hi> by a ſingle feature of the American government, is eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated as treaſonable. With regard to our obligations to France, it ought ſurely to be conſidered, whether gratitude can ever teach us to abet, even the moſt <hi>lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral</hi> and <hi>diſintereſted</hi> benefactor, in <hi>deeds</hi> of <hi>darkneſs and of death:</hi> And, when it is remembered, that the well-timed aid, from which we derived advantages ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputably beneficial, was procured through the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of him, <hi>whom we then hailed as our magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ally—which ally</hi> hath, by the moſt ſanguinary men and meaſures, been, by violent hands, arreſted in the middle of his days! when theſe circumſtances are adverted to, they may poſſibly be regarded as an <hi>extenuation of our crime,</hi> although barely for the ſake of evincing our <hi>loyalty to the Gallic name,</hi> we ſhould not conceive ourſelves obligated to leap the bounds of rectitude.</p>
                     <p>Yet, ſtrange as it may ſeem, faction hath introduced its cloven foot among us; with aſtoniſhing effrontery it hath dared to liſt its baleful head; and, drawing the ſword of diſcord, it is preparing to ſheath it in the vitals of that <hi>infant conſtitution, whoſe budding life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pands ſo fair to view,</hi> and whoſe <hi>docile texture,</hi> yielding

Is there an individual who will not devoutly ſay—May the Parent of the univerſe ſhield our country from the progreſs of that Tartarean fiend which hath ſo long deſolated France! Yea, we confidently pronounce that every patriotic boſom hath glowed with indignation, and every virtuous ſentiment hath recoiled from the frenzy of that parricide, which ſo licentiouſly ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the head of our matchleſs Chief, the execrable guillotine! over the head of that venerable patriot whoſe boſom is the ſeat of every virtue; whoſe diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted efforts for the public weal, ſtand unrivalled in the records of immortal fame; whoſe ſuperior talents, and whoſe revolving hours are invariably appropriated to the general good; whoſe unyielding magnanimity, hath gleamed athwart the darkeſt and moſt diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing moments, the luminous rays of manly hope; who, far from bending beneath the load of national depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, hath conſidered every event, with the firmneſs of inflexible virtue; who, like another Atlas, hath ſtill ſupported the mighty fabric of a various and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated government; whoſe penetrating genius, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding reſources, unravelleth the intricacies of dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and preſenteth the extricating hand of wiſdom; who glows with the rapture of the hero upon every inſtance of national elevation—in one word, who was the illuſtrious leader, the boaſt, and the very ſoul of our armies, and who continues the brighteſt gem in the enfolding robes of peace.</p>
                     <p>Will ye not veil to the father of your country, ye aſſociated declaimers? Is it your element to arraign, to cavil, to cenſure, and to exerciſe a kind of fanciful deſpotiſm? Why will you thus pervert talents capable of rendering you, to this younger world, the richeſt bleſſing? Yet, if ye will ſtill pertinaciouſly proceed, the hand of freemen can never arreſt your courſe;

for ſtill ye are cheriſhed by the genial influence of that liberty, whoſe equal ray, in imitation of its great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype, invigorateth the poiſonous as well as the ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary germe.</p>
                     <p>But, ſuffer a fellow-citizen to make the inquiry—What is your object? Why are you thus ſtudious to create diviſions? Why are you ambitious of forming an <hi>ariſtocracy</hi> in the midſt of your brethren? Ought not the nation at large to conſtitute one vaſt ſociety of people, bound by common ties, common wiſhes, and common hopes? Hath any part of the Union <hi>conſtitutionally</hi> delegated their powers to you? To whom will you appeal? The late envoy of France, <hi>in effect, at leaſt,</hi> threatened an appeal to the people! But ſurely, neither the quondam ambaſſador or his adherents have ſufficiently attended to the origin, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and completion of our happy conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>If ever any government might, ſtrictly ſpeaking, be characterized, in a rationally republican ſenſe, <hi>the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of the people,</hi> the regulations made for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of order, in theſe States, is indubitably that government. This is an axiom which I ſhould imagine could never be controverted. Perhaps, the manner of obtaining and eſtabliſhing our government, hath not, in every reſpect, a parallel. Delegates ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the <hi>free, unſolicited, uncorrupted,</hi> and <hi>unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous voice of the people,</hi> were, <hi>by the people,</hi> inveſted with authority to weigh, ponder, and reflect; they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, they deliberated, examined, compared, and finally arranged. To the conſideration of the <hi>ſovereign people,</hi> the reſult of the collected wiſdom of our Continent was preſented; every article, every ſentiment was examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in every poſſible view; it was analyzed and ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized, in the completeſt, moſt uncontrolled, and rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner. Orators embodied the whole force of their eloquence; writers exerciſed their moſt energetic tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and in the ſtrict examination the beſt productions of the preſs were engaged: Every member of the community had an undoubted right to inveſtigate; public bodies lent their luminous aid; and, in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:034162_0258_0FFC64CEB83534B8"/>
reſearch and expected deciſion, friends and enemies alike combined. Behold the cataſtrophe—how loudly doth it pronounce the eulogy of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution—how doth it dignify and eternize the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican ſyſtem! One State and another, time after time, gradually and <hi>deliberately,</hi> adopt and ratify a plan, which ſo evidently embraceth the intereſts of <hi>the people</hi> at large. In ſome of our governments, the ſanction yielded is unanimous, and, in every part of the Union, the large and reſpectable majority of <hi>the people,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled in the annals of legiſlation.</p>
                     <p>Surely, I ſay, a government thus originating, thus ſanctioned, and thus eſtabliſhed, may be unequivocally pronounced, in every <hi>proper ſenſe, the government of the people.</hi> To whom then, from ſuch a government, can we appeal? The anſwer is obvious; but, may our political Hercules cruſh the Hydra faction, however multifarious may be its power of miſchief, or however widely diffuſed its poiſonous influence.</p>
                     <p>In this era of general conſternation and perturbed ſuſpenſe, it is undoubtedly our wiſdom to abide the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of thoſe inveſtigations and debates, which properly conſtitute the department of gentlemen, whom we have commiſſioned to take upon them the adminiſtration of public affairs. If the Gleaner might be permitted to breathe a wiſh, it would be for the general obſervance and eſtabliſhment of order, and that every citizen would learn, <hi>habitually,</hi> to venerate <hi>offices</hi> and <hi>charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> devoted to, and engaged in, the adminiſtration of juſtice, and to which every <hi>good and worthy member of the community is alike eligible<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Gleaner, from a ſeries of accurate and unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſioned obſervations, is induced earneſtly to hope, that the general government will ſtill continue to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all <hi>illegal interference,</hi> all <hi>foreign, unconſtitutional,</hi> and <hi>unbecoming influence.</hi> And he confeſſes, that he experienced the enthuſiaſm of approbation. when he obſerved in the public prints, that dignified movement of Congreſs, which directed the galleries to be vacat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon an indecent attempt made, to approbate men

and meaſures, by <hi>teſtimonies, proper</hi> only to mark the merit of the votaries of the ſock and buſkin. Yea, verily, this new world is the heritage of liberty; but it is of that liberty which decidedly avoweth her <hi>ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> her <hi>regulations,</hi> her <hi>laws,</hi> her <hi>ſubordination;</hi> to all of which ſhe exacteth the moſt ſcrupulous obedience. I am not ignorant, that <hi>licentiouſneſs</hi> too often aſſumes the ſacred name of liberty: Licentiouſneſs, engendered by darkneſs, nurſed by ignorance, and led forth by impudence; murder and devaſtation are her miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; hell-born ambition is her incentive; and the moſt confirmed and rigorous deſpotiſm remaineth her invariable object.</p>
                     <p>Liberty! heaven deſcended goddeſs, rational and refined—No, ſhe hath not a ſingle feature of the auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious impoſtor, who, with ſuch aſtoniſhing effrontery, artfully arrogateth her character and offices, and who, by a ſeries of execrable machinations, after clothing herſelf in the ſky-wrought robes of the bright celeſtial, demandeth her honours, procureth againſt her the moſt ſhocking and libellous declamations, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her in the upright exerciſe of thoſe pure and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome inſtitutions, which are replete with the moſt ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utary and benign influence, upon the morals and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of our ſpecies. Nay, the blighting and conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious breath of licentiouſneſs, ſtigmatizeth <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>corrected</hi> liberty, as the moſt degenerate and ſervile traitor! and, denounced by anarchy, the terms, uſurper, deſpot, and tyrant, with every other frightful appellation which the black catalogue can produce, is liberally and indiſcriminately beſtowed upon her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween liberty and licentiouſneſs we cannot trace the ſmalleſt analogy; they have been ſtrikingly and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully contraſted. Liberty has been compared to an informed, elevated, and well regulated mind; her movements are authorized by reaſon; knowledge is her harbinger; wiſdom adminiſtereth unto her; and all her interpoſitions are mildly beneficent: Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity reſults from her arrangements; and a ſerene and equal kind of contentment is her eldeſt born.

                     <p>I SAID that genuine liberty recognized her ſyſtems, her laws, and her regular chain of ſubordination; to all of which ſhe exacted the moſt ſcrupulous obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and, if this were not true, I confeſs that I, for one, ſhould be inclined to deprecate her domination. Surely, that ſtate muſt be fruitful of calamities, which admitteth not an acknowledged ſuperior; where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon hath, in every reſpect, an abſolute and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable right to conſult his own feelings, ſubmitting himſelf to no other empire than that of his wayward paſſions.</p>
                     <p>It is not, in every ſenſe, true, that Nature is equal in her productions. The ſame plaſtic hand that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Newton, lends exiſtence to an oyſter. Nature lev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and diverſifies her wide extended lawns, winds her ſerpentine walks, and ſpreads her ample fields; but ſhe alſo erects her mounds, faſhions her knolls, elevates her acclivities, and piles together her ſtupendous moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. The ocean rolls one vaſt world of waters; but the little ſtream murmurs gently and pleaſingly along. The huge leviathan and the polypus, are alike inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants

of the ſea. The elephant and the tatou, the oſtrich and the humming bird, reſpire in our world, while naturaliſts are at a loſs even to name the numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous grades, which make up and complete the ſhades between theſe extremes. A various growth of flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pleaſe the eye; vegetables ſuſtain and nouriſh; fruits regale the palate; and poiſonous plants, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a luxuriant growth, rear their baleful heads. To trace the varieties of nature, is indeed a fruitful avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; the region of fancy is ſtocked with reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while, to the curious obſerver, engaged in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, hardly an hour revolves, which produces not an acceſſion of ideas.</p>
                     <p>Light and ſhade are productive of the fineſt effects; the eye is offended by a continuity of the ſame objects; hills and vallies, ſucceeding each other, furniſh the moſt enchanting views; the interjacent plain is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly terminated, by the ſequeſtered grove; the glade beautifully diverſifies the foreſt; and yonder tall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic eminence is gracefully ſkirted by the enamelled meadow which is outſpread beneath. The ſeaſons ſucceed each other, and the revolutions of day and night, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing their peculiar charms, are ſalutary and grateful. Nor is this multiformity obſervable only in the leſs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler parts of the creation: The human being has va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties, which may almoſt be pronounced endleſs. The degrees of intellect, if we may judge by effects, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unequally proportioned. Now a luminous genius darts through the complicated arrangements of nature; its pervading ken is ſubtil and energetic; its powers are adequate to reſearches the moſt profound; it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigates, and obſcurity is no more; the arcana of ages, yielding to its animated and elucidating progreſs, relinquiſheth the impenetrable veil; its verſatility, and the depth of its obſervations are aſtoniſhing; and, amid the blaze of refulgent day, it lifts its aſpiring head. But the natal place of this luminary, the ſame village, perhaps the ſame family, uſhered into being the unfortunate idiot, whoſe faculties are ſcarcely ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the abſolute calls of exiſtence.

minds, born to all the energy of being, devote their time and talents to inform, to rectify, to improve, and in every ſenſe to benefit mankind; others again, are ſo <hi>abſorbed in ſelf,</hi> that were it not for the catalogue of their individual wants and wiſhes, we ſhould not know that they continued to vegetate. If perſons of this deſcription have any principles but that of ſelf love, they are ſo completely under the direction of, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulated by this their <hi>ruling paſſion,</hi> that it is difficult to trace, in their actions, the ſmalleſt veſtige of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign influence. Is it juſt to refuſe to merit its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable dues? Is it equitable to deny to virtue the palm of honour? Or, ought we to heſitate in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reverence to a ſuperiority indubitable and decided?</p>
                     <p>Where is <hi>unvaried equality to be found?</hi> Not in heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, <hi>for there are principalities and powers:</hi> Not, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in any of the diſtributions which we have traced on earth; for it is unqueſtionable, that <hi>variety</hi> conſtitutes one of the principal beauties in the arrangements of nature. Nor is it the growth of the Tartarean regions; for there the <hi>arch fiend</hi> exerciſeth thoſe powers, which proclaim his regality; and, even <hi>Licentiouſneſs</hi> hath her choſen favourite whom ſhe conſtituteth chief of the ſavage band of murderers. I do not ſay, that my reading and obſervation are ſufficiently extenſive to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide; but were I to hazard a conjecture, I would ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, that, from the days of that firſt murderer who ſlew his brother, the levelling ſcheme hath, ſtrictly ſpeaking, continued a chimera, floating only in the brain of the ſpeculatiſt, or figuring ſplendidly in the theories, which his fertile imagination hath commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to iſſue from the preſs.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps the late Doctor <hi>Johnſon,</hi> who may be ſtyled the monarch of literature, however rich in reſources, could not have hit on an argument more effectually calculated to flaſh conviction upon the feelings of a certain <hi>female hiſtorian</hi> (of no inconſiderable merit, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding) than when waiting upon her, in her decent apartments in the city of London, and aſſuming the humble and ſerious features of conviction, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:034162_0263_0FFC64C274FDEEE8"/>
her to the following effect:—Madam, influenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by your good ſenſe, and the irrefragable ſtrength of your arguments, you at this moment behold before you, the proſelyte of your opinions. I am at length confident, that the children of men are all upon an equal footing; and, Madam, to give you proof poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that I am indeed a convert, here is a very ſenſible, civil, worthy, well-behaved citizen, your footman; I make it my requeſt that he may be permitted to ſit down and dine with us. Doctor Johnſon, upon this, or ſome ſimilar occaſion, made a remark, which, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the general tenor of his obſervations, carrieth its evidence along with it, and which the experience of every day may ſerve to corroborate. "Your <hi>levellers,"</hi> ſaid the Doctor, "wiſh to <hi>level down</hi> as far as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but they cannot bear levelling <hi>up</hi> to themſelves; they would all have ſome people under them; why not then have <hi>ſome people</hi> above them? I would no more deprive certain characters of their reſpect, than of their money. I conſider myſelf as acting a part in the great ſyſtem of ſociety, and I do to others as I would have them do to me. There would be a perpetual ſtruggle for precedence, were there no rules to diſcriminate rank."</p>
                     <p>There is no calculating the diſorders which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from relaxing the ſeries of ſubordination; if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction is ſuſpended, we need but make the trial. I am ſurrounded by a family of men and maid ſervants. I am placed upon extenſive grounds, which call for the regular aid of cultivation, for all the various routine of agricultural attention. The vernal ſeaſon is haſting forward—the morning is delightful. On a day ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious much buſineſs may be accompliſhed: With the early dawn I quit my pillow, I ſupplicate Mary to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect her woman to prepare me an immediate breakfaſt; ſhe, careleſsly, pronounces me quite as eligible to that taſk myſelf. I apply to Abigail, who refers me to another, and another; and, as <hi>equality</hi> admitteth no diſtinctions, the probability is, that I am finally brought back again to Mary herſelf. Poſſibly, after many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:034162_0264_0FFC64BDC35CA438"/>
the females may all combine; one bear a cup, another a ſaucer; a table is dragged from that apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a tea-kettle from this; ignorant of each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's plans, and having no one to direct, the proceſs is impeded and confuſed, and when at length the motley aſſemblage is completed, and the refection preſented, the ſpoiled tea, coffee, chocolate, and bread and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, all evince the oppoſite hands employed in their manufacture. But this is the fair ſide of the buſineſs; they might have engaged in a tumultuous <hi>fracas,</hi> and, conſigning the whole apparatus to deſtruction, they might have left me no other conſolation, than that of ſoothing my vexation, by ſinging, in Homeric numbers, the diſmal craſh of that eventful morning.</p>
                     <p>Well, but to proceed. Breakfaſt over, I ſally forth. I <hi>adviſe</hi> that the cattle be yoked, and that ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of manure be conveyed to yonder ſterile ſpot. Jon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan inſiſts that the horſe-cart is ſufficient to drag it. Thomas is of his opinion. William ſides with me, and we prepare for a trial of ſtrength; equally divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our oppoſition bars our purpoſe; from words we proceed to blows; the females are alarmed; they take their ſides; the plot thickens; appearances grow for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable; a doughty battle enſues; bloody noſes are the conſequence; and the day is ſacrificed to diſcord. Every morning is thus uſhered in; every portion of time is marked by oppoſition. Now the land ſhall be hedged with buſhes, anon the ready rock ſhall preſent the barrier, and again the wooden encloſure is all the rage. To day we will plough, to-morrow we will ſow. Nay, you are too early, you are too late; this is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, that is not enough; we will go hither and thither, every where, and no where.</p>
                     <p>Thus roll on the days, weeks and months. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn is at the door, the lands are uncultivated, and famine, with its meagre ſtride, is rapidly advancing to our borders. Meanwhile, even in this tumultuous era, my houſe, my eſtate confeſſeth a potentate. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy reigneth ſupreme, and deſolation adminiſtereth her commands. To prevent, or to guard againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences,
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:034162_0265_0FFC64BBF0A75E38"/>
which every ſober ſentiment muſt deprecate, becomes impoſſible; no member of the family hath authority to interpoſe the dictatorial document, and the commands of the fiend are perforce obeyed. Who ſhall prevent the ſpreading evil? If licentiouſneſs is ſucceſsful in her impoſture; if, aſſuming the maſk of liberty, ſhe completeth her deception; if we proſtrate before this baleful deſtroyer, where, I demand, is my ſafety? What ſecurity can I have, that my neighbour, whoſe ſinewy arm can bear away the prize of ſtrength, will not ſnatch from me that patrimony, which, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from a virtuous line of anceſtors, I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, at the expenſe of laborious days, and many a ſelf-denying conflict? Surely, language, in attempting an enumeration of the calamities of licentiouſneſs, is baffled in the deſcription! and even <hi>conception</hi> muſt fall ſhort of the miſchiefs which ſhe produceth.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>theory</hi> of equality is not <hi>practicable</hi> in the contracted circle of domeſtic life, much leſs will that experiment ſucceed which would realize it, in regard to the heterogeneous collection of beings who conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a nation. Doth not Liberty aſſociate her laws, her regulations, and her diſtinctions? Is not good gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment the baſis on which ſhe erecteth the ſuperſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all thoſe operations ſo beneficial to mankind? Yes, Liberty, ſacred and genuine Liberty, draweth with preciſion the line, nor will ſhe permit a litigation of the inherent Rights of Man. She alloweth no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginary claims; ſhe is fearful of diſturbing the regular ſucceſſion of order; ſhe is fond of the neceſſary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of civil ſubordination; and ſhe dreadeth that tumultuous and up-rooting hurricane, which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingling the various claſſes of mankind, deſtroyeth the beautiful gradation and ſeries of harmony, again reſtoring all that wild uproar, reſulting from the rude and miſhapen domination of chaos. Yes, we repeat it, that people, that nation, that tribe or family, which is deſtitute of legiſlation, regulation, and officers of government, muſt unqueſtionably be in a deplorable ſituation. The ſtrong will invariably oppreſs the
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:034162_0266_0FFC64B9B3181FB8"/>
weak; to the luſty arm of athletic guilt, imbecile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence will fall a prey, and there is no power to redreſs! Hence the time regiſtered axiom, <hi>It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to relinquiſh a part, for the preſervation of the whole.</hi> Liberty delegates her powers, and to this effulgent goddeſs, her anointed miniſters, with that integrity and patriotic firmneſs which becometh the ſervants of a patroneſs, who ſtill regards the children of men with an eye of benignity, fail not to render up their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
                     <p>Let us ſuppoſe a people in a ſtate of nature, and let us ſuppoſe them made up of all thoſe varieties of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, intellect, paſſions, and corporeal ſtrength, which are commonly found in a community. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath convinced them, that anarchy is pregnant with every evil; and they finally combine to form the league of government. What is the mode for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice, which we would recommend to ſuch a people? Poſſeſſed by a wiſh to render perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and give the requiſite dignity, energy, execution, and obedience to the ſocial order which we ſhould aim at eſtabliſhing, we ſhould be ſolicitous to adopt in our form of polity, that gradatory junction which would cement and bind together, in an amicable and mutual exchange of good offices, the various claſſes of citizens. Fancy, for a moment, inveſts me with the venerable and honorary character of a legiſlator; and, for the purpoſe of forming, for a ſet of well diſpoſed men, a code of regulations, I imagine myſelf ſeated, with the pen of inquiry in my fingers, and my deſign being to compile a government of <hi>laws,</hi> rather than of <hi>individuals,</hi> I am naturally ſolicitous to promulgate inſtitutions, which ſhall be at once ſalutary, efficacious and pleaſing. With a view of tracing and combining an eligible plan, I might turn over huge folios of information, and, purſuing a ſcience of ſuch vaſt importance to mankind, which in its operations is capable of the higheſt public utility, or which may become the root of every evil, inveſtigation can hardly be too ſcrupulouſly exact. But what would be the reſult of an application to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

writers? Doubtleſs we ſhould find ourſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in a labyrinth of oppoſite teſtimonies; and, confuſed by a multiplicity of contradictory and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps fallacious opinions, reflection would be abſorbed, and deciſion at a ſtand.</p>
                     <p>The ancients have remarked, that, cultivated by the hand of liberty in the dwellings of freedom, the arts and ſciences flouriſhed with invigorated charms; that neither the Perſians or Egyptians underſtood their beauties; that from the Greeks, although too often engaged in hoſtilities, and ſtruggling in the toils of poverty, they obtained maturation; that they declined with that freedom, once the glory of the Grecian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics, and that, with their auguſt patroneſs, winging their etherial way to celebrious Rome, they there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their ſplendid career, until the immolation of liberty, in that imperial city, muffled in dark and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentous clouds thoſe intellectual luminaries; and hence, from theſe incontrovertible facts, it is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aſſerted, that the arts and ſciences can never flouriſh but in the ſoil of freedom. Yet, in oppoſition to a concluſion which may have been too haſtil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> formed, we are told, that <hi>modern Rome</hi> and Florence have enwreathed with perfection, ſculpture, painting, muſic and poetry; and that Florence, after the uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of the family of Medici, made the moſt rapid proficiency in thoſe arts. Arioſto, Taſſo, Galileo, Raphael, and Michael Angelio; theſe illuſtrious paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, poets and mathematicians, it is obſerved, were not born in republics. Reubens, it is ſaid, collected and eſtabliſhed his ſchool at Antwerp, and not at Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam; and in Germany, the true poliſh of manners is rather to be found at Dreſden than at Hamburgh.</p>
                     <p>France hath undoubtedly furniſhed a ſtriking exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the proſperity of literature in an abſolute gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. Philoſophy, poetry, dramatic eminence, oratory, hiſtory, painting, architecture, ſculpture, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic—theſe have received the moſt extenſive cultivation, and the higheſt honours in the <hi>kingdom</hi> of France: And we are moreover aſſured, that the <hi>cidevant</hi> ſubjects
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:034162_0268_0FFC64B355E813F8"/>
had aſtoniſhingly meliorated that moſt grateful and beneficial of all arts, <hi>l' Art de Vivre,</hi> the neceſſary and ſocial art, which involves a mutual interchange of ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>contradictory</hi> are thoſe ſtreams of information, which yet may have originated in the fountain of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The ſuperſtructures of governments have gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally been raiſed upon apprehenſion and compulſion; in ſuch circumſtances, error hath been almoſt unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and it can never be matter of wonder, that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſyſtems are ſuſceptible of improvement.</p>
                     <p>In the novelties of Lycurgus, the features of artifice and fraud are but too prevalent. Solon, although the votary of wiſdom, and undoubtedly the mild and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent friend of mankind, yet even Solon entertained deſpotic ideas of the powers veſted in him, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear obſerving, that he conſidered himſelf as poſſeſſing an <hi>optional</hi> authority, to implant the germe of deſpotiſm, or to emit the rays of bland and correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed freedom. Numa, by virtue of the goddeſs Egeria, might have originated the groſſeſt impoſitions; and it is an indubitable truth, that the rights of man are irreconcileable with a relinquiſhment of that privilege of inquiry, which may erect a barrier to the inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of evil. Turning, for a moment, from all thoſe reſervoirs of knowledge, which, nevertheleſs, I muſt ever unceaſingly venerate, I wave the occupation of a Gleaner, and ſimply lighting the torch of reaſon at the flame of experience, I will, for the organization of my ſketch of immunities, conſult thoſe ſentiments and concluſions, which are the natural growth of a plain mind.</p>
                     <p>Common ſenſe pronounces, that a people deſtitute of a leader, and deſtitute of legiſlation, loudly demand the <hi>protecting hand of a guardian power;</hi> and, liberty adds, that a chief ſhould be obtained by the joint ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages of the people at large. To this end, they muſt be convened in their ſeveral diſtricts, where, uninflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by party or by paſſion, let them commiſſion him, whom they eſteem moſt worthy, to aſſume that auguſt
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:034162_0269_0FFC64B1CC7B09B0"/>
title—<hi>The Father of his Country;</hi> and, after reciprocat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt ſolemn engagements, after conſecrating him by their joint affections and benedictions, let them inveſt him with authority to lead them againſt their combined enemies, to fight their battles, and, by the wiſdom of his regulations, to procure them victory, and to guarantee their juſt immunities. Let this their choſen patriot be aided by a general council, conſiſting of delegates according to the number of the people. Let theſe delegates be appointed by a deciſion, influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced only by the intrinſic worth of the candidates. Let them form two diſtinct deliberative bodies, or houſes, properly qualified and authorized to ACT AS CHECKS upon each other; and, let theſe three branches be inveſted with powers, fully adequate to all the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of legiſlation. To the <hi>departments</hi> thus appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to theſe <hi>high offices</hi> of truſt, let the utmoſt veneration be annexed; but I would ordain, that the individuals who filled them, ſhould, after a ſtated time, be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at the pleaſure of the people. Even the Firſt Magiſtrate ſhould hold his place but in conſequence of frequent re-elections; and for high crimes and miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors, he ſhould be conſidered as amenable to the laws. Upon legiſlative acts he ſhould poſſeſs only a conditional negative; and while his fellow-citizens were aided by his counſels, they ſhould be ſecured from his encroachments. He ſhould always be conſidered as the Chief Warrior of the people; but in the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of treaties, he ſhould call in, at leaſt, one branch of the legiſlature, and the ſame concurrence ſhould be neceſſary to the appointment to offices. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce or currency of the nation ſhould not be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the preſcriptions of its Executive, nor ſhould he arrogate, in matters of conſcience, even the ſhadow of juriſdiction. As a faithful and vigilant friend of the people, he ſhould be unwearied in his informations, recommendations, and all ſuch conſtitutional meaſures, as he ſhould conceive would conduce to the public weal; and, during his adminiſtration, he ſhould be careful to exact a faithful obedience to the laws. If
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:034162_0270_0FFC64B048845028"/>
in any ſingle inſtance I entruſted him with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary or abſolute power, it ſhall be in granting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieves, or remiſſion of offences; for, as I would always give the ſcale to preponderate on the ſide of mercy, ſo I would arm the Executive with the lenity of clemency, while I debarred him the exerciſe of meaſures unduly ſanguinary.</p>
                     <p>Yet with the dignified and honorary diſtinctions of government, I would be careful to inveſt the Man of the people. Ambaſſadors, and other public miniſters, ſhould mingle in his train, and every rational inſignia of reſpect ſhould ornament his <hi>department.</hi> His <hi>office</hi> ſhould enſure the higheſt reſpect; and I would yield obedience to the <hi>individual</hi> as long as he was entitled to <hi>public confidence</hi> and reſpect.</p>
                     <p>The judicial power ſhould be ſeparate from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive, and I would inveſt it with as large a ſhare of <hi>independence</hi> as could conſiſt with <hi>reciprocality</hi> and <hi>union;</hi> while the degree of guilt involved in crimes of almoſt every deſcription, ſhould be determined by the empan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelled peers of the culprit. "But all this is only col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the inſtruments, while the code of inſtitutions are yet unfaſhioned." True, but as legiſlative acts ſhould be the reſult of the moſt mature deliberation, we will ſearch in the great volume of nature, we will turn over the leaves of experience, and thus ſelecting the gems, and from time to time accumulating our ſyſtem, we will finally preſent the luminous compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um to the conſideration, and, as we hope, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of unprejudiced reaſon. Meanwhile, ſkim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the ſurface of my ſubject, I preſent only the rudiments of a ſyſtem, which fancy hath pleaſingly contemplated.</p>
                     <p>Doth the reader exclaim—"<hi>Surely theſe hints are nothing more than the lineaments of the conſtitution of the United States!</hi>" Well, honeſt friend, they are the <hi>lineaments of nature</hi>—the <hi>lineaments of liberty</hi>—they make a part of that contract to which ſhe conſents; and, without entering into the complex and admirable intertexture of thoſe united and ſeparate governments,
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:034162_0271_0FFC64AB4655C3E0"/>
which conſtitute our federaliſm, we pronounce, that theſe are the leading features of that ſubordination, without which, GENUINE LIBERTY would no longer irradiate our hemiſphere.</p>
                     <p>May the parties which are originated, ſtimulate the exertions of her real votaries; may no deſcription among us ever aſſume the gorgon head of faction; and, may the mutual jealouſies, diſſentions and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which pervade, ſerve as antidotes to each other. Parties, in a ſtate of civil and political liberty, have been compared to the paſſions of an individual; and, as the paſſions are ſaid to be the elements of life, ſo the animated and reſuſcitating ſpirit of party is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be eſſential to the exiſtence of genuine free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Be it ſo; and may the public weal, the public tranquillity, be, by every means, promoted.</p>

                     <p>WITH ſenſations of ineffable complacency and high glee; with feelings, the felicity of which it would be difficult if not impoſſible to delineate, I ſet me down, upon this 27th day of May, 1794, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count unto the <hi>good-natured reader</hi> an event, which, if I have not been extremely erroneous in my calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will render him, in no inconſiderable degree, a partaker of my joy.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, good-natured reader; for, without incurring the charge of credulity, I conceive I may fairly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:034162_0272_0FFC64A87A8FE1E0"/>
that perſons of this deſcription have, from time to time, been conſtrained to take an intereſt in the fate of Margaretta Melworth Hamilton. I ſay, <hi>good-natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reader,</hi> becauſe <hi>the Gleaner</hi> hath never yet had the arrogance to conceive his powers ſufficiently energet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic to arreſt the attention of the phlegmatic, the ſatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine, or the faſtidious. Individuals poſſeſſing minds caſt in theſe moulds, he hath conſidered as inacceſſible, and he hath imagined them turning from the pages of the Gleaner, with all the frigidity of apathy, with all the glooms attendant upon rigorous ſeverity, diſguſt, or contempt. Nor doth he enter this remark as a complaint; he hath been <hi>humble enough</hi> to content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the eſteem of the <hi>candid</hi> and <hi>ſincere;</hi> in the boſom of ſenſibility he fondly conceives he hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a place, and he is ambitious of rendering his efforts worthy that degree of conſideration with which they may be regarded. Addreſſing then the humane, the benevolent, and the ingenuous; in one word, thoſe who are willing to be pleaſed, he hardly heſitates in promiſing himſelf at leaſt a hearing: and, he is free to own, that he poſſeſſes ſuch a comfortable ſhare of ſelf complacency, as to become confident, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he conſecrates his efforts by the name of the daughter of his affection, he enſures a ſhare of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; nor will he conſent that this idea ſhould be imputed altogether to an over-weening conceit of his own abilities; for ſurely it muſt be acknowledged that an amiable and meritorious woman, ſtruggling with misfortunes, is an object which virtue muſt ever regard with commiſeration and applauſe. For the officious length of this exordium, I ſupplicate the indulgence of thoſe gentle ſpirits, upon whoſe favour I have preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; a candidate for the patronage of benignity ſhould haſten to gratify the feelings of ſuſceptibility, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter narrating a few previous arrangements, without further delay, I ſhall paſs on to a developement, which hath not only inveſted our daughter with high afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but hath, moreover, reſtored to her a bleſſing, which ſhe entertained not the ſmalleſt conception of ever being permitted to poſſeſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="274" facs="unknown:034162_0273_0FFC64A6C6E92658"/>
My laſt communications relative to Mrs. Hamilton, crowned her with thoſe honours which bloom moſt becomingly upon a female brow; the propriety of her conduct in the matrimonial career could not be queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and her patient merit was, in her own opinion, amply rewarded, by a diſcovery that neither misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes or caprice had robbed her of, or in the ſmalleſt degree abated the affectionate attachment of him, to whom her gentle heart was unreſervedly devoted.</p>
                     <p>That tumultuous delirium of joy, of which the ſketch of the ſcene in my reading parlour, in the month of November laſt, can have given but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent idea, gradually ſubſided into an exquiſitely pleaſing calm. Peace, with every accompaniment, which ever cluſters in the train of tranquillity, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtated in her boſom; roſy confidence, fruitful in the ſoil of conjugal complacency, again lifted its auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious head, and the rich perfumes which it breathed around, ſcattered thoſe ſalutary ſweets that gave to every object a face of pleaſure. Margaretta ſeemed to regard poverty as the angel of ſerenity: Indeed a true knowledge of her circumſtances had relieved her from a mighty preſſure, which, becoming quite inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, had well near broken the ſlender thread of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; and an aſſured knowledge that ſhe ſtill poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe undivided regards, which ſhe had ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe no longer reciprocated, very naturally, for a time, abſorbed in her gentle boſom every other conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Some days delightfully ſerene, thus rolled on. I knew that the burſting ſtorm, the tremendous and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooting hurricane muſt ſucceed; but I trembled to diſturb the innocent and unreflecting felicity of the moment. Mr. Seymour, the generous young man who had extricated Hamilton from his difficulties, while hopeleſs love produced him a wandering fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the ſouthern States, had failed for ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; and although repeated letters, glowing with friendſhip and matchleſs generoſity, penned by the hand of Mr. Seymour, aſſured us, that he would ward
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:034162_0274_0FFC64A3F92F0DA8"/>
the blow from us, to the extremeſt verge of poſſibility; yet as he continued, for the ſafety of his perſon, a priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner in his own houſe; as all his books, bonds, and papers, of every kind, were ſubmitted to the inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his creditors; and, as he aſſured himſelf that a fair adjuſtment, producing an amicable compromiſe, would uſher in his liberating hour, the utmoſt creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could not flatter us with continued exemption. Mr. Hamilton too, had many other creditors, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came much more ſuſpicious, inquiſitive, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, than we had expected.</p>
                     <p>The ſcene once opened, my knowledge of mankind induced me to fear a rapid ſucceſſion of diſtreſſing events; and neceſſity, therefore, impelled me to obtrude upon the halcyon hours of my children conſiderations which threw open the avenues of uncounted cares, and great inquietude. Serafina Clifford continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied in her remonſtrances; ſhe was eager to diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs herſelf, in favour of her brother, of every ſhilling which ſhe poſſeſſed; and againſt the ardour and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous impetuoſity of her attack, honour, juſtice, and fraternal affection, although embodied for the purpoſe, maintained but a doubtful combat; until availing my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the rights inveſted in me by my paternal author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, I was reduced to the diſagreeable alternative of interpoſing a poſitive prohibition.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Clifford, in a kind of frenzy, claſped the little William to her boſom, and calling upon the ſhade of her departed father to witneſs her engagements, ſhe vowed henceforward to devote herſelf and fortune entirely to him; adding, <q>I will, my lovely child, be indefatigable in guarding the ſoil of thy infant mind from the admiſſion of that fatal germ, which never fails to produce a growth of falſe principles, of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that proſtitute the ſacred names of honour and integrity, beſtowing them upon an <hi>unſocial kind of pride,</hi> a barbarous ſentiment, which compels its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, although placed upon a precipice of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ruin, to diſdain the aſſiſtance of that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is warm, natural, glowing, and ſincere;
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:034162_0275_0FFC649FC62BF8A8"/>
of that friendſhip, which, as it originates affinity and gratitude, as it is the reſult of the fondeſt attachment, and meliorated by deliberate eſteem, can ſurely nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be regarded as problematical. Sweet innocent! may the kindred blood that ſwells thy little veins, render thee one day leſs obdurate than thy dear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible parents. From this moment the intereſts of Serafina and thine are inſeparably interwoven.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fear not, gentle reader, by virtue of the patriarchal dignity which I have aſſumed, I will, <hi>upon a proper oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,</hi> grant unto the ſaid Serafina Clifford, a full and free abſolution from this her inconſiderate vow, which I ſhall take care to impute to the irreſiſtible impulſe of an impaſſioned moment.</p>
                     <p>In concert with Mr. Hamilton, without delay I took meaſures to place the property in his poſſeſſion, beyond the reach of <hi>any ſingle</hi> creditor; regulating it in ſuch a manner, as would inconteſtibly be moſt for the advantage of, and yield unto <hi>every claimant an equal</hi> and handſome dividend. Thus prepared for a contingency that we had but too much reaſon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently to expect, I requeſted Mary once more to call into action that admirable addreſs which ſhe had ſo repeatedly exemplified. Go, my love, ſaid I, with all thy winning graces, and affectionate perſuaſion; with all thy angel ſoftneſs, and reconcile our daughter to that revolution in her proſpects, which muſt place her again a reſident in this family. Margaretta was far advanced in her ſecond pregnancy, and we judged it neceſſary to obſerve, in regard to her, the utmoſt del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icacy; but we had not yet learned properly to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate the mind of our amiable child. Thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which are generally ſo alluring to a young woman, were not conſidered by her, of ſufficient importance to give her eſſential or laſting pain. An eſtabliſhment, ranking as the head of a family, preſiding at her ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, giving laws to a train of ſervants, receiving viſits in her own houſe, with a number of <hi>et-ceteras,</hi> which have frequently the power of faſcinating a young mind, were regarded as conſiderations <hi>comparatively</hi> of little
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:034162_0276_0FFC649E42F04220"/>
or no moment; and while conſcious ſhe poſſeſſed the affections of the man of her heart; while ſhe retained his ſociety; while ſhe could claſp to her throbbing bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom her lovely infant; while indulged with the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Miſs Clifford, now more than ever endeared to her, and bound to her ſoul by motives of the moſt del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icate and indiſſoluble tenderneſs and eſteem; while ſhe enjoyed the approbating countenance of her parents, her ſuperior underſtanding could ſcarce forbear a ſmile at the ſolicitude we diſcovered reſpecting her removal; and, relinquiſhing her elegant apartments, I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve without a ſingle murmur, ſhe haſtened, together with her amiable friend, to thoſe parental arms which were ever open to receive her.</p>
                     <p>Trials, however, awaited her. It was neceſſary that Mr. Hamilton, who was anxious to accelerate the hour that ſhould honourably exonerate him from his embarraſſments, and who was extremely deſirous of making proviſion for the growing family which he had in proſpect, ſhould immediately apply to ſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which might afford an expectation of putting him in poſſeſſion of wiſhes ſo indiſputably lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. A ſhip bound for Europe, in which he was offered, with the probability of great commercial advantage, a very lucrative and honorary birth, propitiouſly preſented. Of an opening ſo fortunate, intereſt loudly called upon him to avail himſelf; the favourable gale of opportunity was not to be ſlighted. But his heart bled for his Margaretta; yet manly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion heſitated not, and every thing was in train for his departure. We conceived it adviſeable to conceal our purpoſe from my daughter as long as poſſible; and it was not until two days previous to the period deſtined for his embarkation, that I took upon myſelf the painful taſk of diſcloſing to her an event, which we judged muſt inevitably take place. Mary, Miſs Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Edward and myſelf, ſeated with Margaretta, in a retired apartment, had for ſome time been employed in obſerving her; while on her part ſhe ſeemed whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſorbed in contemplating the features of the little William, who, ſleeping on a pillow before her, diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:034162_0277_0FFC649B6498CA28"/>
a countenance truly cherubic. Soul of ſenſibility! moſt unwillingly did I recall her from her maternal reverie! but neceſſity apparently impelling, I thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed her:</p>
                     <p>What is there that Mrs. Hamilton would not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to advance the happineſs of the little being, whom ſhe hath introduced into exiſtence? Margaretta ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—it ſeemed as if her apprehenſive boſom compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, in a ſingle inſtant, the agonizing intelligence which ſhe was about to receive. She continued, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſilent, while urged by neceſſity, I reluctantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded—There is a duty incumbent upon parents, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their children, and from the moment of their birth they are bound to every poſſible exertion, which they can rationally ſuppoſe will contribute to their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al felicity.</hi> Upon Margaretta Hamilton claims of this ſort will ſoon be multiplied, and the probability is, that a long train of ſons and daughters will riſe up and call her bleſſed. Margaretta will not ſurely be found deficient in her maternal character; the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes attendant upon the education of young people, their advancement in life, eſtabliſhment, &amp;c. how quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will they ſucceed. It is happy, that when a ſingle means of acquiring property fails, there are others which preſent.</p>
                     <p>The ocean opens its hoſpitable arms to the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate man, from whom every other reſource is cut off; while the dangers, ſuppoſed peculiarly incident to a ſeafaring life are in reality chimeras, calculated only to appal perſons unaccuſtomed to reflect. Thoſe who acknowledge the ſuperintendence of Providence, the exiſtence of Deity, if they aſcribe to him thoſe powers and properties which are eſſential to the being of a God, muſt acknowledge, that his protecting arm is, upon all occaſions, ſtretched forth; that he can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve upon the mighty waters with the ſame facility with which he upholdeth the dweller upon the land. The truth is, we are immortal until the ſeparating warrant paſſes the great ſeal of Heaven; and, the breath arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a deſignation ſo inevitable, no arrangement can
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:034162_0278_0FFC64989B4DF998"/>
redeem. I flatter myſelf, my beloved Margaretta, that your mind, equal, energetic, and conſiderate, would not ſuffer itſelf to be over much depreſſed, ſhould the viciſſitudes of life produce contingencies, unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably condemning you to a few months abſence from Mr. Hamilton; two or three voyages might perhaps entirely retrieve his affairs, and you would ever after have the ſatisfaction to reflect that you had contributed every thing in your power; every thing which forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and uniform exertions could achieve, in order to re-inſtate your Edward in that independence to which he was born. I was proceeding—but I had not been ſufficiently cautious. My daughter, during my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, frequently changed colour; the lily and the roſe ſeemed to chaſe each other upon her now mant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and now pallid cheek; ſhe trembled exceſſively; and upon my particular application to her, the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her boſom, becoming inſupportable, ſhe ſunk breathleſs into the arms of that paſſionately beloved, and truly afflicted huſband, who haſted to prevent her fall.</p>
                     <p>"My God!" exclaimed Hamilton, <q>it is too much; reſtore, compoſe, and ſoothe this ſuffering angel, too often exerciſed by pangs of ſo ſevere a nature; and do, with a wretch who hath betrayed and undone her, whatever ſeemeth to thee good.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mary and Serafina ſoon recalled the fleeting ſpirit of the lovely mourner. Hamilton once more kneeled before her, and the copious tears, with which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed the hand that he alternately preſſed to his boſom and to his lips, called forth a mingling ſtream from the eyes of the beauteous ſufferer. The ſcene was inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſively tender, but the humid drops upon the face of my daughter annihilated at leaſt one half of my fears upon her account. "And can you, Sir," in a tremulous accent ſhe exclaimed—<q>can you condemn my Edward to bondage, perhaps to irretrievable ſlavery?</q> What means my love? <q>Ah, Sir! do you not recollect Britiſh depredations? Do you not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ollect the ruthleſs and unrelenting rigour of that
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:034162_0279_0FFC649518C216C8"/>
fate which awaits the captive, doomed to wear out a wretched life under the galling yoke of an Algerine deſpot? Might I but have been ſpared at this time! might a ſtep ſo fatal to my peace, at leaſt have been deferred, until the face of affairs wore, to the poor, deſolate, and exiled voyager, a more confirmed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, I think I could have acquieſced.</q> For a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe pauſed; ſighs, expreſſive of the deepeſt anguiſh, burſt from her boſom. Again ſhe reſumed—<q>Gracious Heaven! what an extenſive and wide ſpreading error hath my early indiſcretion proved! and perhaps its cruel conſequences will follow me to the lateſt period of my exiſtence! <hi>Had I waited the parental ſanction, ere I lent an ear to a wretch, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in the arts of deception;</hi> had I not blindly and precipitately given the reins to reprehenſible inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhould never have liſtened to the pernicious voice of adulation; the faithful heart of my Edward would not have received a corroding wound; he would not have been impelled to a voluntary baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he would never have had recourſe to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, which hath too ſurely involved in ruin my terreſtrial hopes! Forgive me, O my parents! for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, O thou beſt of men! and thou ſleeping innocent, forgive, O forgive thy wretched mother! It is now indeed that Margaretta is completely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I was immeaſurably affected; yet I knew that my daughter would ſoon become capable of reaſoning. She poſſeſſes, in an uncommon degree, the power of accurately diſcuſſing points, in which ſhe is the moſt deeply intereſted; but altogether unprepared for the preſent calamity, reaſon had been violently forced from the helm, and we unitedly endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore her to that reflection, to which we well knew ſhe was eminently adequate. The ſoothings of unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned friendſhip are the ſweeteſt ſolace; they yield a balm which is endowed with the ſovereign power of mitigation, and they are a conſolation in almoſt every ſorrow. It was neceſſary to bend the mind of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetta
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:034162_0280_0FFC649394B529A8"/>
to our purpoſe, and a few hours accompliſhed our wiſhes; gradually we opened our plan; ſhe ſaw the propriety of every arrangement; the neceſſity for the ſteps we had taken, and the idea, then firſt held up, of the poſſibility that the time was not far diſtant, which might legally immure her Hamilton within the walls of a priſon, produced the expected effect. Wav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſnowy hand with peerleſs grace, ſhe preſſed it upon her cloſed lips, and bowing her afflicted head, thus tacitly gave that expreſſive, although melancholy aſſent, of which, from the beginning, conſidering the juſtneſs of her way of thinking, we had made ourſelves ſure. Two days, as I ſaid, only remained, and they were marked by a deeper ſorrow, than any which has yet pierced the boſom of my daughter! It will not be doubted, that we called into action every motive which could give energy and firmneſs to her feelings; yet, while penſive reſignation dwelt upon her lips, her altered countenance and debilitated frame evinced the ſtruggles of her ſoul. It was a trial upon which ſhe had never reckoned; in every event, ſhe had calculated upon the ſupporting preſence of her huſband, and that ſhe was thus unprepared for the ſtroke, muſt apologize for the agonized emotions with which ſhe ſubmitted to the blow! The evening at length arrived, which we conceived deſtined to uſher in the morning, upon which our adventurer was to depart for a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring town, in order to his embarkation, and its progreſs was noted by the heart-felt ſighs of corrod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anguiſh.</p>
                     <p>But juſt at this juncture, unfortunately, as I then imagined, our Federal Government interpoſed the late embargo, and joy once more mantled upon the cheek of Mrs. Hamilton. Thus it is, we ſubmit to neceſſity; we are convinced of the utility of certain arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and we are conſtrained, by conviction, to yield our aſſent to events which, nevertheleſs, pierce the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom with the barbed arrows of affliction: Yet, if an interpoſing hand breaks the order to which we had reluctantly ſubmitted; if we are conſcious that we
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:034162_0281_0FFC649153923548"/>
have no how aided in producing the incident; if we have, in every reſpect, acted up to our duty, we ſeem to forget the good we had expected; we rejoice in a change, which emancipates us from thoſe ſorrows we had impoſed upon ourſelves; we ſeem to have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the goal of felicity; and, for a little moment, we become unmindful of thoſe compulſory conſiderations, which had urged the application of a remedy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged indiſpenſably requiſite. Margaretta, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the good ſenſe of which ſhe is miſtreſs—notwithſtanding the remonſtrances of reaſon—not only regarded the embargo as a reprieve, but involuntarily breathed her wiſhes for its continuance; and I produce it as an irrefragable fact, that our country contains not a ſingle partizan, whoſe boſom glowed with more ill-adviſed zeal, for the extenſion or renewal of this ſame embargo. The 25th inſtant, however, arrived—it paſſed—the fleet and welcome footſteps of no new commiſſioned expreſs gladdened the ear of impetuoſity—and the embargo expired—Hamilton was again on the eve of his departure. Yeſterday, exactly at one o'clock, we were aſſembled in the dining parlour. This very morning was to have witneſſed the agon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized moment of ſeparation—and melancholy dejection brooded in the countenance of Margaretta.</p>
                     <p>My ſervant, a man whom I have loved for theſe forty years, entered:—"A ſtranger, Sir, is importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to ſee you." Admit him, by all means. Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta was haſting from the parlour; ſhe was ſolicitous to hide her grief from the obſervation of the uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted; but the ſtranger was cloſe upon the heels of the ſervant, and not being able to make her eſcape, ſhe withdrew to the window.</p>
                     <p>The gentleman, the ſtranger, I ſay, entered; upon his features were imprinted the ſtrongeſt marks of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed and tender anxiety; and, moreover, they were features <hi>with which I was confident I had long been familiar,</hi> although, for my ſoul, I could not recollect at what time, or in what place, they had met my view. He, however, fixing his inquiring eyes, with impatient
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:034162_0282_0FFC648DF94DD0A8"/>
ſolicitude, on the face of my wife, and drawing up a heavy ſigh, thus laconically apologized:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Excuſe me, Madam, excuſe me, Sir—but my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings diſdain ceremony.</q> The ſcrutiny under which the countenance of Mary paſſed, was ſoon performed; and Miſs Clifford next engaged the attention of a man, who, but for the benign aſcendancy, which, amid the moſt tumultuous agitation I had ever witneſſed, was ſtill conſpicuous in his countenance, I ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, entirely deprived of reaſon.</p>
                     <p>"You are lovely," he exclaimed, addreſſing Miſs Clifford, <q>but you are not the angel—at leaſt, I think you are not—of whom I am in purſuit.—Tell me, Mr. Vigillius; tell me, ye incomparable pair! ye who have ſtill continued the matchleſs guardians of my long loſt and unceaſingly lamented Margaretta, what apartment in this happy dwelling contains my only ſurviving treaſure?</q> Margaretta, who had ſought to hide her ſorrow-marked viſage from the gaze of a ſtranger, now, loſt in aſtoniſhment, mechanically turning from the window, preſented to his view her tearful face; ſhe catched a glance, and, faintly ſhriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would have ſunk upon the floor, had not the ſtranger, whom we now regarded with a kind of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant horror, ſnatched her to his embrace! Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, however, ſoon gave place to all thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raptured emotions, which the acceſſion of high and unexpected felicity originates in the boſom, when, in a voice expreſſive of paternal tenderneſs, of paternal tranſport, he ſoothingly ſaid—</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Compoſe yourſelf, my lovely, my admirable, my inimitable child! It is a <hi>father's</hi> arms that are at length permitted to enfold his long loſt Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta!!! Arbuthnot, thou ſhalt no more invade my rights; it is again given me to poſſeſs my child, and all her beauteous mother ſtands confeſt! Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit—this hour ſhall render thy elyſian ſtill more bleſſed!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Margaretta ſhrunk not from his embraces: Strange as it may appear, her agitated ſpirit did not entirely
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:034162_0283_0FFC648BC619D808"/>
ſuſpend its functions; and while ſhe ſeemed, in the arms of the ſtranger, an almoſt lifeleſs corſe, her lips yet moved, and every charming feature received an extatic kind of ejaculatory impreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Among the trinkets belonging to her mother, which had come into her poſſeſſion on the death of Mrs. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buthnot, was a miniature picture of her father: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there was not a ſingle day, on which ſhe did not gaze with filial devotion upon this picture. It was a ſtriking likeneſs; and, by its general contour, her mind was ſtrongly impreſſed. Hence the effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, by a ſingle glance at the original; and it was a frequent obſervation of this picture, that occaſioned the confuſed recollection, for which, upon the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the ſtranger, I was at a loſs to account.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be matter of wonder, that at an interview ſo aſtoniſhingly intereſting, not an individual retained that ſelf-command, ſo requiſite to common forms: At length, however, recollection reſumed, in a degree, its office. Mary conducted Mrs. Hamilton to a ſofa, when, a flood of tears unlocking for her the powers of utterance, with a look of profound and dignified veneration, ſhe quitted her ſeat, and ſuddenly kneeling before the honoured man, in this devotional attitude, with claſped hands, and in broken accents, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbedly queſtioned—<q>Art thou a ſpirit bleſt—diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched from Heaven's high court to ſoothe thy ſorrowing child?—or art thou indeed my father? Haſt thou never taſted death? and, if thou haſt not, by what miracle didſt thou eſcape thoſe tremendous waves, which we have ſuppoſed commiſſioned for thy deſtruction?</q> Mr. Melworth, forſooth, to ſay it was he, his very ſelf, raiſed his kneeling child, and again claſping her to his paternal boſom, in ſtrains of exquiſite tenderneſs, affectionately replied—</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Be comforted, my love; be compoſed, my heart's beſt treaſure; I am indeed thy father. At a proper time, thou ſhalt be made acquainted with every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; and, in the interim, as I have been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of thy embarraſſed circumſtances, know, that
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:034162_0284_0FFC648A40CF61D8"/>
riches, more than thou canſt want, are in my gift. Thou ſhalt introduce me to thy worthy huſband. I am apprized of the whole of thy ſweetly intereſting ſtory; and thy happineſs ſhall, if poſſible, be equal to thy merit.</q> Margaretta, wild with tranſport, now raiſed her eyes and hands to Heaven, and the moſt extravagant and incoherent expreſſions of joy were upon her lips. "Then he ſhall not go," ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed—<q>Avaunt, ye brooding fiends, that hover round the land of murder!—ye ſhall not intercept the virtuous career of Hamilton—ye ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to manacle thoſe hands that have, a thouſand times, been ſtretched forth to wipe the tear from the face of ſorrow—Avaunt, ye hell-born fiends!—Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, united for his deſtruction, ſhall not detain him; for lo, a bleſſed father deſcends from heaven, to ſave his well near ſinking Margaretta!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Edward, who, from the entrance of Mr. Melworth, had remained, as it were, entranced, or petrified by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment, rouſed by his fears for the reaſon of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetta, now coming forward, proſtrated himſelf at the feet of Mr. Melworth. No one poſſeſſed ſufficient compoſure to introduce him—nor was this neceſſary; the ſtrong ſenſations which pervaded his almoſt burſting heart, inſcribing upon every manly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive feature, veneration, joy, gratitude, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, emphatically pointed him out, and rendered a doubt impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>But why continue a ſcene, which may, <hi>perhaps, be conceived,</hi> but which words can never delineate? <hi>Our mutual congratulations; our mutual expreſſions of felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the beſt affections of which humanity is capable; the moſt rapturous ſenſations of delight; theſe were all in courſe—and theſe were all afloat;</hi> and I will only add, that Edward will not proceed on his voyage—that Margaretta is happy—that every creditor ſhall be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſatisfied; and I hereby advertiſe—let them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their ſeveral claims; they ſhall receive to the laſt farthing, yea, and liberal intereſt too.

                     <p>THE author, who leaves nothing to the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his readers, is frequently accuſed of blameable arrogance; and it is often aſſerted that, puffed up by an over-weening ſelf-conceit, he vainly ſuppoſes, that the germ of fancy can flouriſh no where but in the ſoil of his own wonderful pericranium.</p>
                     <p>Now, as the fact is, that I am anxiouſly ſolicitous to avoid every occaſion of offence, I ſhall (taking into conſideration the feelings of ſenſibility, and properly influenced by an idea of the ingenuity which is its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companiment) wave the deſcription of thoſe delightful ſenſations, which, in rapturous ſucceſſion, were the nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural appendages of the introduction of the father of Margaretta. The extatic fondneſs with which he hung upon the accents of his daughter—the mingling pleaſures and regrets—the big emotions which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed his ſoul, as he traced each lovely feature—thoſe well-known features, which exhibited to his view a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:034162_0286_0FFC6484EA837FC8"/>
tranſcript of thoſe that he had early learned to admire in the face of her departed mother—the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſenſations with which he traced the kindred lineaments—comparing them ſeparately and collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ively with a miniature of his lady, which he wore in his boſom, and which might have paſſed for an exact copy of Mrs. Hamilton—the glowing expreſſions of paternal tenderneſs, with which he folded the little William to his boſom—the marked approbation, une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocally demonſtrated toward every movement of the huſband of his Margaretta—the manly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placent regards that he beſtowed upon Miſs Clifford—the ſweet incenſe of expanſive and immeaſurable praiſe, that he addreſſed to me, ſtyling me the ſaviour, the benefactor, the genuine father of his poor orphan girl—the elevated regards, ſhort only of adoration, which he devoted to my dear Mary—thoſe charming effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, conſiſting in expreſſive looks, broken words, and unambiguous geſtures; effuſions which were the ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous growth of uncommon felicity, the reciprocity of exquiſite ſatisfaction which we abundantly inhaled—All this, and whatever elſe the ſoul of ſenſibility can conceive, gladly do I refer to the glowing mind of the <hi>feeling ſentimentaliſt;</hi> and I do hereby inveſt imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, in the utmoſt latitude of its powers, with full ſcope; it is impoſſible it can paint too high; language is indeed inſufficient, and the moſt vivid tints of fancy can alone pourtray.</p>
                     <p>Nay, gentle reader, I take upon me to aſſert, that however elaborately thou mayeſt finiſh thy picture, after thou has beſtowed upon it thy laſt touches, it may, after all, fall vaſtly ſhort of the original; and, right ſorry am I, that my powers are ſo circumſcribed, as to render it impoſſible for me to place it in its genuine luſtre before thee. But, finite efforts, being doomed to ſubmit to a neceſſity, the effects of which it muſt ever be unavailing to lament; we will, without further preamble, proceed in our narration.

From the hour which bleſſed me with the hand of my Margaretta, ſhe continued ſedulouſly intent on procuring a reconciliation with her ſiſter; for the companion of her youth the ſigh of her boſom ſtill aroſe, and while the utter improbability of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her wiſhes embittered our moſt pleaſurable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, her intenſe and unavailing ſolicitude viſibly impaired her health!</p>
                        <p>I flattered myſelf that the period which gave thee, my love, to her arms, would ſupply that void in her heart, which, however ardent the attachment of your ſex to the man of their choice may be, ſuch is the del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icacy of the female mind, a tender and reſpectable <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male friend</hi> can alone fill. Your mother, my dear, was early left an orphan. Her ſiſter had for a long peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od reigned ſupreme in her boſom. Fate preſented her not a Mrs. Vigillius; goodneſs ſo unexampled is not the growth of every clime; neither was a Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina Clifford contained in the circle of her connexions. Yet, as I had hoped, the birth of her daughter opened a ſource of new and exhauſtleſs pleaſure; and when ſhe claſped her lovely infant to her boſom, ſhe forgot, for a moment, her ſiſter; but memory, too faithful to its office, officiouſly preſented the mirror.—"Dear im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Henrietta!" ſhe exclaimed, "why wilt thou ſtand aloof? why wilt thou refuſe to heighten the tranſports of this delicious period? Thy preſence, thy ſanction would indeed add a completion to my feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, which would mark me the moſt bleſſed of women!</p>
                        <p>The novelty, however, the ſoft endearments, the thouſand nameleſs perturbations, and tender intereſt of the maternal character, were powerful alleviations, and the tranquillity of the mother was in a meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. Eighteen halcyon months revolved, when fate, as if envious of our felicity, preſented me with a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of obtaining great emolument, by engaging on board a ſhip bound for the Eaſt-Indies. I was flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the idea of obtaining for my Margaretta and her infant, an elegant independence, and that reſolution
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:034162_0289_0FFC647D348F2788"/>
which became the ſuperſtructure of a baſis ſo proper and ſo deeply laid, could not be eaſily ſhaken. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetta, while ſhe acknowledged the eligibility of my plan, ſhrunk from its execution. Her tenderly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive boſom foreboded a thouſand evils. Yet the heroiſm of her character can never be too much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired.</p>
                        <p>"Go, my Charles"—with emotions of tender and unutterable agony, ſhe exclaimed—"ſince it muſt be ſo, go!—and may the upholding hand of Heaven be, in every event, thy never-failing ſupport!" Repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe ſobbed out the convulſed and agonizing adieu, while ingenious in inventions to retard my departure, ſhe preſſed me to her throbbing heart. "Oh! my love," in broken accents ſhe whiſpered, "if we meet again, we ſhall then be happy. But alas! alas!" ſhe could not add. Yet ſtill her claſped hands and ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes continued to ſupplicate the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> of that God, on whom her firm reliance was invariably placed. I was inexpreſſibly moved. My ſoul was little leſs tempeſted; yet the ſplendour of my proſpects, my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious arrangements, my pledged honour, all urged me on; and, by one violent effort, I tore myſelf from the moſt beloved of women! Our mutual ſufferings may be regarded as a prediction of the fatal event. It was decreed that we never more ſhould meet! Propitious gales attended the firſt part of our voyage, and I had began to anticipate the rich harveſt that a few painful ſeaſons would enable me to lay at the feet of my heart's beſt treaſure.</p>
                        <p>We had already doubled the ſouthern extremity of the great continent of Africa, commonly called the Cape of Good Hope; and, ſhaping our courſe north-eaſt to the continent of India, we were proceeding with all diſpatch—when, lo! on a ſudden, the ſcowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing atmoſphere gathered darkneſs; dreadfully por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentous the winds of heaven aroſe. Waves beat on waves frightfully tempeſtuous. The tumultuous ocean ſeemed to laſh the contending ſkies. Louder and louder the deſtructive whirlwinds bellowed round.
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:034162_0290_0FFC647BAEF1FD78"/>
Hoarſe thunders roared terrific peals ſucceeding peals. The heavens poured forth a deluge of rain, and the forked lightnings were all abroad. Surrounded on every ſide by the tremendous world of waters, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was impoſſible—no aſylum preſented. The ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's art was in vain, and death, in its moſt ſhocking form, appeared inevitable. But to deſcribe the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of our ſituation is beyond the reach of language. In the latitude in which we then were, there is a large ridge of rocks, they are pointed out in moſt of our ſea charts; but if our pilot was aware of them, it was not in his power to avoid them; they accelerated that fate which, imagining the ſhip might live many hours, I had not ſo ſpeedily expected; and, bilging inſtantly upon one of thoſe rocks, a ſecond ſtroke ſevered her in twain! The ſhrieks of the mariners were ſhocking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expreſſion. How long they ſurvived, or what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts they made, I am not able to ſay; for, ſeizing a part of a ſhattered raft, upon which, floating at the mercy of the winds, and waves, while I momently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected diſſolution, I commended my ſpirit to that God whoſe protection and whoſe favour I had never ceaſed to invoke.</p>
                        <p>And how many of the children of men have been conſtrained to aſk, What circumſtances are beyond the reach of Omnipotence? <hi>He who holdeth in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of his hand, the great deep,</hi> ſuddenly huſhed the winds; and, driven upon a ſmall uninhabited iſland, my firſt ſenſations, it will not be doubted, ſpontaneouſly iſſued in the moſt grateful oriſons to the God of my life, who had thus graciouſly interpoſed for my preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ervation. But ſoon the image of my Margaretta, clothed in the habiliments of immeaſurable woe, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed up my ſoul; her forlorn and helpleſs ſituation—her unprotected infant!—My God! madneſs was in the thought. I was on the point of again plunging into that ocean from which I had ſo recently eſcaped; but the good hand of upholding Deity ſtill prevented me, and was ſtill my ſhield. Gradually the heavens reſumed a ſerene aſpect; my mind too became aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:034162_0291_0FFC647A2C028678"/>
calm; and, drying the only veſtments which now remained to me upon a ſun-beat rock, whoſe craggy ſides received the moſt intenſe rays of that luminary, beneath the foliage of a ſheltering tree I ſtretched my weary limbs. Sleep ſpread over me its downy mantle, and I obtained a temporary oblivion of thoſe lacerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reflections, with which ſucceeding hours, in dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful order, appalled my ſinking ſpirits.</p>
                        <p>Neceſſity compelled me to ſearch out the good, if any remained, which was yet within my graſp. At the ſalutary ſtream I ſlaked my thirſt; the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious berry, zeſted by hunger, afforded me a delicious repaſt, and by one ſoothing hope I was ſtill buoyed up: I traced unequivocal veſtiges of the human ſtep—ſhips, I was poſitive, had recently touched there—I might yet recognize my fellow man—I might yet be borne to my native iſle. Deſpair, however, too often gained the aſcendancy, and at ſuch intervals, inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible anguiſh overwhelmed my ſoul. But it is impoſſible to paint the unequalled calamities of his ſituation, who is thus circumſtanced. Even the glowing imagination of a Thomſon could only ſketch them. Yet, not a revolving hour but heard me, to the liſtening echo, repeat—

But forever bleſſed be the all-gracious Diſpoſer of events! the term of my ſufferings was cut ſhort. It was the employment of my firſt rational moment, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had been thrown upon the iſland, to make, with a part of my clothing, a ſignal of diſtreſs. Upon a prominent angle aſcended a ſmall acclivity, on the ſummit of which ſtood the tall trunk of a tree, that
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:034162_0292_0FFA6529311D45D0"/>
contending ſtorms had ſtripped of its branches. To this diſrobed trunk I contrived to faſten the beacon of my diſtreſs, and I conſecrated it, with many ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Him who was alone able to ſave.</p>
                        <p>The morning of the fifth day (after I had ſo providentially eſcaped the waves) broke divinely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene. An amazing continuity was outſtretched before me. With ſolded arms, and an aching heart, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated the extenſive main. The frightful ſolitude, the awful ſtillneſs to which I was condemned, aroſe dreadfully terrific to my ſoul. I threw abroad my anxiouſly inquiring gaze; a cloud ſeemed to gather at a diſtance—It is not a cloud—What can it be?—Swiftly it approaches—Great God! is it poſſible?—Saviour of ſinners! it is, indeed, the white ſails of a Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en directed bark!—It is bending toward me!—Ah! it recedes, and my bounding ſpirit dies within me!</p>
                        <p>Again, however, its altered courſe bore rapidly down upon my deſolate abode. The inſignia of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity reared not in vain its petitioning head. The neceſſary arrangements were made. The boat was manned. My heart leaped exulting; it was too big for its priſon. My tongue refuſed utterance, while, with that commiſerating cordiality, which ſeamen know ſo well to practiſe, and which is a characteriſtic trait of their order, I was received on board the ſhip. To complete my joy, the captain and crew were Engliſh. The captain was a humane and venerable man, who had numbered more than threeſcore years: A ſhower of tears relieved my burſting heart. I told my tale of woe, and he regarded me with even paternal goodneſs. Few know how to reſpect the unfortunate; ineſtimable are the ſoothings of benevolence to the children of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.</p>
                        <p>A tedious voyage was now to be performed: and although a proper ſenſe of the divine interpoſition in my favour, forbid every murmur, yet a recurrence to thoſe pangs which I well knew would lacerate the gentle boſom of her my ſoul held moſt dear, could not fail of pointing the keeneſt arrows of affliction! Ten long
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:034162_0293_0FFC6475AAADE358"/>
months (dating from the time of my departure) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their tedious round, ere the white cliffs of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bion again met my longing gaze. With what extacy did I leap upon the ſtrand. To the parent ſoil I low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent my head; with filial lips I kiſſed the kindred turf, and my bounding ſpirit, ſtruggling with its ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſenſations, poured forth the rapt oriſons of a ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecked, exiled, reſcued, and reſtored man! On the wings of ſpeed I haſted to my native village; to that village which I ſuppoſed contained my only treaſure. But what became of me, when, poſting to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Margaretta, I found them occupied by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers!—Yet, hope ſtill whiſpered ſhe had removed to ſome other abode; and I haſted to the dwelling of a friend, from whom I learned the ſum of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes!!</p>
                        <p>You are, my friends, acquainted with the feelings of the heart. Every feature in your expreſſive coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances are vouchers of your ſenſibility—Why ſhould I aim at delineation!</p>

                           <l>The fainting ſpirit feels a pang of thought,</l>
                           <l>Which, never painted in the hues of ſpeech,</l>
                           <l>Lives at the ſoul, and mocks expreſſion's reach.</l>
                        </lg>
                        <p>I drop the curtain over a train of ſucceeding ills; ſickneſs, loſs of reaſon, comfortleſs calamities!</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Arbuthnot, when ſhe accompanied her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to Ireland, bore my child with her. My aged, widowed mother, gently remonſtrated. My ſuppoſed death, and the demiſe of Margaretta, had centered her every remaining wiſh in the little prattler. Mrs. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buthnot plead the dying injunctions and bequeſt of her ſiſter. This was deciſive. The regulations ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by the everlaſtingly abſent ſhould be deemed inviolably ſacred, and my mother with floods of una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing tears ſubmitted. A few painful weeks devoted to heartfelt regret, had ſucceeded a ſeparation judged unavoidable, when my unfortunate mother received a line from Mrs. Arbuthnot, acquainting her that the little Margaretta was no more. This proved a finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:034162_0294_0FFC6473F1A12788"/>
ſtroke. So many calamities, in ſuch ſwift ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, treading upon the heels of each other, brought down the grey hairs of my aged parent with ſorrow to the grave. Could ſhe have been ſpared to have witneſſed the returning footſteps of the ſon of her youth, a gleam of joy would have diffuſed its genial and ſolac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence over her parting ſpirit. But Heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed otherwiſe, and ſhe cloſed a life, the ſorrows of which had accumulated with every added moment! What could induce Mrs. Arbuthnot to pen a miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, calculated to pierce with ſo keen a ſhaft the boſom of an aged and ſorrow worn ſufferer, I can only conjecture. Probably ſhe might be influenced by her plan of paſſing the child for her own; or, ſhe might imagine that my mother, being inveſted with the rights of a parent, would again demand the child, ſhould the contingencies, peculiar to a ſoldier's life, remove Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Arbuthnot (whom it was well known ſhe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to follow) to a remote or foreign deſtination; and it may be preſumed that ſhe made up the matter in her own mind, by a conſideration that if ſhe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her niece to our village, the extreme age of my mother, would ſoon leave her deſtitute of every nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural guide.</p>
                        <p>For me, after a long and debilitating fever, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a ſtate of convaleſcence,—youth, and a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution uncommonly good, ſoon completed my reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſame intereſt which had before placed me on board an Eaſt-India ſhip, procured me a ſecond em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. I made ſeveral ſucceſsful voyages. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated riches; and at length ſaw myſelf poſſeſſed of affluence. But alas! tranquillity was not in the gift of affluence. In the variety by which I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded my heart took no intereſt; and it refuſed to acknowledge a ſecond attachment. Yet I determined to regulate my feelings by the dictates of fortitude, and to bend my wayward ſpirit to a ſtate of acquieſcence in the deſignation of that God who ruleth in the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens. I became a citizen of the world; and, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf born for the univerſal family, and for the
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:034162_0295_0FFC647088246960"/>
emolument of my fellow men, I induſtriouſly made the moſt of every acquiſition. Under the influence of this ſentiment I proceeded in the career of life; and if my path produced not thoſe high ſcented perfumes, of which the exquiſite ſucceſſion of domeſtic enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is ſuſceptible, I was, notwithſtanding, ſo far favoured, as to obtain a degree of compoſure. Thus rolled on ſucceeding years, until upon an uncommon fine night, three months ſince, feeling no diſpoſition to retire to my chamber, I felt conſtrained to devote an hour to a contemplative walk, and after having ſtrolled ſome moments upon the road-ſide, I bent my ſteps toward St. George's fields, where, experiencing an unuſual kind of perturbation, with folded arms, and raiſed eyes, I continued my deſultory aberration.</p>
                        <p>Methought the ſhade of my Margaretta accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied my ſteps: The ample heavens, the ſtarry lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, the full orb'd moon, the blue expanſe; theſe all combined to image the beauteous form of her, on whom fond remembrance ſtill regretting dwelt.</p>
                        <p>An aſſociation of ideas gave birth to a wiſh, to paſs ſome moments beſide a ſketch of thoſe waters, on which, bidding an eternal adieu to the injured ſufferer, I had heretofore cruelly embarked; and toward Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter bridge I rapidly took my way, which having reached, with an expedition for which I could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I deſcended the ſteps of the landing place; but no ſooner had I put my foot upon the third ſtair than an unuſual daſh of the waters of the Thames, for which the ſtillneſs of the night rendered it impoſſible to aſſign a reaſon, ſtill further accelerated my move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I haſted forward, and was only in time to ſeize by his garments, an unfortunate man, who had plunged into the ſtream, with the unwarrantable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of putting a period to his exiſtence. I remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated againſt the atrocious audacity of the deed that he had well near perpetrated, in terms expreſſive of the horror which it inſpired. For a time he preſerved an indignant kind of ſilence; and when he deigned to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf, he breathed only expreſſions of reſentment,
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:034162_0296_0FFC646F04BA0D70"/>
for what he termed my officious interpoſition. It was manifeſt that his reaſon was diſordered, and pity grew in my ſoul. I addreſſed him in the language of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration, and he gradually became ſoftened and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative.</p>
                        <p>"Generous ſtranger," he exclaimed, "I give thee no mark of confidence in the brief recital, which as an apology for my ſuppoſed raſhneſs, your apparent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration demands. To him, who is reſolved on death, the diſcloſure of ſecrets which effect only himſelf, can be of little importance. Know then, that, born to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, I was bred a gentleman. Know alſo, that, purſuing my pleaſures in a neighbouring kingdom, I ſaw and <hi>loved</hi> a beauteous woman. I <hi>wooed</hi> and <hi>won</hi> her. Her parents were no more; but her brethren, her ſiſters, a numerous family, her fortune, her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, her religion—all theſe ſhe forſook, and fled with me to our Albion coaſt. Indiſcretion and misfortunes have robbed me of every penny which I poſſeſſed. I have no means of obtaining the common neceſſaries of life; the few articles of which I have not yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, will not diſcharge the debts already contracted. Thoſe flatterers, who baſked in the ſunſhine of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, have now utterly forſaken me. My wife, my beloved wife, and her helpleſs children, are reduced to the laſt extremity. I have left no means unaſſayed, by which I could preſume upon relief; but every effort hath proved ineffectual, and I have now quitted my Almira, with an expreſſed hope, for which, alas! there is no foundation. She will expect me with the return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſun; but ſhe will no more behold me. I can no longer exiſt a witneſs of thoſe ills, of which I have been the wretched cauſe!" Need I add, that I was eager to ſpeak, to this ſon of ſorrow, the words of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Conſidering myſelf as the banker of the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, his draught upon me was indiſputable; and the rays of night's fair empreſs, lent a light ſufficiently ſtrong, to evince the authenticity of its characters.</p>
                        <p>I accompanied my new claimant, now incredulous, and now frantic with joy to his dwelling. I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:034162_0297_0FFC646C828DD6D0"/>
to keep guard the remainder of the night. We entered ſoftly. His little family had retired to reſt. I inſiſted that he ſhould inſtantly ſpeak peace to his beloved. I inſiſted that he ſhould not reviſit the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, until the riſing ſun ſhould enable me to commence my propoſed arrangements. I will repoſe, ſaid I, in this eaſy chair; or here are books, with which I may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe myſelf. Awed by that tone of authority which I had aſſumed, with looks of aſtoniſhment, and the moſt profound obeiſance, he left me; and ſleep being beyond my reach, I endeavoured to obtain ſufficient compoſure to amuſe myſelf by reading. I turned over the books—it would not do. A new and painful kind of agitation hurried my ſpirits; at length a parcel of Magazines ſeized my attention. I glanced confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly upon the bundle. The Maſſachuſetts Magazine caught my eye—<hi>an American production</hi>—curioſity was enliſted; I opened one and another; an irreſiſtible impulſe ſtill urged me on; the firſt page of the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azine for March, 1792, arreſted my ey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The appellation <hi>Margaretta</hi> vibrated intereſtingly upon my ear; it was the ſweet taliſman of a thouſand mingling ſenſations; no power on earth could have prevented my reading on. I accompanied you in your journey to South-Carolina, and I entered with you the city of Charleſton. The little Margaretta's tap at the door poſſeſſed a faſcinating power—the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of the lovely cherub penetrated my very ſoul; I waited impatiently for the iſſue; I attended at the bed of death—but, great and good God! what were my ſenſations when I heard from the lips of Mrs. Arbuthnot, the well known ſtory of my Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta's ſufferings—when I learned that the dear pledge of our ſacred loves was yet alive! when I recognized her in the perſon of the little petitioner—when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came aſſured that ſhe had been received by ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors!

During the connexion with Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the moſt tumultuous agitations tempeſted my boſom; but the cataſtrophe, I conceived, gave her honoured guardians a title to almoſt divine honours. Again I became a prey to all thoſe agonizing fears which can lacerate a father's heart. Even of Miſs Clifford, I muſt confeſs, that I was not a little ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. My feelings againſt thee, my ſon, were replete with indignation; and I beſtowed upon thy ſuppoſed inconſtancy a parent's malediction. But November preſented the extatic eclairciſſement. I ſaw that nothing was wanting, but what I poſſeſſed abundant ability to ſupply; and, in broken and almoſt frantic ejaculations, I ſobbed out my gratitude. The dawn at length broke. Memorable, ever memorable night! Never, never can I be forgetful of the events which thou produced!</p>
                        <p>An early hour preſented the now not deſpairing Altamont. He led his Almira by the hand. I had cautioned him not to ſhock the delicacy of her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by a recital of the extremity to which he had been precipitated; and he had been diſcreet enough to follow my advice. He had ſimply informed her that Heaven had ſent him a friend, and this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had proved ſufficient to excite the moſt lively emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Altamont began a ſpeech expreſſive of his gratitude; but I cut him ſhort, by deciſively pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, that fate had ordained me eternally his debtor. My diſordered countenance, and the energy of my manner, alarmed him; and he in his turn became doubtful of <hi>my</hi> reaſon. I gave him, however, a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple relation of facts. I held up the divine pages. Had I not met thee; had I not conſented to deliver to thee that dividend of our common Father's intereſt, with
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:034162_0299_0FFC68F29C822FF0"/>
which he has entruſted me for thy behoof, I had not met theſe bleſſed records; I had not received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which hath communicated to my ſoul immeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urable felicity. <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>Grateful tears of rapture, it will not be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we mingled. Every thing was ſpeedily adjuſted to the complete ſatisfaction of Altamont and his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira. With the firſt ſhip, I embarked for America. The name of Colonel Worthington, of New-Haven, was my clue; and I bore with me the heaven inſpired Magazines. From Colonel Worthington I learned every neceſſary particular. I was told, my ſon, of your intended voyage, of the conſequent anguiſh of my daughter's ſoul. I bleſs God that I am in time to prevent its proſecution. Every individual ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his dues; that good young man, your <hi>forbearing friend,</hi> the benevolent Seymour—every one ſhall be happy!</p>

                     <p>Unwilling to leave the curioſity of the reader un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratified, during the tardy revolution of another month, I have felt myſelf neceſſitated to curtail the narrative of Mr. Melworth. Many uſeful obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are omitted. The frequent interruption, breaks, and pauſes, occaſioned by the ſuſceptibility of Mrs. Hamilton, and the agitation of her father; the unbounded and venerating gratitude of Edward; and the combining admiration, and rapt felicity of our whole party; all this was in courſe, and to every thing of this ſort, I muſt repeat, that the ſilently expreſſive touches of that vivid pencil, which is found in the glowing hand of fancy, can alone do juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Already our young people have reſumed their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant family ſeat. Miſs Clifford is ſtill the companion of Margaretta. Amelia Worthington is now a congrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulating viſitor at Hamilton-Place.

                     <p>THE multifarious ligaments which bind fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies together, being the handy-work of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and eſſentially or cloſely interwoven with our exiſtence, that ſhock muſt be indeed violent, that can burſt them aſunder. It is true that a long continued ſeries of diſobligation may obſcure the vivid glow of thoſe images, which nature and habit have impreſſed upon the intellect. Unkindneſs is the opaque body, which intercepts the ſunny beams of luminous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born tenderneſs; but the eclipſe is ſeldom total, and the cheering influence of affection is frequently invig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orated, and often becomes the more tranſcendent, for the momentary obſtruction, by which it ſeemed well near enveloped.</p>
                     <p>Surely that heart muſt be ſtrangely deficient, which the pleaſing ſenſations that are attendant upon the firſt ſtage of being, hath not indelibly impreſſed; and, that mind is unwarrantably implacable, which, intrenched by inexorable inflexibility, is incapable of being rouſed to the tenderneſs of recollection; which is not ſoftened by the remonſtrances of nature, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with arguments, drawn from a ſeries of endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſubſtantially beneficial proofs, of a generous attachment. Yet I know there are a variety of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtibles, which although perhaps not radically natives of the human ſoil, having, however, obtained a growth therein, and once taking fire, it is difficult to ſay where the conflagration may end. I am aware there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries which pride and ſelf eſtimation, conſider as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable. It is a melancholy truth there are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate hearts; and, it may be, that the ſtrong winds
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:034162_0301_0FFC68EFDA8F3D78"/>
of paſſion may obliterate, or uproot from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom every proper ſenſation of the ſoul. But grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the empoiſoned plant may become rampant in the rancorous breaſt, the Gleaner, while engaged in the routine of his profeſſion, hath at no moment bound himſelf to ſelect the noxious weed; he confeſſes he is fond of culling the flowers of humanity, and that, with theſe, as often as may be, he is ſolicitous to furniſh and adorn his page.</p>
                     <p>To the well regulated mind, the contemplation of family harmony is inexpreſſibly pleaſing. The phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropic ſpeculator views the little ſociety unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attached, bound together by the ſtrong cords of mutual affection, and riſing ſuperior to the adverſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of ſeparate or ſelfiſh claims, as a miniature of that vaſt family of man, which futurity ſhall ſee col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected under the protecting auſpices of a benign and paternal God. Order, unbroken confidence, celeſtial tenderneſs, energetic love—in this auguſt aſſembly, theſe ſhall all triumphantly officiate. Peaceful an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſhall hover round; diſcord ſhall find no entrance there; offences ſhall be no more; but truth, ſky ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed innocence, unimpeached integrity, unblemiſhed virtue, and undeviating holineſs, ſhall be eſtabliſhed, <hi>from everlaſting to everlaſting, and of their dominion there ſhall be no end.</hi> Yes, it is pleaſing to trace the ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſemblance which is exemplified in the animated ſketch. Mild, affectionate and <hi>judiciouſly</hi> indulgent parents; duteous and confiding ſons and daughters; mutually complacent, and unequivocally attached brothers and ſiſters. The royal bard of Iſrael, ſtriking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, feelingly, and poetically delineates the family of love: "<hi>Behold how good, and how pleaſant it is for breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren to dwell together in unity.</hi>" Well might the ſacred poet ſummon the aid of a ſplendid fancy, and arreſt the moſt expreſſive figures to image the fine effects and pleaſing utility of domeſtic complacency; the rich perfumes which conſecrated the anointed prieſt of the Hebrew tribes, the fertilizing dew deſcending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Hermon's verdant ſummit, and reſting with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:034162_0302_0FFC68EBB1FD93B0"/>
influence upon the adjacent eminence; theſe but ſhadow forth the ſublimity of that union, upon which our God hath commanded a bleſſing, which originates a dignified and bliſsful immortality.</p>
                     <p>Yes, it is pleaſing to trace the ſtriking reſemblance which is exemplified in the animated ſketch. The contemplation of domeſtic harmony ſoothes and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the mind, and although it is undeniably true, that the philoſopher will extend his regards from the little group which conſtitutes his <hi>relative circle, to friends, to country, to the univerſe at large, until he commences a citizen of the domain of heaven;</hi> yet he will not refuſe to acknowledge thoſe ardors, thoſe hopes, and thoſe fears, which upon his opening mind, in the white winged hours that marked his dawn of being, were, by the ſtrong hand of nature, irreverſibly engraved.</p>
                     <p>Affection is very properly ſaid to deſcend; and it is generally true, that while we venerate with pious duty the authors of our being, while our hearts are warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them by love and reverence, we are in the ſame moment impelled to acknowledge for our offspring, augmented and more energetic tenderneſs. Nature, it is ſaid, hath implanted theſe ſuperior and irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſations, for the purpoſe of nerving our efforts for the preſervation and advancement of the infant candidate; but, be this as it may, in whatever wiſe regulations it hath originated, the fact is indubitable. Family ties of every deſcription are variouſly reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and variouſly eſtimable, in their various depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: I have been lately led to an appreciation of their comparative value by a diſquiſition on which I was a ſilent attendant, that aimed at deciding what relative character deſerved the preference. The inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation was rather curious than important; but it ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, however, to amuſe, during a vacant hour, which might have been worſe appropriated.</p>
                     <p>The attachment of a well informed and tender fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to an amiable and grateful daughter, has been ſaid to reſemble that which is experienced by a guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian angel, to the being who is committed to his charge
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:034162_0303_0FFC68EA1AAB4D10"/>
—tender, delicate, and diveſted of all that can debaſe, the paternal eye regards with immeaſurable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, his beauteous, his dependent child; and the fineſt feelings of his ſoul become embodied. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect her from every ill he is ſedulouſly attentive; his judicious cautions hover round her inexperienced ſteps; his protecting arm would preſent the invulnerable ſhield; and his auſpices are thoſe of wiſdom. Ever vigilant, ever upon his guard, to ſave her, even from the imputation of diſhonour, he would conſider his life as a comparatively trivial ſacrifice. It is true that he is impaſſioned, but his ardours are thoſe of virtue; his affections are pure, innocent, laudable, elevated, and refined; and, originating in nature, orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inating in God, they will be perfected in heaven. All this is irrefragably juſt, and yet I take leave to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the <hi>fraternal</hi> department, when filled by a good and virtuous mind, more exactly anſwers the ideas which I have indulged, of that attendant cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ub, ordained to tread with holy vigils, the deſtined path of the expecting voyager. In contemplating the character of a father, however beneficial its offices, we can hardly forbear recollecting, that, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the being which is cheriſhed, the conſequent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment may be the reſult of that <hi>ſelfiſh principle</hi> which ſo univerſally, more or leſs, actuates the human mind; and, it is undeniably true, that the operation of a <hi>ſelfiſh principle</hi> eſſentially diminiſhes the luſtre of the moſt beneficial and exemplary action.</p>
                     <p>A brother, it hath been divinely obſerved, is born for adverſity; a gentle and confiding female can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boaſt a more agreeable or <hi>diſintereſted</hi> relation; the general arrangements of nature authorizes a hope, that his protection will continue coeval with her mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal career, and if he fulfils the duties of the fraternal name, he will ſtill continue a natural, patronizing, and conſolatory reſource. What eye is not charmed by a view of the marked and delicate attention, which is paid by an elegant young man to the gentle and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed maiden, who is the daughter of his father
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:034162_0304_0FFC68E88559CBF8"/>
and of his mother. Grant that opportunities of this kind are extremely rare, the ſenſations derived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from are, nevertheleſs, in a ſuperior degree, pleaſing. The attachment of a brother to a ſiſter, if it is genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and ſincere, if it correſponds with the deſignation of unadulterated and upright nature, partakes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite delicacies and refinements of love, devoid of its tumultuous caprices, or intereſted and ungovernable fervors; with ineffable ſatisfaction it yields that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, to which nature and education combine to give the ſex a claim. It is not ſtinted in its regards; it is tender, elevated and refined; it is generous and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable; it is ſympathetic and permanent. A true brother unites the duties of the <hi>paternal,</hi> with the more equal, ſweet, and ſocial pleaſures of the <hi>fraternal</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe; the heart of a brother heſitates not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the bland, endearing, and indiſſoluble ties of amity. A true brother is at all times a guardian friend; he rejoiceth in his fraternity; and, I repeat, that his attachment may claim kindred with thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, which are ſuppoſed to actuate the tenderly watchful ſeraph, who, commiſſioned by the high court of Heaven, enters with the firſt moment of our exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon his truſt, and fulfils his celeſtial miſſion, by attending through every ſtage of life his progreſſing charge.</p>
                     <p>Richardſon exhibits the character, proper to a Broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in the moſt vivid and glowing hues; but if his Grandiſon originated not in fiction, the portrait doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs owes many embelliſhments to the incomparable pen of that inimitable writer. It is a melancholy fact, that eminent virtue, of whatever deſcription, is a gem that the hand of nature, however indulgent, hath too ſeldom produced. Yet, for the honour of humanity, I cannot deny myſelf the gratification of affirming that I, at this moment, contemplate <hi>more than one brother</hi> who hath uniformly ſupported that endearing character. Who, as far as circumſtances have called them forth, have amply proved their title to rank in the <hi>ſame grade with Richardſon's finely imagined delineation.</hi>

Much do I regret that I am not authorized to name thoſe fair examples, which, through a courſe of years, I have been accuſtomed to admire. But the emblaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning voice of fame might poſſibly tinge their cheeks with the hue of diſapprobation; for it is certainly true, that genuine merit "<hi>Does good by ſtealth, and bluſhing finds it fame.</hi>" Yet, if, while ſketching the outlines of characters ſo replete with excellence, their celebrity ſhould induce the finger of perception to point out the living portraits, the Gleaner preſumes he ought not to be made reſponſible for conſequences which, by the foreign traits wherewith he hath ſtudiouſly diverſified his deſcriptions, he hath been ſolicitous to avoid. It is indubitably an exalted and ſublime kind of pleaſure which we derive from a view of tranſcendent worth; and that writer ſhould at leaſt be conſidered as venial, who, fond of contributing to enjoyments reſulting from an unexceptionable ſource, is careful to collect inſtances which adorn and elevate his ſpecies. A laudable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is juſtly admitted as an advocate for the propriety of an action. If it iſſues pure from the fountain of rectitude, we are not, I have conceived, to be regarded as reſponſible, for the adventitious mixtures which it may connect, as it winds its courſe through the murky grounds of opinion, malevolence, miſconception or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. But, be this as it may, the reflections to which this eſſay owes its being, have originated in a view of <hi>real life;</hi> and the probability is, that if virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, informed and judicious parents were multiplied among us, family attachment would be continued, and individuals, branching out in their ſeveral directions, would ſtill, however, reverting to their ancient ſtock, continue encircled by the bonds of amity. <hi>Character</hi> may ſome time preſerve its aſcendency over <hi>education;</hi> but education will, nevertheleſs, remain a powerful agent in the formation both of the heart and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and obſervation convinces us, if the <hi>principals</hi> exhibit the <hi>pattern,</hi> the family will generally be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with the <hi>virtues,</hi> the <hi>graces,</hi> and the <hi>elegance of humanity.</hi>

                        <hi>Happy in my connexions—I have known many charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> highly worthy of imitation. I have known fathers dignified by the integrity of their hearts, the clearneſs of their underſtandings, and the humane and indulgent liberality of their ſentiments.

Poſſeſſing minds capacious and extenſively cultivated, truth ſeems to receive from their lips additional ornament; they expreſs themſelves with elegance, preciſion, and fluency—their language is the language of propriety, and they add a grace to every ſentiment which they utter: the ſincerity and candour of their diſpoſitions are equalled only by the frankneſs which is conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the manners, and gentleman-like deportment of their reſpectable coadjutors in the voyage of life, and all their plans for the regulation of thoſe who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to their care, are marked by wiſdom and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity.</p>
                     <p>From ſuch parents we expect a reſult happy for the individuals immediately under their tuition, and auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to ſociety at large. They will early endeavour to endow the minds of thoſe ſons and daughters, whom they rear to maturity, with the fortitude ſo neceſſary in the voyage of life; they will faſhion in the opening mind a diſpoſition which will teach accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the unavoidable evils conſequent upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; they will cultivate that ſpirit of patient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation which is ſo proper for the dependent being, whoſe part it is to ſubmit without a murmur to the ſtrokes of Providence, and when called upon to reſign into the hands of their Creator God, any of theſe little individuals, who are rendered by nature and habit incalculably dear, an opportunity being thus fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to enforce their <hi>precepts</hi> by <hi>example,</hi> no impious expreſſions will eſcape their lips; the ſighs which they will ſwell, will be the ſighs of ſubmiſſion; with holy acquieſcence they will bend to the decrees of Heaven;

in no inſtance violating the conſiſtency of their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters, they will ſupport with uniform propriety, the Chriſtian name, and they will poſſeſs that applauſe which ſhould invariably attend the benevolent and the good.

                     <p>It was from ſuch a ſtock that the venerable and truly reſpectable Hortenſius deſcended; and, having marked with uncommon ſatisfaction the ſerene pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures which gild the evening of his days, we wave the privilege of a noveliſt, whoſe character places in his gift a choice of heroes, and hazard the mentioning a character, the original of which, having continued through revolving years the boaſt of fraternal records, may perhaps immediately occur to the reader, who is at all converſant in the liſt of thoſe worthies, that in our Columbian world have given ſplendor to the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent day.</p>
                     <p>Hortenſius was bred to buſineſs, and his probity through all the complicated ſcenes in which he hath been engaged hath remained unimpeached. Frugali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and induſtry are conſiderable traits in his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; his efforts are crowned with ſucceſs, and he is in poſſeſſion of affluence. A ſevere diſappointment in early life, relative to the maiden of his election, ſteel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his heart againſt every ſubſequent approach of the tender paſſion, and ambitious of the title, <hi>Citizen of the World,</hi> he devoted himſelf to a ſeries of beneficent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, conſulting in every movement the felicity of the family of man.</p>
                     <p>Hortenſius was exemplary as a ſon, and it was one of his principal enjoyments, "<hi>to rock the cradle of declining

age;</hi>" his parents continued in life to extreme old age, and after gently ſloping for them their paſſage out of time, he laid them decently in the earth, bedewing their exit with a manly and a filial tear. In the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, where he was uſhered into being, he hath ſuſtained through ſucceeding years, and with unblem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed reputation, the office of an upright and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant magiſtrate, and he is beloved and reſpected as univerſally as he is known. Hortenſius is learned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and cheerful, and his liberality is only circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by his abilities. But if you would give the finiſhing touches to the character of Hortenſius, you muſt borrow the pen of his ſiſter.</p>
                     <p>This amiable woman, although accuſtomed to his benignity, can hardly mention him, eſpecially if you advert to his benevolence, without tears. To the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous family, of which he is the head, he at once diſcharges the duties of a parent, and a brother; but, by her, he is conſidered as meriting epithets more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, more reſpectful, and more expreſſive than language hath yet faſhioned; and her tongue untired, delights to expatiate upon his many virtues. She was in the bloom of life widowed of her deareſt hopes, and the hour which marked the exit of him, with whom ſhe had exchanged her youthful vows, who had been the deliberate choice both of affection and of judgment, and to whom ſhe was devoted by every motive which can endear a boſom friend, that fatal hour yielded her a monument of woe! while the virtues of her loſt companion, ſeemed amply to juſtify thoſe demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of heart-felt anguiſh, which, notwithſtanding the length of years that have ſince elapſed, ſhe ſtill occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally indulges. A number of infant ſons and daughters, incapable of eſtimating the amount of their deprivation, while they augmented her grief, armed her with reſolution to attempt encountering the ills of life.

                     <p>But Hortenſius ſaw, he pitied, and he flew to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue. A commodious and elegant habitation was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; his ſiſter and her little family were put into immediate poſſeſſion thereof; and, taking apartments for himſelf under the ſame roof, he became her ſolace, her companion, and her protector; and he was, at once, the guardian, the ſupport, and the preceptor of her children. Their education has been the moſt lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral which our country can afford; her eldeſt ſon is now a barriſter of diſtinguiſhed eminence; her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are apportioned and married into the genteeleſt families, and they are conſidered as ornaments of their ſex; while the glad emotions of their grateful hearts unreſervedly hail the good Hortenſius as their father and their friend; and they equitably acknowledge higher obligations to him, than they could have owed to the author of their beings, whoſe indiſpenſable duty it would have been, to have reared and cheriſhed them.</p>
                     <p>A view of Hortenſius, placed in the midſt of the charming group, is gratifying to the beſt feelings of the heart; he experiences the rapture of a parent, while the children of his affectionate bounty, attached by affinity, gratitude, love, and veneration, behold him as a guardian ſeraph, clothed in the habiliments of humanity, by that watchful Providence, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him their benefactor, their guide, and their truly munificent reſource! Doubtleſs, the firſt of bleſſings will be found in his train. Nay, he is already in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that "<hi>ſweet peace of mind, which goodneſs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms ever.</hi>"</p>

                     <p>NO—Atheiſm will never do. The prime procurer and miniſter of the French arrangements, at length accedes to this axiom; and Gallia, having guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotined her ſovereign, and blaſphemouſly ſought to dethrone and annihilate the Monarch of Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, in her preſent reſolutions, ſolicitous to re-eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the Deity in her ſyſtems, to inveſt the Supreme with thoſe divine honours, which the language of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture haſteth to beſtow, which the dictates of reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably award.</p>
                     <p>Oppoſed, from principle, to thoſe ſanguinary decrees, which, pronouncing the death-warrant of whole heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombs of my ſpecies, fail not to let looſe the dogs of war, I will confeſs, that I have not felt for the name of Robeſpierre any of thoſe cordialities which conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the aggregate of amity. The anarchy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent enormities, prevalent in France, together with thoſe licentious principles, which have apparently been ſo generally embraced, I have conſidered as replete with incalculable evils, as the baleful precurſors of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ill which can afflict humanity! Such my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I expected not from the report of Robeſpierre, thoſe ſtrong and glowing ſenſations, which, whenever I attend to the voice of truth, moſt delightfully expand my ſoul—But I have read—and, charmed with the prevalent contour of the compoſition, the energy and beauty of the diction, and the demonſtrative propriety
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:034162_0311_0FFC68D4279C0B90"/>
and ſublimity of the obſervations—while I do homage to the tranſlator, I cannot but join my ſuffrage to thoſe applauſes, by which America has marked the <hi>new-born</hi> piety of the French politician.</p>
                     <p>It is true that, as being a member of the proteſtant community, I am neceſſitated, by my creed, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all ſupplications made to ſaints, whatever eclat may have attended their canonization. I may not feel at liberty to cry out, "Oh! <hi>Sancta Robeſpierre, ora pro nobis;</hi>" yet if he, <hi>in reality,</hi> ſhall at length purſue the <hi>mild dictates</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> every ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my ſoul will combine to wiſh him God ſpeed. An admirer of the report in the groſs, I yet conceive that the following extracts can hardly be too often repeated, can ſcarcely be too ſtrongly inculcated, or too deeply engraven upon the tablets of reflection. "What was the wiſh of thoſe, who, in the boſom of the conſpiracies with which we were ſurrounded, in the midſt of the embarraſſments of ſuch a war, at the moment while the torch of civil diſcord was ſtill ſmok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuddenly attacked all kinds of worſhip by violence, to eſtabliſh themſelves as the furious apoſtles of anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation, and as the fanatic miſſionaries of atheiſm? Attend only to the happineſs of your country and the intereſts of humanity; <hi>cheriſh all opinions and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which conſole and elevate the mind;</hi> reject thoſe which tend to degrade and corrupt them; <hi>revive</hi> and exalt all thoſe generous ſentiments and thoſe great moral ideas which they have wiſhed to extinguiſh; <hi>reconcile by the charms of friendſhip, and the bonds of virtue, thoſe citizens whom they have wiſhed to divide. Who has given thee the miſſion of announcing to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the Deity does not exiſt?</hi> To you who are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to this barren doctrine, and who are not ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in the cauſe of your country, <hi>what advantage do you derive</hi> from <hi>perſuading man that a blind force preſides in his deſtiny, and ſtrikes by chance his virtues or his vices; and that his ſoul is only a tranſient breath which is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed at the tomb? Will the idea of his annihilation inſpire him with more pure or more elevated ſentiments than that
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:034162_0312_0FFC68D0624A6588"/>
of his immortality?</hi> Will it inſpire him with more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for his fellow men, or for himſelf; more attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his country; more firmneſs in braving tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; more <hi>contempt for death</hi> or pleaſure? <hi>You who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret a virtuous friend, do you not delight to reflect that the moſt valuable part of him has eſcaped deceaſe?</hi> You who weep over the corpſe of a ſon or a wife, <hi>are you conſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him who tells you that nothing more of them remains than a vile heap of duſt?</hi> Unfortunate men, who expire under the ſtroke of an aſſaſſin! your laſt ſigh is an appeal to eternal juſtice! Innocence, on the ſcaffold, makes the tyrant turn pale in his triumphal car: Would it have this aſcendency if the tomb put upon a level the oppreſſor and the oppreſſed? Miſerable ſophiſt! from whence do you derive this right of rending from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence the ſceptre of reaſon, and of placing it again in the hands of vice; <hi>to throw a melancholy veil over na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to drive misfortune to deſpair;</hi> to encourage vice, to afflict virtue, to degrade humanity? <hi>The more a man is endowed with ſenſibility and genius, the more is he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to thoſe ideas which aggrandize his being, and which elevate his mind; and the doctrine of men of this character ſhould become that of the univerſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Ah! how can thoſe ideas differ from truth? At leaſt I cannot conceive how nature could have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to man any <hi>fictions</hi> more uſeful than theſe <hi>real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities;</hi> and if the exiſtence of a God, if the immortality of the ſoul, were only dreams, they would ſtill remain the moſt ſplendid of all the conceptions of the human mind.</p>
                        <p>The idea of the Supreme Being, and the immortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the ſoul, is a continual invitation to juſtice: It is then ſocial and republican. He who can replace the Deity in the ſyſtem of ſocial life, is, in my opinion, a prodigy of genius; and he, who without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed him, only endeavours to baniſh him from the mind of man, appears to me a prodigy of ſtupidity or perverſity. If the principles I have hitherto develop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are errors, I am deceived in what the world unite to revere. Obſerve with what art Ceſar, pleading in
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:034162_0313_0FFC68CE24513DC0"/>
the Roman ſenate in favour of the accomplices of Cataline, loſt himſelf in digreſſion againſt the doctrine of the immortality of the ſoul; ſo well calculated did theſe ideas appear to him, to diſtinguiſh in the hearts of the judges the energy of virtue; ſo cloſely did the cauſe of vice appear to him, connected with that of Atheiſm. Cicero, on the contrary invoked againſt the traitors both the ſword of the law and the thunder of the gods. Socrates, when dying, converſed with his friends on the immortality of the ſoul. Leonidas, at Thermopyles, ſupping with his companions in arms, at the moment of executing the moſt heroic deſign that human virtue ever conceived, invited them for the next day to another banquet in a new life.</p>
                        <p>A great man, a real hero, eſteems himſelf too much to be pleaſed with the idea of his annihilation. A vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, contemptible in his own eyes, and horrible in thoſe of other men, perceives that nature cannot afford him a more ſplendid boon than that of his annihilation. Religion collects mankind together, and by collecting them together you will render them better; for when men are thus aſſembled, they endeavour to pleaſe each other, which can only be effected by thoſe things that render them eſtimable. Give to their reunion a great moral and political motive, and the love of virtuous things will, with pleaſure, enter their hearts; for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind do not ſee each other without pleaſure.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>I had but recently peruſed the whole of this very excellent moral report, when one of the beſt informed, and moſt ſentimental of my friends, put into my hands a piece ſelected from the London Morning Chronicle of November 29, 1793.</p>
                     <p>To the matured judgment of this friend I am in the habit of paying high deference; and he conceived, that whether we regarded the little narration as a fact, or an ingenious reproof of the conduct of the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant party in France, it contained a ſufficient quantum of good ſenſe to merit preſervation. It is a proper ſupplement for the celebrated report of Robeſpierre, and in my office of caterer for my readers, perhaps I
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:034162_0314_0FFC68CBB4A631F8"/>
could not do better than to offer it to their acceptance. I ſubjoin it, therefore, with an added with, that it may contribute as largely to their pleaſures, as it did to the ſatisfaction of the Gleaner.</p>
                     <p>"A few days after the biſhop of Paris and his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars had ſet the example of renouncing their clerical character, a curi from a village on the banks of the Rhone, followed by ſome of his pariſhioners, with an offering of gold, ſilver, ſaints' chalices, rich veſtments, &amp;c. preſented himſelf at the bar of the houſe. The ſight of the gold put the Convention in very good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and the curi, a thin venerable looking man, with grey hair, was ordered to ſpeak. I came, ſaid he, from the village of—, where the only good building ſtanding (for the chatteau has been pulled down) is a very fine church; my pariſhioners beg you will take it to make a hoſpital for the ſick and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of both parties, they being equally our countrymen; the gold and ſilver, part of which we have brought you, they entreat you will devote to the ſervice of the State; and that you will caſt the bells into cannon, to drive away its foreign invaders. For myſelf I am come with great pleaſure to reſign my letters of ordination, of induction, and every deed of title, by which I have been conſtituted a member of your eccleſiaſtical polity. I am ſtill able to ſupport myſelf with the labour of my hands, and I beg you to believe that I never felt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer joy than I now do in making this renunciation—I have longed to ſee this day; I ſee it, and am glad."</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>When the old man had done ſpeaking, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes were immoderate. You are an honeſt man, ſaid they all at once; a brave fellow, you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God; and the Preſident advanced to give him the fraternal embrace. The curi did not ſeem greatly elated with theſe tokens of approbation; he retired back a few ſteps, and thus reſumed his diſcourſe:</p>
                        <p>Before you applaud my ſentiments, it is fit you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them; perhaps they may not entirely coincide with your own. I rejoice in this day, not becauſe I wiſh to ſee religion degraded, but becauſe I wiſh to ſee
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:034162_0315_0FFC68C9F6D75E20"/>
it exalted and purified. By diſſolving its alliance with the State, you give it dignity and independence; you have done it a piece of ſervice which its well-wiſhers would never have had courage to render it, but which is the only thing wanted to make it appear in its gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine luſtre and beauty. Nobody will now ſay of me, when I am performing the offices of my religion—It is his trade—he is paid for telling the people ſuch and ſuch things—he is hired to keep up a uſeful piece of mummery. They cannot now ſay this; and therefore I feel myſelf raiſed in my own eſteem, and ſhall ſpeak to them with a confidence and frankneſs, which before this I never durſt venture to aſſume.</p>
                        <p>We reſign, without reluctance, our gold and ſilver images and embroidered veſtments, becauſe that we have never ſound, that looking upon gold or ſilver made the heart more pure, or the affections more heavenly: We can alſo ſpare our churches; for the heart that wiſhes to lift itſelf up to God, will never be at a loſs for room to do it in;—but we cannot ſpare our religion, becauſe, to tell you the truth, we never had ſo much occaſion for it. I underſtand that you accuſe us prieſts of having told the people a great many falsehoods. I ſuppoſe this may have been the caſe; but till this day we have never been allowed to inquire, whether the things which we taught them were true or not. You required us formerly to receive them all without proof, and you now would have us reject them all without diſcrimination. Neither of theſe modes of conduct become philoſophers, ſuch as you would be thought to be. I am going to employ myſelf diligently, along with my pariſhioners, to ſift the wheat from the bran, the true from the falſe: If we are not ſucceſsful, we ſhall be at leaſt ſincere.</p>
                        <p>I do fear, indeed, that while I wore thoſe veſtments which we have brought you, and ſpoke in the large gloomy building which we have given up to you, I told my poor flock many idle ſtories. I cannot but hope, however, that the errors we have fallen into have not been very material, ſince the village has in
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:034162_0316_0FFC68C6F095CA38"/>
general been ſober and good; the peaſants are honeſt, docile, and laborious; the huſbands love their wives, and the wives their huſbands; they are fortunately not too rich to be compaſſionate, and they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly relieved the ſick and fugitives of all parties, whenever it has lain in their way. I think, therefore, what I have taught them cannot be ſo very much amiſs. You want to extirpate prieſts; but will you hinder the ignorant from applying for inſtruction, the unhappy for comfort and hope, the unlearned from looking up to the learned? If you do not, you will have prieſts, by whatever name you will order them to be called; but it is certainly not neceſſary they ſhould wear a particular dreſs, or be appointed by ſtate letters of ordination. My letters of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are, my zeal, my charity, my ardent love for my dear children of the village—if I were more learned, I ſhould add my knowledge; but, alas! we all know very little; to man every error is pardonable, but want of humility.</p>
                        <p>We have a public walk, with a ſpreading elm tree at one end of it, and a circle of green round it, with a convenient bench. Here I ſhall draw together the children as they are playing round me. I ſhall point to the vines laden with fruit, to the orchard, to the herds of cattle lowing round us, to the diſtant hills ſtretching one behind another, and they will aſk me how theſe things came? I ſhall tell them all I know or have heard from wiſe men who have lived before me; they will be penetrated with love and veneration; they will kneel, I ſhall kneel with them; they will not be at my feet, but all of us at the feet of that good Being, whom we ſhall worſhip together; and thus they will receive within their tender minds, <hi>a religion.</hi> The old men will come ſometimes from having depoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited under the green ſod one of their companions, and place themſelves by my ſide; they will look wiſhfully at the turf, and anxiouſly inquire—<hi>Is he gone forever? Shall we be ſoon like him? Will no morning break over the tomb?</hi> When the <hi>wicked ceaſe from troubling, will the
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:034162_0317_0FFC68C407F571F0"/>
good ceaſe from doing good?</hi> We will talk of theſe things; I will comfort them; I will tell them of the goodneſs of God; I will ſpeak to them of a life to come; I will bid them hope for a ſtate of retribution.</p>
                        <p>In a clear night, when the ſtars ſlide over our head, they will aſk what thoſe bright bodies are, and by what rules they riſe and ſet? And we will converſe about different forms of being, and diſtant worlds, in the immenſity of ſpace, governed by the ſame laws, till we feel our minds raiſed from what is grovelling, and refined from what is ſordid.</p>
                        <p>You talk of Nature—this is Nature; and if you could at this moment extinguiſh religion in the minds of all the world, thus would it be kindled again. You have changed our holy days; you have an undoubted right, as our civil governors, ſo to do; it is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material whether they are kept once in ſeven days, or once in ten; ſome, however, you will leave us, and when they occur, I ſhall tell thoſe who chooſe to hear me, of the beauty and utility of virtue, and of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of upright conduct. We ſhall talk of good men who have lived in the world, and of the doctrines they have taught; and if any of them have been perſecuted and put to death for their virtue, we ſhall reverence their memories the more—I hope in all this there is no harm. There is a book, out of which I have ſometimes taught my people: It ſays, we are to love thoſe who do us hurt, and to pour oil and wine into the wounds of a ſtranger; it has enabled my children to bear patiently the ſpoiling of their goods, and to give up their own intereſt to the general welfare. I think it cannot be a very bad book. I wiſh more of it had been read in your town; perhaps you would not have had ſo many aſſaſſinations and maſſacres. In this book we hear of a perſon called JESUS; ſome worſhip him as a God; others, as I am told, ſay it is wrong to do ſo;—ſome teach that he exiſted before the beginning of ages; others, that he was born of Joſeph and Mary. I cannot tell whether theſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies will ever be decided; but in the mean time, I
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:034162_0318_0FFC68C27A328388"/>
think we cannot do otherwiſe than well in imitating him; for I learn that he <hi>loved the poor, and went about doing good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fellow citizens, as I travelled hither from my own village, I ſaw peaſants ſetting amongſt the ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruins of their cottages; rich men and women re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to deplorable poverty; fathers lamenting their children in the bloom and pride of youth; and I ſaid to myſelf—<hi>theſe people cannot afford to part with their religion.</hi> But indeed you cannot take it away; if, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your firſt declaration, you chooſe to try the experiment of perſecuting it, you will only make us prize it the more, and love it the better. Religion, <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe,</hi> is ſo neceſſary to the mind of man, that you have already begun to make yourſelves a new one. You are ſowing the ſeeds of ſuperſtition at the moment you fancy you are deſtroying ſuperſtition; and in two or three generations your poſterity will be worſhipping ſome clumſy idol, with the rights perhaps of a bloody Moloch, or a laſcivious Thamuſar. It was not worth while to have been philoſophers, and deſtroyed the images of our ſaints for this; but let every one chooſe the religion that pleaſes him: I and my pariſhioners are content with ours; it teaches us to bear the evils your childiſh or ſanguinary decrees have helped to bring upon the country.</p>

I have not forgot that this is an old adage, but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, that its antiquity doth not deduct the ſmalleſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle from its rationality; theſe venerable old ſaws fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently contain the very pith and eſſence of ſentiment, and I have often thought that the pen appropriated to the pointing out their excellence, might be <hi>much worſe</hi> employed.</p>
                     <p>Say, thou diſcontented and repining mortal, what emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ument haſt thou derived from continually tracing the dark ſhades in the picture? Haſt thou received injuries, and doſt thou find thy recompenſe in eternally brood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereon? Do ſuch contemplations meliorate thy vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, or promote the ſunſhine of the ſoul? Are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and ſalutary airs of tranquillity originated or waft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forward by reflections, which wound the mind, and fire the boſom with indignation?</p>
                     <p>Health of body, ſerenity of ſoul, ſweet complacency, ſprightly mirth—all theſe are among the victims of <hi>cheriſhed, gloomy</hi> and <hi>corroding reſentment!</hi> The ſoul of the vindictive is the region of horror, and the moſt black and baleful paſſions harbour there. What are

the pleaſures of the angry man? It is undeniably true that he is his own tormentor; and if he throws the reins upon that implacability and inveterate revenge which ſo fearfully predominate in his breaſt, his moſt uniform or confirmed enemy could hardly deviſe means more adequate or better calculated for the deſtruction of his felicity. Have not the attentions I have received been commenſurate with that merit, with which my ſelf-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality hath inveſted me? Have I to complain of cold indifference or neglect from thoſe upon whom nature, circumſtances, or amity, had furniſhed me with indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable claims? Have I not only been defrauded of thoſe dues to which the inviolable laws of ſociety hath entitled me; but hath inſult, and even outrage been alſo added? Well, it is really a pity-moving ſituation, <hi>and I would certainly turn as often as poſſible from the view.</hi> Canſt thou derive either ſatisfaction or profit from an enumeration of thy grievances? I pity the malignant ſpirit, which can delight to prey upon food on which the fiends aſſembled in Pandemonium might joy to riot. Reader, if thou wert ever angry, then haſt thou expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the ravages which the war of the paſſions mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon thy peace—like all other wars, deſolation follows in the train, and reaſon can never eſtimate their profit; yet, if upon a fair calculation, the ſum total proves thee a ſingle drachm, or even a half drachm, nay, the hundredth part of a ſcruple the gainer; I will then conſent that thou ſhalt in future vex thyſelf to a ſkeleton more hideous than the brain of fertile poeſy ere conjured up, though ſickening envy, or yellow jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſy, or fell revenge, ſtalked full in view—"Yes," cried Maria, <q>the ſenſations which are attendant upon the contemplation of a virtuous action, are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly divine. <hi>I would paſs by a thouſand ſuppoſed injuries,</hi> but I would dwell forever upon the contemplation of genuine worth. <hi>The reflections which are the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniments of offences do not exerciſe, they do not invigorate the finer feelings of the ſoul.</hi> I liſtened to the pleaſing matron,</q> continued Maria, <q>I liſtened with rapture, for her tongue expatiated upon the philanthropy of Alberto.</q>

"My ſon," ſaid ſhe, <q>was on a voyage; he was a ſtranger, and he took rank among the loweſt grade which made up the ſhip's company—my ſon fell ſick; he was dangerouſly ill; gloomy was his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—but Alberto commanded the ſhip; he ſought out my ſon; he ſoothed his woes; he lodged him in his own cabin; he attended him in perſon, and my ſon was reſtored to health. Immeaſurable are my obligations to Alberto; and his name, next to that of the Supreme, is entitled to my utmoſt veneration. Alberto is my brother; I am many years his ſenior; I have known him the moſt beauteous of infants, and he gladdened the hearts of his parents. How ſweet are the praiſes of a brother! Alberto, dear Alberto, for this, and many ſimilar anecdotes of thy ſhort life, I will remit unto thee all, and every one of the peccadillos, which, ſhading thy character, do but ſerve to render thy virtues the more conſpicuous. Yes, the genuine benignity of thy ſoul ſhall ſerve as a ſponge wherewith to obliterate all recollection of thoſe aſperities, that the rough contour of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born integrity ſo frequently preſents.</q>

                     <p>The election of Maria exemplified her accuſtomed penetration; for reiterated obſervation of proper and becoming actions, has upon the heart the moſt ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effect. Was I called upon to delineate the path which would moſt aſſuredly lead to as great a ſhare of happineſs as is compatible with humanity, I ſhould dictate to the candidate for felicity, a frequent recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the fair ſide of perſons, circumſtances and events; almoſt every thing may be viewed in different mediums, and even the various emphaſizing of any given narration, may furniſh the ſame fact with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures directly oppoſite. Reſolve then to view every occurrence in the very beſt poſſible light; and if there is a pleaſing conſtruction, ſeize with avidity the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which points to complacency. Make, I beſeech thee, the experiment; determine to be pleaſed for one week, and then tell me how ſmoothly fled the hours. Here I am aware of an objection; misfortunes may

await, the preſſure of which may cloud even fortitude itſelf. This is certainly true, and yet it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered that habitual equanimity can blunt the edge even of the real calamities of life, and that every evil is undoubtedly mitigated by patience.</p>
                     <p>Reſolution can do much, the embodied faculties of the mind, diſciplined by virtue, are equal to almoſt any ſituation; and they effectually arreſt the progreſs of that fretful <hi>ennui</hi> which is commonly the offspring of indolence, and ſtrongly marks the want of thoſe efforts that are ſo proper to a rational being.</p>
                     <p>Murmuring, repining, captious diſcontent, invidious cavilling, theſe are fiends armed at all points againſt our repoſe; diſagreeable recollections, wounding ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſms, irritating recriminations—theſe are hunted after, as if they were ſome hidden treaſure, and they ſtab our choiceſt comforts; they are the dark aſſaſſins, who, aiming at the vitals of tranquillity, fatally deſtroy our peace. Of what conſequence is it who was the aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor? humanity is ſubjected to error, and that immac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Being, to whom alone belongeth undeviating rectitude, hath given us a dignified example of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Take the advice of a friend; make the moſt of life; enjoy with avidity; reverence virtue, make it the goal of thy wiſhes; purſue and overtake, cultivate phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthrophy; give ample ſcope to every benign ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; take not upon thyſelf the character of a <hi>public accuſer, or cenſor;</hi> but, leaving this invidious office to thoſe to whom it may <hi>legally belong,</hi> accuſtom thyſelf to expatiate upon the <hi>good qualities</hi> of thy aſſociates, upon the <hi>benefits</hi> accruing from an intercourſe with thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, and upon the <hi>eligibles of life:</hi> Tread lightly upon offences; if thou ſhouldeſt awake the ſleeping miſchief, it will ſting thee to the ſoul; its envenomed ſhafts will find their way to the deepeſt receſſes of thy ſpirit. Do not magnify or even inveſtigate the ill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which have been done thee; few circumſtances can juſtify the perturbating ſcrutiny; anger will grow in thy boſom. How ſhocking, how deforming is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger! Seneca's deſcription of anger is not too high

coloured; and it is juſt as true at the preſent day, as it was near eighteen hundred years ſince. Seneca, upon anger, may not be in your library; I take leave, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to tranſcribe an extract from his admired page.</p>
                     <p>"He was much in the right, whoever he was, that firſt called anger a ſhort madneſs; for they have both of them the ſame ſymptoms; and there is ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a reſemblance between the tranſports of choler and thoſe of frenzy, that it is a hard matter to know the one from the other. A bold, fierce and threatening countenance, as pale as aſhes, and in the ſame moment as red as blood; a glaring eye, a wrinkled brow, violent motions, the hands reſtleſs and perpetually in action, wringing and menacing, ſnapping of the joints, ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the feet, the hair ſtarting, trembling lips, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced voice; the ſpeech falſe and broken, deep and frequent ſighs, and ghaſtly looks; the veins ſwell, the heart pants, the knees knock; with a hundred diſmal accidents that are common to both diſtempers. Neither is anger, only a bare reſemblance of madneſs, but many times an irrecoverable tranſition into the thing itſelf. How many perſons have we known, read, and heard of, that have loſt their wits in a paſſion, and never came to themſelves again? It is therefore to be avoided not only for moderation ſake, but alſo for health. Now, if the outward appearance of anger be hideous, how deformed muſt that mind be that is haraſſed with it? for it leaves no place either for counſel or friendſhip, honeſty or good manners; no place either for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of reaſon, or for the offices of life. If I were to deſcribe it, I would draw a tyger bathed in blood; ſharp ſet, and ready to take a leap at its prey; or dreſs it up as the poets repreſent the furies, with whips ſnakes and flames. It ſhould likewiſe be ſour, livid, full of ſcars, and wallowing in gore, raging up and down, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, grinning, bellowing, and purſuing; ſick of all other things, and moſt of all of itſelf. It turns beauty into deformity, and the calmeſt counſels into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Is not he a mad man who hath loſt the government of himſelf, and is toſſed hither and thither by his fury, as by a tempeſt; the executioner of his own revenge, both with his heart and hand; and the murderer of his neareſt friends?

neceſſitated to admit the multifarious produce of an excurſive or fugitive imagination; yet, although thrown from my courſe, I will not be prevented from preſenting my example; I think it cannot fail of ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreeably, and it may poſſibly give birth to thoſe very identical reflections it was my wiſh to embody.</p>
                     <p>It was on a beautiful morning of April laſt that, ſeeking the pleaſures of ſolitude, I wandered from the company at our little inn, and, mounting my horſe, I threw the reins upon his neck, determining to leave to chance the direction of my ramble. We were equally ſtrangers to the road, and a few miles in a country hardly emerging from a ſtate of nature, conducted us to a thick wood, when, ſecuring my horſe to the trunk of a tall tree, I prepared to penetrate a coppice which preſented the only veſtige of the wants or ingenuity of man, which the eye could trace; and, proceeding onward to the extremity of the wood, which bordered a few acres of ground, equally remarkable for the ſterility of its ſoil, and the ſtrong indications it bore of the perſevering patience and uncommon induſtry of its proprietors, I was rouſed from my reverie by a number of voices that, arreſting my attention, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately drew me forward to the place from whence they proceeded. I ſuſpected the employment of our ruſtics, and, leſt I ſhould interrupt operations ſo prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the ſeaſon, I made my advances with care. The opening ſcene preſented a poor built cottage, which, in language unequivocal, proclaimed induſtrious pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty; the heathy appearance of the grounds evinced the ſtinted produce, with which they repaid the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's culture; a few ſheep and a ſingle cow, whoſe thin forms demonſtrated the ſcanty pittance on which they fed, ſtood forth additional vouchers of the penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſoil. But a fertilizing ſtream, which murmured by, and bore in its boſom various deſcriptions of the finny tribe, diverſified the view, and gave birth to the pleaſures of hope.</p>
                     <p>A well looking man was buſily employed in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and ſhaping the glebe; a ſentimental carol vibrated upon his tongue, and his features were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:034162_0326_0FFC68AEEBB65E60"/>
of content. A graceful female at a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, round whom no leſs than eleven children, of different ages, were collected—was directing the eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt boy, a roſy-cheeked youth, in ſetting ſome plants, while ſhe herſelf committed to the prepared earth, thoſe ſeeds from which ſhe cheerfully anticipated the diſtant harveſt. The veſtments of the family were the veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of penury; and if they could be conſidered as garments, they were entitled, for ſo reſpectable an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, to the unwearied diligence, which, ſtill fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the well worn robe, had ſo repeatedly repaired each time made breach, as to render it impoſſible to decide, of what hue or texture it was originally poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Yet the voice of gladneſs echoed round, and the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the heart ſeemed impreſſed upon every feature.</p>
                     <p>I contemplated, with folded arms and grateful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, the uncommon group. The face of the matron was not immediately turned toward me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had the ſhepherd obſerved me; but the children had begun to amuſe themſelves with my figure, when their mother, having finiſhed her employ, was drawn by their innocent mirth to the ſpot on which I was fixed. I have already confeſſed mingling ſurpriſe and pleaſure at the gay tranquillity, which was apparently the appendages of a ſcene ſo barren of good, and ſo remarkably devoid of the eligibles of life; but no language can expreſs my aſtoniſhment, when, in the countenance of the penuriouſly garbed matron, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized the once opulent, truly amiable, and highly deſerving Flavilla!</p>
                     <p>Gracious God!—ſpontaneouſly I exclaimed—Is it poſſible? do I in reality behold the long idolized, and ever charming Miſs Kneller? Flavilla, accuſtomed to the viciſſitudes and caprices of events, uttered no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed exclamation; but, with that genuine dignity, which nature delights to confer upon a conſciouſneſs of innate worth, with a grace and manner which I have not often ſeen equalled in a drawing-room, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting her hand, ſhe expreſſed her ſatisfaction in an interview ſo unexpected; and, leading me to her hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abode, we were ſoon joined by Honorius and the
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:034162_0327_0FFC68AD5B3272B8"/>
little family. I had known Flavilla from early youth: She was born to affluence, and her education had been in the firſt line. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Kneller, had no other child; and this daughter, promiſing in every view, was, of courſe, regarded as an ineſtimable treaſure. Honorius was the man of her heart, and her union with the youth ſhe loved, and who recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated her attachment, received the cheerful ſanction of the authors of her being.</p>
                     <p>Soon after the marriage of Miſs Kneller, her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental friends paid the great debt of nature, leaving Honorius and Flavilla in poſſeſſion of an ample for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But, from this period, thick clouds began to gather, and they experienced a moſt diſtreſſing reverſe of circumſtances. The <hi>career</hi> of their misfortunes was uſhered in by a dreadful conflagration, in which their manſion-houſe, containing many valuable articles, was reduced to aſhes; a ſeries of calamities ſucceeded, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, at length, of all their vaſt poſſeſſions, ſcarce a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige remained; yet a principle of rectitude triumphed in their ſouls; of their inborn integrity, the malice of their fate could not diveſt them; and diſcharging, with intereſt, the laſt farthing for which they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted, with the poor pittance which was left, they retired, like Thompſon's Lavinia—"<hi>far from thoſe ſcenes that knew their better days,</hi>" and purchaſed in this remote ſpot—<hi>'twas all they could</hi>—the barren grounds from which they have ever ſince obtained a ſcanty and hard earned ſubſiſtence. Their original ſtock conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of thirty ſheep, one cow, and a yoke of oxen; the ſheep were almoſt immediately deſtroyed by the wolves; the cow fell a victim, probably, to the ſteril ſoil to which ſhe was confined; and, in an attempt to level a tall tree, one of their oxen was killed upon the ſpot. Succeeding years has reduced to the loweſt ſtate the neceſſaries which made up their perſonal and family wardrobe, and it has not been in their power to poſſeſs themſelves of the ſmalleſt ſupplies! Yet, ſtrange to tell, neither time nor ſorrow hath been able to infix their deadly fangs in the boſom of Flavilla; health dances in her veins, and beauty glows upon her cheek; her
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:034162_0328_0FFC68AA580C72C8"/>
ſmiles ſtill diſplay the dimples of youth; and in her mildly expreſſive eye, corrected vivacity yet beams. It was impoſſible I could forbear expreſſing my aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment and my admiration! and when I inquired by what means they had, Flavilla eſpecially, ſupported ſuch an uncommon meaſure of tranquillity, in the midſt of ſuch a calamitous reverſe of circumſtances, Flavilla replied—</p>
                     <p>"It is ſimply this, we have conſidered the <hi>brevity</hi> of life, and the certainty of our removal to another, a better, and a more permanent ſtate of being; we have adopted, realized, and reduced to practice, the ſentiment of an admired poet; we have been taught by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that "<hi>earth-born cares are vain;</hi> that <hi>man wants but little here below,</hi>" we have fully known; and we do not expect to want "<hi>that little long.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>To contribute to the relief of Flavilla, or her family, is impoſſible; for ſince the diſcovery of her retirement, in regard to which ſhe hath enjoined the ſtricteſt ſecreſy, however ingenious I have been in my attempts to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their finances, I have ſtill found myſelf, and with a firmneſs almoſt unexampled, uniformly repulſed. To have put Flavilla in poſſeſſion of every thing which her ſituation ſeemed to claim, would have been the higheſt luxury which benevolence could have taſted; but while I regret, as an individual, her ſteady rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all pecuniary aſſiſtance, I cannot but admire the genuine elevation of her high-ſouled ſentiments. She liſtened, it is true, to thoſe remonſtrances with which, after more indirect methods had failed, I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to addreſs her; but ſhe liſtened only to aſcertain her rejection.</p>
                     <p>"No, Sir," with all the calmneſs of inborn ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority, ſhe replied, "I am but too much obliged in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving your munificent propoſals, but no one ſhall ſay that he hath <hi>enriched either Flavilla, or her family.</hi> Flavilla, and her family, will depend only upon <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Nature's God; habit hath reconciled us to our ſituation; we are reſigned, we are contented</hi>—beſides, my friend, the proſpect now gradually brightens upon us; by rigid economy, we have replaced our <hi>ſtock;</hi> our

children are growing up; my boys will aſſiſt their father; we have already laid the foundation of a little tenement, in which we expect to meet a tranquil cloſe to waning life. Labour will ameliorate even the ſteril earth; many hands will bear from ſome more friendly ſpot the rich manure; the increaſe of our own fields ſhall yet ſpread us a plenteous board. See yonder flax, already it aſſumes a promiſing and healthy aſpect. The fineſt threads are ſpun by my girls, and even by myſelf. Lydia is miſtreſs of the weaving buſineſs; William has a fine mechanical genius, his looms are nearly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, and the well made web, the product of our own induſtry, will ere long furniſh us with decent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming veſtments."</p>

                     <p>The ſmooth ſurface of the limpid ſtream out-ſpreads its azure flow to the moſt curious inveſtigation; the orient luminary of day emits a flood of light; it iſſues forth a tranſcendent body, elevated in itſelf, while its ſplendours are confeſſed by every eye; and the upright ancient wiſhed for a glaſs in his breaſt, that the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of concealment might be thus eraſed from the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of his abilities.

I confeſs I am charmed by frankneſs of ſoul; ingenuity and integrity of manners, carry with them their title to my unreſerved eſteem, and upon the honeſt ſincere man, reaſon, unbiaſſed by faſhion or habit, is ever ready to pronounce a eulogy. I abhor duplicity in every form; doubtful meanings, <hi>double entendres,</hi> playing upon words, with every baga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telle of this deſcription, are, in my opinion, at leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elegant and unbecoming; nor can I allow that they make any part of <hi>manly ſenſe, true wit,</hi> or <hi>genuine hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi> In a fair, open, conſiſtent manner of thinking, converſing and acting, there is both dignity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; and an elevated reputation is the well earned reward of perſevering and unequivocal worth.

It is dangerous to amuſe ourſelves with the <hi>ſemblance</hi> of <hi>vice; the habit</hi> of uttering <hi>merry falſehoods,</hi> will ſoon blunt the fine edge of our feelings, and we ſhall eaſily ſlide into the moſt <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>capital violations of truth.</hi> Integrity dignifies a character; frankneſs is truly ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and if the offence is not highly enormous, ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ingenuity of a candid acknowledgment, we are ready to preſs the offender to our boſoms; we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him a ſecond leaſe of our eſteem, and it depends altogether on himſelf, whether we ſhall ever again ſerve upon him a writ of ejection. A moment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment is a moment of humiliation; and although circumſtances may ſometimes render it neceſſary, yet, it is certain, that when the <hi>paths of innocence are encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by ambiguity,</hi> the luſtre of her crown is dimmed; her blooming honours <hi>ſeem</hi> to <hi>wane,</hi> and we heſitate, while uttering thoſe applauſes which ſhould be reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enwreath the brow of <hi>unequivocal merit.</hi> Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious arrangements excite ſuſpicion; conjecture is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>float; jealouſy is rouſed; the aerial miſchief feeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the thinneſt diet, and peace evaporates in its graſp. Monimia is perturbed and agitated; not an hour in the day but a variety of tormenting ideas ſucceed each other in her mind; and the moſt vexatious inquietude, is the deſpot of her dreams. Monimia once boaſted of her felicity, and her preſent ſufferings are the offspring of conjecture; delicacy forbids her to queſtion, and yet her tranquillity will never be reſtored, until ſhe learns to what fair hand her loved Eugenio was indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the <hi>expreſſive device</hi> ſo elegantly enwreathed, and ſo curiouſly cut, which hath recently come into his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and which he carefully preſerves in the cover of his watch. Clariſſa is agitated and unhappy; ſhe accidentally diſcovered in the eſcrutoir of Horatio, a lock of hair; it was beautifully gloſſy; ſhe is poſitive that it never made a part of her own auburn treſſes; it was neatly folded in ſome lines, ſweetly pathetic, and tenderly poetical: Perhaps the rape of that immortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized lock, which Dan Pope has ſo ſweetly ſung, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it intereſted the celeſtials, was not productive of more <hi>real anguiſh</hi>—and I perſuade myſelf that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Cordelia, whoſe attachment to her nuptial lord is ſtill unbroken, hath paſſed <hi>months of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction,</hi> occaſioned by her incertitude, relative to the diſpoſal of a pair of ſleeve-buttons, which ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly preſented to her Henry as a pledge of love.</p>

                        <q>But theſe are all unjuſtifiable ſources of inquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ude—they are the imbecilities of the mind, and, originating in the <hi>caprice</hi> of affection, they are of too ſmall moment to merit attention; and they are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, too reprehenſible to be countenanced.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I grant they are at preſent <hi>comparatively</hi> ſmall; yet if I am unhappy, I am unhappy, whatever may have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the evil; and when the peace of a family, or even of an individual is involved, a full explanation, with ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery attempt to ſoothe, is as neceſſary as it is generous; and it ſhould always be remembered, that the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed flame, which, raging with increaſing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, purſues its deſolating career, and iſſues in the moſt diſtreſſing conflagration, was once a lambent ſpark, whoſe genial warmth might eaſily have been ſuppreſſed, and whoſe agency, under a judicious direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might have produced the moſt beneficial effects.</p>
                     <p>Yes, the peace of families is too often ſacrificed to falſe delicacy, and to an ill-judged ſilence on facts and circumſtances, which ought to have been ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly narrated and critically examined. Inviolable ſecreſy, preſerved for any conſiderable length of time, ſuppoſing the event we are ſolicitous to conceal of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to thoſe with whom we are intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, is hardly within the chapter of poſſibilities; a word, or even a look, accidentally tranſpiring, will give the alarm; the truth, however latent, is thus <hi>in part</hi> divulged; curioſity commenceth the purſuit, and a clue is obtained, which may be juſt ſufficient to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the intereſted perſon into a labyrinth, from which, never being able to extricate himſelf, he may be deſpoiled of all that treaſured ſerenity, which he had vainly hoped would ſerve as a fund, for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a life of rational enjoyment.</p>

recollection; ſhe is not perſonally known to me, but although the vaſt Atlantic rolls its waves between us, yet, with reiterated pleaſure, I have frequently traced the lineaments of her fair mind, as I have ſeen it pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed in many a well-written page, the product of her inimitable pen. She hath, I am told, a pleaſing exterior, and her underſtanding is elevated much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the level of mediocrity. Nature, when ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon her uncommon parts, endowed her alſo with an exquiſite tenderneſs of ſoul. Her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is lively and fertile, and ſhe has a taſte capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diſtinguiſhing, and highly enjoying the beauties of poetry. Early enliſting in the ſervice of the Muſes, ſhe became one of their moſt ſucceſsful votaries; and, from the beautiful parterres which ornament the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſian grounds, ſhe hath ſkilfully and happily combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many an elegant fancied bouquet. She was always a nymph of the <hi>ſober-ſuited train,</hi> and to airs the moſt penſively melodious her lyre was uniformly attuned.</p>
                     <p>Sweet Eliza! in the enchanting walks of poeſy, thy feet have ceaſed to ſtray; that confirmed melancholy, which the ſunny beams of hope can no longer impreſs, will no more permit thee to attune the neglected chords; the voice of the chantreſs is forever mute, and the lovely minſtrel hath forgotten to charm. Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fair one! the roſe of thy tranquillity is blighted, and "<hi>thy violets, alas! have all withered.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>It is to the ill-judged ſilence of Eliza, and her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parent, that her misfortunes muſt be imputed, The ſtory of her life is ſimple: I owed unreturnable obligations to her father; it was to him I was indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſyſtematic and rational mode of thinking, which has conſtituted the moſt tranquil and refined moments of my exiſtence. He was a man in the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary line; his writings are copious and energetic; and for ſtrength of argument, perſpicuity of diction, and ſelf-evident demonſtration, he hath never yet been ſurpaſſed; but having attained, in his favourite purſuit, the higheſt poſſible excellence; he became nearly abſorbed in thoſe contemplations from which originated ſo large a part of his felicity, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſibly
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:034162_0334_0FFC689CDD8910D0"/>
inattentive to every conſideration which he deemed of leſs moment. It too often happens that real or original genius, although rich in reſources, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the moſt ſhining qualifications, is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs found deſtitute of thoſe very neceſſary requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, which can alone beſtow a capability of a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial intercourſe with mankind.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mortimor, the father of Eliza, made his nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial choice with ſo little diſcretion, as to exchange the marriage vow with a woman, who, at the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe met him at the altar, knew herſelf to be the wife of another! With this perfidiouſly abandoned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate, he lived in total ignorance of her criminal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion; and laviſhing upon her every proof of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment almoſt unexampled, until the perjured miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant, having ſtripped him of every valuable article which he poſſeſſed, found means to abſcond with the paramour of her choice, at a period when the treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly betrayed Mortimor was engaged in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of ſome benevolent offices, which his philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropic diſpoſition had impoſed upon him as duties.</p>
                     <p>It was not until after her elopement, that the turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of her life was diſcloſed to him; and yet he could not, even then, although convinced of her atrocity, be perſuaded to take meaſures calculated to bring her to condign puniſhment! Many years elapſed before the wound he had received admitted a cure; his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of ſoul, and his innate ſenſe of rectitude, ſtill combated his peace, and reaſon, for a long time, plead in vain. At length, however, the lenient hand of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaging years, aided by the intellectual accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and prepoſſeſſing exterior, of a truly deſerving female, effectuated the moſt ſalutary change. Hope once more dawned in his boſom; it gleamed like ſome heavenly viſitant athwart the melancholy region of his benighted ſoul; by degrees it obliterated the gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ideas which hovered there, and he again aſſerted the native dignity of his character. To the ſweet ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his ſorrows, his hours of leiſure were invariably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted; a ſentimental intercourſe commenced; it was ameliorated by the ſtricteſt amity, and it terminated in an attachment of the tendereſt kind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="336" facs="unknown:034162_0335_0FFC689AAB20C968"/>
Hymen once more light for Mortimor his ſacred torch; and had he attended to ſome legal ſteps, which ſhould previouſly have been taken, the auſpices under which he entered into this ſecond engagement, would have been moſt happy: Yet, thoſe arrangements, which ſlower ſouls would have deemed indiſpenſable, muſt have occaſioned delays; the proceſs of the law was tedious; Mortimor had many enemies; obſtacles might be interpoſed; and if upon application he ſhould not be able to obtain the neceſſary form of divorce, his expectation of happineſs would be defeated. What was to be done? Concealment was a ready reſource; and, wrapping himſelf about in the veil of ſecreſy, in his own retired apartment, in the preſence of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prieſt and a few ſelect friends, he plighted his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling faith. Mrs. Mortimor (ſtill received merely as the friend of her huſband) retained her family name; and, although many might ſuſpect, thoſe only who were bound to ſecreſy could deciſively pronounce.</p>
                     <p>At length, however, revolving months uſhered into the world the infant Eliza; and impenetrable myſtery ſtanding centinel at her birth, ſhe was produced in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety by the name of Montague; and her parents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced her as the orphan daughter of deceaſed rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. Indeed, having conducted their engagement with ſo little obſervance of forms, however <hi>innocent</hi> in
<hi>intention</hi> and in <hi>fact</hi> the parties in reality were, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere penalty annexed by the laws of England, againſt that irregularity or breach, a deſcription of which would undeniably involve their connexion, rendered it incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon them carefully to avoid an explanation.</p>
                     <p>Eliza was educated with the moſt ſcrupulous atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſhe was nurtured by the hand of elegance, and trained to the obſervance of every virtue. As early as her opening reaſon authorized a confidence ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, under the ſtrongeſt injunctions of inviolable ſilence, ſhe was made acquainted with the ſecret of her birth; and that diſcretion, armed by filial piety, with which ſhe guarded a communication on which was ſuſpended the life of her father, abundantly juſtified the repoſing a truſt of ſuch a nature in ſo tender a
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:034162_0336_0FFC6897B684F090"/>
boſom. Fifteen happy years were paſſed by Eliza, amid the ſoft endearments of parental tenderneſs; each cheerful morn was uſhered in by new proofs of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent care, and the feathery hours were all marked by gentle admonitions, tender cautions, or well-judged ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and each returning evening ſaw her encircled by thoſe arms, and preſſed to the faithful boſoms of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who ſealed upon her balmy lips their wiſhes for the repoſe of the night, always concluding their pious benedictions by ſo natural an avowal of feelings, which were the genuine offspring of a ſpecies of tenderneſs that perhaps cannot be ſurpaſſed. How fatal for Eliza was the hour, that juſt at this period robbed her of a father, who, actuated by a ſpirit of univerſal benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and breathing the mildeſt and moſt benign ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of philanthropy, glowed with uncommon ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for a daughter, whom, in his moſt unimpaſſioned moments, he could not but acknowledge as highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, every way amiable, and compriſing in herſelf the ſum total of a father's wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>The demiſe of Mr. Mortimor preſented a moment, in which it would have been wiſdom to have opened on ſociety, with a full and unequivocal eclairciſſement. Death had placed the victim the law would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, beyond the reach of its penalties; and, clothed in the habiliments of conſcious integrity, <hi>they had then nothing to hazard by an explanation.</hi> The prieſt, who joined the hands of the parents of Eliza, could, at that juncture, have been produced; and the few friends who were preſent at the marriage, were ſtill in exiſtence.—Alas, alas! they are now conſigned to the ſilent tomb! and, ſtrange to tell, letting ſlip the golden ſeaſon of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, Mrs. Mortimor was ſtill known by the name of Laughton, while Eliza was addreſſed by that of Montague!</p>
                     <p>It is certain that reſerves, <hi>except impoſed by neceſſity,</hi> are never juſtifiable; and the <hi>neceſſity of myſtery,</hi> ceaſed with the death of Mr. Mortimor.

her election, a youth with whom her gentle heart could unheſitatingly conſent to inweave the ſilken bands of tender, conjugal and indiſſoluble amity. But her choice once made, ſhe deferred not to baniſh from the boſom of him ſhe approbated, that perturbed ſuſpenſe that ſo fatally corrodes each promiſed joy; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her every ſtep was pointed by virgin delicacy, yet did ſhe ſkilfully enwreath therewith a noble and dignified frankneſs, which huſhed that tumultuous whirlwind of the paſſions, that hath ſhipwrecked the peace of many a manly breaſt. Pity ſhe was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be uniformly explicit; but the maternal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition was ſtrangely and unaccountably interpoſed, and her nuptials were ſolemnized under that diſguiſe, which, although juſtifiable for a time, was moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently continued, and ſhould never have been worn in the preſence of a man, whom, in every other reſpect, ſhe had honoured by the moſt unbounded confidence; but ſhe remained perſeveringly, reprehenſibly ſilent! and this ſilence hath been fatal to her peace. The firſt years of her wedded life were uncommonly ſerene; ſhe bore to Altamont many fine children; and none but tranquil days ſeemed written for her. How pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious are terreſtrial joys! An untoward accident ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly reverſed the ſcene. A paper, written by herſelf, and addreſſed to her mother, breathing the language of ambiguity, deeply fraught with myſtery, and yet obſcurely hinting at the truth, unfortunately met the eye of Altamont! To the niceſt ſenſe of honour Atla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont is exquiſitely alive—the ſoul of ingenuity is his, and the delicacy of his ſentiments refuſeth to tolerate the moſt diſtant appearance of deception. He drank in the contagious lines; every word operated as an envenomed draught; and while he ſhrunk from the fearful contents, they became, in effect, like thoſe ſubtil poiſons, which are ſaid to procure immediate death; for they infixed their deadly fangs in the very vitals of that tranquillity, which he had fondly hoped was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the malice of fate.</p>
                     <p>Inſtantly the fiend, deſpair, embodied its miniſters; they were buſy about his heart; complacency was
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:034162_0338_0FFC6894086FD9E0"/>
chaſed from his boſom; the ſmiles of benevolence are no more; a deep and ſettled melancholy lowers upon his brow; and the ſullen ſilence which he obſtinately obſerves, effectually bars an eclairciſſement. His houſe, once the ſeat of ſocial happineſs—now, alas! dire ſuſpicion, dark conjecture, and baleful jealouſy, hover there; and although months and years have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, no beam of elucidation hath yet illumined thoſe heartfelt glooms, by which he is enveloped. The tear is upon the cheek of Eliza; and her dream of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of terreſtrial happineſs, is gone forever.</p>
                     <p>The deep melancholy which impreſſed the mind of Altamont, was immediately ſucceeded by the moſt alarming eſtrangement; his temper ſeems totally ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined. He regards the partner of his ſufferings with a miſtruſtful kind of indignation; ſhe has loſt his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; ſhe has every reaſon to believe ſhe no longer poſſeſſes his affection; and, the probability is, that was ſhe now to come forward with a full and undiſguiſed explanation, it would produce no ſalutary effect; her vouchers, as we obſerved, are numbered with the dead; Altamont is haughty and implacable, and Eliza, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once indiſputably deceived him, it is to be feared that he will yield her no future credence!!!</p>

                           <p>UPON my word, Mr. Gleaner, I believe you are a ſly old fellow, after all. Let me tell you, Sir, it ill ſuits with your <hi>aſſumed gravity,</hi> to be thus foiſting yourſelf into the ſecrets of all the young, handſome, married women of your acquaintance. Mighty fine, mighty fine, truly. <hi>Delicacy, forſooth, forbid Monimia to queſtion her huſband;</hi> but <hi>delicacy,</hi> it ſeems, did not think proper to interfere, while ſhe contrived to pour her pity-moving tale into the boſom of <hi>nobody knows who—one who is here, and there, and every where, and very poſſibly not of much importance any where. A perfect Proteus to the imagination, aſſuming a thouſand fantaſtical forms, and becoming ſtationary in no one reſpectable charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; a bird of paſſage, emigrating from ſtate to ſtate, and picking up a ſcanty pittance, after a whole month's toil, which but ill repays the labour of travelling through the dull pages he is ſo ſtudious to multiply.</hi> You may think me ſevere, Mr. Gleaner, but I have the ſatisfaction of knowing I am <hi>juſt;</hi> and I add, that you might have gone on with your itinerant gleaning, to the end of the chapter, for me, if you had not rouſed the feelings of an injured huſband, by thus palpably inſinuating, that you are a greater favourite with his wife than he is himſelf! Really, Mr. Morality, you make a very pretty <hi>conſiſtent, heterogeneous</hi> figure; and I ſhould like vaſtly to have your motley image ſtuck up in a print-ſhop, by way of relief to the ſtudies of the chubby-faced ſchool-boy, as he trudges along the academical way to his daily labours.</p>
                           <p>The wiſe man ſays, that laughter doeth good like a medicine; and it is undeniably true, that the ludicrous is a wonderful ſpecific in every intellectual complaint. But let me whiſper you, good Mr. Prig, you are a
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:034162_0340_0FFC688DF4C7FE50"/>
coxcomb; and you may bleſs your ſtars that I am not able to collect the trio, which you have huddled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in your laſt Gleaner; for, if I could name my fellow-ſufferers, we would unite together in obtaining a moſt ſignal revenge; but you are ſuch a doughty hero, and, withal, ſo evaneſcent a ſpright, that you elude the force of common exertions.</p>
                           <p>How you became acquainted with Monimia's tale of ſorrow, is an enigma, of which it will be conceived that <hi>delicacy</hi> forbids me to ſeek an explanation! The probability is, that you have practiſed upon her ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and, inſinuating yourſelf into the good graces of the afflicted fair one, by ſome illicit methods, you have at length obtained her confidence; and, as I am one of the beſt natured men in the world, extending the ſceptre of my clemency, I ſhall view, with proper indulgence, the <hi>imbecilities of nature.</hi> Doubtleſs, I could have reſtored the tranquillity of my wife, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling either you or myſelf with my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but, beſides that I conceive your temerity mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its chaſtiſement, as you have impertinently precipitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and an affair which was wholly mine, to public view. I am induced to believe, that the eclairciſſement hath thus acquired a kind of right to publicity.</p>
                           <p>Monimia will remember, that I not long ſince paid a viſit to my relations at B—. My kinſman S—has a daughter, <hi>not yet twelve years old,</hi> who is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, and handles her ſciſſors to admiration; <hi>ſhe cut my watch-paper, and ſhe will be proud of furniſhing Monimia with any little fancy pieces which ſhe may wiſh.</hi> On my return home, I made a diſplay of my acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Monimia, <hi>haſtily</hi> and <hi>tremulouſly, made ſome round about inquiries, relative to the fair artificer—theſe I would not underſtand—I diſlike every ſymptom of ſuſpicion in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; ſuſpicion looks ſo like jealouſy, and jealouſy looks ſo like want of confidence, I remained ſilent, and affected a kind of, what the ladies call, delicate embarraſſment.</hi> Perhaps I was wrong; but had I been appriſed that the impreſſion made by <hi>ſo light a thing as a watch-paper,</hi> could have been ſo ſerious, I ſhould certainly have endeavoured to eraſe it.</p>
                           <p>I have, Mr. Meddler, the honour—<hi>the honour</hi>—no, that's wrong—<hi>I have not the honour</hi>—I have <hi>the conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion</hi>

                           <p>AS you have given your examples under fictitious names, I am not furniſhed with a rational cauſe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and yet, Sir, you have ſo well pointed circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that it is impoſſible for the real claimant to avoid aſſuming habiliments, which can fit no one but himſelf.</p>
                           <p>Myſtery is indeed the parent of conjecture, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment moſt ſurely engenders ſuſpicion. Authors are doubtleſs juſtifiable, in procuring every warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble illuſtration of their ſentiments, and of thoſe infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which they wiſh to deduce; and even a <hi>deſire</hi> to inform, or to improve, is entitled to grateful reſpect. If my Clariſſa, or her favoured Altamont, can furniſh either amuſement or inſtruction to the Gleaner and his numerous readers, any little anecdote, relative to us, is extremely at their ſervice. My Clariſſa is more dear to my ſoul than the life-blood which warms me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; ſhe hath not, ſhe never had, nor ever can have, a rival in my affections. She reigns ſole miſtreſs in my heart, and to her peerleſs virtues my every thought does homage. Yet, while I avow a fealty ſo unreſerved, I am bold enough to confeſs my property in the beautifully gloſſy look of hair, a diſcovery of which has been ſo ſurreptitiouſly obtained; that I have treaſured up this lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Further, my own hands ſevered the conteſted lock from the head of a lovely female, who was dear to me as nature, as amity, or as my fondeſt hopes of happineſs. All this is moſt true; and it is likewiſe true, that this female was not Clariſſa!</p>
                           <p>Are you immeaſurably aſtoniſhed? Step to the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſide of the piece, and it will aſſume another hue. I am not a native of America; I have lived only five years in this paradiſe of liberty. I had a ſiſter—good

God! how unfortunate was that ſiſter! amiable as virtue, and indulgent as Heaven; ſhe merited every thing ſhort of adoration, from that world which perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted her, almoſt from the firſt hour of her exiſtence. Execrable world!—the virtues of a Clariſſa were nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary to reconcile me to an abode among thy deeply deſigning and treacherouſly murderous inhabitants! I have forborne to narrate to my Clariſſa the ſtory of my ſiſter's woes; her misfortunes were too ſtrongly marked with anguiſh, to be impoſed upon the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely tender feelings of that ſuſceptible boſom, which melts with ſoft regrets at the tale of woe, and which has a ſigh even for the common ills of life. Nay, thoſe deplorable circumſtances which hovered round the ſteps of my ill-fated ſiſter, I have ſedulouſly ſought to blot even from my own memory. I would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber only her virtues, her angel goodneſs, her beauteous image, and her ſaint-like fortitude; but, alas! thoſe recollections are ſo interwoven with the cruel events of her life, as to render a ſeparation impoſſible.</p>
                           <p>Orphanaged in her earlieſt bud; the ſport of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price, malice and duplicity, through the unſuſpecting morn of life; and, in her marriage choice, placing her virtuous confidence in a man, who, by a ſpecious exterior, villanouſly deceived her; who wore the garb of integrity, honour, generoſity, and a mild and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding diſpoſition of ſoul, on purpoſe to betray her eaſy faith; who no ſooner exchanged the nuptial vow, than throwing off the maſk, and commencing tyrant, he became unweariedly ingenious in his devices to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the victim of his power; who perſecuted her to the death, nor ſuſpended, for a ſingle moment, his ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and deteſted operations, until, with a broken heart, ſhe yielded up her breath, falling the martyr of aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prerogative, cruelty and deſpotiſm.</p>
                           <p>Angelic ſufferer! mild and ſubmiſſive, thou utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no complaint; not a vindictive expreſſion eſcaped thee; and had thy murderer poſſeſſed but common pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the knowledge of thy unprecedented wrongs would have been conſigned to the grave with thee. Through all thy hard fortune, I followed ſtill an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent ſpectator of thy injuries; but, while appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:034162_0343_0FFC688A063E53E0"/>
were preſerved, cuſtom forbid a brother's interfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and an impeachment of thy huſband's character would have been an incurable wound to thy delicacy. What ſhall I further ſay? He who made her, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with ſacred pity, the pity of a God, her eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation was accelerated, and ſhe drew her laſt breath in my arms! I ſaw her lovely boſom ſurceaſe the corroding ſigh; I ſaw her heavenly form quietly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the bed of death; and, my Clariſſa, it was in that agonized moment, that I ſevered from its kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred treſſes, the ſhining ringlet, which, ſtraying from its incloſure, fell unconſcious upon her ſnowy forehead.</p>
                           <p>I grieve that it hath been to you the ſource of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude; but its value, at that diſtreſſing period, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me immenſe; nor has reaſon or time eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially depreciated its importance. I could never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade myſelf to part with it to an artiſt, who would have oſtenſibly returned it to me, in the form of cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ubs, urns and inſcriptions; for I have ſtill preferred contemplating its natural beauties; and I employed my firſt ſerene moments in preparing thoſe lines, in which to enſhrine it, that have been erroneouſly called poetical.

The reader will indulge his own reflections; and I have choſen this method of making my communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Clariſſa; as the emotions which ſwell my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, when I would attempt to retrace the misfortunes of my injured ſiſter, are too big for utterance.</p>

                     <p>I could very modeſtly propoſe myſelf as a new proof of the truth of this oft-cited ſentiment, which if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not, time and obſervation hath elevated into an approved axiom. I could, I ſay, leaving thoſe who are offended to chew the cud of reſentment, eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole myſelf, by ſo <hi>convenient</hi> an <hi>appropriation;</hi> but I freely confeſs, that I ſet a high value upon the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the world; <hi>I mean the worthy part of the world, to be ſure;</hi> and that thus ſtimulated, I feel myſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to make my defence, by producing a ſhort ſketch of my plan of operations.</p>
                     <p>When I was firſt ſeized with the mania of ſcribbling, I very wiſely endeavoured to combat it by much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate conſideration, and many a ſalutary antidote. Wiſdom, attired in the alluring habiliments of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, and armed with the rhetoric of reaſon, ſagely
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:034162_0345_0FFC68842B8CB650"/>
advanced her plea, and with great perſpicuity, and energy of argument, ſhe advocated that kind of ſeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, which is the accompaniment of the unambitious man: who, gliding down the ſtream of time, inhaleth not the feveriſh gale; but wafted onward by the equal breath of contentment, partakes its mildly influence, and lives but to bleſs the gently undulating zephyr, that is thus ſilently impelling him athwart that ocean, upon which the <hi>adventurous</hi> voyager is fated to contend with hopes and fears, and with all thoſe tumultuous winds of paſſion, which frequently involving him in a fearful hurricane, fail not to wreck his peace, whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beneath their tremendous waves the brighteſt moments of his exiſtence! Wiſdom pointed out the wretched ſtate of inquietude, anxiety, nightly watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and daily fatigues, to which that unhappy and miſguided wight is condemned, who, betrayed by an <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> is allured from the humble vale of ſoft and ſilent repoſe; from the calm poſſeſſion of each ſocial and domeſtic enjoyment, to encounter the various ills attendant upon a purſuit of <hi>artificial good.</hi> Wiſdom enumerated a hoſt of weary toils, of woe-begone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grets, of unrecompenſed deeds of worth, of thankleſs achievements, and of barbed diſappointments; and ſhe painted in glowing colours the ingratitude of that world to which I would madly devote thoſe hours, that might otherwiſe revolve, marked by the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, rational and exquiſite ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Wiſdom delineated the thorny circles which begirt the hill of fame; ſhe bid me haſte from the magic of her voice, from the mad contagion of her votaries; and, ſheltering in the ſweet and flowery walks of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, ſhe conjured me to emboſom my aſpiring views in the deepeſt receſſes of my native ſhades; and, that ſhe might forever daſh my proud pretenſions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorate that deſpair, which, with icy graſp, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid influence, hovered round my ſteps, ſhe repreſented in forms tremendouſly terrific, thoſe deadly fiends, that with ghaſtly features, and unrelenting rigour, eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guard the glittering domes of ſame. Envy, with ſnaky locks, empoiſoned veins, and peſtilential breath
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:034162_0346_0FFC68829D9A2000"/>
—Malice, with tongue envenomed, armed with ten thouſand ſhafts of inſtant death, and ſmiling at deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—Pale diſappointment, marked by ſorrow's train, with ſad and ſolemn ſtep, heaving corroding ſighs, quaffing her copious tears, and in deſpondence garbed—and, laſt of all, deep ſhame, with face averted, eyes withdrawn, and red conſuming anguiſh, confeſſed thy power, heart appalling, ſpirit wounding, ſoul abaſhing ſcorn. Afflicting ridicule—ſatires dread ſting—the crit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic's whip, which hiſſed along the air—with every plague which a poor author ever knew—theſe Wiſdom ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, and in fearful order the direful phalanx ſtood.</p>
                     <p>Yet my aſpiring mind, ſteeled for the conflict, all in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour clad, and ſhielded by temerity—aſſuming reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and armed by pertinacity, preſumed with dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſteps, and enterprizing raſhneſs, to penetrate the embodied oppoſition, <hi>and Reaſon plead in vain.</hi> Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ambition, all precepts notwithſtanding, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inflexibly perſevering, and triumphed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict. Ambition ſelected its ornaments, and it wore on its left breaſt, cloſe to the heart, a bouquet, whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed buds were, with intrepid daring, ſnatched from the ſtock of ever blooming hope. In this it prided much, and fondly fancied that ſome future day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decked with ſunny beams, would give the deathleſs flowre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s to enwreath its time diſtinguiſhed, time adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed brow. Thus breathing mid ſuch odoriferous airs; incenſe ſo ſweet inhaling, intoxicated reaſon, treading enchanted ground, by magic ſpells enfolded, and wrapped in gay deluſion, its firmneſs loſt—Ambition ſeized the reins—the die was caſt—and helter-ſkelter round the world we drove.</p>
                     <p>But, ſeriouſly, although thus raſhly embarked, <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> occaſionally officiates; and while temerity ſets at the helm, <hi>ſhe</hi> often, matron like, interpoſes her cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary directions, and to be duly influenced by her counſels, is a prime object, even in the arrangements of ambition.</p>
                     <p>There is hardly any thing I have ſo much feared, as the ſands of oblivion; and that I might produce a ſtream of ſufficient depth to fleet my little ſkiff, my
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:034162_0347_0FFC68805F3F7B30"/>
faculties, diligently exerciſed, have been almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly employed. Mankind have generally furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my reſervoir; and I have ſet in the circles which I frequent, induſtriouſly improving a hint, marking the ſentiment of worth, catching every unwrought gem, and eagerly availing myſelf of thoſe circumſtances, which I conceived I might <hi>honeſtly</hi> appropriate. Names I have been careful to conceal; and ſtudiouſly embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing events, and qualifying them to convey amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, information, or even inſtruction, I have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them as candidates for the attention of a vacant moment. Thus occupied, it will ceaſe to be matter of ſurpriſe, that I have treaſured even the <hi>whiſpers</hi> of converſation; my ear is conſtantly on duty, and it hath proved to me a truly faithful ſcout. Collected in myſelf, I am often regarded as a mute in ſociety; but I am careful to hoard every remark, and bearing the multifarious burden to my working hive, it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goeth a chymical proceſs; and, after receiving in my pericranium the deſtined form, it is with all due hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility ſubmitted to public obſervation.</p>
                     <p>Thus Eugenio, if he will give his candour full play, may perceive, that without being the favourite confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dante, "<hi>of all the young, handſome married women of my acquaintance,</hi>" I may, <hi>the loquacity of the ſex conſidered,</hi> legally become poſſeſſed of <hi>ſecrets,</hi> which are <hi>whiſpered to ſelect friends,</hi> which are gathered from <hi>myſterious</hi> words, and which ſometimes reſult from thoſe <hi>expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> looks, in which the <hi>female world</hi> are ſuch proficients, and which they ſo well know <hi>when to aſſume.</hi> On the whole, while I have generally aimed at utility, I have ſtudiouſly endeavoured to avoid all occaſion of offence; but if my honeſt intentions have not been crowned with ſucceſs, as it is impoſſible to recal the paſt, I can only aſſure Eugenio, and every reader of his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I will be indefatigably induſtrious to render my future numbers leſs exceptionable.</p>

                     <p>"TAKE away this child," ſaid the late benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Dr. Cooper, while ſeated with the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Dr. Franklin, in a little retired breakfaſting parlour—<q>Take away this child—her queſtions inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt our converſation, and are an impertinent intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the enjoyments of an hour, devoted to an entertainment of the higheſt kind.</q> "Nay, nay," cried the philoſopher—<q>let her ſtay, let her ſtay; ſhe is a ſtranger in our world, and ſhe has a right to make her inquiries relative to the manners and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the people, among whom, the probability is, ſhe has many years to ſojourn.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Men and women are too haughty, and form too ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated conceptions of the diſtance between them and the little race of mortals who are, <hi>for a ſeaſon,</hi> their dependants. There is a freedom of acceſs, and a chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized familiarity, which is very compatible with a due ſpirit of government; but <hi>mild dignity</hi> is an aſſociation too little known, and too rarely exemplified in the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent order of things.</p>
                     <p>The truſt repoſed in parents and preceptors, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed important; the character of the riſing generation
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034162_0352_0FFC6B2B61D88D00"/>
is in their gift, and the peace or anarchy of ſociety muſt reſult from them. When we conſider how few parents are endowed by nature, or qualified by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, for the judicious as diſcharge of duties ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, we are almoſt ready to give our voice in favour of that plan, which, in a certain celebrated communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, placed their youth under the tutelage of the State, commiting their education to perſons deliberately cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and properly qualified for their high office. Yet, againſt this arrangement, the authority derived from the Father of the univerſe, forcibly pleads! The feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the parent indignantly revolt; and my right to direct my own child, is, in my own eſtimation, unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable. Well then, there remains but one remedy—Let the cultivation of the minds of the man and woman, in miniature, be of that deſcription which will, in future, enable them to aſſume with advantage, the guardianſhip of their deſcendants.</p>
                     <p>Much, in this momentous department, depends on <hi>female adminiſtration;</hi> and the mother, or the woman to whom ſhe may delegate her office, will imprint on the opening mind, characters, ideas and concluſions, which time, in all its variety of viciſſitudes, will never be able to eraſe.</p>
                     <p>Surely then, it is politic to beſtow upon the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of girls the moſt exact attention: Let them be able to converſe correctly and elegantly, (in their native ſtrains) with the children they may uſher into being; and, ſince the pronunciation is beſt fixed in the early part of life, let them be qualified to give the little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients a pleaſing impreſſion of the French language; nor, it is conceived, ought it to be conſidered as <hi>unſexual,</hi> if they were capacitated to render the rudiments of the Latin tongue familiar. An acquaintance with hiſtory would capacitate mothers to ſelect their nurſery tales from thoſe tranſactions which have actually taken place upon our globe, and thus uſeful knowledge would ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſede fairy legendary witches, and hob-goblins. Geography alſo might be introduced, and the little prattlers, by information that the great globe whereon
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:034162_0353_0FFC6B28F41EC600"/>
they move, has received the form of that orange which ſo pleaſingly regales their palate, would, ere they were aware, be uſhered to the avenues of inſtruction. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronomy too may lend its aid; the blazing fire may repreſent the ſun, and the little bird revolving to its flame, on which they ſo impatiently wait to feaſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the direction of the well informed and judicious tutoreſs, may gradually account for light and heat, the grateful viciſſitudes of night and day, with the alternate ſucceſſion of the ſeaſons; and thus would the taſk of the future preceptor be rendered eaſy, a thirſt for knowledge created, and the threſhold of wiſdom ſtrewed with flowers.</p>
                     <p>But children commonly paſs from the hands of their parents to that of their tutors at a very early period; and was I inveſted with the powers of legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or was the gift of conferring honours mine, there is no order of citizens which I would ſo liberally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and raiſe to ſuch diſtinction, as thoſe individuals who devote themſelves to the education of youth. But then they ſhould be perſons unqueſtionably qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified for their office, and entitled beyond all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy to the approbation of their country. Arduous is the undertaking—the firſt abilities are requiſite—and it is impoſſible to rate too high the worth of thoſe who are thus ſuitably accompliſhed. Permit me, reader, to ſketch the outlines of the character of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor whom I ſhould delight to honour. Imagination this moment preſents him—he blends exquiſite ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility with uniform patience—he is remarkably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during—never haſty or impetuous—calmly deliberate in all his movements—carefully inveſtigating, nor ever inflicting puniſhments, but ſuch as both in <hi>quantity</hi> and <hi>quality</hi> are righteouſly due. <hi>He poſſeſſeth extenſive knowledge of the ſcience</hi> or <hi>ſciences which he teaches</hi>—he is free from every external blemiſh, and remarkable for no unfortunate ſingularity—his manners are elegant, and in the beſt ſenſe of the word deſcriptive of the gentleman. He is celebrated for benevolence—he is an indiſputable philanthropiſt—he poſſeſſeth the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034162_0354_0FFC6B276D95C8D8"/>
ſecret of aſſimilating dignity and condeſcenſion—his inborn integrity is undoubted, and he is maſter of ſufficient addreſs to obtain an entire aſcendency over the minds of his pupils—a ſtranger to prejudice, he is, ſtrictly ſpeaking, impartial—and, to ſay all in one word, he embodies every virtue of which humanity is ſuſceptible: Nor is the ſketch too highly wrought, for it is aſſuredly true, that to accommodate the mind to the various diſpoſitions to be found in a large ſchool, and ſo to underſtand the intellectual arrangement of each individual as to be capable of rendering him the important ſervices, which are neceſſary, muſt indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably require every excellence, and the utmoſt perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our nature.</p>
                     <p>The auſtere man can never be ſucceſsful; he will baniſh ſmiles from the face of that ſeaſon which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Severity will always operate upon the opening mind, like the chilling blaſts of winter upon the tender plant; it droops its blighted head, its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are rendered torpid, its ſtrength is proſtrated, and it is well, if the progreſſing principle (if I may ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs myſelf) which is at preſent latent, doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wholly extinct. Blows are the moſt eaſy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and are, perhaps for that reaſon, too often reſorted too—the <hi>caſtigation of the boy, frequently gratifies the paſſions of the maſter,</hi> and he is ſometimes vindictive and inhuman in his puniſhments. If the giving a <hi>wrong ſound to a letter, or forgetting a ſentence, is to be marked by blows—what reſource, permit me to aſk, has the Preceptor in the event of capital crimes?</hi> A man who is himſelf free from error, or, which will have the ſame effect upon his pupils, who is ſtudious to conceal his foibles from their knowledge, who is ſolicitous to attach them to his perſon, and who carefully impreſſes an idea of his own affection toward them, who labours to obtain their confidence, and makes free uſe of that <hi>noble incentive, Praiſe</hi>—ſuch a man will ſeldom, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine, find it neceſſary to have recourſe to ſeverity;

and it is inconteſtibly true, that puniſhments, <hi>eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blows,</hi> ſhould be repeated as ſeldom as poſſible; for aſſuredly, nothing can be obtained by rendering the little offender <hi>callous, familiarizing him to diſgrace, or baniſhing from his boſom the hope of unblemiſhed reputation. The firſt offences of children,</hi> whatever may be their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhould invariably be conſidered as venial; and it would be always right, if practicable, to convict them <hi>without a witneſs</hi>—we cannot be too ſolicitous to ſpare them he <hi>firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>I remember, ſome time ſince, being greatly ſhocked at receiving an account of an arrangement (which I would fain hope is ſingular) in a certain ſchool of ſome celebrity, ſituated in one of our ſea-ports not far diſtant from the metropolis. Rewards are offered, and every method taken to prove a crime—ſay, for example, a falſehood. While the child, in all the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of infantile confidence, remains unconſcious of the conſpiracy formed againſt him! Irrefragable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction is at length obtained, and the culprit is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately proclaimed throughout the ſchool—he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon the <hi>lying liſt,</hi> and takes his ſeat upon a range which produces him a proper ſubject for the ill-natured ridicule of the whole flock. Nor is this enough—his name is written in capitals with the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious term, <hi>Liar,</hi> at the end of it. The defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſentence is poſted up in ſome conſpicuous place, for the <hi>inſpection, not only of the children, but of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual who may happen to viſit the ſchool; and this mark of infamy once affixed, is not taken down as long as the aggreſſor continues a ſtudent in this ſeminary!!!</hi> My face

glows with indignation, while penning this relation. What has the little wretch to hope for under ſuch tuition; after ſuch a procedure, (labouring under the weight of a moſt opprobrious verdict, and the victim of unwarrantable ſeverity) where will he find ſpirits to purſue, with the requiſite alacrity, his appointed ſtud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies? Or how can he advantageouſly receive leſſons from the mouth of him, who has thus unmercifully bliſtered his reputation? Are not the ill effects of this arrangement both upon the <hi>ſchool in general, and the offender in particular,</hi> ſufficiently obvious? Is not undue degradation, envy, rancour, implacability, everlaſting, diſgrace, and conſequent deſpair, thus ſyſtematized, and embattled againſt that order, harmony, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, which would inevitably reſult from the adoption of a mild ſpirit of government? Gracious God!—but let me exerciſe the patience that I would recommend as the uniform companion and boſom friend of the preceptor, and of which a view of the ſituation to which the foregoing diſcipline, or, more properly ſpeaking, infamous tyranny, muſt reduce the offending ſtudent, had well near deprived me—and let me, with all due deference <hi>to the general merit,</hi> and <hi>ſuperior abilities</hi> of the gentleman, who will feel himſelf intereſted in this repreſentation, calmly aſk, would it not be more judicious to aim at acting the part of an <hi>inviſible ſpy,</hi> continuing a ſilent obſerver of every action until the tranſgreſſion <hi>is evident</hi> or <hi>ſtrongly ſuſpected,</hi> and even then would it not be well to follow the offender by <hi>private admonitions</hi>—to addreſs his reaſon; to enliſt his affections; to delineate in forcible language his error, and energetically to deſcribe the tremendous conſequences of an obſtinate adherence to guilty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits? <hi>Public ſhame, in the receſs of a private interview, might be flaſhed in his face;</hi> probably he would ſhrink from its horrors, and the <hi>hope of eſcaping ſo indelible an evil,</hi> might engage him to return to the haunts of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue—might enſure his dereliction of vice.</p>

the recovery of a beloved and notorious offender; and all who do, will not fail to applaud. It is, however, a melancholy truth, that theſe mild efforts will not always procure a reformation. But ſurely, previous to a <hi>publication of diſgrace,</hi> a conſultation of parents or guardians ſhould be obtained; and as thoſe deeply intereſted characters ought invariably to <hi>coaleſce with the preceptors in whom they confide,</hi> no important ſtep ſhould be taken, without their knowledge and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. I am aware that this precludes the idea of <hi>ſecrecy</hi> in regard to ſchool diſcipline; and I muſt confeſs, that I ſeriouſly wiſh the <hi>telling tales out of ſchool,</hi> was no longer held up as a bug-bear to children, and that the terror it has ſo long excited, was entirely aboliſhed. Rectitude ſubmitteth its adminiſtration to the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny; the more it is known, the more it is admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the arrangements of equity ſoliciteth inquiry.</p>
                     <p>The magnitude of my ſubject, bars the ſuppoſition that it can be too warmly expatiated upon. Children, I inſiſt, ſhould be brought forward with gentleneſs. The wiſe king of Iſrael was not <hi>always wiſe;</hi> and when he is found ſo <hi>petulantly</hi> exclaiming, "<hi>Spare the rod and ſpoil the child,</hi>" the probability is, that, crowded upon by the <hi>ill-regulated offspring of his illicit and multifarious amours,</hi> he had loſt that balance of equanimity, which is ſo proper to the philoſopher. The tutor ſhould nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be permitted to act the part of a deſpot; he ſhould ever be free of acceſs, and while he uniformly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a mild ſpirit of government, the pupil, under proper regulations, ſhould be permitted a ſufficient lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude of inquiry.</p>
                     <p>Every anxious parent experiences the difficulty of obtaining a preceptor, to whom he can confide the care of his children. But if the emoluments of the office were proportioned to the ſolicitude and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the undertaking, if it was more honorary, and if there were greater diſtinctions annexed thereto, an adequate number of candidates, of meritorious candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates, would preſent. Countleſs advantages would
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034162_0358_0FFC6B1EC942FCA8"/>
accrue to families, and conſequences the moſt benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, would reſult to the community at large.</p>
                     <p>The ancients, we are told, formed ſuch juſt ideas of the nature and momentous conſequences of education, as to eſteem the cultivation of the minds of their young people among their moſt dignified offices; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the firſt conſideration, poſſeſſing affluence, and obtaining general confidence, engaged in the arduous taſk, delighting to employ themſelves in ſhaping the principles, and pointing the views, of thoſe who were to ſucceed them in the great drama of life. And was not this perfectly right? The good preceptor is of courſe ennobled; and no juſt reaſon can be given why he ſhould not take rank in the higheſt grade of the community. For my own part, I again repeat, that deliberate reflection upon the nature of his duties, and the magnitude of thoſe effects which frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his regency, has conſtrained me to regard him as more conſequential, and of higher importance, than even the authority which is conſtituted ſupreme in any country; nay, further, that ſchool dame, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by adverſe circumſtances to confer the rudiments of inſtruction, and to call into action the latent ſeeds of worth, is of more value (ſuppoſing ſhe judiciouſly and faithfully performs the truſt repoſed in her) in the great ſcale of excellence, than ſhe, who, from conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of wealth or beauty, receives the adulation of gathering crowds. This is an obvious truth, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is the exertions of the tutoreſs, ſucceeded by the more extenſive operations of the preceptor, that will render eaſy the ſeat of the magiſtrate, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the neceſſity of coercive interpoſition, giving uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal order to take place, as naturally as the hours ſucceed each other, or as the bleſſings of light proceed from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rb of day. From whence is derived the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of families? Undoubtedly from a due regulation of the individuals of which they are compoſed, and particularly from a proper arrangement of the young people who conſtitute ſuch important parts thereof. From what ſource reſults the well-being of the great
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034162_0359_0FFC6B1AB75B6EB8"/>
body of the people? Indiſputably from the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, correct movements, and order of its members. And is not the due qualification of teachers, and the faithful diſcharge of the duties of their office, the broad and ſolid baſis, on which is erected the ſuperſtructure of whatſoever is neceſſary in the economy of private life, public uſefulneſs, or general celebrity? I ſay then, <hi>if theſe things are true,</hi> let us encourage by every means the <hi>worthy preceptor;</hi> let us cheriſh him as the origin of virtue; and while we diſcountenance every veſtige of tyranny, let us firmly reſolve to ſtrengthen the hands of thoſe, to whom we have <hi>deliberately</hi> confided the care of our children.</p>

Say no more, Brother Thrifty, cried I—ſay no more; I perfectly underſtand you, although it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed your illuſtration is rather far fetched; yet, truſt me, it ſhall be my endeavour in future to circumſcribe, as much as poſſible, my excurſive rambles; and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this determination I abridge a number of ſheets, that I had entitled an eſſay on education, confining myſelf to a few obſervations, which I moſt unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh may be duly conſidered.</p>
                     <p>The queſtion whether private or public education is of the moſt general utility, has agitated the minds, and employed the pens, of many ingenious writers; but the ſubject, as far as I am informed, ſtill remains prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lematical; nor ſhall I arrogantly pretend to decide where thoſe Doctors of literature ſo widely diſagree. Yet the Gleaner, without incurring the charge of temer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, may perhaps be permitted to aſk whether it would not be wiſdom to defer the choice of public or private tuition, until the diſpoſition of the child is aſcertained? The modeſt, diffident mind, may ſtand in need of all thoſe ſtimulatives that are in the gift of a large ſchool. Retiring efforts are often rouſed to action by emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that fame which a conſpicuous ſituation fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently confers, may at once allure, and give a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to ambition. There are minds, peculiarly attu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to all the ſenſibilities, which are at once the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ornament, and the ſource of thoſe gentler virtues that connect, that meliorate, and that actuate beings who combine, and who are formed to cultivate the endearing charities, the elegancies, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of ſocial life. To accommodate an intellect of this deſcription to the multifarious and frequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant ſcenes that are to be encountered in a world, where ill-judged aſperities too often wound the exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely delicate feelings of ſuſceptibility, a various and extenſive intercourſe with mankind may be neceſſary. But the boy, whoſe bold aſpiring temper precipitates him upon an undue aſſumption of importance, who ſuddenly ruſhes forward to thoſe diſtinctions, which are only proper to maturity; ſuch a boy, methinks, ſhould
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034162_0361_0FFC6B155506B0C0"/>
receive the checks of retirement; ſhould be formed to knowledge and to virtue, amid the ſhades of ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered life; care being taken to furniſh him with thoſe views, which may gradually accuſtom him to a proper eſtimation of himſelf.</p>
                     <p>My wiſhes, relative to the inſtruction of young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, compriſe every thing which can be conſidered as uſeful or ornamental; but I am eſpecially ſolicitous, that they ſhould be made <hi>critically</hi> acquainted with that language, in which they are deſtined to <hi>converſe, tranſact buſineſs,</hi> and <hi>adjuſt their pleaſurable purſuits.</hi> Some of my acquaintance have made greater profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in many branches of ſtudy, than in their mother tongue; and I know perſons who can paſs rapidly through a Latin author, who cannot eaſily trace the lineage or deſcription of the ſeveral parts of ſpeech in their native Engliſh; who cannot readily decline a noun; who heſitate with reſpect to the caſes nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, poſſeſſive, and objective; and who are at a loſs to follow the verb through number, perſon, mood, and tenſe.</p>
                     <p>Latidius ſhould be a good Latin ſcholar; he has received the honours of a univerſity; and yet it is a fact, that Latidius cannot write a billet, in which an Engliſh grammarian will not be able to point out, I had almoſt ſaid, as many errors as there are lines! Is Latidius cenſurable for this deficiency? Perhaps he is much leſs ſo than thoſe who had the direction of his education. Great care was taken to uſher him into the world, perfectly accompliſhed in every requiſite except his vernacular tongue; but, while engaged in the ſtudy of the <hi>dead languages,</hi> he was never taught a due deference for, or proper eſtimation of, his own:</p>
                     <p>I ſhould not be ſatisfied, if my ſons and daughters did not ſpeak, read, and write Engliſh, <hi>grammatically, critically,</hi> and even <hi>elegantly.</hi> Perhaps the accurate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver may, at this moment, ſhrewdly remark—<hi>
                           <q>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be who takes upon himſelf the character of Dictator, or arrogantly aſſumes the ſeat of the Cenſor, ought to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly free from the errors which he condemns.</q>
                        </hi> This iſ
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034162_0362_0FFC6B12F388F670"/>
aſſuredly true; and, to the well-meaning and candid objector, I calmly anſwer—<hi>I have no where propoſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a model: It may be, that I am experimentally qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified to deſcant upon the diſadvantages attendant upon early inattention. For aught thou knoweſt, the Gleaner may have been doomed to the toilſome drudgery of gleaning his information, when years, diminiſhing the flexibility of the mental faculties, have rendered it difficult for them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive impreſſions;</hi> and, if I am thus circumſtanced, I may be allowed to delineate the inconveniences of, and energetically to lament a deficiency from which I ſo eſſentially ſuffer. Admitting, I ſay, this to be the caſe, I may, with the ſtricteſt propriety and the utmoſt conſiſtency, proceed to point out the ſhoals which too often impede, and frequently wholly arreſt my progreſs.</p>
                     <p>One thing is certain; for the riſing generation, the devout oriſons of my ſpirit are daily breathed. I have written <hi>primarily</hi> for my amuſement—Truth is my pole ſtar—I would contribute my mite to benefit my fellow-mortals—I have not deſigned ill—and, if I err, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entreat thoſe who confer on my pages the honour of a peruſal, to impute my errors rather to my head than to my heart.</p>
                     <p>The modern literati are generally ſufficiently liberal in the eulogies which they beſtow on the ancients; and, as <hi>imitation</hi> is commonly the offspring of <hi>admiration,</hi> is it not wonderful, they do not more frequently tread in their ſteps? Neither the Greeks nor the Romans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered themſelves with a variety of tongues; their own language always obtained a juſt <hi>pre-eminence,</hi> and never failed of engaging their earlieſt and moſt unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted application. The reſult was, natural children were qualified to converſe, and to expreſs themſelves on paper, with elegance and accuracy; they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiated, in the morning of their days, into an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with all the varieties of grammar; they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate the ſeveral parts of ſpeech; the intricacies of their language were rendered familiar to their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings; they were capable of determining its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034162_0363_0FFC6B116EBA5378"/>
and of analyzing every ſentence; they could, with the greateſt preciſion, reſolve each component word, placing it under its original head or deſcription; And hence, it is ſaid, (and the conjecture is founded in reaſon) proceeded thoſe works of <hi>educated genius,</hi> which have ſtood the teſt of time, extorting a tribute of applauſe from every ſucceeding generation.</p>
                     <p>If I miſtake not, (and upon this occaſion I do what I ſeldom do—truſt to the tenacity of my memory) there were periods, when the Romans, meaſuring the importance of their language by the dignity of their rational character, <hi>diſdained the ſtudy even of the Greek tongue.</hi> Victors are fond of impoſing their laws, their cuſtoms, and their language; and the univerſal preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of any particular mode of ſpeech, would be one ſtep toward the introduction of univerſal dominion. National attachment ſhould, therefore, dictate the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious cultivation of a national language; and it may be worthy the exertions of an enlightened legiſlature, to erect a ſtandard, to raiſe, to dignify, to perfect, and to poliſh a common tongue.</p>
                     <p>Is the ſtudent deſigned for the profeſſion of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular art or ſcience, a vernacular language muſt be the vehicle of his ideas. Gentlemen at the bar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver their harangues in their mother tongue; in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtrains they addreſs the impannelled jury, and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice frequently hangs upon their forcible, intelligent, and well conſtructed periods. The ſacred Orator ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes his liſtening audience in familiar accents. The Repreſentatives of our free, ſovereign and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent States—Senators enrobed with power—Chief Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices delivering their ſolemn charges—and our auguſt Preſident, the Patriot WASHINGTON, inveſted with all that authority which <hi>virtuous liberty</hi> can confer, with every intervening grade—are all found delivering their ſentiments, and arreſting attention, in the well known ſounds which deſignate the Engliſh tongue.</p>
                     <p>Letters are indiſputably the elements of language; and the due arrangement, and fit conſtruction of thoſe words which they compoſe, is the broad baſis on which
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034162_0364_0FFC6B0E59540DF8"/>
towers the arts and ſciences, forming, in their ſeveral orders, a ſuperſtructure replete with elegance, beauty and uſefulneſs. It is from this ſource that the orator muſt draw his materials; poets too ſubmit to its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurement; and the grave hiſtorian muſt be tried by its rules. Indeed, an early acquaintance with the nature, conſtruction and latitude of a vernacular lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, is of ſuch importance to every claſs of people, that it is wonderful there ſhould be found parents and preceptors who can preſerve their equanimity, while conſcious that thoſe committed to their charge are, in this truly eſſential part of education, almoſt totally neglected.</p>
                     <p>The train of reflections introduced by my ſubject, at this moment preſents to my mind a perſon, who is now ſuffering much from this unnatural omiſſion; and, as examples often enforce conviction more effectually than general remarks, I preſent him by way of illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration.</p>
                     <p>Leontius, born in the midſt of affluence, was nurſed in the lap of plenty; and being the only ſon of deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parents, who were generally judicious in their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements, his education was regarded as a matter of the greateſt moment. No expenſe was ſpared; and his preceptors were rewarded for their exertions not only with a liberal, but with a laviſh hand. He had hardly completed his ſixth year, when it was judged neceſſary he ſhould commence his ſtudies of the Latin tongue; and from that moment, hurried on from one ſtage of erudition to another, no portion of time was found to attend to his progreſs in that language, from which he was in a great meaſure to derive his future reſpectability. It was abſurdly ſuppoſed, (if indeed it ever obtained a place in the reflections of either pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or tutor) that Engliſh would be a matter of courſe; and thus the boy was left to form unto himſelf a ſtyle, juſt as whim or caprice might direct. For a place at a celebrated ſeminary he was early preſented a candidate; his acceptation was full and honorary—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e paſſed through the univerſity, attending the accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034162_0365_0FFC6B0B12A2B4C8"/>
routine of inſtruction, and, enriched with aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical applauſe, he received his firſt degree. Thus endowed, he made his <hi>entrée</hi> upon ſociety, better quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to figure in any walk than as an Engliſh ſcholar. Without arrogating the gift of prophecy, it was eaſy to predict an event, which was preciſely that which reaſon would have calculated. Awkward and untaught, his education had in effect produced him a ſtranger to thoſe ſcenes in which he was hourly called upon to take a part. If he aſſayed the, to him, arduous taſk of entertaining his friends with an Engliſh book, falſe pronunciation, emphaſis, and accent, were viſible in every paragraph; comma's aſſumed the diſtinction of full ſtops, while the finely turned period loſt all its beauty: Colons, ſemicolons, notes of interrogation and admiration, theſe were all promiſcuouſly huddled together; and while by one continued monotony of ſound, ideas were jumbled, and the auditory nerve diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted, it was in vain that his hearers fatigued themſelves by an expectation of the ſentiment of an author. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious accents, delicate inflexions of voice, and that animation, or energetic propriety, which is the vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of intelligence—of theſe he had no idea; he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in effect the determined foe of good reading, and he ought to have been arraigned as the murderer of ſenſe. Candour would, however, have appeared as his advocate; and ſhe might truly have ſpecified, that ſuch erroneous concluſions had obtained in his boſom, as taught him to regard every thing <hi>merely Engliſh</hi> with a ſenſation bordering upon contempt; and, ſhe would have added, that he had been unavoidably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated upon theſe concluſions, by the total ſilence of his preceptors. As a writer, too, Leontius is highly deficient; and a girl who is dependent upon her nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle for her ſupport, ſuppoſing ſhe has been properly educated, ought to bluſh if ſhe could not ſurpaſs him in the correctneſs of her epiſtolary productions.</p>
                     <p>Yet it was expected that our young gentleman would attain eminence, deſerve well of his country, and make his way to popularity among a race of beings who
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034162_0366_0FFC6B0990063BE0"/>
ſpoke, wrote, declaimed, and tranſacted their commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial concerns, altogether in Engliſh. Leontius was bred to no buſineſs; he was, as has been intimated, born to high pecuniary expectations, and it was preſumed that his natural and acquired abilities would raiſe him to diſtinction. His exterior is dignified and prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and, notwithſtanding his deficiencies as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſcholar, high ideas of his literature are entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He early wedded the diſcreet and beautiful Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietta, and ſoon became the father of a family; his parents and the friends of his youth have ſunk into the grave, and misfortunes have robbed him of that patrimony, which, in the warmth of a youthful imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination, he had calculated as exhauſtleſs.</p>
                     <p>For Leontius what now remains? Education hath unfitted him for the preceptor of his own children—he is unqualified for every thing that is <hi>ſimply Engliſh;</hi> and while nature has endowed him with abilities which might capacitate him to become the bard, the eſſayiſt, or even the hiſtorian of his country, education inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes its effectual barriers.</p>
                     <p>The want of an early and critical knowledge of a vernacular tongue, is deeply felt by a writer; an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, which might otherwiſe be advantageous and pleaſing, becomes real drudgery, and the experience of perſons thus circumſtanced, will oblige them to confeſs that it is ſomething late to begin the ſtudy of a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, after the age of adoleſcence hath paſſed away.</p>
                     <p>Neceſſity, however, hath called into action the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Leontius; ſome beautiful eſſays, with infinite labour, he hath completed; but he bluſhes at every line, leſt the critic ſhould detect him in doing violence to the ſubtleties of grammar; and each revolving day witneſſes his lamentations that he was not early taught his mother tongue.</p>
                     <p>I condemn not the extenſive ſtudies in which our youth are engaged—far from it—French, Latin, Italian, and whatever elſe the underſtanding can attain, theſe are all little enough; but while my mind continues under the dominion of reaſon, I ſhall ever contend for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034162_0367_0FFC6B07349F8EC0"/>
preference as indiſputably due to the mother tongue; and under this perſuaſion the neceſſity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating parents, guardians and preceptors of every deſcription, continually to bear in mind what country is deſtined the theatre of action to thoſe committed to their care, becomes apparent.</p>
                     <p>The Engliſh language is by inheritance ours. It is that in which we firſt breathe forth our filial grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; in thoſe ſentences which it compriſes, we mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt our family attachments—expreſs our amities—ſhape our devotional oriſons—tranſact buſineſs—form the moſt tender of all ties—addreſs an infant family—faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion the lives and manners of that family—and, final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, embody that laſt ſolemn adieu, which is to precede our exit from the preſent to a higher order of exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>The advantage of acquitting ourſelves, on theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, with propriety, muſt be obvious to every thinking mind; and the Gleaner imagines he can hardly be too importunate on a ſubject of ſuch magnitude.</p>

                           <p>AS Miſs Melworth, now Miſtreſs Hamilton, was unfortunately engaged previous to my application to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034162_0368_0FFC6B03C301E5C0"/>
you; as my plans are all under the direction of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and as I ſuppoſe you have ſome influence over her ſiſter, Miſs Clifford, if you can inſure me, that ſhe will not be ſo fooliſhly conſcientious as to hold her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf bound by a ſort of a promiſe made to the boy William, who, it appears, is now in comfortable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; and you muſt recollect, Mr. Vigillius, that you became a ſort of a ſurety for the girl; theſe are your words, which I ſhall tranſcribe juſt as they ſtand in your twenty-eighth number. "<hi>Fear not, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reader—by virtue of the patriarchal dignity which I have aſſumed, I will, upon a proper occaſion, grant unto the ſaid Serafina Clifford, a full and free abſolution from this her inconſiderate vow, which I ſhall take care to impute to the irreſiſtable influence of an impaſſioned moment.</hi>"</p>
                           <p>Now I ſay, Mr. Vigillius, if you do in reality poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs ſuch a power, and if you will abſolutely and <hi>bona fide</hi> clear Miſs Clifford, and the heirs lawfully born of her body, <hi>from all claims whatſoever, which the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iltons may, on any future emergency, find it convenient to lay to her eſtate, I will paſs over the queer manner of her birth,</hi> and the odd way in which her true father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to ſmuggle her into his family, and ſhe ſhall forthwith become my <hi>true</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> wife <hi>until death.</hi> You know, friend Vigillius, there are ſome men of not <hi>half my property,</hi> who would be more <hi>ſqueamiſh;</hi> but ſo that I do but ſecure the <hi>main chance,</hi> I will not loſe a bargain, although its inſtrument may not chance to be ſtampt with other people's ideas of legitimacy, and all that. To ſay truth, I think I cannot do better than to enter into your family; and, as you ſeem to have ſo much authority over Miſs Clifford, (and ſhe is now, by all account, the ſiſter-in-law of Mrs. Hamilton) I conſider her all one as a girl of yours; and being more and more determined to marry, I am in down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right earneſt in this buſineſs.</p>
                           <p>I have lately loſt a ſiſter, who, though ſhe was what is commonly called an old maid, was nevertheleſs a very good houſe-wife, and managed my matters <hi>to a fraction; nothing was loſt,</hi> and every <hi>penny</hi> was diſpoſed
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:034162_0369_0FFC6B011FF13F00"/>
of to the <hi>beſt</hi> advantage; and yet, Mr. Gleaner, ſhe ſtood me in no more, take one year with another, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of her board, (and, by the way, ſhe would <hi>live upon next to nothing)</hi> than <hi>fifteen pounds per year.</hi> Was I to take a houſe-keeper, who would not conſider my intereſt as her own, ſhe might <hi>waſte a great deal, and in the long run ſpend much more than a good, ſober, diſcreet wife,</hi> while I ſhould have not one of the comforts of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimony. I know, Mr. Gleaner, that you are fond of ſaving, and that you calculate theſe things; and I therefore take it for certain, that you will think with me. It is true, I have a number of other ſiſters—ay, and brothers too, for there are a pretty many of us; <hi>the Plodders are a numerous family;</hi> but what of all that? they are every mother's ſon of them married and ſettled; and, having all of them children, ſome of whom are grown up, they reckon upon me as free plunder. I can ſee by the twiſt of their features, that they have already divided my acres among them: They viſit me, it is true, very often—are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant, and all that; but I can ſee, plain enough, it is for the <hi>loaves and fiſhes,</hi> and that were it not for the <hi>legacies</hi> for which they are hunting. I ſhould ſee but very little of them. I have a thouſand reaſons, all clear as day light, by which I am aſſured they do not care <hi>three braſs farthings for me.</hi> I have lately recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered from a dangerous illneſs, and although they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine they have <hi>topped their parts</hi> very well, and that they are as <hi>ſecure as a thief in a mill,</hi> yet I could ſee, plain enough, under all their pretended grief, that they were ready to <hi>ſing for joy,</hi> when the <hi>phyſicians</hi> pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my diſorder <hi>incurable;</hi> and, moreover, I <hi>overheard their converſation when they ſuppoſed me in a delirium;</hi> and their <hi>

Serafina and myſelf have no time to loſe; and ſo if you will out of hand propoſe the matter, and let me know when I may ſee the young woman, or yourſelf, or her brother Hamilton, we will conclude the bargain with all poſſible diſpatch, before my relations <hi>get ſcent</hi> of the buſineſs; for they abſolutely grow very ſaucy, and I am determined to <hi>ſhow them ſome little Plodders, whom they little expect to ſee;</hi> and then we ſhall know who is to be reſpected, and all that. I will make Miſs Clifford a good huſband; ſhe ſhall have every thing ſhe can <hi>reaſonably deſire;</hi> and I will continue, kind and reſpected Sir, your's to ſerve, <hi>until death,</hi>

                           <p>MISS Primroſe and myſelf have <hi>wagered</hi> two five-dollar bills about dear Margaretta's new father; Miſs Primroſe thinks that you knows ſo <hi>ſupereminently</hi> well how to write about <hi>loveyers</hi> and <hi>novels,</hi> and all <hi>them there ſort of things,</hi> and that you have ſuch a little mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of pretty <hi>phantaſticks</hi> about you, that you will, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while, bring old Mrs. Melworth out of the tomb; and that, having got ſome <hi>curous</hi> Engliſh doctor to bring her to life again, ſhe will, <hi>ſome how</hi> or <hi>ſome how,</hi> come over here to <hi>this here</hi> country of America, where they will be all <hi>happified</hi> together. Now, though I <hi>thinks</hi> this would be delightful, yet, having heard my papa and Miſs Sabina ſay, that ſuch a <hi>denomong,</hi> I <hi>thinks they calls it,</hi> would be a <hi>cataſtrofe</hi> that would have too many <hi>inadmiſſibles</hi> to be <hi>admitted—thinks</hi> it cannot be—and ſo I have <hi>wagered</hi> two five-dollar bills with Miſs Primroſe, that you will, out of hand, marry Mr. Melworth to Miſs Serafina Clifford; for, <hi>ſays I,</hi> who would matter his being a few years older, when the man is ſuch a <hi>heroiſm man,</hi> as a body may ſay, and is beſides ſo <hi>ſuperexcellent;</hi> and, <hi>as I ſays,</hi> who will Miſs Serafina have, if ſhe does not have this <hi>here</hi> Mr. Melworth; for now, <hi>ſays I,</hi> that Mr. Hamilton is

proved to be her true and <hi>deeden</hi> brother, <hi>born of her own father,</hi> it is certain ſhe can never have him, even ſuppoſe dear Margaretta, <hi>which I pray may never be the caſe, ſhould do otherways than well.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now I mentions Miſs Clifford's brother, I will tell you, Mr. Gleaner, about my own brother, our Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine—Why you muſt know, that my papa ſays, <hi>how that</hi> he has almoſt broken his heart; and I am ſure for it, that he has made me cry as bad, every bit and grain, as if I had been reading a <hi>tragedy,</hi> or a <hi>novel.</hi> I will tell you how it was—why he would be gone from our houſe whole evenings together, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>e'en a moſt all night,</hi> and my papa could never get out of him where he was, or what he was about; and ſo, at laſt, he <hi>abdicated</hi> himſelf from his own home, and his <hi>natural-born father</hi> altogether, and my papa could not tell where to look for him, and we never <hi>knowed</hi> till <hi>tother</hi> day we <hi>adventitiouſly</hi> found out, that he was privately married to Molly Brazen; to whom he uſed to write love-letters and <hi>epitaphs, and thoſe ſort of poetricks,</hi> directing them every one to Miſs <hi>Clarinda Paragon,</hi> and ſigning himſelf her <hi>everlaſting adorer, Valentine Lovelong</hi>—for my part, <hi>I thinks</hi> it is a <hi>burning ſhame,</hi> that he ſhould bring ſuch an <hi>indeliating</hi> diſgrace upon names which is ſo <hi>monſtrouſly fine.</hi> My papa ſays <hi>as how</hi> that it is all owing to your <hi>hiſtorettas</hi> and your <hi>commedies,</hi> and your <hi>plays;</hi> but I wont believe it; I knows its no ſuch thing, and it makes me cry, out of pure vexation, to hear <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>demeanours,</hi> and all theſe <hi>gentilities and handſomeneſſes,</hi> which are taken out of <hi>theſe here</hi> kind of books, ſpoken of in ſo <hi>metrepoſterous</hi> and ſo <hi>abſorbed</hi> a manner. I knows bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Mr. Gleaner, I knows that Molly Brazen is a very bad girl; ſhe is not—God forgive her—<hi>one morſel better than ſhe ſhould be;</hi> and ſhe would have had my brother, if ſhe could have <hi>cotch him,</hi> though he had never look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a book in the <hi>univerſal world.</hi> I <hi>knows</hi> too that I have read all the books that I could poſſibly get, and a <hi>great, great</hi> many they have been, more, two to one, than our Valentine ever heard of in his born days,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034162_0372_0FFC6AFA352CDAA0"/>
and yet no <hi>deſolate</hi> deceiving man, has ever come with his <hi>deceptionary</hi> tales for to <hi>traduce</hi> me. <hi>It may be,</hi> (as I am very ſure I ſhould find him out, and ſoon give him his own) that I ſhould have no <hi>objections to hear</hi> what ſuch a ſad <hi>depopulating</hi> gallant might have to ſay for himſelf; but no matter for that—this is a <hi>ſecret;</hi> for my papa would never forgive me if he knew I had ſuch a thought; but as I am reſolved that I will not date this, any more than my laſt letter, and as I ſhall ſtill ſign by my <hi>fiction</hi> name, my papa, unleſs he had to do with the <hi>black art,</hi> will never find me out.</p>
                           <p>Do then, dear Mr. Gleaner, tell Miſs Primroſe and I, whether Mr. Melworth is to have Miſs Clifford? Whether Margaretta and Serafina dreſs their waiſts as ſhort as <hi>Mrs. Modiſh,</hi> (who poſitively aſſures both me and Miſs Primroſe, ſhe makes, with her own hands, all their apparel) ſays they do? What the ladies think of <hi>naked elbows,</hi> and whether they have thrown aſide <hi>their modeſty pieces?</hi> An anſwer to theſe queſtions, will <hi>inſurmountably</hi> oblige your ever loving, and truly <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated</hi> ſervant to command,</p>

                           </opener>
                           <p>I AM willing to believe, as you ſay, that your girl was abſolutely diſpoſed of, before you received my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, making known my deſigns in regard to her; and I can tell you, old Gentleman, it is well for you that I am—yes, Sir, <hi>it is well for you that I am</hi>—for I am connected with a ſet of high-blooded blades, every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual of whom, have all reaſonable attachment to my perſon and my intereſt; and we are, moreover, bound to each other, by the moſt ſolemn engagements, to aid and abet each other, upon all occaſions, and to render to every member of our invincible community all poſſible aſſiſtance; and 'fore gad, old Square Toes,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:034162_0373_0FFC6AF69FF503D8"/>
if you had not given unequivocal demonſtration, that your Margaretta was abſolutely and <hi>bona fide</hi> ſhackled, before you was apprized of the <hi>honour I intended her,</hi> we would have made nothing of <hi>toſſing your Worſhip in a blanket,</hi> and of leaving you, after your aërial eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, handſomely ſouſed in the firſt horſe-pond in our way. I give you this information for your future government; and, as I have a new propoſal to make, I expect it will be properly influential. Do not deceive yourſelf, good Mr. Prig, with an idea, that the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxical myſteries, in which you have contrived to wrap yourſelf about, will much longer avail you; for Dick Bluſter, Tom Pompous, Ned Mettleſome, and the reſt of us, are expert at finding out the ſecret haunts of you <hi>ſly ones;</hi> and we are, moreover, whatever you may think of it, poſſeſſed of a <hi>clue to your caſtle, which will lead us directly upon the ground,</hi> and we are both able and willing to turn <hi>knight-errants, to ſtorm enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed caſtles, fight magicians, and deliver all the diſtreſſed damſels, who may be ſound within the territory of the United States.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus you are forewarned, and if you are but fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, that is, if the weapons of your warfare are not carnal, but ſpiritual; if you enliſt only under the banners of reaſon, we may adjuſt matters amicably enough. Serafina Clifford is a fine girl, by Jupiter—my intentions are honourable matrimony, and Miſs Clifford is my object; for although her <hi>birth is not quite the thing,</hi> yet ſhe is a good generous girl; and as ſhe appears to be in poſſeſſion of the <hi>ready,</hi> I very glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make a transfer of my <hi>penchant</hi> for her little meek ſiſter to her fair ſelf; and I expect ſhe will not find much difficulty in ſubſtituting as her heir apparent, a gay, handſome young fellow, inſtead of the little chap of whom ſhe has appeared ſo paſſionately fond—her huſband will very naturally ſucceed to her <hi>affections,</hi> and all her other <hi>goods</hi> and <hi>chattels;</hi> and if ſhe continues her fondneſs for the ſmiling brats, <hi>y'clepped the comforts of matrimony,</hi> I may poſſibly furniſh her with a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them, while ſhe, continuing to ſupply me with
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:034162_0374_0FFC6AF4219E0C70"/>
the <hi>ready,</hi> we ſhall thus very handſomely reciprocate obligations.</p>
                           <p>But, in the mean time, as I have already been fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh enough to inform you that my eſtate was a little embarraſſed, and as her ſage brother may not be over and above fond of the ſcrapes into which that miſerly and deſpotic old curmudgeon, Poverty, is ſo ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemanly as to lead the ſubjects of his ragged empire; he may probably think it becomes him to make a few pragmatical inquiries, and as I do not wiſh to be at odds with the brother of my ſpouſe elect, you may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Edward Hamilton, that I have a handſome eſtate in poſſeſſion; it is true, it is encumbered with a few mortgages, but the <hi>ready,</hi> which I take it for granted the young lady has in her gift, will eaſily clear off all theſe, and we ſhall then be as handſome and as faſhionable a pair, as any of the gay circles in or about town can produce. But Edward is a ſober dog—Well, hang it, ſo am I—and all this I am able and willing to demonſtrate at whatever moment, and in whatever place, you and brother Hamilton may appoint. Pleaſe to preſent my <hi>humble duty</hi> to Miſs Clifford, and aſſure her, that I am now <hi>immoveably fixed</hi>—that I am the moſt <hi>enamoured</hi> and <hi>impaſſioned of her adorers;</hi> and that I will ever continue</p>

You muſt know, that when, by the orders of our <hi>ſelf-created</hi> captain, Deborah Seafort, we <hi>crowded every ſail</hi> for the land of matrimony, as we had a <hi>gallant ſhip</hi> under foot, we fooliſhly enough hung out ever ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtreamers; and, not having taken on board a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantity of ballaſt, we ſhipped, in lieu thereof, ſuch a cargo of <hi>ſelf-conceit, affectation, prim-oſity,</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034162_0376_0FFC6AEFA6668160"/>
other femalities, as rendered us ſo <hi>crank,</hi> that we were many a time within <hi>an ame's-ace</hi> of overſetting.</p>
                           <p>But, mayhap, Mr. Gleaner, if you have never ploughed the ocean, you may not underſtand theſe ſea terms; and ſo, <hi>d'ye ſee,</hi> I will endeavour <hi>for to let my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down</hi> as much as poſſible. Why, you muſt know, that our girl Molly—for may I receive the <hi>cat-o' nine-tail upon my beam timbers,</hi> in preſence of the whole ſhip's crew, if I ever call her Mary, or Maria, again.—I ſay, Mr. Gleaner, our girl Molly, being a good tight little huſſy, and, withal, handſomely <hi>built, rigged,</hi> and, though I ſay it that ſhould not ſay it, <hi>properly ſound,</hi> was judged a fit match for any <hi>ſea-boat</hi> whatever. I did not, as I have hinted above, like her manner of ſailing, or the way which ſhe made. Frequently has ſhe flung out <hi>falſe colours,</hi> and after bringing to her lure many a <hi>gallant ſail,</hi> ſhe has <hi>up jibb,</hi> and borne away, quite in another direction. This I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced daſtardly, and have thought fit to enter my proteſt; but I have been charged with fomenting a mutiny, and <hi>belayed</hi> faſt in the cabin, or the ſhip's hold, as a meddling, dangerous and officious fellow. You will underſtand, that I ſpeak by way of metaphor, ſimile, or the like of that. It is in vain that I have, upon theſe occaſions, run over a whole catalogue of ſea oaths, that has frightened many a Jack Tar into obedience. The women, as they ſay, have got harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, and they do not value them a <hi>rope's end!</hi> Deborah was above conſulting her compaſs, and I have looked every moment when we ſhould <hi>ſplit to pieces.</hi> At length they have ſprung a maſt, and, entirely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their <hi>chart,</hi> and not knowing which way to <hi>wear the ſhip,</hi> and being brought to their wit's end, they have condeſcended to place me at <hi>the helm.</hi> But, Mr. Gleaner, this being a kind of navigation at which I am not expert, I am much in the ſame ſituation of your land-lubbers, who find themſelves at ſea in a ſtorm; and I am, as it were, obliged to bend my courſe to the <hi>harbour of your experience:</hi> You have erected a <hi>beacon,</hi> and if you can but <hi>warp us out</hi> of the preſent
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:034162_0377_0FFC6AEE232F2808"/>
difficult ſtrait, in which we are <hi>becalmed,</hi> you ſhall be our <hi>land mark</hi> in future.</p>
                           <p>It goes to the heart of me, Mr. Gleaner, to ſee our Molly opening the ſluices of her eye-pumps, and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth ſuch a torrent of ſalt-water ſorrow. You muſt know, Sir, that after ſhe had kept <hi>at bay ever ſo many pickeroons,</hi> ſhe was at laſt brought to, by a ſmart, well-built <hi>brigantine,</hi> who ſeemed to underſtand every point of the compaſs, who was wonderfully <hi>trim,</hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhed out to the beſt advantage. Molly, knowing how to calculate her own force, would not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſtrike,</hi> and, to ſay truth, our ſpark rather played <hi>faſt</hi> and <hi>looſe,</hi> as the ſaying is—not chooſing to come to an open parley. Howſomever, he contrived, <hi>d'ye ſee,</hi> to be conſtantly in <hi>the girl's wake;</hi> if ever ſhe hoiſted ſail, he was ſure to follow, and like the old Roman Mark Anthony, who we read of at ſchool—who, by the bye, was as little of a <hi>ſailor</hi> as a <hi>ſoldier</hi>—he ſeemed to think the <hi>world well loſt for our Cleopatra.</hi> Well, but after Molly had ſtood out <hi>many glaſſes,</hi> Deborah, who is as <hi>yare</hi> as any old ſea-boat need to be, having the watch, and having, as ſhe ſaid, thoroughly overhauled the <hi>lifts</hi> and the <hi>braces, the clew-lines</hi> and ſhe <hi>buntlines;</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>top't her yards,</hi> and d'ye ſee, got every thing in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineſs, thought proper to heave out a <hi>white flag,</hi> by way of concluding upon terms of capitulation. But no ſooner had we begun to <hi>veer</hi> out our <hi>faſts.</hi> than, zounds, Mr. Gleaner—for, d'ye ſee, it is enough to make the beſt miniſter in the United States ſwear—if the cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly, raſcally pickeroon, did not <hi>ſlip his cable,</hi> and ſheer off, when, hoiſting every ſail, he was nearly out of ſight before we knew he had <hi>weighed anchor.</hi> We immediately called a council, when, according to our <hi>reckoning,</hi> the ſhip had ſailed too many <hi>knots</hi> for a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit; and, moreover, our fair weather ſpark had ſo <hi>managed</hi> his <hi>tack,</hi> as to put it out of our power to <hi>libel the ſhip;</hi> and, over and above all this, it is deemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all rule, to <hi>give chace</hi> in this kind of navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>

Well, here then we are—and faith and troth, all in the dumps—Deborah is conſtantly <hi>ſnivelling</hi>—I can ſcarcely keep above water; and poor Molly, like a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled weather-beaten yacht, is laid up.

                           </opener>
                           <p>IT is juſt two years and four months, this day, ſince I had the preſumption to addreſs you before. I have ſeen with pleaſure the gradual progreſs of your Margaretta; ſhe ſeems to poſſeſs every ſexual virtue, while her attainments render her in every view ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior. A ſuperſtructure ſo rare, however excellent the materials, could not have been accompliſhed without the ſuperintendence of uncommon abilities. The lot of the lovely orphan has been highly diſtinguiſhed; and may ſhe, as far as humanity will permit, be happily exempted from every future evil.</p>
                           <p>Yeſterday my girl completed her twelfth year, and while every moment grows more and more intereſting, my mind is ſtruggling under the preſſure of a thouſand anxieties. Sophia Aimwell—tears ſtream from my eyes while I make the confeſſion—is not exactly what I could wiſh! It is true her gentle boſom harbours no
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:034162_0379_0FFC6AE8BAFE0918"/>
particularly alarming propenſities, and, that nature has endowed her with a good underſtanding, is alſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but notwithſtanding the variety of expedients to which I have had recourſe, I have never yet been able to impreſs upon her mind, the neceſſity of <hi>appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> She ſeems unalterably oppoſed to <hi>uniformity;</hi> nor doth ſhe ever, by her own choice, purſue either her book, her needle, or her pen, or even thoſe lighter matters to which her attention is required, with the <hi>regularity</hi> which is, I have conceived, abſolutely <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> to any <hi>conſiderable proficiency.</hi> My wiſh has been to produce her in ſociety an accompliſhed female; but, alas! the execution of our plans remain not with us. Sophia is particularly averſe to reading and writing; novels have not yet come under her obſervation. I have thought it too early to entruſt thoſe faſcinating volumes to her inſpection. It appears, Sir, that you do not altogether approve of novels, although, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the impoſition of neceſſity, you have put them into the hand of your daughter. Pray, Sir, did you not exerciſe diſcrimination in this reſpect, or was Miſs Melworth indulged with the free uſe of thoſe books? Is it not poſſible to <hi>create, by habit,</hi> a taſte for reading, where, unhappily, it is not inherent?</p>
                           <p>If it is conſiſtent with your plans, you would do me a particular favour, if you would furniſh me with cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies of a few of thoſe letters, juſt by way of ſpecimen, which paſſed between Mrs. Vigillius, and her amiable charge, by the poſt that was eſtabliſhed between their reſpective chambers; and, any hint of direction which you may condeſcend to favour me with, will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with much gratitude.</p>
                           <p>Sophia has never appeared ſo deeply intereſted in any thing, as in the ſtory of your Margaretta; and a word from the Gleaner, will go farther than volumes written by any other pen. I am, worthy Sir, with high eſteem, your conſtant reader, and ſincere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer,</p>

                     <p>THE picture which Mr. Plodder has given of his ſituation, is truly pitiable; and I am ſo far from regarding it as a <hi>caricature,</hi> that I am induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve its moſt prominent features will generally ſtand confeſſed, in the life of thoſe, who live and die bach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elors. I, however, once knew a happy exception to this concluſion, who, I confidently conclude, has now taken his ſtation in a higher ſtate of being. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of time was marked by the <hi>orphan</hi> and the <hi>widow,</hi> with the deepeſt regret—ſighs and tears were a tribute which his virtues neceſſarily drew forth, and his memory is embalmed by the richeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes which gratitude can beſtow. But the dwelling of this ſingular character was not a <hi>dreary ſolitude;</hi> it was <hi>irradiated</hi> by the <hi>ſmiles of infancy;</hi> and while the ſons and daughters of penury, of every deſcription, ſhared his bounty, the numerous offspring of a wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owed ſiſter, with their truly amiable mother, who was endeared to him, as well by kindred virtues, as by conſanguinity, graced his board, became unto him as the children of his youth, and not only threw into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thoſe paternal feelings which were inherent in his boſom, but furniſhed alſo an ample field for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:034162_0381_0FFC6AE4A6F144D0"/>
of thoſe uncommon abilities, which were largely drawn out in the courſe of their education. All who knew John Parker, eſquire—generally diſtinguiſhed by the name of Sheriff Parker—of Portſmouth, in the State of New-Hampſhire, will readily acknowledge, that the voice of panegyric can hardly ſwell too high a note, when ſounding the praiſes of this great and good man, who lived and died a bachelor.</p>
                     <p>But it is true, nevertheleſs, that the life of a bachel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or is almoſt invariably gloomy, or thinly ſtrewed with rational pleaſure. My friend Oſwald may ſerve as an epitome of this claſs of men; he was bred a lawyer, and his youth paſſed in literary application; he either regarded <hi>la belle paſſion</hi> as below that dignity of character at which he aimed, or his moments of leiſure were not ſufficient to thoſe attentions which its refinements require. Years rolled on, and ſucceeding ſeaſons ſtill found him buſily engaged in ſcientific pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, until he attained the ſober age of ſixty, without having made a <hi>ſingle attachment</hi> which could <hi>intereſt the heart,</hi> or forcibly engage the tender affections. The claſſics were enchanting; they ſtill continued the faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating companions of his ſtudious hours; and, although highly ſocial by nature, his <hi>ruling</hi> propenſities ſeem to have been, for a courſe of years, ſtrangely <hi>over-ruled</hi>—but when once they were ſet afloat by reflection, he was rouſed to a melancholy view of his ſituation, and could not forbear regarding himſelf, in a very eſſential ſenſe, <hi>alone in the univerſe.</hi> The guides of his youth, thoſe perſons whom he had been accuſtomed to revere, were moſtly removed out of time, and the companions of his juvenile years were, to a man, "<hi>doubled in wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock and multiplied in children.</hi>" Oſwald was ſolicited to paſs a month at the villa of Myrtilus, who had been his claſs-mate; he obeyed the ſummons, and he found the manſion of his friend the ſeat of domeſtic happineſs.</p>
                     <p>During a period of twenty-five years, the life of Myrtilus had been ameliorated by the ſympathies, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected ſentiments, endearing tenderneſs, and faithful attachment, of a lovely and elegant woman; a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:034162_0382_0FFC6AE263BDE700"/>
and beautifully promiſing family of ſons and daughters ſeemed to emulate each other in their filial attentions; eagerly they watched every turn in his countenance, and while their animated features were impreſſed by glowing and duteous affection, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to anticipate his wiſhes, and were on the wing to fulfil his commands. Thomſon's family piece was ſtrikingly exemplified; the union of Myrtilus and his charming wife was cemented by ſacred love; the holy prieſt had witneſſed their plighted faith; and, enriched by his pious benediction, their mutual tenderneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the righteous ſanction. "<hi>The world, its pomp, its pleaſures and its nonſenſe,</hi>" were to them compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively of ſmall eſtimation; poſſeſſing in each other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they accounted tranſcendantly excellent, <q>
                           <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing than beauty dearer, both in the mind, and mind illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined face—truth, goodneſs, honour, harmony and love.</hi>

                           <hi>by degrees thoſe human bloſſoms blew, while each ſucceeding day, ſoft as it rolled, evinced ſome new charm, the father's luſtre, and the mother's bloom</hi>
                        </q>—the ſkilful hand of kind aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care, had formed their opening minds; <q>
                           <hi>to rear the tender thought, to teach the young idea how to ſhoot. To pour the freſh inſtruction o'er the mind—to breathe the enlivening ſpirit, and to fix the generous purpoſe in the glowing breaſt.</hi>
                        </q> This had been, of theſe bleſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the "<hi>delightful taſk.</hi>" Perhaps they would have found it difficult to embody, by language, the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their enraptured boſoms, when, glancing round upon their little family, <q>
                           <hi>Nothing ſtruck their eye but ſights of bliſs—All various nature preſſing on the heart: An elegant ſufficiency, content, retirement, rural quiet, friendſhip, books. Eaſe and alternate labour, uſeful life, progreſſive virtue, and approving Heaven;</hi>
                        </q> and perhaps, on ſuch occaſions, the tear of luxury which ſtrayed adown their checks, was the moſt expreſſive teſtimony they could give of their ineffably exquiſite feelings.</p>

to his view, combined to furniſh a moſt <hi>humiliating compariſon;</hi> and ſpontaneouſly he exclaimed—<q>
                           <hi>Theſe are the matchleſs joys of virtuous love; and thus their moments fly. The ſeaſons thus, as ceaſeleſs round a jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring world they roll, ſtill find them happy; and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spring ſheds her own roſy garland o'er their heads: Till evening comes at laſt, ſerene and mild; when, after the long vernal day of life, enamoured more, as more remembrance ſwells with many a proof of recollected love—together down they ſink in ſocial ſleep; together freed, their gentle ſpirits fly to ſcenes where love and bliſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal reign.</hi>
                        </q> What an enchanting view! how beautiful, and how highly finiſhed! Did poet ever pen ſuperior lines?</p>
                     <p>Our bachelor heaved a ſigh—a contraſt ſo glaring was forcibly felt. "No young props," ſaid he, <q>lift their green heads for my ſupport; not an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual of the riſing generation is bound to me by the ſilken bands of attachment, and this is a conſequence of the arrangements of nature and of juſtice; for no mode of reaſoning will inveſt me with a title to the fervours of that mind, which I have not particularly contributed to form, and in whoſe flexile dawn I have not been ſolicitous to obtain an intereſt. No deſerving female honours me with her diſtinguiſhing regards—no gentle boſom ſwells for me the ſigh of affection. I have not ſought to lay the foundation of happineſs; and it is in vain that I look for the ſuperſtructure of enjoyment. I have lived in vain, alas! for me <hi>it is now too late to form advantageous connexions, or to enter into engagements which ſhould be the growth of many ripening ſuns.</hi> When I expire, my name will be extinct, and all remembrance of me will ceaſe from the earth!!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our comfortleſs old gentleman was perfectly right in his concluſions; and we would adviſe friend Plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take the hint—ſhould any mercenary female, caught by the lure of that eſtabliſhment in his gift, caſt her lot with him, we are apprehenſive his chance for happineſs will be ſmall. It is too late in life for
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:034162_0384_0FFC6ADED08AE8B8"/>
him to begin that career, which ſhould at leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence in the meridian of our days; and, beſides, we think his motive for wiſhing to become a married man, is rather invidious. Revenge is rarely ever the parent of that tenderneſs, which is ſo indiſpenſably requiſite in a matrimonial connexion. We think he may have judged erroneouſly of his kindred; it will be ſtrange if in a family ſo numerous he cannot find a worthy object; we adviſe him to make the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to cultivate thoſe attachments which nature authorizes, and to reſign, at this <hi>late period</hi> (for we have good and cogent reaſons to believe him turned of <hi>ſixty</hi> inſtead of <hi>fifty</hi>) all pretenſions to wedlock.</p>
                     <p>But however Mr. Plodder may determine, it cannot affect Serafina. The name of Clifford is now abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that of Seymour; and the accompliſhed maiden, who wore it with tranſcendent honour, has added one more to the liſt of thoſe matrons, who give dignity to, and beſtow the brighteſt ornament upon humanity. I will own that ſome months have elapſed ſince the receipt of Mr. Plodder's letter; and, farther, that the marriage of Miſs Clifford was not then ſolemnized; but as I was apprized of her engagements to a <hi>worthy</hi> man, and as neither his epiſtle, nor that of the facetious Mr. Bellamour, contained any thing which was conſidered of ſufficient importance to <hi>ſtop proceedings,</hi> I did not think it abſolutely neceſſary to derange my plans, by an earlier attention to their letters. Uninfluenced and undiſmayed by the threats of Mr. Bellamour, I might have contented myſelf with ſimply announcing the marriage of Miſs Clifford; but feeling a degree of compaſſion for Mr. Plodder, and ſincerely wiſhing ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery man and woman judiciouſly diſpoſed of in holy wedlock, before they have fully completed their thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The reader will have the goodneſs to recollect the important advantages which Edward Hamilton re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, during his ſouthern tour, from a friend, reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the State of South-Carolina; he will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alſo, the ſubſequent embarraſſments of that friend, and that circumſtances induced a belief that the ſtate of bankruptcy, into which the generous Seymour was precipitated, if not <hi>procured,</hi> was at <hi>leaſt accelerated</hi> by his efforts in favour of Edward Hamilton. Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude can never take root in a noble mind; it could therefore find no place, either in the boſom of Mr. Hamilton, or that of the father of his Margaretta.</p>
                     <p>The abilities of Mr. Melworth were, on this occaſion, commenſurate with his wiſhes; and, after devoting a few days to paternal claims, and making ample pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the complete adjuſtment of Hamilton's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he haſted upon the broadly philanthropic wings of benevolence, to South-Carolina. His dignified mein, conſpicuous merit, and letters of addreſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him a free acceſs to the creditors of Mr. Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and, with that diſpatch which evinced the thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough accomptant, their ſeveral claims were examined, and a fund appropriated fully adequate to the reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſement of every juſt debt, while the unfortunate debtor, unconſcious of the ſteps taking in his favour, wore away his melancholy hours immured within the walls of a priſon.</p>
                     <p>The misfortunes of Seymour were not the reſult of miſconduct; if there was a fault in his arrangements, the <hi>principle</hi> which produced it, conferred thereon a luſtre which gave it, both in <hi>appearance</hi> and <hi>effect,</hi> the rich colouring of the moſt ſplendid virtue. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but he who ſuffers by his extenſive benevolence, and his commiſeration for the unhappy, muſt carry with him his <hi>credentials of ſuperior worth</hi>—muſt exhibit unequivocal teſtimonies of the juſtice of his title to <hi>admiration.</hi> It is true that the injunction to be <hi>juſt</hi> before we are <hi>generous,</hi> is worthy of obſervation; but if I endow a fellow creature with the means of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a competency to-day, and to-morrow the ſhip in
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:034162_0386_0FFC6AD4F8E15338"/>
which was contained my remaining property, is, by a ſtroke of Providence, whelmed beneath the waves, I do not ſee that I am <hi>greatly cenſurable</hi> becauſe I did not, in the dread of this evil, withhold the ſolace which it was <hi>yeſterday in my power to give.</hi> Mr. Seymour was of that claſs of men who never ſhut their ears againſt a tale of woe, and by conſequence he could not lay up to himſelf much treaſure; and when his ſhips of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize were either wrecked or captured, he had no means of ſatisfying thoſe rapacious creditors, who, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated upon by principles the reverſe of thoſe which actuated his boſom, purſued him with unrelenting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity.</p>
                     <p>It was not until Mr. Melworth had procured a reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular courſe of proceedings; until every thing was in train; legal documents obtained, and the formalities neceſſary to his liberation completely adjuſted, that he waited upon Mr. Seymour in his confinement; and he introduced himſelf to the then, (in his own eſtimation) unfortunate man, by words to this effect:—</p>
                     <p>"My name, Sir, is Charles Melworth. I am no ſtranger to the feelings of the unhappy. I am perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with the hiſtory of your rectitude, of your misfortunes, and of your generous munificence. But, Sir, you muſt not expect to contribute ſo nobly to the neceſſities of an Edward Hamilton, and to exerciſe toward that young man ſuch unexampled forbearance with impunity: <hi>The day of retribution is at length ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived; the ſon of Charles Melworth, the huſband of his Margaretta, muſt not ſubmit to unreturnable obligations. Here, Sir, is your diſcharge in full; you are, from this moment, exonerated from a preſſure, which muſt have been truly irkſome to a mind like your's; and you receive this exoneration as a debt, which is your incontrovertible due.</hi> At liberty to purſue your own wiſhes, you will, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, be expeditious in departing from a place ſo little ſuited to your feelings and your character. <hi>But, ere you go, as we are now upon even ground, I requeſt a leaſe of your good opinion, to be continued or forfeited, as I ſhall, in future, merit.</hi>"</p>

Melworth might have proceeded uninterruptedly to a much greater length; the underſtanding of Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour underwent a kind of temporary petrifaction; aſtoniſhment abſorbed his every faculty. Melworth pauſed in vain, and it was not until he had taken a variety of methods to rouſe him to attention, that he was capable of liſtening to a regular eclairciſſement. But to ſketch his feelings, when the liberating truth firſt opened upon him, were a fruitleſs attempt; as well might I delineate to mortal view a diſembodied ſpirit, as give the form of language to thoſe exquiſite ſenſations which then pervaded the boſom of Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; he however ſtruggled not againſt the extricat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand of his nobly generous friend—his compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contained not a particle of <hi>falſe delicacy</hi>—he was conſcious that a change of circumſtances would have produced in him a ſimilarity of exertions; and his unexpected enlargement, while it confounded his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, reſtored to his numerous friends that peace which his misfortunes had chaſed from their boſoms.</p>
                     <p>His emancipation, giving him an opportunity of an accurate inveſtigation, he diſcovered many frauds by which he had been groſsly injured; theſe he expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and debts to a conſiderable amount were recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while the <hi>return</hi> of ſeveral cargoes, that had been <hi>detained by the Britiſh for adjudication,</hi> by putting him in poſſeſſion of conſiderable property, once more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furled for him the golden wings of ſucceſsful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce! Again he floated buoyant upon the ſtream of proſperity; and the expanding buds of hope obtained in his boſom primeval vigour. Hardly had he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted his twenty-eighth year, ere he had witneſſed all thoſe viciſſitudes which I have thus haſtily ſketched; and he may in truth be conſidered as an early profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in the ſchool of adverſity. That he embraced the firſt poſſible opportunity of viſiting Hamilton-Place will not be doubted; and it will readily be conceived that his arrival there was expected by his friends with uncommon impatience. Seymour was not only an accompliſhed man, but he had performed the part of a
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:034162_0388_0FFC6AD0AE0C9AD0"/>
guardian angel to Edward; and both Margaretta and Serafina regarded the moment which was to introduce them to a character whoſe virtues were unequivocal, and to whom they were eſſentially indebted among the moſt diſtinguiſhed of their lives. Margaretta ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to meet the <hi>protector of her huſband,</hi> with that chaſte and elegant freedom which the dignified mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron knows to aſſume, nor did ſhe conceive ſhe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed any rule of propriety when her ſnowy hand was extended to his manly preſſure, and her lovely cheek was modeſtly bent to his ſalute. Serafina ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted herſelf with more timidity—her manner was characteriſtic of virgin delicacy; and while Seymour preſſed her hand to his lips, "<hi>a higher bloom</hi>" ſuffuſed her animated features; and ſhe permitted thoſe civilities to which as the ſiſter of Hamilton ſhe was entitled, with ſilent complacency: Admiration and tender grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude were, however, evinced in her every geſture; and her expreſſive eye beamed thoſe unequivocal tokens of welcome which her tongue refuſed to utter.</p>
                     <p>Edward ardently wiſhed to reward the deſerving Seymour, by ſome ſignal token of his grateful affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He regarded the hand of his ſiſter as an ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable prize—too rich, in his eſtimation, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the poſſeſſion of any but his friend; and Seymour, on his part, from the moment he beheld Miſs Clifford, became the moſt impaſſioned of men. But Serafina, devoted to the family of her brother, had repeatedly declared her <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>unalterable</hi> predilection for a ſingle life. Seymour was privately advertized of this reſolution, and <hi>its motive,</hi> by Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Margaretta; and thus obtaining a <hi>ſecret clue to her affections,</hi> he made his approaches with that addreſs, which, in this age of <hi>fineſſe,</hi> ſeems to be a nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary part of the character of a finiſhed gentleman. Had he directly attacked the fortreſs, by the common methods of aſſailment, the poſſibility is, that, prepared for an event, an expectation of which might have been induced by a variety of circumſtances, ſhe would reſolutely have maintained her ground; but, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:034162_0389_0FFC6ACF28708A00"/>
covertly to undermine, he ſlowly made his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, until, gradually ſapping the foundation of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, a coalition became an event in courſe. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilton and his charming wife; the little gentleman, whom Serafina regarded as a prodigy, with the infant Margaret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta; theſe were the themes of panegyric, on which the enam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured deſigner copiouſly dwelt, during thoſe interviews that were frequently extended far beyond the limits which would have anſwered the wiſhes of common amity.</hi> The hours paſſed unheeded by; they were ſentimental and refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the heart of Serafina was deeply impreſſed; ſhe was conſcious of her ſituation, and ſhe ſecretly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed—"<hi>Yes, theſe delicious moments, ſnatched with the man who hath thus imperceptibly intereſted my beſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are productive of more highly zeſted pleaſures, than I have ever yet experienced.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Edward and Margaretta ſaw that their utmoſt wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for their lovely ſiſter was on the point of gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they felicitated themſelves on the proſpect of an eſtabliſhment for Miſs Clifford, that was every way commenſurate with her beauty and rare qualifications. They were careful not to interrupt the progreſs of a union they had ſo much at heart. <hi>Apparently uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious</hi> of the growing importance of a friend, to whom they were ſo warmly attached, not a ſingle obſervation eſcaped them; and thus was Serafina <hi>entrapped</hi> and <hi>captivated,</hi> before ſhe had received the leaſt ſuſpicion of the combination formed againſt the ſingular reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe had avowed.</p>
                     <p>Seymour is one of the moſt accompliſhed men I ever beheld; his perſon is uncommonly handſome, and wonderfully prepoſſeſſing; his manners are eaſy and dignified; his morals are unexceptionable; and, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorated in the ſchool of adverſity, he unites, in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, every requiſite which can inſure felicity to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding female. To Serafina he every moment became of ſtill more conſequence, until, imaged upon her every thought, <hi>that hour was marked by frigid inſipidity, that preſented not the man of her heart</hi>—that witneſſed not his indefatigable and tender aſſiduities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="unknown:034162_0390_0FFC6ACCCE2E3BD8"/>
It was after his return from one of thoſe little neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary abſences, which Serafina ſecretly lamented as real misfortunes, that, finding her alone, with his accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed freedom, he took a ſeat by her ſide; and, after relating a new inſtance of the benevolence of her broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he fixed his fine eyes tenderly upon her; the ready tear, at the recital of Edward's virtues, had ſtrayed unbidden from its chryſtal ſource, and was making its pearly way adown her lovely cheek, when, unable longer to reſiſt his feelings, he took her not reluctant hand, and impreſſing upon i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the <hi>ſecond kiſs of love,</hi> he ardently exclaimed—"Ah! Madam, <hi>how happy is your brother! I love you, Miſs Clifford—paſſionately love you—and every faculty of my ſoul does homage to your peerleſs perfections: Forgive, lovelieſt of women, the freedom of a declaration, which I can no longer withhold. Surely, the ſiſter of Edward Hamilton may ſtill preſerve that enviable character, and yet condeſcend to wear the title of the tender friend of Seymour. Turn not, I beſeech you, from my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent gaze—if I am reprehenſible for devoting my every thought to you, thus, on my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Serafina, overcome by a declaration which ſhe had long fervently wiſhed, had averted her face for the purpoſe of regulating thoſe tender emotions, that, riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in rebellion againſt their lovely miſtreſs, crimſoned her face, and filled her eyes with the moſt delicious tears ſhe had ever ſhed. Soon, however, reſuming her native fortitude, ſhe wiped from her checks thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious drops; and, ſmiling with more beauty than poets ever yet attributed to the dewy morn, with mild dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (having previouſly entreated the ſupplicating Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to quit his humble poſture) ſhe thus reſponded: "You are, Sir, entitled to my utmoſt frankneſs—the confidence which you repoſe in me, inveſts you with this claim. I had formed a reſolution to continue ſingle: Penetrated by the virtues of my brother, and my not leſs amiable ſiſter, I knew not that the univerſe
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:034162_0391_0FFC6AC947EB67A0"/>
produced ſimilar excellence—But you, Sir, appear to me to poſſeſs a mind fraught with thoſe perfections I have delighted to trace. To adhere to my plan, <hi>after conviction of the error which originated it,</hi> would draw upon me the accuſation of obſtinacy. True, I imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined myſelf unalterably attached to it; but why ſhould I bluſh to find—why heſitate to confeſs—<hi>that juſtice neceſſitates me to relinquiſh it</hi>—that I relinquiſh it to the virtues of a Seymour—and, that I can have no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional objection to binding, by yet added ties, merit ſo unequivocal to a family, to which I am, by affinity, gratitude, and inclination, unalienably attached? <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, Sir, this attachment, as a pledge of that, which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet ſuperior, will impreſs upon my boſom.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Serafina ceaſed to ſpeak—ſhe trembled exceſſively; and, by a kind of involuntary motion, threw her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief over her glowing face—Seymour caught her hand in extaſy—But it was not our deſign to finiſh this ſcene; and not a ſtep further will we proceed therein.</p>
                     <p>The now affianced lovers received the congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their friends, with their accuſtomed dignity of character; no unneceſſary delays were permitted; a few revolving weeks produced the bridal morn; Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour plighted his faith with Serafina at the altar. Mr. Melworth, with that delicacy and propriety, for which he is remarkable, officiated as the nuptial father of Miſs Clifford, and the venerable Urbanus <hi>received, while bending angels regiſtered, their vows.</hi> Serafina was a beautiful tranſcript of Margaretta; her dreſs was white muſlin, wrought after the ſame elegant pattern of the robe, which had been worn upon a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilar occaſion by her friend. But our party was not ſo ſelect as that which had graced Margaretta's wedding-day. Some choice ſpirits attended the relations of Mr. Seymour, from South-Carolina; and they were reſolved, as they ſaid, to make a day of it. Their boiſterous mirth, however, did not eſſentially impede the pleaſure of the ſentimentaliſt. Margaretta, aided
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:034162_0392_0FFC6AC648B9AC50"/>
by Mary, preſided; and it is unneceſſary to obſerve, that hilarity was chaſtiſed by delicacy. The evening was concluded by an elegant rural ball, and every arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment announced the ample fortune and capacious heart of the munificent Hamilton.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Seymour has erected a neat edifice in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Hamilton-Place; he has diſplayed much taſte in his buildings and his gardens; but his elegant fancy has been no where ſo conſpicuous as in a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful grove, on which he has beſtowed every embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of art and nature; and his ſeat, principally diſcriminated by this enchanting ſpot, is beſt known by the name of Seymour-Grove.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Melworth too, has tried his talents at architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and he has diſtinguiſhed the paradiſiacal retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he has completed, by the appellation of the Cottage of Amity. Thither, when we would inhale pleaſures of the pureſt and the higheſt kind, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective families collect; and if mortality is ever the abode of felicity, this manſion is, upon theſe occaſions, its reſidence.</p>
                     <p>Serafina's attachment to the family of her brother, is, if poſſible, augmented ſince her marriage, and her regards are abundantly reciprocated.</p>
                     <p>Margaretta has introduced into being her third in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, to whom ſhe has given the combined names of Mary-Auguſta. Serafina continues her predilection in favour of the little William; but Mary whiſpers me, that a few months will probably produce a new candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date for the affections of Mrs. Seymour, who will, doubtleſs, generalize, or render leſs marked, her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the children of her brother; and, in the mean time, ſhe has perfect complacence in her matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial connexion; ſhe regards her huſband as the firſt of men, and heſitates not to confeſs herſelf the happieſt of women.</p>

                     <p>HONEST Captain Seafort is in poſſeſſion of the full commiſeration of our reſpective families. The Melworths, the Hamiltons, the Seymours, with Mary, and myſelf, ſwell for him the ſigh of regret. We wiſh indeed he had taken the <hi>command of his own ſhip,</hi> and we would gladly lend our aid to furniſh the <hi>hawſer, which ſhould warp the bark into ſmooth water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we comprehend Captain Seafort, when he ſays—"<hi>frequently has ſhe flung out falſe colours, and after bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her lure many a gallant ſail, ſhe has up jibb, and borne away quite in another direction</hi>"—we cannot altogether acquit Miſs Seafort. It is true, a weak, inconſiſtent, and irregular mode of conduct in the commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſexes, from its <hi>ſuppoſed characteriſtic</hi> features, hath been hitherto tolerated, or has not excited that degree of contempt, and ſeverity of reprehenſion, in the <hi>female,</hi> as in the <hi>male</hi> world. But in this enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened period, when the ſex ſeem emerging from the clouds which have hitherto enveloped them, and the <hi>revolution of events is advancing that half of the human ſpecies, which hath hitherto been involved in the night of darkneſs, toward the irradiating ſun of ſcience,</hi> we had <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi> that women would have been contented to have reſigned their charter for abſurd and cruel trifling, and that a <hi>female coquette</hi> would have been held in as much deteſtation as a <hi>male.</hi> We allow, however,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:034162_0394_0FFC6AC25B7C8B78"/>
that <hi>old habits</hi> are not eaſily relinquiſhed; gradually the morning breaks, and we are willing to wait, until mid-day, for the meridian perfection of the ſex.</p>
                     <p>For Miſs Seafort, we hope ſhe will call into exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the heroiſm of the female character. Upon the glaſſy ſtream of tranquillity, her own efforts muſt again produce her. It is ſurely a pity to yield a <hi>coxcomb ſuch a triumph,</hi> as her continued inaction, and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly <hi>wearing away, upon the flats of apathy,</hi> would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow. She will conſider that by the "<hi>falſe colours ſhe has hung out,</hi>" ſhe has in ſome meaſure provoked the attack, that ſhe is in one view <hi>the aggreſſor</hi>—that if ſhe <hi>hath ſuffered,</hi> ſhe hath alſo <hi>inflicted ſufferings;</hi> and that although it is evident ſhe hath not merited the neglect of him for whom ſhe mourns, yet it is rare that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation is conſigned to the individual hand of him, who was originally aggrieved: The paſt, we know, cannot be recalled, and we counſel Miſs Seafort to view her accounts with the world as adjuſted, the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſtruck, and her arrearage fully paid. We rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommend it to her to <hi>begin her traverſe anew, to place her worthy father at the helm, and to hoiſt every ſail, and keep a ſteady courſe, until ſhe once more makes the harbour of rectitude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be an alleviation of her misfortunes, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the ſilly fellow, who, without ſuffering his words to inveſt her with a legal claim upon him, has barely amuſed himſelf with her eaſy credulity, would, had it ſuited his convenience to conclude with her a matrimonial bargain, have become either <hi>neglectful</hi> or <hi>domineering;</hi> the character of an idle, unprincipled, and diſſipated young fellow, is not <hi>neceſſarily</hi> ameliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by marriage; and a <hi>virtuous woman has no reſource but her tears.</hi> Miſs Seafort cannot <hi>eſteem</hi> her "<hi>fair weather ſpark.</hi>" His conduct is not calculated to give a favourable impreſſion of his mind. Let her remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that <hi>love, not grounded upon,</hi> nor <hi>invigorated by eſteem,</hi> is more evaneſcent than the ſtructures reared by the aërial illuſions of fancy. The life of a woman of <hi>ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>virtue,</hi> wedded to a man ſhe cannot <hi>eſteem,</hi>
                        <pb n="49" facs="unknown:034162_0395_0FFC6ABEF36B5098"/>
is a conſtant warfare. <hi>Alas! that the welfare of ſociety, and the laws of our country, admit no remedy for ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon an evil!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A man, thus circumſtanced, it is notorious, is in poſſeſſion of various means of diſſipating his chagrin, and of eluding the ſhafts of diſappointment—but a woman, (ſuch are the laws which <hi>propriety enact</hi>) muſt waſte her life in <hi>ſilence,</hi> and in <hi>ſolitude.</hi> Miſs Seafort may be aſſured, that firſt attachments are <hi>frequently ill-judged;</hi> that <hi>they are not indelible;</hi> and that a <hi>woman</hi> of <hi>ſpirit,</hi> if ſhe commits the <hi>conflict to reſolution,</hi> will aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly entitle herſelf to the honorary wreath of victory. <hi>The homage paid to firſt love is a pernicious idolatry.</hi> The ſentiments entertained of the <hi>durability</hi> of <hi>la belle paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> have <hi>uſurped</hi> a prevalence, which hath conſigned the hours of many an amiable female to unavailing regret. I contend that <hi>love, in a good mind, will aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly expire, if not nurtured by eſteem;</hi> nay, further, <hi>I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that it is in fact a ſhort lived paſſion,</hi> that its diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is unavoidable, its own intenſe ardours naturally procure its deſtruction; and <hi>meliorating eſteem is the Phenix which aſcends from its aſhes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How deplorable is the ſituation of that wedded pair, who are not endowed with the requiſites to inſure mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual eſteem; their conduct is neceſſarily under the daily obſervation of each other, and to the penetrating eye of keen and momently inveſtigation their minds are frequently unveiled. How careful then ſhould the ſexes be to endow themſelves with thoſe intellectual qualities, which will procure mutual confidence and mutual complacency. Let Miſs Seafort cultivate the worthy propenſities of her nature; let her either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſingle, or wed a man of a ſound underſtanding and cultivated mind, of pleaſing manners and <hi>mild integrity,</hi> and I hazard my reputation on the trial. I pronounce poſitively, that her ſituation will be <hi>much more eligible,</hi> than if ſhe had given her hand to the fop who now probably derides the aggravated anguiſh he hath originated.</p>

I will confeſs, that my reſentment is forcibly exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt an idea which hath committed ſuch devaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the peace of ſociety.

                     <p>The poor Lavinia is a melancholy inſtance of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal conſequence of an unlimited indulgence of thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities, which, under the requiſite control, frequently make the felicity, and are always the ornament of humanity. She poſſeſſed a heart, glowing with every ſentiment which is dictated by benevolence; ſhe was eminently capable of friendſhip; diſdaining ſuſpicion, her confidence in the <hi>appearances</hi> of virtue was exactly what it ſhould have been in long tried worth, and her ſuſceptibility was extreme. Born to an opulent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſhe had multiplied opportunities of gratifying the propenſities of a munificent mind, and ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by the ſons and daughters of penury as the angel of conſolation. She had loſt her father in her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, and ſhe continued the only prop of an amiable mother, of whom ſhe was the richeſt ſolace; ſhe was beautiful in her perſon, of a pleaſing underſtanding, and highly accompliſhed; her manners were a tranſcript of her mind, open and undeſigning; and a man of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would have ſuffered death, rather than have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loined the tranquillity of a boſom ſo exquiſitely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned, or betrayed the confidence repoſed in him by ſuch tranſcendent excellence. I think I have never ſeen a more amiable female than Lavinia; I recollect attending Mary and Margaretta, on a viſit made to her and her worthy mother. Margaretta was then a child—ſhe had been with us only one month; but young as ſhe was, the prepoſſeſſing Lavinia captivated her little heart.

extorted general admiration; her <hi>equal attentions</hi> to her numerous gueſts, the elegance of her move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, her ſolicitude to contribute to the pleaſures of every individual, her duteous attention to her mother, the eagerneſs with which ſhe haſtened to diveſt her of every care, while the eyes of her enraptured parent followed her with an expreſſion of extacy, which I have ſeldom ſeen equalled, and never ſurpaſſed; all this was calculated to produce the higheſt degree of approbation, and ſhe neceſſarily received the hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of every eye. At our requeſt, ſhe played and ſung, and her execution gave general ſatisfaction; dancing conſtituted a part of our entertainment, and the movements of Lavinia were attuned by harmony. Every heart congratulated the mother of ſuch a daughter; and we became aſſured that Emly-Houſe was indeed the abode of felicity.</p>
                     <p>From this ſketch it will be imagined that the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Lavinia had not been neglected; and indeed, the truth is, that her anxious and tenderly intereſted mother had ſpared, in the cultivation of her mind, neither pains nor expenſe; nor was there any defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, except in thoſe <hi>cautionary guards</hi> with which young people ſhould invariably be furniſhed, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly when their ſenſibilities are manifeſtly glowing, and their brilliant imaginations are ſketching ſcenes, which, alas! the preſent lapſed ſtate of humanity will never give them to realize. To throw a reſtraint up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the confiding innocence, the fine feelings, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous propenſities of the opening mind—<hi>to plant the germ of ſuſpicion</hi> in that ſoil which hath hitherto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced only a growth of the moſt ſweet ſcented flowers, is an act which ſeems to wear an invidious aſpect, and it is undoubtedly a painful effort; yet, ſuch is the imbecility of our nature, and ſuch, in many inſtances, its depravity, as to render it the duty of every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor, to endeavour as early as prudence will permit, or reaſon can digeſt the information, to give his pupils an accurate view of "<hi>man as he is.</hi>"</p>

It will not be doubted that the perſonal charms, fine accompliſhments, and <hi>independent fortune</hi> of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinia, produced many candidates for her favour. In fact, ſhe was ſurrounded by a little army of admirers; but although her heart refuſed to ſurrender to any of thoſe paſſionate declarations, which aſſailed her ear, (and ſhe invariably received every one who diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her by his regard, with that ingenuous frankneſs, which, upon theſe occaſions, always marks the conduct of an amiable woman) they ſtill perſiſted in their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations, affirming that her avowed preference of an individual ſhould alone conſtitute a period to their purſuit. Among the acquaintance of Lavinia, figured conſpicuouſly an accompliſhed youth, for whom her gentle boſom had long ſighed. All her ſecret wiſhes were breathed for Alphonſo, but Alphonſo had never taken rank among the number of her declared ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers. This, however, was, by the enamoured La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinia, imputed to an <hi>exceſs of del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

In thoſe rural walks, in which it was the cuſtom of Lavinia to accompany her juvenile compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, Alphonſo was ſtill by her ſide; for her the ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed berry was culled, the elegantly fancied bouquet was preſented with a modeſt and impreſſive air, and, to encircle her auburn treſſes, he enwreathed a garland of the choiceſt flowers.</p>
                     <p>He was careful to procure for her every new pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, and he would paſs whole days in reading to her thoſe volumes which he judged worthy her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>every impaſſioned ſentence</hi> he would render ſtill more glowing, never forgetting, by <hi>emphaſis</hi> and <hi>geſture,</hi> to point to the <hi>heart</hi> of Lavinia each moving ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Often did he fix his eyes, <hi>apparently beaming with love, on her glowing face; on theſe occaſions he would aſſume a tender air, ſigh deeply, place his ſpread hands upon

his heart, anon claſp them in a kind of enthuſiaſtic rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and rarely ever did he conclude this well acted farce without a tear, which he affected to conceal, and which the too credulous Lavinia never failed to impute to delicacy, ſtrength of affection, and unexampled reſpect.</hi> He was inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably her conductor to places of public reſort; and he ſeemed to regard every gentleman who offered himſelf by way of eſcort, as an invader of his prerogative.</p>
                     <p>Thus rolled on the halcyon months. Lavinia's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment every hour augmented; all her ſenſibilities were in full force; her unbounded confidence was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and her higheſt complacency enſured. Of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity ſhe had formed but a vague idea; ſhe had heard, it is true, of the exiſtence of a propenſity which ſhe eſteemed <hi>monſtrous,</hi> and it ranked in her mind, with the ſtories of giants and hobgoblins, which ſhe had received from her nurſe, in her days of childhood. To have imputed nefarious purpoſes to Alphonſo, ſhe would have regarded as a moſt cruel outrage againſt the brighteſt aſſemblage of virtues, which ever irradiated a human boſom; <hi>and to reſtrain the expanſive flights of an ardent and luxuriant fancy, ſhe had never been taught.</hi> She eſteemed—ſhe loved—and at the ſhrine of tender friendſhip, ſhe offered the moſt impaſſioned vows. The numerous friends of Alphonſo and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinia, gave them to each other; the world announced their marriage as an event which would ſpeedily take place; her profeſſed admirers, conceiving ſhe had made her election, decently withdrew their pretenſions, avowing a manly reſolution, to act, in future, "<hi>a brother's part.</hi>" Alphonſo continued to evince himſelf in every action, and in every arrangement, the moſt <hi>impaſſioned of lovers;</hi> and yet, ſtrange to tell, his tongue had never uttered a <hi>ſingle ſentence,</hi> which announced what <hi>his eyes were continually proclaiming;</hi> which amounted to the ſimple declaration—<hi>I love you.</hi> The mother of Lavinia beheld with approbation the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attachment of her beloved child—ſhe regarded Alphonſo as a man every way worthy of her daughter; and ſhe anticipated a rich harveſt of domeſtic felicity,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:034162_0400_0FFC6AB421249E80"/>
when Lavinia, wedded, ſhould augment her joys, and probably give to her embraces a blooming offspring, amid whoſe endearing careſſes ſhe ſhould breathe her laſt maternal ſigh.</p>
                     <p>At length, however, the wary matron could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to queſtion—"It is ſtrange, my dear Lavinia, that Alphonſo is not <hi>more explicit</hi>—you have received his attention with all that indulgent complacency, which is proper to a modeſt and a decent girl; he cannot doubt your approbation; what then can ſuſpend his moſt unequivocal declarations? What delays his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to your mother?" Lavinia <hi>bluſhed expreſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> but it was not, however, a <hi>bluſh of conviction.</hi> The doubt, implied in the obſervations of her mother, ſhe conceived derogatory to the <hi>immaculate honour of the man, whom ſhe deemed incapable of error;</hi> and ſhe had never before felt ſo much inclined to arraign the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and even the juſtice, of her, who, from the firſt dawn of reaſon, ſhe had regarded as a perfect model of every excellence. <q>Alphonſo, ſhe replied, is the moſt <hi>delicate of men</hi>—of his ardent love I have had <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible proofs</hi>—a thouſand times has the moſt une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal declarations trembled upon his lips; but that <hi>uncommon reſpect</hi> which inmingles with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, his tender <hi>awe of me,</hi> hath hitherto reſtrained the fervour of an avowal, which is <hi>but delayed.</hi> Ought I to regard as reprehenſible a mode of conduct, manifeſtly the reſult of his <hi>conſideration for my feelings?</hi> Alphonſo, Madam, is not to be influenced by <hi>common principles;</hi> he is affectionate, amiable, and diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted; his paſſion is <hi>ſentimental,</hi> preciſely of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription which I wiſh; and ſo eligible is my preſent ſituation, indulged, as I am, with the preſence and tender approbation of my dear mamma, and amply gratified by the full enjoyment of thoſe pleaſures, which I derive from contributing to the relief of the neceſſitous, that, provided the aſſiduities and tender friendſhip of Alphonſo is allowed me, I cannot form a higher idea of earthly felicity.</q>
                     </p>

Thus was the matron ſilenced; and ſhe the more readily acquieſced in the ſentiments of her daughter, as her upright mind could not conceive of turpitude ſo <hi>enormous,</hi> as that which muſt excite a being, <hi>deliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to perpetrate the murder of the peace of a fellow creature, without a ſingle apparent motive to ſtimulate to a deed of ſuch atrocity.</hi> She alſo knew how to eſtimate the value of her daughter; ſhe was conſcious of her exquiſite beauty, and rare accompliſhments, and ſhe was ſenſible that her fortune was amply ſufficient to gratify the moſt ambitious views; an impartial deciſion would, ſhe confidently imagined, pronounce her in every reſpect the equal of Alphonſo, and ſhe therefore gave to the winds her maternal anxieties.</p>
                     <p>In this train matters continued many weeks longer: Alphonſo contrived to extend his treacherous entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the utmoſt poſſible duration. Perceiving, however, that he had at length attenuated the thread to the very point of breaking, he thought proper ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to decamp; and having made up his mind, he announced to the family, quite in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </p>
                     <p>The mother of Lavinia now ſaw clearly the fate of her beloved child; but ſhe heſitated to make a diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, an apprehenſion of the conſequence of which, fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with immeaſureable dread! while Lavinia ſtill continued ingeniouſly reaſoning away appearances. Alphonſo was ſtill the beſt, and moſt undeſigning of men—ſhe confidently expected his ſpeedy return; nor did ſhe experience any other regret, than what his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence occaſioned, until many ſucceeding poſts paſſed without bringing her a ſingle line; then, indeed, her utmoſt tenderneſs and candour was put to the teſt, to invent apologies, or to account for a conduct ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous. Still, however, <hi>the particular days in which the poſt returned, might have ſlipped his memory; his letters might have been written; his ſervant might have delayed
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:034162_0402_0FFC6AADDCEB7140"/>
to put them in the office; the courier might have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful.</hi> In ſhort, ſtruggling to detain the deluder hope, there was ſcarce an abſurdity which ſhe would not have admitted, rather than ſuppoſe that boſom, where ſhe had treaſured up her deareſt expectations of earthly bliſs, ſhould have relinquiſhed every good. Conviction, however, could not be delayed; it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force obtained; and when ſhe learned that the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Monimia had become the object of his purſuit, ſhe could no longer doubt.</p>
                     <p>She received the information with a ſteadineſs and compoſure, which was more terrifying to her mother, than the moſt violent exclamation of grief. She ſhed no tears, nor uttered a ſingle complaint; but, folding her ſnowy arms, with a look expreſſive of the deepeſt woe, and all the aggravated anguiſh of a broken ſpirit, ſhe meekly bent her head in token of reſignation; and while evidently aſſaying to arm herſelf with fortitude, overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by the magnitude of the ſtruggle, ſhe fainted in the arms of her agonized parent! On her return to life, ſhe gave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

For a time, her lucid intervals cheriſhed the hope of a perfect reſtoration; but her ſenſibility was extreme; and, <hi>unaccuſtomed to yield the control of the paſſions to the regency of reaſon, is it wonderful that, upon an occaſion ſo cruelly calamitous, ſhe became unequal to the combat?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let the Monimia's of the female world beware, however meritorious they may be—they do not, they cannot ſurpaſs the amiable, the highly accompliſhed Lavinia; and an Alphonſo who could meditate the deſtruction of a happineſs ſo well founded, as was that of the now deſolate ſufferer, is abandoned enough to harbour the moſt atrocious purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>The glimmerings of reaſon which Lavinia diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, during the firſt weeks that ſucceeded her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, were tranſient, and more and more unfrequent; and the faint traces of recollection which ſhe evinced, produced the moſt heart affecting melancholy that
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:034162_0403_0FFC6AAC44701BC0"/>
can be imagined. She is now a confirmed maniac; and ſo total is her derangement, that ſome months have elapſed ſince ſhe has manifeſted the ſmalleſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion even to her mother. She frequently holds long ideal dialogues with Alphonſo, reſponding for him, and it is obſervable that ſhe utters the anſwers which ſhe ſhapes for him <hi>preciſely in his tone of voice.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the caprice of the time being, ſhe alternately upbraids and ſoothes him; and ſhe is, by turns, grave and gay. Now with floods of tears ſhe weeps his exit, chanting at his ſuppoſed obſequies, the funeral dirge; and anon, in an extacy of joy, ſhe felicitates herſelf on his reſtoration to virtue and to her; not a ſentiment does ſhe utter in her ſtrongeſt paroxyſms, but is chaſtiſed by delicacy, but is deſcriptive of the purity and benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of her ſoul. The ſcattered gems glitter with tranſcendent luſtre upon the dark clouds in which ſhe is enveloped; and it is hardly poſſible to conceive a more calamitous ſituation, than to be marked down the hourly witneſs of her plaintive ſorrows. Yet this taſk is aſſigned to a fond, an aged, and a widowed mother. To other hands ſhe refuſeth to relinquiſh the care of her poor unfortunate! "No mercenary hireling" ſhe exclaims, "ſhall inflict upon my gentle child, unneceſſary ſufferings. It is enough, that the bloſſoms of her youth have been thus untimely blight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is the part of her mother to ſoothe, as far as circumſtances will admit, her woe ſtricken ſpirit; and no earthly conſideration ſhall induce me to yield my melancholy charge, or quit for a ſingle hour my faultleſs mourner!" Every night her bed is prepared in the apartment of her daughter; and ſhe takes no ſuſtenance but what ſhe receives in her preſence. Alas! alas! what a heart piercing contraſt is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently exhibited, to thoſe ſcenes which ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated as unveiling to her declining life, when, in the full enjoyment of her complacent hours, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of her beloved daughter paſſed in viſion before her.</p>

Lavinia, like another Maria, is ſuffered to wander over the grounds which make a part of her paternal inheritance. Her inſanity being of the melancholy and pathetic kind, ſhe is never boiſterous or unruly; her mother, and her woman, are continually the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of her rambles; of theſe ſhe takes no other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, than barely to petition, in the moſt ſupplicating tone of voice, for any article of which ſhe happens to fancy herſelf in want: She is particularly fond of ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amid thoſe walks to which Alphonſo was attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and every tree and ſhrub is addreſſed by her in the moſt pity moving ſtrains!</p>
                     <p>When death ſhall deprive Lavinia of her guardian parent, the augmentation of her calamity will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calculable. Nor can this event be far diſtant—accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the ſad cataſtrophe of her daughter's once luminous expectations, and by her hourly ſufferings, it muſt ſoon take place. She will ſink into the grave; a diſtant branch of her family will ſucceed to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, who, very probably, regarding the deranged Lavinia as an incumbrance to the acceſſion which awaits him, will, by <hi>pretended neceſſary ſeverity,</hi> haſten the demiſe, which it will be his intereſt to procure!!!</p>
                     <p>I viſited Emly-Houſe not long ſince—great God, how changed is the aſpect of every object which preſents! The ſervants, the apartments, the ſuperb furniture, every thing ſeemed to partake the general gloom! In a remote chamber I beheld the aged mother—her head white as ſnow—on her bended knees, with ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating hands, and ſtreaming eyes, ſhe was conjuring her daughter to relinquiſh a purpoſe, which ſhe had recently declared, of putting an end to an exiſtence that (with greater manifeſtations of reaſon than ſhe had demonſtrated for a long period) ſhe affirmed was no longer to be endured.

that this <hi>ſometimes</hi> excellent modeller, at <hi>all times pertinaciouſly</hi> inſiſts upon her own whims, however ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and fantaſtical they may chance to be, and that ſhe frequently precipitates her determined votaries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt ridiculous vagaries. Margaretta and Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fina take a curſory view of her followers, and adopt only ſuch regulations as are proper and becoming; they are never fond of extremes; and hence the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den tranſitions of faſhion cannot produce them <hi>outrée figures.</hi> If a particular colour is ſaid to be the <hi>rage,</hi> and it does not happen to ſuit their complexions, they do not impoſe upon themſelves the neceſſity of wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; their ambition is, to diſplay their fine features and perſons to the beſt advantage, and this their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant wiſh in dreſs is never proſtrated to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior conſideration; they have no violent deſire to be conſidered as the <hi>ſtandards</hi> of mode, or to be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>ſummit of taſte;</hi> they have heard a favourite poet ſay, that

                        <hi>they have uncommonly fine arms:</hi> Their ſleeve, then, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending one quarter of an inch, more or leſs, below that well turned curvature <hi>y'clepped</hi> an elbow, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its graceful ſlope, the extreme edge being orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with muſlin, ſlight gauze, blond, or Bruſſels, as may ſuit the quality of the gown, or the occaſion on which it is to be worn. They have not thrown aſide <hi>their veils of modeſty</hi>—God forbid they ever ſhould—but with regard to <hi>modeſty pieces, ſo called,</hi> in all their varieties, or thoſe parapets upon parapets, behind which breaſt-work the fair intrencher ſeems to challenge the attack—as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute for all theſe, their delicate muſlin, ſimply edged with a border, varied agreeably to the elegance of their fancy, is drawn round the neck, and faſtened with a knot of ribbon behind, over which the handkerchief receives a form ſomewhat conformable to the reigning taſte. For their waiſts, as they never appeared like <hi>inverted cones, ſo their ſkirts have not yet obtained an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional half yard in length, for the purpoſe of uſurping that part of the body where the blond tucker formerly obtained a ſtation.</hi> If the ladies make up a new dreſs, they ſo far condeſcend to the then faſhion, as not to render themſelves conſpicuous for their non-conformity; and I believe this piece of accommodation makes up the ſum total of their compliance with the faſhionable world.</p>
                     <p>Thus having adjuſted, as I conceive, this <hi>important</hi> particular, I turn with pleaſurable alacrity to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal epiſtle of the truly deſerving Mrs. Aimwell. Tremblingly alive to every thing which can affect her beautiful charge, does not Mrs. Aimwell too readily admit thoſe corroding apprehenſions which undermine her peace? She confeſſeth that nature hath been liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and that the mind of her daughter is exempt from thoſe adverſe inclinations which too often, even in the boſom of childhood, become fearfully productive. Ought ſhe not then to felicitate herſelf upon the happy diſpoſition of her Sophia? I pronounce that patience and perſeverance will perfect her wiſhes. Miſs Aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well hath but recently attained her twelfth year. It is
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:034162_0408_0FFA654C1304CA28"/>
rather early to expect a love of uniformity, and a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of regularity, <hi>as a matter of choice.</hi> The ſeaſon of youth is happily marked by vivacity; and the playful candidates for more ſubſtantial good are filled with intereſting wonder at every novel ſcene that comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their obſervation. They love to walk, ſet, or ſtand, preciſely as an imagination which does not readily ſubmit to the ſober agency of reaſon, ſhall dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. The young lady in queſtion at preſent, takes rank among this little eccentric claſs of beings; but under the judicious auſpices of Mrs. Aimwell, ſhe will eventually become that accompliſhed female, who will exhibit an exact tranſcript of the model already form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the mind of her excellent mother.</p>
                     <p>Yes, indeed, I do conceive that the hand of ſkilful cultivation may implant an ardent thirſt for knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge; or, in other words, a love of reading in that mind of which it was not the original growth; nay, further, I affirm, upon the authority of experience, that the uſeful and fertile exotic will take as deep root, flouriſh as luxuriantly, and produce as plentiful a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, as in its native ſoil; and perhaps the conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this artificial taſte, is one of the <hi>moſt eligible uſes which can be made of novel reading.</hi> Curioſity in the minds of young people is generally if not always up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wing; and I have regarded curioſity, combined with neceſſity, as the grand ſtamina of almoſt every improvement. Narrative, unencumbered with dry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, and adorned with all the flowers of fiction, poſſeſſes for the new plumed fancy a moſt faſcinating charm; attention is arreſted, every faculty of the ſoul is engaged, and the pages of the intereſting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining noveliſt are almoſt devoured. Thus an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to reading is formed, and this primary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject once obtained, in that paucity of thoſe kind of writings, <hi>which the watchful parent will know how to create,</hi> the entertaining biographer will become an acceptable ſubſtitute; the tranſition to hiſtory will be in courſe; geography conſtitutes an eſſential part of hiſtory; and the annals of the heavenly bodies will ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately

be ſtudied with avidity. Pope's Homer may originate a taſte for poetry, even in the very ſoul of frigidity; and a peruſal of the beautifully diverſified and richly ornamented numbers of the Adventurer, induces a perigrination through every eſſay which has been written, from the days of their great primogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Steele and Addiſon, down to the ſimple num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the humble Gleaner. In this view, novels may be conſidered as rendering an important ſervice to ſociety; and I queſtion whether there is not leſs riſk in placing volumes of this kind in the hands of girls of <hi>ten or twelve years of age,</hi> than during that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting period which revolves from <hi>fifteen to twenty.</hi> The mind is inſtructed with much more facility, at an early age, than afterwards; and I have thought that many a complete letter writer has been produced from the ſchool of the noveliſt; and hence, poſſibly, it is, that females have acquired ſo palpable a ſuperiority over us, in this elegant and uſeful art. Novels, I think, may very properly and advantageouſly conſtitute the <hi>amuſement</hi> of a girl from <hi>eight to fourteen years of age, provided always that ſhe purſues her reading under the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious direction of her guardian friend:</hi> By the time ſhe hath completed her fourteenth year, (ſuppoſing the voice of well-judged and tender premonition has occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſounded in her ears) I am miſtaken if her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding will not have made ſuch progreſs, as to give her to riſe from the table with proper ideas of the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the repaſt; of the frivolity of thoſe ſcenes to which ſhe hath attended; of their inſufficiency, as ſources of that kind of information which is the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of truth, and of their inability to beſtow <hi>real knowledge,</hi> or thoſe ſubſtantial qualities that nerve the mind, and endow it with the fortitude ſo neceſſary in the career of life.</p>
                     <p>Under the requiſite guidance, ſhe will learn properly to appreciate the heroes and heroines of the noveliſt; repetition will create ſatiety, and ſhe will have riſen from the banquet before the conſequences of her intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ication can materially injure her future life. She will
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:034162_0410_0FFC6A9869AC5D90"/>
have drank largely, it is true, but revolving hours will give her to recover from her inebriety, and happily thoſe hours will intervene ere yet ſhe is called to act the part aſſigned her; and ſhe will have extracted every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage within the reach of poſſibility, from this line of reading, while the pernicious effects attributed thereto, can in no reſpect eſſentially hurt her.</p>
                     <p>When a torrent of novels burſts ſuddenly on a girl, who, bidding adieu to childhood, hath already entered a career, to her of ſuch vaſt importance, the evils of which they may be productive are indeed incalculable! aided by a glowing imagination, ſhe will take a deep intereſt in the faſcinating enthuſiaſm they inſpire; each gilded illuſion will paſs for a ſplendid reality; <hi>ſhe will ſigh to become the heroine of the drama; and, ſelecting her hero, it is poſſible ſhe may be precipitated into irremediable evil, before ſhe may have learned to make a juſt eſtimation of the glittering trifles, by which ſhe is thus captivated.</hi> I ſay, therefore, I would confine novels to girls from eight to fourteen years of age; and I would then lay them by, for the amuſement of thoſe vacant hours, which, in advanced years, are frequently marked by a kind of <hi>ennui,</hi> the reſult, probably, of a ſeparation from thoſe companions, with whom we have filled the more buſy ſcenes of life.</p>
                     <p>I grant that novels, under proper direction, might be made much more extenſively ſubſervient to the well being of ſociety, than, <hi>with a very few exceptions,</hi> they have ever yet been. Was not <hi>love, unconquerable, unchanging, and omnipotent, their everlaſting theme,</hi> they might abound with precepts and examples conducive to the beſt of purpoſes. This remark leads to the conſideration of the queſtion propoſed by my anxious correſpondent. <hi>In my toleration of novels, have I not exerciſed a diſcriminating power?</hi> Moſt aſſuredly I have. There is a claſs of novels, and of plays, which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me ſhould be burnt by the hands of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon executioner; and were it not that the <hi>good natured world</hi> generally takes part with the ſufferer, I could
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:034162_0411_0FFC6A96E319EA88"/>
wiſh to ſee ſtrong marks of public odium affixed upon the authors of thoſe libidinous productions.</p>
                     <p>But it is as painful to dwell upon ſubjects of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion as it is pleaſurable to hold the pen of pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric—let me haſten, therefore, to a ſelection which I have conceived indiſputably worthy of preference; and, in the firſt grade of thoſe writings, that take rank under the general deſcription of novels, and that are entitled to the higheſt notes of eulogy, I have been accuſtomed to place the hiſtory of Clariſſa Harlowe.</p>
                     <p>In my decided approbation of this admired pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, I have the ſatisfaction to reflect that I am not ſingular. My paternal grand-father, who was one of the moſt reſpectable characters of the era in which he lived, indulged, perhaps to exceſs, an invincible aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to novels. Yet, the Holy Bible and Clariſſa Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, were the books in which he accuſtomed his daughters to read alternately, during thoſe hours in which he attended to them himſelf. The Rev. James Hervey, Rector of Weſton Favell, in Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire in England, celebrated as well for an exemplary life and purity of manners, as for the elegance and piety of his literary compoſitions, in a treatiſe written upon the education of daughters, recommends Clariſſa, as a ſuitable preſent to thoſe young ladies, who are to be trained in the paths of virtue and propriety; and a <hi>late writer,</hi> has aſſerted, that Clariſſa Harlowe is the <hi>firſt human production now extant.</hi> He heſitates not to place it, for <hi>literary excellence, above the Iliad of Homer, or any other work, ancient or modern, the ſacred oracles excepted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But without taking it upon me to defend this opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. I will only ſay, that it appears to me admirably well calculated as a uſeful companion for a female, from the firſt dawn of her reaſon, to the cloſing ſcene of life. It has been ſaid that many a Lovelace has availed himſelf of plots, fabricated and developed in thoſe volumes, which would never elſe have entered his imagination—be it ſo, I only contend for the placing them in female hands; and I affirm that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:034162_0412_0FFC6A955C3154B8"/>
the beſt code of regulations, the beſt directions in every ſituation which they exemplify—in one word, the beſt model for the ſex, that I have ever yet ſeen pourtrayed. The character of Clariſſa, it has been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, is too highly wrought: but I aſk, what perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did ſhe poſſeſs that we ſhould be willing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with, in the female, who we ſhould delineate as an accompliſhed woman! Was I to advance an objection againſt a work of ſuch acknowledged merit, I would ſay that it is the character of Lovelace, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the Sinclairs, the Martins, the Hortons, and the Harlowes, of thoſe pages, which are <hi>too highly wrought.</hi> It is ſurely much more eaſy to conceive of an amiable woman, acting preciſely as did Clariſſa, than of that degree of turpitude and inexorable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, which muſt have preceded the perpetration of actions ſo black, and the manifeſtation of rigour ſo ill ſounded and unrelenting.</p>
                     <p>It has been generally imagined that Clariſſa's only deviation from ſtrict propriety, conſiſted in her flight from the protection of her father; but a moment's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection will evince the error of this concluſion—<hi>that cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e a fault to which I am compelled.</hi> Clariſſa met her betrayer with a deſign to remonſtrate, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate, but with a <hi>determined reſolution not to abandon the paternal manſion;</hi> it appears that ſhe was precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated upon that fatal ſtep, and, environed by the deep laid machination of the deceiver, her eſcape would have been miraculous, yet ſhe continued to ſtruggle, and even at the moment ſhe was hurried away, the beauteous ſufferer ſtill vehemently proteſted againſt accompanying the wretch, who was armed for her deſtruction. Clariſſa's <hi>error</hi> (<hi>if indeed, all circumſtances conſidered, ſhe was ever in any ſort reprehenſible</hi>) muſt be traced further back; it conſiſted in her <hi>correſpondence after the parental prohibition, and in her conſenting to meet the treacherous villain.</hi> Yet, when we take a view of the <hi>motives</hi> which ſtimulated her to thoſe deciſive meaſures, we can ſcarcely deem her cenſurable; and
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:034162_0413_0FFC6A93A018B0A8"/>
ſhe extorts from every boſom that kind of applauſe, which we ſpontaneouſly yield to perſecuted merit.</p>
                     <p>Love, in the boſom of Clariſſa, was always ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to virtue. It would never have taken the lead of duty; and, had ſhe been left to the free exerciſe of her fine faculties, had ſhe been permitted to call into action thoſe rare abilities of which ſhe was miſtreſs, ſhe would have <hi>completely extricated herſelf from every embarraſſment.</hi> Love, in the boſom of Clariſſa, was the <hi>nobleſt of principles;</hi> it was uniformly ſolicitous for the <hi>genuine felicity, eſtabliſhment and elevation of its object;</hi> but it would never have permitted her to have allied herſelf to a man, who could <hi>barbarouſly triumph in the deſtruction of that ſweet peace of mind, which is the boſom friend of the innocent and of the good; who could inhuman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meditate the ruin of thoſe confiding females who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to his pity and his protection.</hi> Liberated from the reſentment of her hard hearted relations, and moving in that enlarged and elevated ſphere, to which her matchleſs intellect and uncommon information en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled her, ſhe would doubtleſs have inveſtigated. The libertine would inevitably have ſtood confeſſed, and would as aſſuredly have been diſcarded from her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. In one word, love, in the boſom of Clariſſa, was what I wiſh, from my ſoul, it may become in the boſom of every female.</p>
                     <p>The deportment of Clariſſa, after Lovelace had ſo artfully betrayed her into a ſtep which her judgment invariably condemned, has been the ſubject of much cavilling; ſhe is accuſed of undue haughtineſs; but ſurely ſuch cenſurers have not well weighed either her character and ſituation, or that ambiguous mode of conduct, which the deſpoiler ſo early aſſumed. How often did he <hi>hold her ſoul in ſuſpenſe,</hi> and how neceſſary was it for his nefarious purpoſes thus to do.</p>
                     <p>But I am not now writing a criticiſm upon Clariſſa; the foregoing hints will inform Mrs. Aimwell what claſs of novels I particularly approbate; and I proceed, agreeably to her requeſt, to ſelect a few of thoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which made a part of the correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

                           <p>NO courier ever produced a letter with an air of greater importance than did our boy Plato, when, ten moments ſince, he handed me yours. Indeed he ſeems much elated with his new office; and I freely own to you, my dear girl, that I am fond of giving pleaſure even to Plato. When pleaſure reſults from duty, as in the preſent inſtance, it can hardly be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed too luxuriantly. Thoſe beings who are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſubjected to the caprice of the petty tyrants whom they ſerve, derive their exiſtence from the ſame ſource with their maſters and miſtreſſes; their deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is alſo ſimilar to ours; and, conſidering the natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al love of liberty which predominates more or leſs in every human boſom, and the pangs which muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reſult from ſervitude, it is a duty incumbent upon us to render that ſtate of ſubordination in which ſervants are providentially placed, as eaſy as poſſible. Reflection will ſuggeſt the policy of this conduct, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in every view; and as the face of things is continually changing, and it is difficult to ſay what events time may produce—our fate may, in future, remain with him, who is to day under our direction: At any rate, if we would inſure to ourſelves a fund of pleaſing reflections, we muſt treaſure up thoſe proper and becoming actions, which will alone ſtand the teſt of accurate inveſtigation.</p>
                           <p>I thank you, my love, for your letter: It is a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpecimen of what I am to expect in future; and as you have ſo well profited by my premonitory addreſs, I calculate upon your continued docility, and antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate from this correſpondence the moſt deſirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.</p>

I will be more explicit. <hi>I mean the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete triumph, which Lord Harenbrook and Lady Morpeth obtained over an inconſiderate attachment, that ſeemed vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to have tempeſted the mind of the enamoured ſwain, and to have made no inconſiderable impreſſion upon the heart of the faſhionable nymph.</hi> Her recovery from thoſe paths of diſſipation, into which ſhe had been betrayed by a pernicious plan of education, is truly acceptable to the intereſted reader; and the <hi>grateful attachment,</hi> which, it is apparent, ſhe ultimately conceives for Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, is a completion of her character.</p>
                           <p>Indeed, nothing can be imagined more abſurd, than the endowing a haſty predilection, formed in <hi>childhood,</hi> or at beſt, in the days of <hi>inexperienced youth,</hi> with <hi>invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibility!</hi> I do not ſay that ſuch attachments are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways improper: If they are approved of, after accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate inveſtigation, and crowned by the ſanction of guardian friends, their permanency is deſirable, and we ought ſtudiouſly to cultivate every ſentiment which can contribute to their eſtabliſhment. But the <hi>election</hi> of the <hi>uninformed</hi> mind is ſeldom <hi>judicious,</hi> and the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality</hi> which we confer thereon, exiſts no where but in an over-heated imagination. <hi>A happy marriage</hi> is nothing elſe but the <hi>higheſt ſtate of friendſhip,</hi> of which the ſons and daughters of mortality are capable; and, in the choice of a companion for life, <hi>perfect eſteem</hi> ſhould point the election. If you diſcover either of the young ladies, to whom your gentle boſom is already ſo tenderly attached, to be unworthy of your regard, although ſhe may ſtill be followed by your anxious wiſhes for her reſtoration to virtue, yet you will no longer confer on her your <hi>confidence;</hi> and, was the ſame <hi>reſolution</hi> in exerciſe, a diſcovery of the want of merit in the object, <hi>until then beloved,</hi> would as eaſily <hi>obliterate</hi> the attachment exiſting between the ſexes, and we ſhould ſhrink from the idea of embarking on the important voyage of life, without the rich cargo of eſteem.</p>

                     <p>TO arreſt the warm affections of the youthful voyager, very little addreſs is requiſite. Eaſily ſuſceptible of impreſſions, the opening mind generally eſtimates perſons and things, with the benefits which accrue therefrom, agreeably to its own vivid imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and its calculations, accumulated by a productive fancy, highly o'ertop the judgment of reaſon. Grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude, if not ſpontaneous, is implanted in the glowing boſom, almoſt without an effort; and <hi>affection, ſtamped by gratitude,</hi> is a ſubſtantial baſis for the ſuperſtructure of education. To convince young people of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire attachment, and that all our views, and every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement relative to them, are directed to their preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and future advancement, is <hi>indiſputably</hi> of the greateſt importance. Children will receive leſſons with confidence and advantage, from the lips of thoſe whoſe tender attachment they do not conſider as prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lematical; and reciprocity of regards, between the teacher and the taught, is abſolutely indiſpenſable.</p>
                     <p>Happily, in the mind of Margaretta, an indelible conviction of our unalterable and diſintereſted attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was early produced; and a reciprocation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, a decided preference, and even veneration, for our characters, with that calm repoſing confidence,

which naturally reſults from affection ſo entire, and eſteem which ſhe conceived ſo well grounded, origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in her gentle boſom the warmeſt ſenſations, and ultimately procured the very beſt effect. Many of her letters are too expreſſive of the impaſſioned feelings of a fervid and enthuſiaſtically grateful heart, to meet the public eye; and, as Mrs. Aimwell requires only a ſpecimen, I am at liberty to ſuppreſs them; ſelecting others, as they may happen to occur, without attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order in which they were written.

                           <p>I DO not know that there is ſo happy a being in this world, as your little Margaretta. Your letters, beſt of friends, are more pleaſing to me than I can find words to expreſs. Alas! alas! who would have thought it?—When my aunt Arbuthnot uſed to weep over me, apprehending that ſhe ſhould leave her poor child quite friendleſs, ſhe would ſigh as if her heart would burſt; and I, for my part, had no wiſh, but to go to ſleep on the dear boſom of her, whom I ſuppoſed to be my mother, and never, never more to wake in a world, where I thought there was no one to cheriſh and to love the poor little creature, who was ſo ſoon to be deprived of her only friend! Were any one now to ſee the rich joyful Margaretta, as happy as the days are long, would it be poſſible to conceive her the ſame little deſtitute child, who ſhed ſo many tears in Mrs. Thrifty's houſe in Charleſton? Dear me!—the <hi>big waves ſwallowed up my father!—my mother broke her poor heart!—and my aunt too, very ſoon followed to that better world, whence ſhe can no more return, and ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery body ſaid, there was no one remained to take care of me!</hi>—But God has ſent two bleſſed angels to take charge of me; and for this I will proſtrate myſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him every morning and evening, and love and honour him all my days.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="74" facs="unknown:034162_0420_0FFC6A801B539B00"/>
Well now, I think, if I ſhould be a third time or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanaged, I ſhould never again hold up my head! You know, mamma, <hi>you have taught me</hi> to make <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> and <hi>compariſons;</hi> and ſo, ſtanding in the bow window the other day, I could not help weeping at the fate of the plant, which we have ſo long cheriſhed and watched with ſo much care. It was the laſt ſtormy day—and, although it had ſtood upright during the burning heat of ſummer, and the heavy rains of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, yet, the torrent that burſt upon it from the firſt wintry ſtorm, ſtripped it of all its leaves, and levelled it with the earth, from which it has never ſince lifted its head. Juſt ſo, thought I, it would fare with thee, Margaretta; thou haſt ſurvived the loſs of thy parents, and of thy ſecond mother; but, if envious death ſhould deprive thee of thy preſent guardian friends, thou muſt never think to look abroad again; thou muſt lie down with the proſtrate plant, and all thy fine expectations will be trodden to the ground! Dear me! my tears fell like big drops of rain. You remember, my mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, that you had the goodneſs to wipe them away with your own handkerchief, that you kiſſed my cheek, and wiſhed to know the cauſe of my ſorrow. I could not then ſpeak—but I determined to write you about it—they were partly tears of joy, and partly of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row—of joy, for the preſent; and of ſorrow, for what may happen; but your indulgent ſmiles ſoon left nothing in my little heart but joy and gladneſs. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, as Mrs. Trueworth ſays, if I am not the beſt, I ſhall be the worſt young body in all this world; and if I ſhould ever be ungrateful to you or my papa, I ſhall deſerve the diſpleaſure of every good perſon.</p>
                           <p>Lady Morpeth's diſreſpect for her excellent parents ſurpriſed me very much; and although I was pleaſed with her fine qualities, yet, on account of this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it was ſome time before I could be reconciled to her character—But what a ſhocking woman was Lady Ann Foſteſs! <hi>Are there ſuch ladies in England as Lady Ann Foſteſs?</hi> fie upon them, if there are! I am ſure they are not worthy to be called ladies;
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:034162_0421_0FFC6A7D6C26BFE8"/>
and if they are, in reality, to be found in Old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, how happy am I that I have eſcaped to this new world, where <hi>ſincerity and kindneſs are created king and queer, and where all their ſubjects obey their laws.</hi> I wiſh, mamma, you had written me your ſentiments of Lady Ann—I am ſure you muſt deteſt her.</p>
                           <p>I truſt I ſhall never have a friend whom you do not approve; and you ſpeak the very heart and ſoul of your Margaretta, when you ſay, that if any of my aſſociates were to addict themſelves to thoſe habits, which you and my dear papa have pointed out to me as reprehenſible, I ſhould immediately become deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of ſeparating myſelf from them, however dear they might have been to me; and I do believe it is impoſſible I ſhould continue to love thoſe, whom you aſſure me are unworthy of my attention.</p>
                           <p>Miſs Hayden has been diverting herſelf this hour paſt, with what ſhe calls our <hi>funny</hi> correſpondence; ſhe ruſhed into my chamber, (you know ſhe viſits when and where ſhe pleaſes, without ever thinking it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to aſk her mamma's permiſſion) having found her way up the back ſtairs, juſt as I was preparing to write. She had not ſtopped to put on either hat or ſcarf, and her appearance was ſo wild, that it abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frightened me! She ſays ſhe believes it is the firſt time that ever people wrote to each other under the ſame roof, when they could talk together every hour if they pleaſed; and ſhe would not be ſo ſilly, <hi>even though her mamma ſhould require it!</hi> After this ſhe wiſhed to <hi>ſee your letter,</hi> but I refuſed to gratify her.

                           <p>"Miſs Hayden ruſhed into your chamber without hat or ſcarf." Well, my dear, ſhe is quite in our vicin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and this was nothing more than a neighbourly mark of ſociability; and if her mamma chooſes to toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate her excurſions <hi>when</hi> and <hi>where</hi> her inclination leads her, without ſo far intereſting herſelf, as to take the direction of her movements, I do not ſee that <hi>we</hi> are called upon to take upon us the invidious character of her cenſors.

I would have my girl regard the faults that may paſs under her obſervation, as <hi>cautionary occurrences,</hi> that may direct her to avoid the rocks on which too many have ſplit; but ſhe muſt not be <hi>eager to detect, nor haſty to expoſe.</hi> If, from whatever motive, there has not been that plan in the education of Miſs Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, without which, <hi>ſcarce any thing valuable can be achieved,</hi> is ſhe not therefore inveſted with a claim to your kind commiſeration? If the health and leiſure of her mamma, had permitted her to beſtow that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is ſo abſolutely requiſite in the cultivation of the mind and manners, the probability is, that her orthography would have been as unexceptionable, her reading as elegant, and that ſhe might have uſed her needle as expeditiouſly, as girls, who have been thus ſyſtematically taught, generally do. Early accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed properly to appreciate time, ſhe would not then have ſlumbered away her hours in bed, but each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning morning, as it gilded the eaſtern ſky, would have witneſſed the glad oriſons of the lovely maiden, would have marked in its progreſs thoſe habits of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry ſo proper, and ſo becoming, eſpecially to the ſeaſon of youth. I am not pleaſed with your refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhow Miſs Hayden my letter. It would have been better if, with your uſual ſweetneſs, you had put it into her hand, if you had replied, to the ridicule ſhe endeavoured to throw on our correſpondence, in words to this effect: <q>Why, Miſs Hayden, my mamma ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of this arrangement, and ſhe is undoubtedly a better judge of the utility of the plan than I am; it is her wiſh to render letter writing familiar to me; and ſhe thinks the books which ſhe recommends to my peruſal with thoſe adventitious events that may be worth treaſuring up, will be more deeply infixed in my memory, if I dwell upon them long enough to commit my remarks thereon to paper, than if I paſſed them by in a curſory manner; beſides, ſhe is thus preſented with an opportunity of forming my taſte, and correcting my judgment, which might not otherwiſe have been afforded her. With regard
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:034162_0424_0FFC6A74AEFA65D0"/>
to our dwelling under the ſame roof, I have heard my mamma obſerve, that we are as really ſeparated by the walls of our reſpective apartments, as if we were placed in different kingdoms. It is often as difficult to recollect the features of a friend who is in the next room, as if he was removed to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of China. Spirit is not, in this particular, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther embarraſſed by diſtance, or aſſiſted by vicinity. On the wings of imagination, I can tranſport myſelf to the manſion of any family I have viſited in Philadelphia, with as much celerity, as I can be <hi>thus borne</hi> to the parlour, where I every day meet my aſſembled friends; nay, if ſpirit, when acting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of material organs, is in no ſort govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their admeaſurement, I can as eaſily peep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the city of London, <hi>with my bodily eyes,</hi> as into the next room, <hi>provided I made no advances to the neighbouring apartment;</hi> and, ſeated at my writing deſk, without an obſerver, I do as certainly addreſs an <hi>abſent parent,</hi> as if ſhe had been unfortunately called to croſs the vaſt atlantic.</q>

But, on the contrary, you have made your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the aggreſſor—your indignation is rouſed by the prattle of a girl whom you <hi>affect to deſpiſe</hi>—you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly refuſe a requeſt that you could have granted without the ſmalleſt inconvenience to yourſelf—you enumerate circumſtances, with the odium of which, ſhe is not juſtly chargeable—you produce them againſt her, and, with a degree of rancour of which I had not ſuppoſed you capable, by pointing out an <hi>almoſt imperceptible blemiſh</hi>—you endeavour to detract from thoſe perſonal charms, which Miſs Hayden is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged to poſſeſs!!</p>

Of <hi>injuſtice,</hi> becauſe, as I have juſt hinted, we thereby condemn, or make an individual ſuffer, for a circumſtance not to be avoided, and which the voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the being, whoſe misfortune we thus aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, was no how acceſſary in procuring. Of <hi>impiety,</hi> becauſe we thus irreverently ſubject to ridicule, and tacitly arraign, the wiſdom of that Supreme Being who preſents his productions preciſely in the order and manner which, to his unerring judgment, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beſt. There can be but <hi>one good reaſon,</hi> for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the view of the world at large, or the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual in particular, a deformity either in the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual or animal conformation. It is ſuperfluous to add that this is <hi>reformation,</hi> and where this is not the object, thoſe who remark thereon are both <hi>officious</hi> and <hi>ill-natured.</hi> The truth is, the perſon of Miſs Hayden is uncommonly beautiful, her underſtanding is natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good, and had her education been proper, ſhe would undoubtedly have been acknowledged a very lovely young perſon. The variation in her fine eyes, ſcarcely amounts to a <hi>mote;</hi> it can hardly be deemed an imperfection.</p>
                           <p>The voice of praiſe from the lips of my Margaretta will always ſound ſweetly in my ear. Not that I would wiſh you an indiſcriminate panegyriſt—by no means, but let <hi>your ſilence</hi> give evidence of your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of diſcrimination. Applaud with all the energy of language, when incenſe ſo rich becomes <hi>righteouſly due.</hi> But forbear to <hi>publiſh</hi> (unleſs to anſwer ſome valuable purpoſe, that can be no otherwiſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed) <hi>the errors which you may remark.</hi> Believe me, my love, the injurious conſequences of detraction are incalculable; when once the comment of ſeverity has

eſcaped your lips, it is beyond your control, and while it may inflict the deepeſt wounds, a remedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth not in your gift; you can only lament the melancholy effects of your indiſcretion. Often, alſo, have I known the tale of ſlander to implant in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the propagator its deadly talons, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary detractor hath himſelf become the ultimate ſacrifice.</p>
                           <p>But to dwell on the evils of detraction, would require powers more energetic than words can command. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction is the firſt-born of envy, the fiend of ſociety, and the fell deſpoiler of honeſt ſame. <hi>Beware</hi> then, my child, of its blighting influence; let your friend Miſs Clifford alſo <hi>beware, for there is not a calamity written in the book of adverſity, of which it may not be productive.</hi> I am fearful you have treated Miſs Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den unkindly. I recollect when ſhe quitted your cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that ſhe paſſed the parlour window in tears; and your avowed complacency in her departure, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent declaration, with that of your friend, relative to her future viſits, abundantly juſtify my ſuſpicion. Miſs Hayden is a mild tempered girl, and her eaſy good humour, when told of her faults, evinceth the ſerenity of her diſpoſition. <hi>To point out faults,</hi> is an office that ought to be ſacred to that <hi>experience which is the growth of a length of years, or to that tried friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that hath ſtood the teſt of various ſituations. Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta Melworth is yet too young to take upon her this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant taſk:</hi> If you can influence your companions by the <hi>propriety</hi> and <hi>beauty</hi> of your <hi>example,</hi> it is well; <hi>admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi> and <hi>cenſure, muſt be referred to a riper age.</hi> If you have, indeed, deported yourſelf with undue reſerve, ſuperciliouſneſs, or mortifying neglect, you have but one way of reſtoring yourſelf to my good opinion. Seek Miſs Hayden—and in your own amiable manner cancel a fault, which I am willing to conſider as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a want of reflection—cancel this <hi>eſſential deviation from the conſiſtency of your character,</hi> by conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to <hi>ſolicit</hi> a reconciliation. Remember, my love, <hi>acknowledgment</hi> of <hi>error,</hi> always adds additional luſtre
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:034162_0427_0FFC6A6CECA16658"/>
to the fine qualities of a perſon, <hi>capable of conducting ſo properly;</hi> and remember, alſo, that Miſs Hayden is two years your ſenior. <hi>Put yourſelf in her ſituation—tell me how you would wiſh ſhe ſhould conduct towards you, and let your anſwer decide your movements.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Do not, my daughter, ſuffer the freedom of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon this occaſion, to envelop your future ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and actions in a veil of myſtery or <hi>concealment;</hi> ſeek not to reſtrain the frankneſs of your diſpoſition; but let your lovely boſom be ſtill open to my inſpection. If I am <hi>ſtrict to mark; if I carefully ſearch out the deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weed, it is becauſe I would utterly exterminate from ſo fair a ſoil, every thing which can offend.</hi> Your virtues, I predict, will be permanent; your faults, I pleaſingly believe, will be trivial; and from the eyes of a cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous world, I ſhall ſtill be ſolicitous to conceal the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of my child. Anxious for the conſiſtency of her character, I ſhall, as often as I ſee occaſion, freely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect; and while I point out thoſe miſtakes, upon <hi>which perſons leſs intereſted will be ſilent, or, perhaps, aſſail her ear with the ſtrains of adulation, I ſhall thereby beſt evince my maternal regards.</hi>

                           <p>I am, my dear, enchanted by your letter; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have haſted to eraſe from ſo fair a page the extraneous blot, I have not been the leſs captivated by its beauties. Your figure of the fallen plant is charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—it robbed me of ſome delicious tears—May my favourite flower be never more ſurcharged by woe—may the ready prop be ſtill preſented—may the bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms of her youth be ſheltered from every evil—may her life be a life of uſefulneſs—and may the ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, attendant upon deeds of worth, be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of her declining years.</p>

                           <p>WHILE you and my papa are continued in this world, there is no misfortune that can happen to your Margaretta, which will be ſo heavy as
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:034162_0429_0FFC6A6874122B70"/>
your diſpleaſure. I ſaw, immediately upon my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dining parlour this day, that you did not look upon your poor girl exactly as you have heretofore done—your eye, as it met mine, did not ſay, "Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetta, you are a good girl, and I am,"—as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you have frequently ſtyled yourſelf—"<hi>your approbating mother.</hi>" You called me too, "<hi>Miſs Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth!</hi>"—and although you looked tenderly upon me, when this coolneſs drew from me a ſigh, which indeed came from the bottom of my trembling boſom, yet I could ſee, <hi>too plainly,</hi> that you were not reconciled to me; and I ſhould immediately have thrown myſelf at your dear bleſſed feet, entreating you to tell me in what I had offended, and ſupplicating your forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had I not been ſure and certain, that your diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation was occaſioned by my letter, and had you not given it as a rule, that I ſhould not refer, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, to thoſe letters, until the cloſe of a correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence ſo delightful to me. The wonder is, how I continued at table—but dinner over, I was no longer able to ſuppreſs my emotions, and I flew to my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to weep over a fault, that I was ſure I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted! Plato followed with your letter—with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling lips I kiſſed the ſeal—I haſtened to read, and the reaſon for the unuſual reception I had met, was fully explained! I read it over and over again, bluſhing and weeping by turns. Ah, mamma! it is impoſſible I ſhould ever commit a ſecond error of this kind! Moſt ſincerely do I deſpiſe myſelf, while my mother appears more an angel than before! You are all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſweet condeſcenſion to every body—every one whom I know has told me this again and again; and beſides, I ſee it myſelf every day—how then could I act ſo very different from my mamma! How many tears has my ſtrange behaviour coſt me! and, what is worſe than all, I, who ſhould give nothing but pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure to my mother, have wounded her boſom alſo!</p>
                           <p>Well, but when my poor heart was almoſt ready to burſt, I began to ſee that there were many lines in your letter, from which I ought to take comfort. You

did not ſay, your poor orphan child had <hi>forfeited your good opinion forever</hi>—no indeed, no ſuch thing—there was yet one way left, by which I might again become your <hi>own Margaretta;</hi> and, dropping down on my knees before the chair, (in which you uſually ſit, when you paſs thoſe charming moments in my chamber, that you bid me call the viſits of my maternal friend) I thanked God and my bleſſed mother, for the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contained in that dear charming line, <hi>that there was yet one way left, by which I might be reſtored to your good opinion</hi>—and jumping upon my feet, I clapped my hands out of pure joy; and ſo, mamma, I immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tripped down ſtairs, <hi>without either hat or ſcarf,</hi> (for I thought it right to puniſh that impertinent pride, which had officiouſly brought upon me ſo much evil) and ſat off in purſuit of Miſs Hayden. When I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered her parlour, I began an apology; but ſhe, not in the leaſt attending to what I was about to ſay, threw into my arms a little lap-dog, which ſhe ſaid was the moſt beautiful creature in the world; that her mamma had juſt purchaſed it for her; and, "Margaretta," ſhe added, <q>you will be pleaſed when you hear, that for this one indulgent action of my mamma's, (for ſhe herſelf deteſts lap-dogs) I am determined to become the beſt girl in the world! Come hither, Florus—poor fellow—reſt upon your miſtreſs's lap—there—lay ſtill. Yes, Miſs Melworth, I will, if poſſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as good as Miſs Clifford, or yourſelf, and I am ſure I cannot have better models.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>I will confeſs to you, my mamma, that I was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to obſerve Miſs Hayden had thought my rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>(for indeed it deſerves no better name)</hi> below her attention. At that moment I could not forbear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging her ſuperiority; and, had it not been that I muſt have <hi>paſſed from your care,</hi> I would gladly have changed characters with Miſs Hayden; ſo much did her <hi>manner</hi> of paſſing by my unbecoming conduct, exalt her in my opinion. But, waving my hand, with an expreſſion of gratitude for her kind ſentiments of Miſs Clifford and myſelf, I ſaid, while a bluſh of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:034162_0431_0FFC6A6250542530"/>
inferiority crimſoned my cheek—I have called upon you this afternoon, dear Miſs Hayden, to make confeſſion of the impropriety of my late behaviour to you; to aſk your forgiveneſs; to ſolicit your future friendſhip; and to requeſt, as a token you are indeed reconciled unto me, that you will read the letter, which, on an occaſion ſo truly diſhonourable to myſelf, you expreſſed a wiſh to ſee.</p>
                           <p>Miſs Hayden, notwithſtanding Florus was repoſing upon her lap, immediately roſe from her chair, and, throwing her arms about my neck, ſhe burſt into tears! Never, methought, did any one, <hi>except my mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> appear ſo lovely. As ſoon as ſhe had a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered herſelf from the ſurpriſe into which my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs had thrown her, ſhe affectionately ſaid—<q>I will not deny that I thought you, Miſs Melworth, a little diſobliging; you are generally ſo fond of giving pleaſure, that any thing of a contrary kind from you is ſo much the more unpleaſant: But when I relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the circumſtance to my mother, ſhe thought that my flippant conduct might have drawn upon me your diſlike, and ſhe adviſed me to ſet about an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of manners, which I was partly reſolved to do, even before ſhe made me a preſent of my little Florus; and when I ſaw you enter this afternoon, it gave me more pleaſure than I can ſay. I thought there could not be a better time to ſet about <hi>my ref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormation, as mamma calls it;</hi> and I was rejoiced too, that you thought enough of me to viſit me. With regard to forgiveneſs, it is too much to ſay. I was, I remember, very provoking; I felt uncommon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſchievous. Let theſe expreſſions of endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</q>—and ſhe kiſſed my forehead—<q>help us to forget the paſt, and let me be conſidered in future, as a wild good-natured girl, who is determined to improve by your example.</q> I caught her hand with grateful tenderneſs, and juſt at this moment her mother entered; ſhe looked both aſtoniſhed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted at ſeeing us ſo affectionately engaged; we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the termination of our miſunderſtanding, and ſhe too ſhed over us tears of joy.</p>

I produced from my pocket-book your dear letter, and put it into the hands of the young lady with a look of entreaty; ſhe kiſſed the paper, and preſented it with inimitable gracefulneſs to her mamma. Mrs. Hayden read it and commented upon it, in a way calculated to improve both her daughter and myſelf. I have heard you ſay, mamma, if I remember right, that Mrs. Hayden is an accompliſhed woman: She regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that her Emily had been ſo little attended to; ſhe wiſhed ſhe may be permitted to peruſe as many of the letters of a correſpondence ſo <hi>well judged,</hi> as might conſiſt with propriety; and, that if it were not too great a favour, ſhe might ſometimes be permitted to make one of thoſe reading parties, of which ſhe had heard ſo much, and from which it was evident, Miſs Clifford and myſelf had derived ſuch eſſential advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. I ventured to aſſure both the ladies, that it would add to the happineſs of my mamma, if Miſs Hayden would regularly join us upon our ſtated read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hours, (was I right, mamma?) and ſhe will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, meet us in the reading parlour when we next aſſemble. I took my leave, with repeated aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, that I would endeavour, by future acts of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to cancel the diſobligation of the paſt; and, haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening to my own apartment, I could not enjoy a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment until I had given you this circumſtantial account.</p>
                           <p>And now, mamma, again kneeling at the chair you have ſo often filled, I do moſt earneſtly ſupplicate your forgiveneſs for the trouble I am ſenſible I muſt have given you. Let me entreat you, in your own charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, "<hi>Reſtore your Margaretta to your good opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion;</hi>" for indeed, indeed, ſhe is loſt to every comfort until you do! When I ſee you at tea will you again look kindly upon me, kiſs my cheek, and call me once more your good little girl? If you aſſure me of your full and free pardon, and of your reſtored approbation, then will my poor heart leap for joy; and then, and not till then, will your ever dutiful child be again your truly happy</p>

                     <p>Margaretta, thus receiving permiſſion, ruſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly into our apartment, and ſuch were the rapidity of her movements, that, ere we were aware, flinging herſelf almoſt breathleſs at the feet of her mother, and claſping her knees in a kind of extaſy, ſhe exhibited a ſpectacle the moſt charmingly intereſting which can be imagined. Mary raiſed her in her arms—alternately we preſſed her to our boſoms, and, until that moment, I had never experienced tranſports ſo exquiſitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful!</p>
                     <p>Thus ended an affair, that ſome may poſſibly regard as a "<hi>much ado about nothing;</hi>" but Mary, availing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the aſcendency ſhe had obtained over the mind of her daughter, <hi>had purpoſely wrought it up to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:034162_0434_0FFC6A5949404558"/>
importance.</hi> She was ſolicitous to uproot every propenſity which diſcovered the moſt remote tendency to the malignancy of ſcandal. She conceived, that as impreſſions are generally made with ſucceſs in the early part of life, ſhe could hardly be premature in her efforts to implant a proper deteſtation of this <hi>hydra evil;</hi> and the event proved ſhe had acted judiciouſly; for this little circumſtance, with all its conſequences, was indelibly ſtamped upon the mind of Miſs Melworth; the ſerious ſolemnity with which it had been attended, engraved it there; it confirmed her the irreconcileable foe to detraction in all its varieties; and ſhe recoils, with a kind of horror, for which perhaps ſhe does not always ſtop to account, from the very ſemblance of a malevolent remark; nor do I believe ſhe has, from the above era to the preſent moment, ever uttered a ſingle ſentence, that could, by any rational conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be termed <hi>invidious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was the deſign both of Mary and myſelf, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our daughter, in that career on which ſhe was entering, both theoretically and practically, a philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropic moraliſt. And to this valuable end were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected both my admonitions and precepts, as well as the converſation and letters of her mother. We were well aware of the vaſt importance of the <hi>firſt informed movements of reaſon,</hi> of <hi>firſt principles,</hi> and of a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement in the path of rectitude.</hi> We were ſenſible that individuals, connected in ſociety, neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon each other; and that, of courſe, our felicity or infelicity is more or leſs deducible from ſentiments and arrangements beyond our control. We propoſed to Miſs Melworth the general approbation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as an object worthy her unremitting purſuit; and, as we could not conceive of a human being ſo inſignificant, as to bar the poſſibility of his, or her, future influence upon our proſpects, ſo we taught her to eſtimate the good will of every individual as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable acquiſition. It muſt be remembered, however, that we always inculcated the neceſſity of circumſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wiſh for univerſal applauſe, in itſelf laudable,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:034162_0435_0FFC6A57B86DFFC8"/>
within the boundaries of virtue; that we erected our ſtandard of rectitude, and firſt of all, carefully impreſſed an idea of the <hi>ſuperior importance of ſelf-complacency, and of approving Heaven.</hi> But, having taken down in ſhort hand, as I was ſeated at my writing-deſk, in a cloſet adjoining to Margaretta's, a few disjointed ſentences, which fell from the lips of my wife, during one of thoſe hours appropriated to the inſtruction of her beloved charge, I tranſcribe them from my minutes.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>There are, my love, a variety of means, by which you may inſure to yourſelf the general good wiſhes and eſteem of all thoſe with whom you aſſociate; and this, too, without parting with a ſhilling of your prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, or the ſmalleſt inconvenience to yourſelf. Nay, on the contrary, it may happen that you will thus procure conſiderable pecuniary emolument; and you will certainly reap incalculable mental advantages; your boſom will be tranquillized, and you will poſſeſs that harmony of intellect, which few events will be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of interrupting. But let me be more particular: Avoid engaging warmly as a diſputant; deliver your ſentiments, when called upon, with calmneſs and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and never aſſume a <hi>deciſive</hi> air, or tone of voice.</p>
                        <p>Accuſtom yourſelf to dilate on pleaſing facts; dwell with pleaſure on every good action; <hi>advocate the cauſe of the abſent,</hi> and do not ſuffer yourſelf to repeat thoſe inſtances of miſconduct, which you may have heard. Hide the faults which may happen to come under your obſervation, with as much care as if they were your own; never make them the ſubject of your animadverſions, except you have <hi>good ground</hi> for imagining that you ſhall thereby effectuate ſome <hi>valuable purpoſe.</hi> Be ſcrupulouſly exact in your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of that intercourſe of civilities, pronounced, by a certain claſs of people, <hi>eſſential to good breeding.</hi> It is true, we may regard thoſe ceremonies as trivial; but nothing, <hi>in fact,</hi> can be indifferent, on which the <hi>ineſtimable enjoyments of ſociety are made to depend;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a regular obſervance of punctuality, in every department, will always be recognized as a virtue.</p>

But while I counſel you to be a tenacious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of the <hi>etiquette,</hi> eſtabliſhed in thoſe circles in which you may happen to move, as far as it relates to others, being careful, in no inſtance, to draw upon yourſelf the accuſation of neglect, I would wiſh you, on your own part, to riſe ſuperior to thoſe, in <hi>reality, little</hi> punctilios; be not eaſily betrayed into reſentment; do not indulge an irritable diſpoſition of mind, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject your aſſociates to the neceſſity of moving as if they trod on glaſs, for fear of wounding your feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. There is one rule to which it will be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to adhere—never take offence at any inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you may have reaſon to ſuppoſe undeſigned; when you are in reality injured, accept an apology; and let that <hi>mild indulgence, ſo proper to a being ſubjected to error, be ever prominent in your conduct.</hi> With the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of my grandmother, of celebrious memory, I have been particularly charmed; as often as ſhe found the ſhafts of ſlander aimed againſt herſelf, if the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator ranked in the number of her oſtenſible friends, it was her cuſtom to take an early opportunity of viſiting them, <hi>not to reproach them,</hi> but to evince, by the augmented urbanity and indulgent forgiveneſs of her manners, how little ſhe merited their cenſure: If the maligner was found among the ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of penury, ſhe never failed of beſtowing upon them ſome extraordinary and liberal mark of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common elevation of her ſpirit. Thus did her <hi>enemies become her warmeſt panegyriſts, and every malevolent princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was abſorbed in the ſplendor of her almoſt peerleſs virtues.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But while I am ſolicitous to put you in poſſeſſion of the good opinion of that world, upon the great the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre of which you are ſo ſoon to make your <hi>entrée,</hi> I wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Be not haſty to make profeſſions of friendſhip, nor credit thoſe feveriſh impreſſions, which probably are, at beſt, but the paroxyſms of an hour; but regard the <hi>deliberate and uniform eſteem of perſons of eſtabliſhed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and reputation, as an incalculable treaſure, and endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to preſerve their good opinion, by purſuing thoſe attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that, when poſſeſſed, will infallibly beſtow upon you the perfumed wreath of ſweet applauſe.</hi>

                        <p>Much hath been ſaid reſpecting the virtue of ſecret-keeping, and the neceſſity of electing a diſcreet confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; let me rather hope that you will have <hi>no ſecrets to keep.</hi> You will, I dare believe, be careful to obtain, and to perpetuate, that equity of thinking, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of acting, which will paint your cheek with the hue of innocence, endow with modeſt confidence your words and actions, and inſure a continuity of that charming ſerenity and cheerful expectation, that at preſent triumphs in your boſom. Yet, it is true, that there are a thouſand little delicacies, contingent alarms, hopes and fears, which alternately predominate in the female mind. Theſe may create embarraſſments, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuring, poſſibly, the better way, and enveloping in clouds thoſe enjoyments, that, under proper regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, would unqueſtionably beſtow the richeſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency. Of all thoſe <hi>entanglements,</hi> and <hi>intricacies of every deſcription,</hi> the breaſt of a <hi>maternal</hi> friend is the only proper repoſitory. Years almoſt neceſſarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow with experience; and <hi>affection, directed by knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, is demonſtrably the ſureſt guide.</hi> A judicious moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, riſing ſuperior to conſiderations, which generally influence a younger and <hi>leſs intereſted confidant,</hi> will not cheriſh ill founded hopes, nor give energy to thoſe paſſions that are founded in weakneſs; <hi>but ſhe will do better; by her ſyſtematic efforts, ſhe will annihilate the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,</hi> and again lead the footſteps of the lovely trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler into the beamy paths of peace. A mother will neither indulge nor ſoothe thoſe errors, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of imbecility; her plan is, to cruſh in embryo every thing that may have a pernicious influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the future progreſs of her child, <hi>to nerve by reſolution,</hi>
                           <pb n="92" facs="unknown:034162_0438_0FFC6A4EC8AC69C8"/>
and to cultivate that fortitude ſo neceſſary in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer of life; and hence it is, that a mother ſhould be conſidered as the only proper confidant of her daughter.</p>
                        <p>I will confeſs, my dear, that I am not only ſatisfied, but perfectly charmed with your conduct. Your reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution to become exactly what I wiſh, has been inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably reduced to practice; and the ſweet conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and tender ingenuouſneſs of your apologies, have totally cancelled thoſe miſtakes, on which you have been precipitated by inexperience. Never, I bleſs God, have I diſcovered in you a blameable impatience of reproof, nor cenſurable haſte to procure your own juſtification; all <hi>aggravating, ſelf-applauding</hi> replies, <hi>implied accuſations of rigour, audacious pertneſs and ſelf-ſufficient loquacity, or diſcontented gloomy reſerve, ſullen glances, angry and provoking geſtures, with dumb indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>—from all theſe you have ſtill been wholly exempt, and I have to acknowledge your mild ſubmiſſion, ſweet diſcretion, and affectionate duty, as the richeſt ſolace, both to your father and myſelf.</p>
                        <p>Such alſo is your conduct to our domeſtics, as to merit our higheſt approbation. The authority which I have thought proper to delegate to you, has been admirably ſupported. Without aſſuming arrogance, or that imperious haughtineſs, ſo vexatiouſly diſtreſſing to dependants, you have conducted with dignity, amelio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by condeſcenſion; and this hath inſured you both reſpect and eſteem. I am pleaſed with your <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of <hi>directing;</hi> and the habit you have ſo happily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, of <hi>requeſting the aſſiſtance</hi> of thoſe about you, is certainly preferable, both in <hi>form</hi> and <hi>effect,</hi> to that peremptory commanding tone of voice, and imperious ſtyle of language, ſo generally adopted. Nothing can merit contempt, but unworthy actions; and you therefore rightly judge, that the individual, who, in the order of things, is employed in the loweſt uſeful occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, provided he ſills his ſphere with propriety, ſhould not only be exempted from ſcorn and deriſion, but <hi>is, in reality, ſuperior to the crowned head,</hi> whoſe life is a
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:034162_0439_0FFA65446684E6A0"/>
combination of atrocious crimes. It is well obſerved, that good ſervants ſhould be regarded as humble friends. I am perſuaded it will ever be your aim to make their yoke eaſy; and I repeat, that in this houſe, the mild benignity of your temper, and your engaging deportment, without in the ſmalleſt degree diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſideration due to you, as the daughter of our election, has eſtabliſhed you in every heart. It has been your object to mitigate the unavoidable evils, and to leſſen the reſpective burdens of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals who compoſe our houſehold; and I obſerve with pleaſure, that you have become the ſovereign lady of their affections.</p>
                        <p>I am not apprehenſive, that the rendering you the praiſe, ſo indiſpenſably your due, will be, in any ſort, injurious. You will not, I flatter myſelf, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly elated—far otherwiſe—the noble energies of your diſpoſition will be thus ſtimulated to yet higher excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Nothing is more diſguſting than an overween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſelf-ſufficiency and preſumptuous pride, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in young perſons; modeſt diffidence carries with it its own recommendation. I ſhould bluſh to find my Margaretta; except induced by particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, making herſelf the heroine of her own narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Thoſe events which may be importantly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting to you, and from which you conceive you derive an elevation of character, will, too probably, fatigue in the recital; the indifferent will conſider them as inſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id; you will be ſubjected to ridicule, and aſſuredly draw upon yourſelf the odium of <hi>egotiſm and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is wiſdom to cultivate a complacency in the ſcene under your preſent obſervation. <hi>Contentment is the richeſt gem within the graſp of mortality;</hi> hardly any price can be too great for ſo valuable an acquiſition; it is a <hi>ſubſtitute</hi> for almoſt every leſſer enjoyment, and often ſupplies, with much reſpectability, the place of higher orders of felicity. <hi>You cannot call back the paſt, you may never attain the future, and,</hi> ſurely then, I may repeat, <hi>it is wiſdom to cultivate complacency in

the preſent,</hi> and to uſe all poſſible diligence to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate your mind to a ſituation, which you have it not in your power to ameliorate, however <hi>ineligible</hi> it may, <hi>in fact, be.</hi>

                           <p>IT is impoſſible for any words of mine to ſay, with what unequalled pleaſure I read over and over again, thoſe letters which you have condeſcended to write to me. I have this morning been placing them according to their dates. I have beſtowed upon them more kiſſes than there are lines; and, conjoining them with a piece of purple ribon, I can thus turn to them the more readily; the impreſſion made by the folds will gradually diſappear, and, while I live, I ſhall be able to preſerve them. The laſt ten letters<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe letters do not appear.</note>, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directions for my conduct, in all thoſe ſituations in which you ſuppoſe I may poſſibly be placed, I ſhall certainly read, at leaſt once, every day.</p>
                           <p>Surely, never—no, never—was poor, rich orphan ſo completely bleſſed as your Margaretta. When you
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:034162_0441_0FFC6A4BB1431580"/>
went through Evelina yeſterday, I could ſcarcely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear interrupting you by an expreſſion of thoſe feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of gratitude, which were all collected, if I may ſo ſay, in one delightful emotion of exquiſite and almoſt ungovernable joy! Evelina, it is true, did not find a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but Mr. Villars was exactly ſuch a man as my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly indulgent father; and, methought, it was my own dear papa who was addreſſing Lady Howard, when he ſo affectionately ſays, <q>
                                 <hi>That child, Madam, ſhall never, while life is lent, know the loſs ſhe has ſuſtained. I have cheriſhed, ſuccoured and ſupported her, from her earlieſt infancy to her ſixteenth year.</hi>
                              </q> Good, kind gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman—I was uncommonly affected. I have been looking over Evelina again this morning; and, on my knees, I pray God, that both you and my papa may be able to ſay of your Margaretta, as Mr. Villars of his Evelina, that ſhe has amply repaid your care and affection, and that ſhe is all which your fondeſt wiſhes had anticipated.</p>
                           <p>Evelina was very happy to meet in Lord Orville, a friend ſo like her papa. Is it not very uncommon, mamma, for ſo young a gentleman to be in the exerciſe of thoſe virtues which ſeemed to have found a home in the boſom of the venerable Mr. Villars?</p>
                           <p>But Evelina deſerved every thing—Was ſhe not, my mamma, a <hi>faultleſs character?</hi> Surely the Engliſh reviewers, of whom I have heard ſo much, muſt have ſpoken highly of thoſe volumes. I have again been weeping over the ſufferings of Lady Belmont—Sir John Belmont I alſo pity—May God protect me from the cruel impoſitions of baſe and intereſted men! I think, mamma, you did not give your opinion of Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina. Your next letter, I hope, will teach me how I ought to think of it; and may I never take a ſtep without your kind advice and direction, and may I always continue your affectionately dutiful,</p>

                           </opener>
                           <p>RARELY doth a day paſs without furniſhing me with ſome new reaſon to love and admire my Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta. You have experienced that I am not niggard of praiſe, nor is it proper I ſhould be ſo. I would as ſoon withhold from you the light of heaven, leſt you ſhould become enamoured with the beauty of your face, or the ſymmetry of your perſon, (neither of which you have been any how inſtrumental in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing) as I would keep back thoſe commendations decidedly due to unequivocal merit, in the fear they might be productive of ſelf-conceit.</p>
                           <p>Praiſe operates upon the youthful mind like the vernal ſhower upon the tender plant, or like the clear ſhining of that parent orb, whoſe genial ray ſucceeds the fertilizing irrigation. And I am, at this moment, in poſſeſſion of a motive ſufficient to extort applauſe even from the frigidity of apathy. Yes, my love, ſince you retired to your pen this morning, I have made a diſcovery, that, while it <hi>elevates to a degree of rapture, the complacency I am in the habit of experiencing in my child,</hi> incalculably augments my confidence in her virtues.</p>
                           <p>You recollect when your papa firſt informed you, that you ſhould receive, at the cloſe of every week, a ſmall ſum, as pocket money, (which has ſince been regularly paid you) he at the ſame time aſſured you, it ſhould remain entirely at your own diſpoſal; that he would never require, or receive an account of its expenditure; and that, however you might think proper to enter it in your calculation of expenſes, it ſhould, on no occaſion, be ſubjected to his inſpection; and by this aſſurance he has ever ſince been religiouſly bound. I will confeſs to you, my dear, that having never obſerved even a veſtige of this money, I have had a ſtrong curioſity to know in what manner it was beſtowed; but regarding the <hi>wiſhes</hi> of your father as <hi>rules</hi> for my conduct, I have forborne to inveſtigate;
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:034162_0443_0FFC6A456AA04AE0"/>
and, as the ſum was ſmall, I was the leſs anxious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting it. This morning, however, has produced a moſt unexpected and captivating eclairciſſement. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, by its beauties, to prefer a walk to a book, I ſtrolled further than I have done ſince the illneſs under which I ſo long laboured, and which filled the boſom of my Margaretta with ſuch tender apprehenſions. It happened in my walk, that I paſſed the cottage of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona, whom I have not ſeen for more than a year; and, indulging a hope, that time, aided by neceſſity, might have procured that reformation, for which my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels had been ineffectual, I felt a ſtrong inclination to look in upon the poor woman. I paſſed her humble threſhold, marking, with pleaſure, an appearance of neatneſs, I had never before witneſſed in the dwelling of Melona.</p>
                           <p>The cottage, you know, has two apartments; no perſon was in that which I entered; but it bore ſtrong teſtimony of the cleanlineſs and induſtry of its miſtreſs; and, moreover, the buz of a ſpinning-wheel ſaluted my ear! This is excellent, thought I, and juſt as I was about to enter the other room, little Peggy open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the door, and carefully ſhutting it after her, tripped into the ſtreet. The child had her eyes ſo ſteadily fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſpelling-book, which ſhe held open in her hand, that ſhe did not obſerve me; and the grateful noiſe of the ſpinning-wheel ſtill continued. Peggy's apparel was ſtrikingly deſcriptive of <hi>ſcanty means, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently employed to the beſt poſſible advantage;</hi> and this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, together with the new face which every thing in the cottage of Melona aſſumed, determined me to interrogate the child, expecting, from her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and ſimplicity, a clue of direction for my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to her mother. I ſoon overtook her, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted her ſtudies with a—How are you, my pretty little Peggy? She had no recollection of me, and not having reflection enough to teach her to wonder at my knowledge of her name, with a childiſh kind of baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, ſhe dropped a courteſy, and ſaid, "Pretty well I thank you, Madam." Where are you going, Peggy?
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:034162_0444_0FFC6A43E197FDA8"/>
"I goes every day to ſchool, Ma'am, now-a-days." And what do you read in, pray? "I reads in this here ſpelling-book; and I ſtudies my leſſon every morning." That is very proper, my dear; you ſeem to have a very handſome ſpelling-book, quite new; I hope you take care of it: Who gave it to you, Peggy? "That I muſt not tell, Madam; for Miſs Melworth would be angry if I ſhould." Miſs Melworth! ſaid I, almoſt gaſping for breath; why, child, what has Miſs Melworth to do with it? "I muſt not ſay, Madam, for Miſs Margaretta herſelf bid me not to ſpeak; but for all that, my mamma ſays how that ſhe is an angel, and that ſhe has ſaved us all, and made her a thouſand times <hi>gooder</hi> than ſhe was before; but this is all a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and I would not tell for the world."</p>
                           <p>Here I will own to you, my love, that your <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering</hi> ſuperiority originated in my boſom, admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my daughter, and accuſation of myſelf. But determining to trace every ſtep, by which you had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuated ſo valuable a change, I took Peggy by the hand, and once more entered the cottage of Melona. "<hi>The wicket opening with a latch,</hi>" gave us a ready ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into its back apartment. Melona threw her eyes over a countenance ſhe had ſo long known; a crimſon bluſh inſtantly ſuffuſed her cheek, and was as inſtantly ſucceeded by a death-like paleneſs; her wheel ſtopped, and, ſinking upon a chair, it was with difficulty that the immediate application of my ſalts preſerved her from fainting.</p>
                           <p>When ſhe was a little compoſed I began my attack, and managing with ſome addreſs, I ſoon obtained the full confeſſion of a ſecret, which adds another beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trait to the character of my Margaretta. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me of your appearance under her humble roof upon the week you firſt received your little ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend—of your ſage admonitions—of your earneſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties that ſhe would permit you to put her little Peggy to ſchool—of your propoſal to purchaſe the ſpinning-wheel—of the aſſiſtance ſhe had received from you during her illneſs, and that of her huſband—and
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:034162_0445_0FFC6A4212AFA160"/>
of the happy change a patronage ſo unexpected had produced in her life. Reflecting, ſhe ſaid, upon the great goodneſs of ſo young a lady, upon her ſtooping to take ſuch a compaſſionate intereſt in her affairs, and condeſcending to urge her, with ſuch extraordinary earneſtneſs, to aſſiſt herſelf to have pity on her huſband, to have pity on her poor little Peggy, and to make the beſt of that little which was allowed her, filled h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

She immediately made a vow, that nothing ſtronger than water ſhould, in future, paſs her lips; and, that ſhe might have no temptation to forfeit a reſolution ſo ſalutary, ſhe forthwith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>the intoxicating diſtillation, hitherto carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed for her own particular uſe,</hi> to the ſtream which winds its way at a little diſtance from the cottage; and, being earneſtly bent upon a thorough reform, her application became as remarkable as her previous negligence had been; and habit reconciling her to her new walk, frugality, neatneſs and induſtry, with all their captivating charms, ſoon burſt upon her.</p>
                           <p>Melona informs me, that ſhe long refuſed to receive any part of your weekly ſtipend; but that, on your poſitive aſſurance, that the kindneſs of your parents had left you no wiſh ungratified; that you poſſeſſed an undoubted right to diſpoſe of this ſum exactly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your own pleaſure; and, that her acceptance was the only compenſation ſhe could make to you for the intereſt you ſo kindly took in her welfare, ſhe had at length conſented to receive from you weekly dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that you had furniſhed her huſband with many articles neceſſary to his buſineſs; and that you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly paid for the inſtruction of Peggy. But ſhe added, that ſhe believed, ſhe and her little family were not your only penſioners! Matchleſs child! My God! how I glory in my Margaretta! or rather, in thoſe heavenly propenſities, with which thou haſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed

her. I inquire not, my beloved girl, for a liſt of your dependants; enjoy, <hi>in this particular, the lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury of concealment; but it ſhall be my care, that your means ſhall be immediately augmented; ſhe, who knows ſo well how to diſpoſe of money, muſt not be circumſcribed within ſuch narrow bounds.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Do you not think I came home in raptures with thoſe peerleſs virtues which I have the honour to cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and to protect? I could hardly, upon this occaſion, arrogate to myſelf the title of your Mother, and I felt my mind ſpontaneouſly proſtrating before an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, whoſe brilliant dawn ſurpaſſes the meridian ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgence of common intelligence.</p>
                           <p>Plato met me with your letter. I was prepared to accede to any requeſt of yours—and, as your father does not return until the evening, I reſerve, till that period, the pleaſure of a circumſtantial account of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona and her cottage; of the means by which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the delightful particulars which I ſhall narrate; and of beſtowing upon the brow of merit, the wreath of unequivocal applauſe. Shall we not, my dear, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a moſt enchanting evening? Well, but you ſolicit my ſentiments of Evelina. Surely, my Margaretta is an enthuſiaſt in her gratitude—<hi>but the enthuſiaſm of virtue is a noble enthuſiaſm.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The plot of Evelina is well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap>, and happily executed. It is a novel to which we can return with pleaſure, even to a ſecond or third peruſal, and this is more than can be ſaid of common productions of this kind. The ſtyle is familiar and eaſy; and the ideas ſeem naturally to grow out of each other.</p>
                           <p>Evelina is ſaid to be a firſt production, and, if ſo, it is entitled, or the abilities of its author, to high admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But I think you will eſteem Cecilia (which is a publication of the ſame author) as a work which merits a <hi>decided preference.</hi> The character of Albany, in Cecilia, is a highly finiſhed original, and has for me peculiar charms. <hi>I do not ſay it is natural;</hi> but I could wiſh to render ſuch characters <hi>official,</hi> and to <hi>multiply them in ſociety.</hi> Miſs Burney's publications have hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:034162_0447_0FFC6D7B2AB1BFA0"/>
done honour both to her fine genius and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heart; and, I think, they have much appropriate excellence. I am ignorant in what claſs the reviewers have placed the productions of Miſs Burney; but juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice muſt award them a very high rank in the literary line. Yet, it appears to me, that Evelina, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, is not without a blemiſh; and, I conceive, the heroine herſelf <hi>is ſtrikingly deficient</hi> in one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which conſtitutes a capital requiſite in the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of a <hi>young and amiable woman.</hi> The taſk of a cenſurer muſt always appear invidious; yet, for the ſake of my Margaretta, who warmly demands, "<hi>Was not Evelina a faultleſs character?</hi>" I expreſs my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without reſerve. Evelina then, was <hi>greatly want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that delicacy,</hi> which ſhould have marked her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment to Madame Duval. Madame Duval had been <hi>denied the aids of education; this was her misfortune, rather than her fault; and a well informed, amiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant ſhould have thrown over this defect the veil of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and not have ſought every opportunity to have <hi>expoſed it in the moſt glaring colours!</hi> In the letters ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to her <hi>reverend correſpondent,</hi> the old lady is rarely mentioned without a ſketch of her bad Engliſh, as, <hi>"Ay now," cried Madame Duval, "that's another of the unpoliteneſſes of you Engliſh, to go to talking of ſuch things as that: Now, in Paris, nobody never ſays nothing about religion, no more than about politics.</hi>" And again, "<hi>I would have you learn to be more politer, Sir,</hi>" &amp;c. &amp;c. Was it, I aſk, the part of a <hi>well diſpoſed, well educated young lady,</hi> to hold up to view errors of this kind, when found in the mouth of a perſon, <hi>whoſe years,</hi> and <hi>whoſe affinity,</hi> entitled her to a more <hi>candid</hi> and <hi>dutiful</hi> repreſentation?</p>
                           <p>It appears that Madame Duval was indebted to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for nothing but the charms of her perſon, and that her temper was very unhappy and cruelly implacable; yet it is not inſinuated, that <hi>her enormities were greatly multiplied.</hi> She is, however, treated as the moſt atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of criminals; and, by the inſtigations of a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Mirvin and the <hi>lover of her grand-daughter,</hi> ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:034162_0448_0FFC6D79A70837D0"/>
the moſt abſurd and cruel outrage. The <hi>gentle</hi> Evelina, <hi>who is apprized that ſome miſchievous plot is in agitation againſt her grandmother, ſets out without a ſingle remonſtrance,</hi> attended only by the ſervants, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her to a juſtice of peace, <hi>although ſhe had expreſſed previous fears of entruſting herſelf to her care!</hi> A farce, of which I cannot ſee the <hi>wit,</hi> ſucceeds. <hi>The poor old lady is made to believe herſelf in the poſſeſſion of a ſavage banditti—her apprehenſions for her life are apparently well founded—ſhe is torn from the carriage by maſked men—ſhe is dragged along the road, cruelly agitated, ſhook, and thumped about—ſtuck faſt in a ditch—her legs bound—tied to a tree—and, robbed of her head dreſs, ſhe is thus left to her own contemplations, while her grand-daughter continues in her chariot, liſtening to a tale of love!!</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In one ſenſe, Evelina muſt be conſidered as <hi>acceſſary to theſe unwarrantable proceedings; a ſingle hint would have ſaved her parent all the cruel mortifications to which ſhe was ſubjected; but this hint ſhe withheld!</hi> If conduct ſo reprehenſible is <hi>too groſs, even for a romping miſs, in purſuit of fun,</hi> how muſt it detract from the character of a pupil of the venerable Villars? <hi>Surely, Evelina ſhould not have been aſtoniſhed, (conſidering the propenſities of Madame Duval) at the ſlap which ſhe received in her face—and the unreſtrained violence of the old lady's diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, upon this occaſion, rather too conciliatory. An air of ridicule</hi> is thrown over this doleful narrative by Evelina, who, giving it in the manner of the poor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer, interſperſes it with ſuch ſentences as this—"<hi>I am ſure, I dare ſay, I am out of joint all over, &amp;c.</hi>" Evelina is a <hi>ſilent obſerver of the mirth of the ſervants, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that ſhe was, herſelf, almoſt compelled to laugh at the pity-moving recital!!</hi> For a conduct ſo unequal to every other inſtance of her blameleſs life, there can be but one reaſon, the fear of offending a <hi>ſea-monſter,</hi> on whom ſhe in no ſort depended, and from whom ſhe could, in any moment, eſcape to that ſanctuary, which had, for ſo many years, continued the aſylum of her innocence. But, if the fear of giving offence is an apology for Evelina, can it be conſidered as ſuch
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:034162_0449_0FFC6D7822CEB0B8"/>
for the venerable Villars, to whom every circumſtance is related, and <hi>from whom ſhe receives not the ſmalleſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof?</hi> It is impoſſible to inculcate upon the mind of young people too high a reſpect for years; age is ever entitled to veneration, and we ſhould regard the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of perſons in advanced life with the utmoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. It is true, that Madame Duval had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable to the mother of Evelina; but it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the young lady had embraced a vindictive plan; and it is alſo true, that the mother of Evelina had <hi>imprudently confided in a libertine!</hi> Nor can we oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe account for this raſhneſs, conſidering that ſhe too had paſſed eighteen years of her life with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable Villars, than by ſuppoſing ſhe inherited a portion of the imbecility ſo ſtrongly marked in the conduct of her parents. The agonies of Madame Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, on the death of lady Belmont, ſhould, to erring mortals, have palliated her offence; and it ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to have been remembered, whatever were her faults, or foibles, that ſhe was ſtill the grand-parent of Evelina.</p>
                           <p>At a tranſaction ſo enormous as the unprovoked attack upon Madame Duval, we conceive additional diſguſt, from the conſideration that it was perpetrated by perſons taking rank in a circle, which, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſuppoſe, was the ſeat of elegance. But, for the honour of human nature, I truſt, no one of its fraternity ever ſat for the picture of a Captain Mirvin. I know not what the Britiſh ſailors may be, but I have had an opportunity of making many obſervations upon various characters among that claſs of people in this country, and I have never yet met with a reſemblance to this extravagant caricature! Do but recur to his capital enormities, plotting ſo unwarrantably againſt a female, who was countenanced as a viſitor to the reſpectable Lady Howard; and, in the cloſe of the third volume, throwing the whole company, conſiſting of genteel, well bred perſons, into conſternation, alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ladies, and diſtreſſing every individual! Are you not ready to aſk, could exploits of this nature have
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:034162_0450_0FFC6D7654083838"/>
been ſubmitted to in any civilized country under heaven? The general terror excited upon that ſingular occaſion, (it is unneceſſary to obſerve that I refer to the introduction of the monkey) with the blood ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ear of poor Lovel, would have drawn upon the malevolent plotter of the outrage, the vindictive reſentment and conſequent chaſtiſement of a horde of ſavages.</p>
                           <p>Yet this invader of the rights of hoſpitality and betrayer of the peace of ſociety, is firſt announced to the reader, by the penetrating, refined and ſentimental Lady Howard, <hi>as the man of her daughter's heart, and as a perſonage, whoſe unexpected</hi> return had given birth to joyful ſurpriſe.</p>
                           <p>It is difficult to conceive how a lady of Mrs. Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin's refined ſenſibility, could ever unite herſelf to ſuch a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, having thus done, <hi>the propriety of her ſubſequent conduct will not admit a doubt.</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>The trivial ſcenes interſperſed through the pages of Evelina and Cecilia, are, it is ſaid, too frequent and too prolix; but I am not convinced of the juſtice of this remark; and I have to ſay, that whatever may be the defects (and no human performance is without its blemiſh) of thoſe ineſtimable productions, their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:034162_0451_0FFC6D74C7A1A4D0"/>
are of <hi>the firſt order.</hi> And I repeat, that their right to rank with compoſitions of the firſt claſs, in their line, is indiſputable.</p>
                           <p>The character of Lord Orville is indeed highly fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed; it is enriched with every virtue of which our nature, in its preſent ſtate of degradation, is ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Nor do I find it difficult to conceive of a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, diſcreet young man, whoſe mind has been early occupied by ſentiments of propriety, acting, upon ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery occaſion, preciſely as did Lord Orville. The ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable Villars may alſo be regarded at nearly faultleſs. The moſt beautiful paſſages in Evelina are to be found in his letters. How tenderly affecting is his addreſs to Lady Howard, by his Evelina! It can hardly be read too often.</p>
                           <p>Do you not think, my Margaretta, <hi>that I too, make my applications?</hi> But every heart muſt be intereſted in ſuch a character; and after having, in idea, followed with him his orphan child to the ordeal over which ſhe victoriouſly triumphed, we liſten, with inexpreſſible pleaſure, to his concluding addreſs.</p>

                           <p>I DO not blame your tears, my dear; the loſs of your young friend is a ſerious calamity, and it is natural to weep over our misfortunes. Horatio was a promiſing youth; his demiſe has overwhelmed with diſtreſs a worthy family, and the well grounded hopes of tender and judicious parents are thus laid in the duſt. But, my dear Margaretta, while I allow you to regret the removal of Horatio, I cannot juſtify your impaſſioned exclamation—"To what purpoſe was he ſo good, ſo wiſe, ſo learned, and ſo every way accompliſhed?" Does not my daughter know that virtue, tranſplanted to a celeſtial ſoil, will flouriſh with immortal beauty? The faculties, while embodied in this clay-built tenement, are <hi>literally</hi> muffled by the denſe and heavy materials, in which they are envel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oped. The mind is only in its dawn of being; but the valuable acquirements which it attains while here, are not, upon its emancipation, loſt; far otherwiſe—they are rather introductory to that career, which is to be continued and perfected in future worlds.</p>
                           <p>The ſtudent of hiſtory becomes acquainted with all thoſe characters that have borne conſpicuous parts upon the vaſt theatre of this globe. The philoſopher, devoted to the ſtudy of nature, attaining thoſe bliſsful regions, ſhall purſue, with abundant advantage, his delightful employ. The aſtronomer will behold, with aſtoniſhment, where other ſyſtems riſe! Suns, which

have not even theoretically darted a ſingle ray on his inquiring mind, will then burſt in reſplendent luſtre to his enraptured gaze.

                           <p>Thus the young Horatio may be conſidered as an amiable novitiate, who obtaining, while here, the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of ſcience, is now removed to a ſuperior ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inary, where every acquirement worth preſerving will receive the higheſt finiſhing of which it is ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. This reflection is a ſource of infinite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and often have I experienced its ſoothing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy. I was once tenderly attached to a youth, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, virtuous and informed as Horatio. His under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding unfolded with uncommon brilliancy; an inſatiable thirſt for knowledge gave him to purſue, with eagerneſs, thoſe branches of literature which were propoſed to his conſideration, and he acquired in his little ſpan, a vaſt ſtock of erudition, for which, alas! he had no uſe in time! From this youth I received even filial attention; but he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Thirdly, What were your ſenſations as you read, and what are your ſentiments of Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, Henry IV. of France, Charles I. of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and Peter the Great, Czar of Ruſſia?</p>
                           <p>And, fourthly and laſtly, although I do not enjoin you to weigh with accuracy the <hi>murders of a Cortez,</hi> although I expect you will paſs rapidly over the pages in which a Montezuma bled, and in which are regiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the maſſacre of an innocent and defenceleſs people; yet, my dear, I am ſolicitous to know whom you characterize as the moſt amiable of all thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, who, quitting the chalky cliffs of your native land, croſſed the broad Atlantic, to obtain eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in North-America?</p>
                           <p>It is by the careful inveſtigation of proper, great and virtuous actions, as performed by others, that the glow of emulation is enkindled in our boſoms.

                           <p>THANK you, my mamma, for permitting me to weep for Horatio; you are in all things indulgent; and I cannot but bluſh for an expreſſion of ſorrow, which is, indeed, unbecoming in a young creature, who has been privileged by receiving your inſtructions, and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your example. I will no more <hi>regret the virtues of Horatio;</hi> but I will endeavour to obtain thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements which ſhall render me a fit companion for him in that world whither he hath flown.</p>
                           <p>You, my mamma, have often been afflicted, and yet you are cheerful and happy! It will be my pride to tread in your ſteps, and for two very good reaſons; firſt, I ſhall thus become amiable and virtuous; and, ſecondly, I ſhall give joy to your maternal boſom. To be called your daughter, and to merit, in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that diſtinction, is my higheſt ambition; and while I am thought worthy to ſucceed the beloved child whom you mourn, I ſhall indeed be the happy Margaretta. The letters which you are to give me, are a new inſtance of your goodneſs; my treaſures are daily augmenting, and my gratitude ought to be proportioned.</p>
                           <p>I have again carefully looked over the volumes of biography and hiſtory, which I have ſo lately read in

your preſence; and, although they are all freſh in my memory, yet I can hardly tell how to give an opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion reſpecting them, and, but in obedience to the wiſhes of my Mother, I ſhould not preſume to expreſs my ſentiments.</p>
                           <p>Plutarch has recorded ſo many great actions, that I am almoſt loſt in aſtoniſhment while I read his pages; but, after heſitating who, of all his heroes, to name upon this occaſion, I have thought that as Ariſtides ſo generally obtained the appellation <hi>juſt,</hi> he muſt have poſſeſſed ſuperior excellence; and, upon attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examining his deeds of worth, I cannot ſay that he did not deſerve the title which he received. I am ready to aſk, Was not Ariſtides a perfect character? and, ſince you have put me upon the compariſon, I have taken the liberty to conceive, that there are not many of the Engliſh kings worthy to be compared with him.</p>
                           <p>If Edward VI. had lived, as he was ſo early re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for virtue and for learning, he might have exceeded all who went before; and I ſhould not then have heſitated in my anſwer to the ſecond queſtion of my dear mamma. The reply of the ſon of Henry VI. upon being interrogated by the prince whom he deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a uſurper, relative to his appearance in England, betokened an intrepid mind: But this youth was bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly murdered. Henry VII. was a good king; he is ſaid to have rendered his ſubjects powerful and happy, and to have wrought a great change in the manners of the people. Henry V. is a celebrated and victorious warrior. The Black Prince is rendered il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious by many virtues. Goldſmith tells us, that he left behind him a character <hi>without a ſingle blemiſh</hi>—that time could ſcarcely alleviate the ſorrows occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his death—that his affability, clemency, and lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral diſpoſition, is extolled by many hiſtorians; and that, although he was born in an age in which milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry virtues alone were held in eſteem, he cultivated the arts of peace, and ſeemed ever more happy in <hi>deſerving praiſe, than in obtaining it</hi>—<hi>But he was not a monarch.</hi>
                              <pb n="111" facs="unknown:034162_0457_0FFC6D6884158070"/>
Thomſon's Edward and Eleonara, has prepoſſeſſed my mind in favour of that monarch. Shall I, my mamma, greatly err, if I give the preference to the hero of the poet? Suffer me to point out a few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances wherein I have been charmed with the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that ſovereign.</p>
                           <p>At an early period, when Prince of Wales, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears fighting the battles of his father, whoſe rebellious ſubjects had taken arms againſt him. Fired by the inſults offered to his royal parents, he purſues and takes vengeance upon them; he ſubmits, with calm reſignation, to the hardſhips impoſed upon him, and becomes a voluntary hoſtage for his father: he extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates himſelf with great dexterity from the difficulties in which he was involved; he eſcapes from the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Leiceſter, and ſuddenly appearing the brave leader of his armies, his preſence inſures ſucceſs; he haſtes, with filial eagerneſs, to ſnatch his father from the threatened danger; he overcomes, in ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, the rebel Gordon, a veteran trained to arms, and ſkilled in combat! He does more; for, <hi>good</hi> as he is brave, he obtains his pardon, reinſtates him in the king's favour, and reſtores him to his family and eſtates! He mourned for his father with true filial ſorrow. When he came to the throne, <hi>he might have been deſpotic; but he contented himſelf with limited power.</hi> In the midſt of danger he diſcovered great intrepidity; no circumſtance could diminiſh his valour; he was never vindictive but when he conceived the exigencies of the State required it. We are informed, that he added much to the real emolument of his ſubjects; <hi>that he was ſolicitous for the tranquillity of the people,</hi> and was ſeldom arbitrary but with a view to their intereſt. He was devout, fond of juſtice, eſſayed to diſtribute it indiſcriminately, and <hi>confirmed the rights of the people.</hi> Such is the character of Edward I. and yet, methinks, many of his actions were deeply tinged with ſeverity.</p>
                           <p>To read the life of the Queen of Scots without tears, appears to me impoſſible. I prefer <hi>Doctor Stuart</hi> to <hi>Doctor Robinſon,</hi> and I view Mary as the moſt injured
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:034162_0458_0FFC6D6506091AE0"/>
of women. I cannot regard her as a murderer—I am diſtreſſed if ſhe is accuſed—I am fond of conſidering her as blameleſs. <hi>I do not love Elizabeth</hi>—I am aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed to find her at any time the object of admiration; and I feel diſappointed, that no remarkable calamity overtook her as a puniſhment for her cruelty to a woman ſo unfortunate and ſo meritorious! The Earl of Murray I deteſt, nor did I part with a ſingle tear at his aſſaſſination.</p>
                           <p>Henry IV. of France (excuſe the arrogance of your girl) was, I conceive, <hi>inferior</hi> to the Duke of Sully. I have been ready to think he owed his greatneſs, in many inſtances, to his miniſter; he is often extricated by him from his difficulties, and ſaved from the moſt diſhonourable connexions; yet the king is frequently angry with the duke without a cauſe. Beſides, <hi>the king was an apoſtate;</hi> and the duke of Sully, although im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned by his ſovereign, who enforced his arguments by the moſt ſplendid offers, preſerved his religion inviolate. The duke is tenderly attached to his family, while the king very ſoon enters into habits of intimacy with perſons who were ſuppoſed to have procured the death of his mother! nor does he pay much attention to the feelings of his ſiſter! And indeed I am ready to aſk, Was not the duke of Sully, as well as Ariſtides, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a fault? The action of Ravaillac was horrid, and, methought, I felt the wound which pierced the ſide of the king.</p>
                           <p>The fate of king Charles has coſt me unnumbered ſighs and tears. Surely, had the advances which he condeſcended to make, been accepted, he would have become the father of his people. The heroiſm of Lady Fairfax, at the trial of the unfortunate monarch, excites my gratitude and my admiration.

<pb n="113" facs="unknown:034162_0459_0FFC6D6268E2C818"/>
I behold the venerable ſufferer—I liſten to his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatic "REMEMBER"—I ſee his head extended on the block, his hands out-ſtretched! and I ſhudder at the fatal blow!—I turn from the bleeding trophy of rebellion!—I execrate the enemies of the martyred monarch!—I join in the lamentations of the deeply affected ſpectators; and, I think, I would not be Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth of England, nor Oliver Cromwell, although I might thus be raiſed to the empire of the whole world.</p>
                           <p>I take pleaſure in travelling with the Czar Peter; I admire him while in Holland and England. He was called great—but I had rather he had been leſs rigorous to his ſon.</p>
                           <p>You have taught me, Madam, to venerate the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters of thoſe matchleſs men, who, quitting their native country, and thoſe commodious habitations where they enjoyed the elegancies of life, croſſed the wide Atlantic, and took up their reſidence in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, where even the articles neceſſary to their exiſtence were with difficulty obtained; thus encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering various hardſhips, for the ſole purpoſe of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining liberty to worſhip God agreeably to the dictates of their conſciences; and I attend, with ſuperior ſatisfaction, to the actions of perſons, who were thus diſtinguiſhed for patience, fortitude and piety.</p>
                           <p>But, when I am required to ſay which I admire moſt, I again feel as when making a choice among Plutarch's Greeks and Romans; and I am ready to conceive, that the naming one would render me guilty of diſreſpect to the reſt; yet my mother would not put a queſtion to her girl unbecoming for her to anſwer, and I cannot but feel a pleaſure in accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating myſelf to her requeſts. Mr. Johnſon, of Clipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, ſeems to have exerciſed himſelf in acts of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards America; he was an upright and pious man; after his death, the people of Maſſachuſetts evinced the eſtimation in which they held him, by <hi>directing their bodies, as they departed out of time, to be interred around him.</hi> But the peruſal of the life of

Govenor Winthrop has given me inexpreſſible ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; he was early diſtinguiſhed in Suffolk, and his being appointed a juſtice of peace at the age of eighteen, is a ſtriking proof that he was ſuppoſed to poſſeſs ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior virtue. He enjoyed an eſtate of many hundreds a year; but he heſitated not in parting with every thing which was eligible in his proſpects, when they were ſet in competition with his integrity and his religion. Placed, by general conſent, at the head of the new formed colony, he was eleven times choſen its gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor, and it appears that he conducted with prudence and juſtice. The death of Governor Winthrop, who was ſtyled, the Father of the infant State, cauſed a general lamentation throughout the colony; and his virtues, it is ſaid, were many, while his errors were few—perhaps he had no ſuperior.</p>

                           <p>YOU have, my love, fully anſwered my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and I <hi>pronounce deciſively,</hi> (a liberty which you know I ſeldom allow myſelf to take) that few young women have made better improvement of their time and advantages than my Margaretta; and, as I am in the habit of gratifying all your reaſonable wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, I ſhall, according to your deſire, addreſs you in ſeparate letters upon the principal points to which I have required your attention.</p>
                           <p>I did not calculate on preciſion of compariſon from my daughter. Plutarch, after carefully collecting the materials for the lives which he hath written; after weighing every circumſtance, and digeſting them with that admirable regularity in which they are handed down to us, is often at a loſs to eſtimate the <hi>compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> excellence of his heroes. He narrates particulars, places them in a parallel view, and ſeems rather to leave the deciſion to his readers. My purpoſe, in the exerciſe which I have exacted, was to inſure your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate attention; well knowing, that the diſquiſition of a ſubject, a conference on its merits, and, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, thoſe reſearches which are requiſite to the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of an opinion that we are to commit to writing, is the moſt probable means of impreſſing the mind. Beſides, we cannot too often contemplate virtuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Stimulated by the approbation that will, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putably, ſooner or later, attend on rectitude, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:034162_0462_0FFC6D5A9BBEC880"/>
enamoured thereof, and, aiming at thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies which may entitle us thereto, we ſeek to implant in our boſoms every good and proper principle.</p>
                           <p>The heroes of antiquity, grouped together, may be conſidered as a ſplendid conſtellation, illumining thoſe tremendous periods, which, fraught with blood and murder, unveiled ſcenes that ſeemed to threaten the univerſal wreck of nature! Lycurgus, the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian legiſlator, evinced his integrity in the moſt ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions of his life; no difficulties were too great for his enterprizing ſpirit. Zealous for his country's weal, he endured every hardſhip; viſiting the learned men in various cities, that he might, by their collected wiſdom, become qualified to conſult the general good. His valour was equal to his love of information. In early life he was proof againſt the aſſault of perfidious beauty; he cheerfully reſigned royalty; and, although ſome of his regulations, apparently at variance with nature, may be deemed rigorous and cruel, yet we cannot call in queſtion his probity, nor the light in which he himſelf regarded his inſtitutions, when we find him voluntarily yielding up his life, in the hope of inſuring their perpetual operation.</p>
                           <p>Solon, the Athenian law-giver, united wiſdom and clemency; his philanthropy was demonſtrated by his <hi>remiſſion of debts,</hi> and his exempting the <hi>body from ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure in caſes of inſolvency.</hi> He abrogated the bloody laws of Draco, and equity was the baſis of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: He ordained, alſo, that no one ſhould <hi>ſpeak evil of the dead.</hi> Theſpis, the immortal father of the drama, was cotemporary with Solon.</p>
                           <p>Numa Pompilius was a virtuous prince. He ſeemed born to humanize the ferocity of the Romans; he cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated the arts of peace; and his ſuppoſed intercourſe with the goddeſs Egeria, giving him the aſcendency over the minds of the people, he became indeed a ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereign, and he employed his power for the emolument of his ſubjects. His acceptance of the royal dignity was in conformity to their perſevering importunity, and he juſtified their utmoſt confidence. His inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:034162_0463_0FFC6D579CD55900"/>
were deſcriptive of wiſdom; he erected public edifices; he ſhut up the temple of Janus; and, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he exerciſed ſovereignty for the ſpace of forty-three years, this temple was never again opened dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reign. Numa exhibited an example of juſtice, clemency and goodneſs; and the benign virtues of humanity prevailed throughout his dominions. The ſources of contention were cut off; the gentle breezes of complacency were abroad; the healthful and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillizing occupations of agriculture were diligently purſued; the authority of religion was eſtabliſhed; the people ſaw good days; feſtivity gladdened their hearts; and amuſements, under the auſpices of virtue, were eſtabliſhed. Italy aſſumed a face of confidence and contentment; an amicable intercourſe ſucceeded thoſe hoſtilities which had diſtracted the land; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of ſecurity obtained, and commerce revived.</p>
                           <p>Valerius became illuſtrious by his virtues. He was the <hi>friend of the people;</hi> his condeſcenſion to their feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings obtained for him the ſirname of Publicola. He demoliſhed, without heſitation, the ſuperb manſion which gave them offence; he inverted the <hi>inſignia</hi> of authority as he approached their aſſemblies; thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring his reverence for their ſentiments, and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of their ſovereignty. By theſe judicious conceſſions he cut aſunder the ſinews of envy, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed himſelf in the hearts of the many. He was the firſt Roman conſul that ever mounted a triumphal chariot; and the oration which he delivered at the funeral of Brutus, is ſaid to have originated that cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom among the Romans. Publicola enacted wiſe and equitable laws, and he communicated to his adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration the requiſite energy. He gave liberty to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, condemned by the conſuls, to appeal to <hi>the people.</hi> No perſon could legally exerciſe any office, who had not been elected by the free ſuffrages of <hi>the people; and he exempted the poor from any cuſtom,</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt of any deſcription!</hi> He ordained queſtors; he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed himſelf in acts of liberality; and he was induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious in eſtabliſhing all <hi>that equality which is conſiſtent
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:034162_0464_0FFC6D5615FE18B0"/>
with the regular adminiſtration of government.</hi> He was an intrepid warrior; he was victorious over the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his country; he was frequently elected conſul; his triumphs were repeated; and he died, honoured and regretted. The Roman ladies, to demonſtrate their high ſenſe of the merit of this illuſtrious citizen, <hi>appeared in black one whole year after his deceaſe.</hi> If Solon's definition of happineſs is admitted, <hi>Publicola was happy, for he was virtuous; he ſerved his country honourably as a legiſlator and a general, and his ſervices were gratefully compenſated. He died amid the continued victories of the republic, which had attained reſpectability under his auſpices; and to him is referred the ſplendor and anceſtry of the noble houſes of the Publicoloe, the Meſſalloe and Valerii.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Marcus Furius Camillus bore many honourable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices under the Roman commonwealth. Perhaps, if we except the Decii and the Regulii of the Roman hiſtory, it records few, if any lives, that exhibited more uniform and glowing patriotiſm. He was five times choſen dictator; and his deeds of worth rendered the family of Furia illuſtrious. The authority which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved ſingly upon himſelf, he judiciouſly communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and when he was aſſociated with others, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his underſtanding, giving him to <hi>originate</hi> every ſeaſonable and important regulation, rendered his ſuperiority apparent. It is remarked of him, that he <hi>commanded without envy,</hi> and that his contemporaries <hi>cheerfully</hi> yielded him the <hi>preference.</hi> It was during a conteſt relative to Camillus, that the Roman ladies evinced their patriotiſm by parting with their jewels; in conſideration of which, a decree paſſed the ſenate, that orations ſhould be pronounced at the funeral of meritorious women. The indignation with which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus received the infamous pedagogue who betrayed the Falerian youth, baſely conducting the ſtudents committed to his care into the Roman camp, and his equitable deciſion relative to the traitor, demonſtrates the wiſdom and integrity of his character; while his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, on that memorable occaſion, are deſcriptive of
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:034162_0465_0FFC6D525AACD3B0"/>
magnanimity, heroiſm and rectitude. <hi>War,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is of itſelf a ſufficient evil; oppreſſion, cruelty and bloodſhed are in its train: Nevertheleſs, the man of probity will ſtill ſquare his actions by the rule of right; he will not accept a victory obtained by perfidy; but he will truſt to his own valour to procure for him that deciſion, which the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his cauſe may authorize him to expect.</hi> Virtue, as it often happens, was, in this caſe, its own reward. The unexpected reſtoration of the Falerian children, with the marks of ignominy beſtowed upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious preceptor, were circumſtances which enkindled in the boſoms of the well near diſtracted parents, the moſt ardent veneration for the Roman character; and while their emancipated ſons extolled Camillus as their father, their god and their deliverer, ambaſſadors were immediately diſpatched to the Romans, and an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous and a bloodleſs peace was obtained.</p>
                           <p>Yet Camillus, at a period when he was involved in the deepeſt domeſtic calamity, when the cheek of the warrior was wet with the tears which fell over the early grave of the ſon of his boſom, became the victim of ingratitude! Arraigned by the ill-founded malice of the people, he anticipated judgment, and only eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped an ignominious ſentence, by ſubmitting to vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untary baniſhment. But, unlike Coriolanus, during his exile, his good genius ſtill hovered round the city of Rome, and, as her guardian angel, he watched over her for good. The Gauls attacked and deſtroyed the city, maſſacreing the ſenators in their robes of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but the exiled hero was fruitful in reſources, and his moſt arduous efforts were embodied for the relief of his deſolated country. As a private ſoldier, aſſociating with a veteran band, he obtained a ſignal victory over the common enemy; <hi>and, ſo ſacred did he hold the authority legally appointed, that he refuſed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which he was ſolicited to aſſume, until the repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives of the State, then beſieged in the capitol, ſhould elect him to that office!</hi> The heroiſm of an individual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the neceſſary inveſtiture; and, thus armed with <hi>regular powers,</hi> his actions proclaimed the patriot, the
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:034162_0466_0FFC6D50D70EC178"/>
hero and the warrior! He led an army againſt Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus; diſappointed the mercenary views of that Gaul; ſet the battle in array; obtained a deciſive victory; extricated his native city; entered Rome amid the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of the citizens, and was received with every poſſible demonſtration of joy! Camillus rebuilt the city of Rome, and was honoured by the appellation of its ſecond founder. He enjoyed, for the fourth time, that triumph which he had ſo well deſerved! In ſhort, he attained the higheſt ſummit of human glory.</p>
                           <p>Cincinnatus is enrolled in the brighteſt annals of fame! His magnanimity, his abilities and his moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation merit the ſublimeſt eulogy. Departing from the rural haunts of peaceful virtue, he ſaved Rome, obtained a triumph, and returned to that retirement, where he had ſo ſucceſsfully reared to maturity that noble patriotiſm, which, in the hour of danger, had nerved his arm, and led him forth to victory!</p>
                           <p>Cimon, the Athenian, it is ſaid, "<hi>poſſeſſed all thoſe qualities that dignify the ſoul.</hi>" He was zealous for his country's weal; his politics were upright; he was an accompliſhed general; modeſt, when raiſed to the higheſt employments and moſt diſtinguiſhed honours, liberal and beneficent, ſimple, and averſe to oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He had the glory of <hi>curbing</hi> the vanity of his countrymen, and diſſuading them from acting tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically; and he uniformly inveighed againſt that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity, which taught them to ſacrifice virtue to profit, and honour to power.</p>
                           <p>Philopoemen, <hi>produced in the old age of Greece,</hi> is characterized as the laſt of her ſons. He was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted warrior; he trained his countrymen to arms, and led them forth to victory: Many were his valorous deeds; and he continued, through a long life, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined enemy of tyrants. The integrity of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poemen was not to be corrupted; and ſuch were the impreſſions of his rectitude, that no Lacedemonian dared to offer him a bribe. The citizens of Sparta wiſhed to tender him the ſums, accruing from the ſale
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:034162_0467_0FFC6D4D80F5AAA0"/>
of thoſe valuable articles, which had been the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the tyrant whom he had ſubdued by his valour: But they were aware that much addreſs was requiſite, and they committed the buſineſs to Timolaus; who, after undertaking it, upon obſerving the wiſdom, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, temperance and moderation of Philopoemen, deſpairing of ſucceeding, pronounced him ſuperior to ſeduction, and returned to his employers without exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his commiſſion! A ſecond attempt was alike ineffectual; a third trial, however, enabled him to produce the gratuity; when Philopoemen, rejecting the largeſs, calmly obſerved to the Spartans, that it would be economical to reſerve their gold for thoſe <hi>unprincipled men, whoſe nefarious purpoſes</hi> might elſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the public ruin.</p>
                           <p>Philopoemen was the eighth time appointed general of the Achaeans, after he had completed the ſeventieth year of his age! What mortal could achieve he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought: But misfortunes overtook the winter of his days. He was impriſoned by Dinocrates; and when the impoiſoned chalice was placed in his hands, he queſtioned the meſſenger of death relative to the horſemen who were in his train, and upon being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed they had eſcaped, he replied with a ſmile, "<hi>It is well</hi>—<hi>we are not every way unfortunate;</hi>" and, ſwallowing the fatal draught, uttered not another ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence! The Achaeans revenged his death. The body of the hero was placed upon the funeral pile—the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated urn received the aſhes, and it was adorned with garlands of flowers. Polybius, the hiſtorian, conveyed it to his native city. The whole army, drawn up in ſolemn proceſſion, attended the venerable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. People, of all ranks and conditions, flocked from the towns and villages, to meet the ſad retinue; preſſing, with tears and lamentations, to touch and embrace that ſacred urn, in which was depoſited all that was mortal of him, who had ſo often delivered them from impending evil. He was interred with ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery demonſtration of reſpect; and ſtatues aroſe to his memory in all the principal cities of Greece.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="122" facs="unknown:034162_0468_0FFC6D4B59BDB0F0"/>
But Plutarch pronounces deciſively, that neither Philopoemen, nor any other warrior, can be compared to Titus Quintius Flaminius, in regard to benefits conferred upon the Grecian States. Titus combined gentleneſs of manners and piety with his valour. He was ſteady in his friendſhips; and his clemency to a conquered foe was exemplified in many inſtances. He was judicious in his arrangements: deliberation preceded his actions; and his bravery was tempered by wiſdom. Being victorious over Philip of Macedon, he left him in the poſſeſſion of his realm and crown; and he manifeſted great tenderneſs to the Etolians.</p>
                           <p>I pity the reader who is not elevated to a tone of extacy, when, borne on the wings of imagination, he preſents himſelf amid the aſſembled Grecians, and liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens to the proclamation of the Roman herald.</p>
                           <p>Greece had been torn by inteſtine diſſenſions, and alternately the prey of contending nations. At length, ſubdued by the Romans, ſhe looked for deſpotiſm and bondage. The Macedonians were expelled; they were totally diſpoſſeſſed of all their conqueſts in Greece, and their garriſons were, by conſequence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
                           <p>They were without a remedy, wholly at the mercy of the victor. That the Romans would relinquiſh the cities they had conquered, was improbable; the very idea was infinitely abſurd and romantic. Solacing themſelves, however, with the proſpect of that repoſe which peace might confer, they prepare to celebrate the Iſthmian games. A vaſt concourſe of people are aſſembled—every heart is replete with expectation—perſons of the higheſt rank mingle in the crowd—a decree is to be promulgated; <hi>a decree of their conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; and their fate hangs upon the lips of thoſe who have obtained the power of deciſion.</hi> Hope and fear alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail; but the moſt ſanguine expectancy could only calculate upon being indulged with a mild ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of government. See how the agony of ſuſpenſe is impreſſed upon every deeply intereſting countenance! Hark! the trumpet ſounds—ſilence is proclaimed—
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:034162_0469_0FFC6D48A804CFE0"/>
the herald advances into the centre of the ARENA—he is about to ſpeak—What will he ſay?—Huſh, huſh, let not a breath interrupt.</p>

                           <p>"<hi>IS not the character of Ariſtides perfect?</hi>" This is the preſent queſtion. Let us, my love, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a careful inveſtigation thereof, and our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer will follow of courſe. It appears that Ariſtides was, indeed, <hi>eminently virtuous;</hi> and, that although highly capable of friendſhip, his attachments could never render him unjuſt. His deciſions, when ſitting in the ſeat of judgment, were not influenced by a ſenſe of <hi>perſonal</hi> injuries. "<hi>Friend,</hi>" ſaid he, to a plaintiff who ſought to bias him in favour of his ſuit, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the aggreſſor as the adverſary of Ariſtides; <q>
                                 <hi>Friend, tell me only what injuries he has done to thee; for it is thy cauſe, and not mine, which I ſet to judge.</hi>
                              </q> He was modeſt, and averſe from oſtentation, nor was he ambitious of the pageantry of office.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="125" facs="unknown:034162_0471_0FFC6D4290D9E378"/>
He was highly patriotic; the public good was the prime object of his purſuit; and, to a conſideration ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, he cheerfully proſtrated his individual glory; yet, in fact, he thus rendered himſelf truly illuſtrious. I regard the action, by which Ariſtides relinquiſhed his authority to Miltiades, among the moſt ſplendid of his life; the conſequences were happy; he thus extermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the noxious ſeeds of jealouſy and contention, which, taking root, gave indications of a plentiful growth; and he taught the Grecian warriors the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of being led to battle by a veteran, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in the toils and arts of war; nor could inferior chiefs, thenceforward, refuſe to follow an example ſo evidently productive of general utility. Juſtice is ſaid to be the moſt prominent virtue which Ariſtides poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed; it raiſed him from the humble walks of life to the higheſt honours his country could confer; and the aſcendency with which it inveſted him, giving a colour to the plea, that the liberties of Athens were in danger, became the foundation of that verdict of the <hi>oſtraciſm,</hi> by which he was baniſhed. "Hath Ariſtides ever injured you?" ſaid the hero, to an illiterate ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who, ignorant to whom he applied, requeſted him to inſcribe the devoted name upon the ſhell. "Not in the leaſt," replied the cynic, "neither do I ſo much as know him; but I am weary of hearing every where of <hi>Ariſtides the juſt.</hi>"</p>
                           <p>His prayer, at departing from Athens, breathed the true ſpirit of that kind of philanthropy, which is nearly allied to Deity; and his conduct during his baniſhment, together with his coalition with Themiſtocles, taking meaſures, <hi>from devotion to the public good, to advance to the higheſt eminence, the reputation of an inveterate foe, gives him an incontrovertible right to that ſplendid immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, which is entitled to deathleſs praiſe.</hi> Who can ſet bounds to their admiration, when they behold the enterpriſing hero, bidding defiance to every danger—forcing his way, at the extremeſt peril, through the enemy's fleet, and ſuddenly preſenting himſelf in the tent of Themiſtocles, not with the language of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:034162_0472_0FFC6D40176D6020"/>
but in a tone that announced the friend of his country, glowing with unabating zeal for her intereſt, and ready to devote himſelf to her ſervice?</p>
                           <p>The virtues of Ariſtides ſeem, on this occaſion, to have attained the higheſt pitch of which humanity is ſuſceptible; the intrigues of Themiſtocles had procured his baniſhment, and the invidious calumniator was then inveſted with that authority, to which the ſervices and tranſcendent merit of the illuſtrious exile had given him an indiſputable title! Yet he is ſuperior to reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—he takes no retroſpect of injuries. The ſtate of Athens is in danger, and he utters not a recriminating ſentence! In one word, he approximates to divinity. The concentrated riches of the univerſe, in the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ariſtides, would not have been held as an equivalent for the liberties of Greece; and had he ſtill ſojourned in mortality, he would have waged war with her enemies, ſo long as the ſun and the moon endured.</p>
                           <p>His benign efforts were induſtriouſly employed to mollify the enkindling reſentments of chiefs, engaging in the common cauſe; and he gained every thing by his pacific interpoſition.</p>
                           <p>His addreſs relative to the diſaffected Grecians, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too much applauded; nor do I conceive, that, in this inſtance, he ſacrificed juſtice, ſince the two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, againſt whom he proceeded, were confeſſedly the <hi>moſt culpable,</hi> and the reſt were referred to the battle, as an ordeal, by which they might ſilence the clamours of accuſation, and produce a conviction that they had never imagined any thing prejudicial to the welfare of Greece. Ariſtides exemplified both his policy and his juſtice, by the decree which declared the victorious citizens alike eligible to the offices of government, and which authorized an <hi>impartial election of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                           <p>We find Ariſtides repeatedly oppoſing himſelf to the treacherous policy of Themiſtocles, and it appears that the Athenians at length knew how to appreciate properly, the abilities and the virtues of thoſe two

warriors. I have conceived a deſign, ſaid Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which will be of vaſt advantage to the State, but its ſucceſs depends upon its continuing a profound ſecret. Communicate your deſign to Ariſtides, cried the Athenians, and we will abide by his deciſion. The project was, to burn the combined navy of Greece, which conflagration would have inveſted Athens with ſovereignty. But one judgment can be formed of this ſcheme—it was infamouſly perfidious. "<hi>Nothing,</hi>" ſaid Ariſtides, as he gave in his report to the aſſembly—"<hi>could be more advantageous, and nothing could be more unjuſt.</hi>" We conceive a high idea of the <hi>integrity of the Athenians, and of their unbounded confidence in Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides,</hi> when we hear them, without waiting to inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, command Themiſtocles to relinquiſh his purpoſe.</p>
                           <p>The dignified condeſcenſion of Ariſtides induced the confederated forces to ſolicit his acceptation of the general command of their united army; and his matchleſs integrity conſtrained the Lacedemonians to ſupplicate the Athenians, that he might have leave of abſence, while he examined, in perſon, the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated revenues, and aſſigned to every citizen their due proportion of the expenſes accruing from the general burden of the war. Yet this perſonage, rendered illuſtrious by an aſſemblage of virtues, led a life of poverty, and daily practiſed a cloſe obſervance of the moſt rigid frugality. His candour and moderation were frequently apparent. Themiſtocles continued the determined foe of his virtues; yet he "<hi>refuſed to join in the proſecution of that citizen,</hi>" when his practices being unveiled, he was finally accuſed of capital crimes, and he poſſeſſed too much real dignity of mind, to inſult him in his misfortunes.</p>
                           <p>My Margaretta repeats her queſtion, "<hi>Is not the character of Ariſtides perfect?</hi>" I anſwer—we have hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto only attended to the fair ſide of his conduct. Perhaps Ariſtides attained to as much rectitude of life, as hath ever yet fallen to the ſhare of a being who is ſubject to the aſſaults of paſſion, who is the ſport of contingencies, and who too frequently finds himſelf
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:034162_0474_0FFC6D3ABB6E4778"/>
involved in a labyrinth of error. But neither Ariſtides nor any other <hi>mere mortal,</hi> ſince the defection of him who was placed in the garden of Eden, hath ever yet been, <hi>ſtrictly ſpeaking, wholly exempted</hi> from the effects of that imbecility, which, from the abovementioned pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, hath, more or leſs, pervaded human nature. But Plutarch ſays, "<hi>that he was firm and ſteady in his behaviour, immoveable in every thing that appeared juſt, and incapable of uſing the leaſt falſehood, flattery, diſguiſe, or deceit, ſo much as in jeſt.</hi>" True, he does ſo, and this very aſſertion is another proof of the imperfection of <hi>poor human nature.</hi> Plutarch is highly reſpectable as an hiſtorian, and yet his life of Ariſtides expreſsly contradicts this ſummary which he has given us of his character; for, beſides that, he ſeems to adopt the opinion, that the enmity of Ariſtides and Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles originated in an <hi>unwarrantable</hi> attachment, which they had mutually conceived to a beautiful individual. He repreſents <hi>Ariſtides the juſt</hi> as ſtrenuouſly combating a meaſure of great importance and advantage, <hi>merely becauſe it had been propoſed by Themiſtocles!</hi> I confeſs, on this occaſion, he acted in contradiction to the general rectitude of his mind; <hi>but he did act,</hi> and a conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the impropriety of his conduct, extorted from him a confeſſion, "that the Athenians would never be ſafe, <hi>till they threw Themiſtocles and himſelf into the Barathrum.</hi>"</p>
                           <p>I am aware that his matured judgment amply cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected this error; but neither were his riper years en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely free from blame. As a treaſurer, he diſcharged his truſt with that integrity which made ſo eſſential a part of his character; but upon ſurrendering up his accounts, being accuſed by Themiſtocles, and other nefarious incendiaries, of embezzling the public monies, although he was honourably acquitted by the <hi>chief and beſt men of the city, and continued in his office,</hi> he affected, during the courſe of a complete year, an utter derelic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his former probity; he courted the approbation of thoſe who robbed the public, and paſſed their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, without that equitable inveſtigation and detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:034162_0475_0FFC6D385248ADE8"/>
of treachery, to which he had been accuſtomed. It is true, that upon his ſecond re-election, he thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the privilege of rebuking the Athenians, by the following addreſs: <q>
                                 <hi>When I diſcharged my office faithfully and honourably, I was reviled and diſgraced: but now, when I have ſuffered your treaſury to be robbed by theſe public plunderers, I am admired and applauded at the beſt of citizens.</hi>
                              </q> It is alſo true, that this plan might be politic. Athens, thus warned, probably reaped the benefit in her ſubſequent regulations and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but ſurely it is a circumſtance which deſtroys the aſſertion of his biographer, for he appears during the tranſactions of a year, <hi>capable of "uſing falſehood and deceit."</hi> Thus, if we would not be miſſed, the neceſſity of an accurate inveſtigation of even the beſt authors, becomes obvious.</p>
                           <p>But having adjuſted our firſt point, we proceed to the ſecond. You have very naturally accounted for your predilection in favour of Edward I.; but your favourite poet has enriched the drama, by rendering another Engliſh monarch the hero of his production. Alfred the Great was ſurely not inferior even to Ariſtides. I will confeſs to you, my daughter, that I have never read the hiſtory of this prince without the moſt animated and pleaſurable ſenſations. I may be an enthuſiaſt in my admiration of his virtues; but he appears to me to have united in himſelf every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence which can dignify or adorn humanity; and I experience a degree of elevation, in the conſideration that this magnanimous monarch was of that order of beings, in which nature hath conferred on me, alſo, the gift of exiſtence.</p>
                           <p>Let us, my good girl, take a curſory view of the ſplendid actions which rendered illuſtrious one of the moſt diſtinguiſhed lives that is to be found in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of human nature.

of heroes, are rehearſed in his preſence, and his noble faculties are rouſed to action; an ardent thirſt of knowledge, and deſire of virtue, pervades his boſom, and his <hi>maternal parent</hi> cheriſhes the princely emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is thus happily originated. The elevated and penetrating genius of Alfred was ſuperior to every impediment. Both Engliſh and Latin were ſoon attained, and his progreſs in every uſeful and ornamental ſtudy was aſtoniſhing. The death of his father placed his brother Ethelred upon the throne, by whom he was deprived of his patrimony; yet, relinquiſhing at the ſhrine of public ſafety, his ſenſe of individual wrongs, he bravely fought the battles of his brother. Providence at length inveſted him with the ſovereign authority; but his dominions were previouſly reduced to the very brink of deſtruction, and his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects were indeed truly lamentable. The progreſs of the Danes was fearfully rapid. Agriculture was arreſted in its moſt eſſential operations—the grounds remained uncultivated—the ſacred temples were laid in aſhes—every reſource ſeemed cut off, and deſpair, with tremendous aſpect, ſtalked through the deſolated land! yet virtue, valour and wiſdom united in the perſon of Alfred—the trio was auguſt—it was equal to the moſt aſtoniſhing achievements—the clouds gradually diſperſed—every evil was redreſſed—and confidence, regularity and felicity were reſtored!</p>
                           <p>ALFRED, juſtly receiving the epithet GREAT, was anointed by Heaven, the deliverer, reſtorer and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of his proſtrate country; and although his firſt onſets were unſucceſsful, and the Danes ſtill continued their barbarous ravages, yet no misfortune could repreſs his heroic ardour; but yielding, for a ſeaſon, to thoſe melancholy neceſſities, impoſed by an enemy, rendered powerful by ſucceſſive victories, whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy no treaty could bind, and conſtrained alſo by the ſuperſtitious fears of thoſe few followers who remained, he relinquiſhed the enſigns of royalty, diſmiſſed his attendants, and, clad in a ſhepherd's garb, he took his way to the cottage of a herdſman, to whom his rank
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:034162_0477_0FFC6D3548AAE328"/>
was unknown; where, in this diſguiſe, he continued, impatiently expecting the hour, when he might advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly preſent himſelf, and reduce to practice thoſe preconcerted plans, which were to emancipate his bleeding country. Equal to every ſituation in life, he ſupported himſelf with propriety during this reverſe of fortune. Muſic conſtituted the prime ſource of his amuſement, and hope illumined his hours. Thomſon lays the ſcene of the moſt intereſting of his dramatic productions, in this rural abode of royalty. The Maſque of Alfred opens with a dialogue of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and his wife, reſpecting the ſtranger who reſided in their cottage. It commences in the following beautiful manner:

                           <p>The auſpicious era at length dawned, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed Saxons once more rallied round the ſtandard of their prince. But a hazardous enterprize remained;
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:034162_0478_0FFC6D2FDBD54650"/>
a knowledge of the numbers and ſituation of the foe was abſolutely indiſpenſable; and Alfred, at a loſs to whom to confide an undertaking ſo important, devoted himſelf to the perilous inveſtigation! In his ruſtic habiliments, with his harp in his hand, he paſſed the Daniſh lines—amuſed the ſoldiers—addreſſed in the moſt ſoothing ſtrains, the admiring officers; and thus procuring an introduction to the Daniſh prince, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with him many days; until, obtaining the requiſite information, he departed to that retreat from whence he iſſued thoſe commands which placed him at the head of an army, reſolutely determined to make for their lives and their liberties a vigorous ſtand! The conſequence was glorious. The Danes, aſtoniſhed to behold again in the field, a power which they had conſidered as totally annihilated, gave way on every, ſide; a deciſive victory was obtained; and, although thoſe who eſcaped, again intrenched themſelves, yet ſpeedily ſurrendering at diſcretion, they experienced the clemency of the conqueror. From this period Alfred continued victorious; a ſeries of brilliant ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes utterly expelled the treacherous invaders, while the fleet which he appointed, deſtroyed their veſſels, and defended the Engliſh coaſt. It was now that he attained the extreme acme of human glory. His territories were extended far beyond the domain of his predeceſſors. The Welſh monarchs acknowledged his ſuperiority; the Northumbrians accepted the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign whom he appointed; no enemy remained; and general peace was reſtored.</p>
                           <p>Twelve years of profound tranquillity enſued, and Alfred appropriated this interval to the originating, reſtoring and eſtabliſhing whatever could be conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as contributing to the welfare of his ſubjects, whom he regarded as his children. The cities rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged by the Danes, were rebuilt; a regular militia, well ordered and equipped, was embodied. He num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered and regiſtered the people, and, placing weapons in their hands, he taught them to defend themſelves. He divided the kingdom into claſſes, aſſigning to each
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:034162_0479_0FFC6D2E58ADD348"/>
a reſpective routine of duty; thus the lands were cultivated, while well appointed and duly regulated bands held themſelves in readineſs to repel an invading foe. The navy, alſo, obtained a due ſhare of his foſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing care; an able and completely furniſhed fleet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of one hundred and twenty ſhips of war, were ſtationed along the Albion coaſt; and the Engliſh, in this reign, became expert in ſailing and in naval en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements; and thus were ſucceeding incurſions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly repulſed.</p>
                           <p>He next turned his attention to the embelliſhment of the kingdom which he had thus delivered and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected; he enacted laws, and eſtabliſhed the moſt judicious regulations. The wiſdom of his civil inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions is highly celebrated. The trial by jury, that grand palladium of juſtice, is aſcribed to him; and to ſuch perfection had he conducted the ſyſtem which he originated, and ſo well did the morals of his ſubjects harmonize therewith, that he is ſaid to have ordered bracelets of gold to be hung up in the high-way, as a challenge to robbers, which bracelets remained in perfect ſecurity. He was the uniform friend and patron of literature; this neceſſarily ameliorated the manners, and humanized the habits of the people. He mounted the throne at a period when his ſubjects were enveloped in the moſt profound ignorance. The <hi>character of the age was ferocious;</hi> and the fluctuating ſtate of the Engliſh government, together with the depredation of the Danes more eſpecially, impreſſed upon that nation the features of barbariſm. The Latin tongue was almoſt wholly unknown in England; and Alfred took meaſures to allure to his dominions the moſt learned men of Chriſtendom. He renovated the Univerſity of Oxford, and conferred on that ſeminary many privileges. He was truly economical of his own time, regulating his hours to the beſt advantage, and appropriating them moſt judiciouſly: Grammar, rhetoric, philoſophy, architecture, and geometry, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a part of his ſtudies. He is celebrated as an hiſtorian; his knowledge in muſic is ſaid to have been
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:034162_0480_0FFC6D2A79D705A8"/>
reſpectable; and his poetical talents were in high eſteem. He was fond of allegory; he tranſlated from the Greek, the fables of AEſop; and many of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions are handed down to the preſent day! Thus did the example of the ſovereign furniſh a powerful incentive to application and improvement. He alſo liberally encouraged the mechanical arts. His palaces were conſtructed of brick, and his example was properly influential. He patronized manufactures of every deſcription; and every uſeful invention, was, by the munificence of the prince, ſuitably rewarded. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and navigation, which he invariably cheriſhed, furniſhed him with the elegancies of life; and England was at length taught how to appreciate the value of juſtice, tranquillity and induſtry.</p>
                           <p>"It was," ſays a reſpectable hiſtorian, <q>after a glorious reign of twenty-nine years thus ſpent in the advancement of his ſubjects' happineſs, that he died in the vigour of his age, and the full enjoyment of his faculties; an <hi>example to princes, and an ornament to human nature.</hi> To give a character of this prince, would only be to ſum up thoſe qualities which conſtitute perfection. Even virtues ſeemingly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, were happily blended in his diſpoſition; <hi>perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> yet <hi>flexible; moderate,</hi> yet <hi>enterpriſing; juſt,</hi> yet <hi>merciful; ſtern in command,</hi> yet <hi>gentle in converſation.</hi> Nature, alſo, as if deſirous that ſuch admirable qualities of mind ſhould be ſet off to the greateſt advantage, had beſtowed on him all bodily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments—vigour, dignity, and an engaging open countenance. In ſhort, writers have taken ſuch delight in deſcribing the hero, that they have totally <hi>omitted the mention of his ſmaller errors, which doubtleſs he muſt have had, in conſequence of his humanity.</hi>

brother, of the huſband of her youth, to whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſhe was <hi>fondly attached,</hi> and attended by her ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a few faithful followers, ſhe fled from her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive realm; when, encountering with heroic fortitude, the hardſhips inſeparable from her enterprize, ſhe found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or eſtabliſhed, the city of Carthage; ſhe enlarged and beautified it; ſhe incloſed it by a ſtrong wall, and erected in it a citadel; her ſubjects rapidly increaſed; ſhe laid the foundation of a flouriſhing commerce; and her adminiſtration combined juſtice, wiſdom and prudence. Her inſtitutions, and the form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſhe introduced, are pronounced by <hi>Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totle, the moſt perfect that had ever been known in the world;</hi> and Polybius informs us, that monarchy, ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy and democracy, all concentred therein.</p>
                           <p>Her attachment to the memory of her murdered huſband continued inviolable. Agreeably to the idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrous cuſtom of the times, ſhe ordered divine honours to be paid to him; and while ſhe was indefatigable in her endeavours to promote the advancement of her ſubjects, ſhe remained wedded to his memory; thus exhibiting a pattern of female delicacy, propriety and faithfulneſs. A conſciouſneſs of the happineſs which ſhe communicated tranquillized her boſom, and her life would have cloſed ſerenely, but for the intereſted propoſals of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

The Carthaginians, fearful of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their ſovereign by an explicit communication of the overture, practiſed that kind of punic ſubtilty, for which they were afterwards ſo remarkable; and the unſuſpecting Dido, enſnared by their addreſs, found herſelf in a ſituation, which, of all others, ſhe moſt deprecated. With ſtreaming eyes ſhe appealed to her deceaſed lord, and, continuing firm to her plighted vows, laying her hand upon her breaſt, with dignified reſignation ſhe pronounced.

The opening powers of her mind autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized the faireſt expectations; her diſpoſition was amiably mild, and her underſtanding was even ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did; ſhe was a proficient in elegant needle work; ſhe obtained an accurate knowledge of the Latin tongue; ſhe could converſe with propriety and fluency in French, Italian, and Spaniſh; ſhe attained a high degree of excellence in painting, poetry and muſic; her dancing was inimitable, and her movements com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined a grace irreſiſtibly enchanting. Many writers
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:034162_0484_0FFC6D2297F0C0F0"/>
have expatiated on the beauty and elegance of her exterior; and her perſonal and mental attractions, rendered her charming beyond any woman of the age in which ſhe lived. Her early years paſſed under the happieſt auſpices, and her marriage with the Dauphin, opened her way to the higheſt regal dignity. Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the throne of France, ſhe was placed in a ſphere which ſhe was well calculated to fill, and her talents and her virtues became properly conſpicuous.</p>
                           <p>But alas! how momentary was the bliſs!—the evaneſcent viſion ſoon fled, and the youthful queen was arrayed in the melancholy garb of widowhood! From this moment ſhe ſeems marked the daughter of ſorrow. The death of her mother rendered her return to Scotland indiſpenſable; and, with an aching heart, ſhe prepared to obey the dictates of duty. Is there, who ſhudders not, as ſhe receives, while yet in France, the homage of the contending parties? Gladly would we remove her from the toils and tumults of a turbulent adminiſtration, and ſhelter her amid thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial haunts which ſhe would dignify and adorn. Yet, conſcious of integrity, and with a heart glowing with the benevolent purpoſe of appeaſing conflicting paſſions, deſtroying animoſities, and healing every breach, ſhe prepared for her voyage to her hereditary dominions.</p>

                           <p>Elizabeth—the powerful Elizabeth, nearly allied to her in blood, but the determined foe of her virtues and her pretenſions, was irreconcileably offended by the early declaration which had been made of her right to the crown of England; and her inveteracy was apparent in almoſt every action; but the firmneſs and penetration of Mary was fully equal to every <hi>open</hi> and

Her anſwer to Throgmorton, while ſhe continued in Paris, relative to the treaty, binding her to abſtain <hi>forever</hi> from aſſuming the title and arms of England, was at once deſcriptive of her wiſdom and her addreſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the favourable ideas which were entertained of her character.</p>
                           <p>Elizabeth commenced hoſtilities by denying Mary a ſafe conduct to her dominions; and the remarks of the Scottiſh princeſs on this occaſion were ſpirited and proper. Taking leave of the royal family of France, at St. Germains, ſhe proceeded to Calais, where ſhe embarked for Scotland. And, connecting the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable circumſtances of her life with its tragical cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe, our ſenſibilities are rouſed almoſt to agony, as we witneſs her departure from a ſcene which had naturally engaged her fondeſt partialities. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantile joys, the ſoft indulgence, and foſtering care, which hovered round her morn of life, the felicity and dignity of her wedded days, paſſed in review before her, and her regrets were proportioned to the pleaſures ſhe had experienced—we acknowledge their propriety—we mark the deepening anguiſh impreſſed upon ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery feature—we hear her exclaim, as the Gallic ſhores recede from her gaze, "<hi>Farewel, France! Farewel, delightful country! I leave thee, never to return!</hi>" We liſten to the tender iteration; her perturbed ſighs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate upon our ears; the intervening ſhades of night officiouſly obtrude; and, with the lovely mourner, we watch the returning dawn; eagerly we catch a parting look, and we ſeem to inmingle our ſtreaming tears with thoſe of the royal ſufferer. Yet we bleſs the enveloping miſt which ſheltered her from the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſaries of the inhoſpitable Elizabeth; and when we behold her in her native dominions, amid the acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her gratulating ſubjects, we become ſolicitous to deceive ourſelves, and we would fain diſperſe, in theſe happy preſagements, the deep gloom which a knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of ſucceeding events hath thrown about the heart.</p>

For a time, the tendereſt conſiderations gave to the beauteous queen, in the boſom of manhood, an affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intereſt! Introduced into being during the calam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of her country—a ſovereign in her cradle—expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dangers while yet unconſcious of ſuffering—croſſing the ocean to receive that ſhelter her native realm could not afford—now mounting buoyant upon the wings of proſperity, and anon plunged from the higheſt elevation, and immerſed in all the anguiſh attendant upon the entire wreck of thoſe hopes which reaſon had authorized! Theſe circumſtances endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to the boſom of ſympathy; while her youth, her figure, her natural and acquired abilities, and the beneficent mildneſs of her diſpoſition prepoſſeſſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every heart in her favo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                              </gap>. The commencement of her adminiſtration demonſtrated a depth of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and a maturity of reflection, rarely to be found in the boſom of youth, beauty and royal birth. To the eſtabliſhment of the Proteſtant faith ſhe expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly agreed, reſerving only to herſelf that mode of worſhip to which ſhe was <hi>conſcientiouſly</hi> attached. Could the moſt uniform diſcretion have decided more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly? Juſtice would have awarded the ſtipulation, and loyalty would have evinced its gratitude by the moſt cheerful and exact obſervance. Yet, a fearful ſtorm began to gather; the queen was affronted in the exerciſe of her religion, and the renewed declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her pacific wiſhes was ineffectual, as a barrier, to the impetuous torrent of ferocious zeal, which was burſting upon her. She proceeded, however, in her tranquillizing plan; and <hi>an attempt at innovation in the eſtabliſhed religion was made death!</hi> But ſtill the brutal ſpirit of the times relented not: Knox proceeded in his inflammatory harangues, and his ſovereign was diſturbed and inſulted! <hi>Nature</hi> pointed out the Lord James Stuart <hi>(one of the leaders of the reformed religion)</hi> as a proper object of the queen's confidence; and ſhe accordingly beſtowed upon that nobleman ſtrong marks of her attachment: But alas! he was a wretch, who was ſeeking to elevate himſelf upon the ruin of her

from whom he derived his importance. Elizabeth, too, cheriſhed the moſt malignant paſſions, ſuffering her hatred to her rival to reach the extreme of rancorous malevolence! But Mary, although ſurrounded by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate foes, who were variouſly intereſted in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, borne forward on the ſtream of innocence, and fanned by the gales of conſcious rectitude, purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſteady and equal courſe. Strange, that to a conduct not only <hi>unexceptionable,</hi> but highly <hi>meritorious,</hi> the profeſſors of the <hi>mild and peaceable doctrines of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity</hi> ſhould unnaturally oppoſe themſelves, <hi>inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently</hi> taking rank with the moſt determined of the queen's enemies! Open, generous, inexperienced and confiding, ſhe embarked againſt ignorance, bigotry, perfidy and the moſt ferocious cruelty; and, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſo unequal, it cannot be matter of aſtoniſhment, that ſhe ultimately became the ſacrifice.</p>
                           <p>Many ſources of inquietude combined; parties were daily more and more exaſperated; the age was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely profligate; and events, truly diſtreſſing, which human efforts could neither foreſee nor prevent, were almoſt hourly ſucceeding. The queen, ſuperior to partiality, referred offenders to a court of law, and only interfered by extending her royal clemency, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as the ſafety of her ſubjects and her perſonal ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity would admit. The animoſities of the diſaffected nobles filled her with the deepeſt regret; whatever party prevailed, joy was a ſtranger to her boſom; the ſympathies which ſhe experienced for the ſufferers, barred the entrance of pleaſure; and her mind, accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to the refinements of ſcience and of reaſon, the abode of the virtues and the graces, was now, by ſtern neceſſity, ſurrendered up a prey to anxiety, perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a hoſt of fearful apprehenſions. In a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thus cruelly embarraſſed, ſhe became ſtill more ſolicitous to ſecure the amity of the Engliſh queen. Negociations for an interview were opened, and on her part, every advance, conſiſtent with regal dignity, was cheerfully and ſincerely made. But hatred is a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poiſon, and no emollients can arreſt its progreſs.

The nefarious duplicity of Elizabeth was triumphant; and after the place and time of their meeting was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, ſhe had the addreſs to delay, and finally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to ſet aſide this deſirable event!</p>
                           <p>Without a friend—deſtitute of a protector—no guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian hand to point the better way, we ſpontaneouſly lament the fate of a woman ſo young, and ſo environed by danger. The daring attempt of Chatelard was a ſpecimen of the evils to which ſhe was ſubjected; but his ſucceeding puniſhment ſhould entirely free her from the ſhadow of ſuſpicion. Propoſals of marriage were made her by many crowned heads: while the claſhing intereſts of contending parties, and their conſequent intrigues, ſeemed an inſuperable bar to a conjugal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. Elizabeth, oppoſed in every poſſible ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to the advancement of Mary, even <hi>exceeded her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in adroitneſs of fineſſe,</hi> relative to her marriage. She was indefatigable in raiſing obſtacles thereto; and ſhe dictated, remonſtrated and objected, in a ſtyle ſo imperious, that if the Queen of Scots had not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed unequalled diſcretion, would have procured an utter dereliction of her conciliatory views; but her reverſionary expectations, relative to the crown of England, ſtill kept her true to her ſyſtem.</p>
                           <p>At this criſis of affairs, the feminine heart will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a high degree of exultation, at the view of Mary taking her ſeat in the great council of the nation. See! ſhe looks, ſhe moves a queen. She is ſolicitous to imprint upon the public mind the moſt favourable impreſſions: All the dignity of majeſty is blended with the moſt benign demonſtrations of complacency. She enters the ſenate-houſe—the inſignias of royalty are diſplayed—ſhe is richly habited—ſhe is beautiful as the daughters of paradiſe—ſhe aſcends the throne—ſhe addreſſes the three eſtates—perſuaſion dwells upon her lips—and her words are replete wiſh affection, wiſdom and prudence. Lovely woman! how ſavage and how unrelenting was that premeditated and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined cruelty which decreed thy ruin!</p>
                           <p>

It was at this juncture that the Proteſtant preachers renewed their clamours; the improvements originat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the queen, were made to aſſume the hue of criminality; and even the ornaments of her perſon became the ſubject of their inflammatory declamations. With that ſevere reformer, Knox, Mary condeſcended to expoſtulate: He had laboured to procure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the adherents of the maſs! What deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſolence! How cruelly inconſiſtent would he have rendered the adminiſtration of his ſovereign! and how inſulting were the importunities which directed her <hi>to execute</hi> perſons for thoſe religious obſervances, <hi>which ſhe herſelf practiſed,</hi> and from which ſhe derived her moſt ſolid enjoyments! Mary repreſented to Knox the <hi>inclemency of intoleration, and the horrid barbarity of devoting men to death, merely for an opinion.</hi> It is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to conceive of words or ideas more ſhockingly groſs, than thoſe which conſtituted his indecent replies. <hi>Samuel hewing Agag to pieces; Jezebel's falſe prophets, and Baal's prieſts</hi>—theſe were brutally held up to view, until <q>

Yet her firmneſs remained unqueſtionable; and ſhe <hi>equitably</hi> determined not to deprive of <hi>life, tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> nor <hi>eſtate, merely on account of religious ſentiments.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The queen endeavoured to excite the officers, in their different departments, to a performance of their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive duties, by an augmentation of ſalaries. She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in perſon in the courts of law, exciting emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and accelerating the courſe of juſtice; thus dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onſtrating her early attainments, and her right to the utmoſt reſpectability of character. She was ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to eſtabliſh herſelf in the hearts of her people; and
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:034162_0490_0FFC6D1210A951E0"/>
ſhe was laudably ambitious of fame. May the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Heaven reſt upon that hiſtorian, who hath, at this late period, renewed thoſe laurels, which, plucked by the rude hand of prejudice and ſuperſtition, might elſe no more have wreathed the brow of ſo meritorious a candidate for excellence.</p>
                           <p>The revolt of the Earl of Murray was attended with circumſtances of aggravated atrocity; but was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs excited and abetted by Elizabeth.</p>
                           <p>Mary at length effectuated her marriage with Lord Darnley. The exterior of this nobleman was prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing, his addreſs captivating, and the queen was tenderly attached to him. It was not a connexion calculated to excite the jealouſy of Elizabeth; it was <hi>primarily concerted by herſelf;</hi> yet it conſiſted with her inſidious policy to <hi>affect diſpleaſure;</hi> and, poſſibly, <hi>the few halcyon</hi> days allowed to Mary, might be to Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth a ſubject of ſerious regret.</p>
                           <p>At this period, the majority of the Scotch preſerved their loyalty, and the people in general entertained proper ſentiments of the diſſimulation and intrigues of Elizabeth. The feſtivity, conſequent upon the royal nuptials, gave place to hoſtile preparations! The queen, at the head of a formidable army, appeared in the field; the Earl of Murray and his adherents were put to flight, and immediately took refuge in England; while Elizabeth, with her accuſtomed duplicity, ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly patronized, and oſtenſibly condemned them. Mary, having thus conducted to an honourable iſſue an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ſufficiently alarming, might have taſted the ſweets of domeſtic peace and tender amity, had ſhe not been written in the book of fate, irreverſibly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate.</p>
                           <p>Darnley poſſeſſed a mind incapable of a refined at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment. His capacity was below a mediocrity! Thoſe ſuperficial accompliſhments, which captivate at firſt ſight, ſoon loſe their effect; and Darnley, alas! could not command eſteem! He was arrogant, haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and jealous; no entreaties could ſubdue his obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and he was at once inconſtant and inflexible, rude
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:034162_0491_0FFC6D0FA36B65E8"/>
and contemptible. In ſhort, the queen too late diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered a melancholy truth; and painful experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced her that ſhe had made a moſt unworthy election! But although love, ſpreading its downy pinions, fled from the boſom of Mary, (and it is too certain that its place was not ſupplied by eſteem) yet <hi>virtue,</hi> regent in her breaſt, continued the bulwark of her honour. A ſenſe of duty took the lead, and kept her ſteady in the path of rectitude. It is true, ſhe wept the precipitancy of that ſtep which had decided her fate; but, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Lord Darnley's coldneſs, and unmerited neglect, although inconteſtible proofs of his infidelity were frequently furniſhed, yet ſhe ſtill remembered that he was her huſband, and failed not to conſider what was due to her own character, as a wife and a queen.</p>
                           <p>The ſuppoſition that Mary was improperly attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Rizzio, could only have originated in the dark boſom of prejudice, heated by bigotry, and ſtimulated by the extremeſt rancour. Rizzio was old, ugly and misſhapen—and "it is a wild abſurdity to imagine that the queen would ſubmit to the careſſes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and old age." His aſſaſſination in her preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, at a time when her intereſting ſituation ought to have engaged the utmoſt tenderneſs of her huſband, (eſpecially when her high dignity and ſuperior accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments are remembered) was indeed a barbarous outrage, and muſt ſhock even the moſt phlegmatic feelings of humanity. The ſubſequent treatment of the queen; the drawn dagger, pointed at her boſom; the tremendous threats which were ſounded in her ears; her impriſonment, and the audacious reproaches to which ſhe was ſubjected; the attempt to infix upon her unſullied honour an indelible ſtain; and all theſe atrocities paſſing under the eye, and ſanctioned by the man on whom ſhe had conferred the higheſt honours, and even raiſed to a throne—theſe aggravating circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances rank this black tranſaction, when conſidered in all its parts, among the moſt horrid and enormous crimes which were perpetrated in thoſe days of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude and murder. Yet even theſe deep tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:034162_0492_0FFC6D0E1FB7EB38"/>
a diſpoſition ſuperior to malignity, enabled the queen to forgive—ſhe conſented to a reconciliation with the king—ſhe approbated an act of amneſty—ſhe remitted the offences of the delinquent Murray, who again ſought his own emolument in a reſtoration to her favour—and obſerving, with an air of dignity, that ſhe utterly deteſted every ſpecies of inhumanity, ſhe nobly ſanctioned the act of oblivion.</p>
                           <p>While the barbed ſhafts of misfortune were thus piercing the boſom of the Queen of Scots, a white moment was however at hand; and when ſhe uſhered into being her firſt-born ſon, ſhe in that inſtant forgot all thoſe ſorrows which, with ſuch accumulating weight, had preſſed upon her. The birth of the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al infant was celebrated in Scotland by every poſſible demonſtration of joy—while Elizabeth mourned this event, as a ſerious calamity! Alas! alas! how do the virtues fade in that boſom, into which the deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fiends, <hi>jealouſy</hi> and <hi>envy,</hi> have made their deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating entrance!</p>
                           <p>At this period, we are again conſtrained to regret the uniform unworthineſs of the king, and his total deficiency in all thoſe qualities inherent in a noble mind. But his haughtineſs was ſtill unſubdued! Yet, through all the deepening glooms which he ſo injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly aſſumed, through all his ungrateful returns to the tenderneſs of the queen, even to the hour of his melancholy exit, we trace, on her part, a uniform ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplification of prudence and virtue; and we repeat, that the precepts of religion, together with an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſenſe of the delicacy of her ſituation, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſhe owed to virtue and to herſelf, was, in her boſom, an effectual ſubſtitute for that affection which the demerits of the king had baniſhed from thence!—To-morrow, my dear, we will purſue this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting ſubject.</p>

                           <p>MARY, utterly averſe to the departure of the king, oppoſed it by every proper method; and her condeſcenſion, upon this occaſion, was truly amiable, truly feminine. But his peeviſhneſs and his obſtinacy remained invincible, and it was in thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting moments that he conceived the ungrateful deſign of diveſting Mary of that ſovereignty to which ſhe was born—of placing the crown upon the head of his infant ſon, and of aſſuming, as his father, that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he was ſo ill qualified to maintain. Yet the queen, although apprized of theſe proceedings, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the mild ſyſtem ſhe had adopted; and, while her hours of retirement were devoted to ſorrow, ſhe continued in public, to diſguiſe her grief by an aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gaiety; and her elegance, urbanity and native dignity, prepoſſeſſed in her favour all thoſe with whom ſhe aſſociated.</p>
                           <p>The perturbed ſituation of her mind brought on, however, a dangerous illneſs: It was apprehended her laſt moments were at hand: and ſhe yielded herſelf, with holy reſignation, to her fate. The king contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued unmoved, nor deigned, even at the moment when her death was pronounced inevitable, to make her a ſingle viſit. But ſhe was reſtored to health; and in the ſucceeding indiſpoſition of the king, ſhe exhibited a reverſe of conduct, which reflects the higheſt honour upon her principles and her humanity. Uninfluenced by the remonſtrances of thoſe who eagerly ſolicited her to procure a divorce, her huſband's danger awakened the tendereſt ſympathies of her generous boſom, and ſhe ceaſed, in the calamity of the moment, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber her manifold injuries! Days and months had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:034162_0494_0FFC6D0679F56318"/>
and their lenient influence had blunted her keen ſenſe of the wrongs ſhe had received. She was by nature placable; her anger reſembled the paſſing cloud, which, for an inſtant, intercepts the mildly beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing radiance of day; and while her ſtreaming eyes evinced her grief, no vindictive paſſion harboured in her boſom! Her tender melancholy paved the way to the renewal of her affection, and every ſenſe of diſobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, every idea of his inferiority, like the viſion of ſome dark and comfortleſs night, inſtantly vaniſhed away. The king too, placed, in his own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, on the verge of diſſolution, experienced the ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſations of remorſe; and he reproached himſelf, in the bittereſt terms, for his ingratitude to the queen. The news of his relenting was expeditiouſly conveyed to her; and all that impaſſioned tenderneſs he had originated in her boſom, ruſhed upon her memory—the felicities of wedded amity—the hour, which in the bloom of youth, and the full perfection of her perſonal charms, devoted her to Darnley—the lovely infant whom ſhe hourly preſſed to her boſom—theſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting conſiderations obtained in her mind their due weight; and, quitting her palace in the depth of he wintry months, ſhe haſtened to attend him; with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate aſſiduity ſhe hovered round his bed of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment, and her preſence, and her endearments op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated as the ſweeteſt ſolace; the mind of the king became tranquil, and health again glowed in his veins. He accompanied the queen to Edinburgh, and her demonſtrations of fond ſolicitude were unwearied.</p>
                           <p>It was at this juncture, that the nobles, who, by an aggravated repreſentation of the king's offences, had cheriſhed the reſentments of the queen, apprehenſive that the conſequences of the reconciliation between the royal pair would be deſtructive to themſelves, contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and perpetrated the murder of the king! The ſuppoſition that Mary was acceſſary, conſenting, or even privy thereto, is devoid even of the ſhadow of probability; It was forged in the dark haunts of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and credulity; and it is confuted by a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:034162_0495_0FFC6D04F50B21D0"/>
ſeries of well atteſted facts—by the mildneſs, moderation, tender ſympathy, and genuine piety, which were conſpicuous traits in the character of the queen—by the teſtimony of many who endured the extremeſt torture—by the dying aſſeverations of all thoſe who were executed for this crime—and by the declaration of Bothwell, who, having dragged out a number of years in cloſe impriſonment, in his laſt moments made a complete confeſſion of his own guilt and her innocence. The anguiſh, horror and conſternation of the queen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the fatal intelligence, were equal to the enormity of the crime which had been perpetrated; and ſhe affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if her kingdom and her life were the forfeit, all thoſe who had procured a cataſtrophe ſo ſhocking, ſhould be proſecuted to the death. She called on her aſſembled nobles to aſſiſt her in her juſt purpoſe, of delivering up to condign puniſhment, offenders ſo atrocious; and, with ſtreaming eyes and heart-affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earneſtneſs, ſhe conjured them to leave no means uneſſayed, which might involve the remoteſt probabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of a ſurrender ſo important. She pathetically la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that in a moment, when the ſunny beams of hope had reviſited her boſom, when the clouds, which gathered round her proſpects, had began to diſperſe, and the ſerene pleaſures of domeſtic life were opening to her view, ſhe ſhould thus fatally, by the audacious hand of guilt, be overwhelmed in ſorrow, and conſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over, the hapleſs victim of a tranſaction, dark, une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled, and tremendous!</p>
                           <p>The circumſtances attendant upon the king's death, were ſufficient to enkindle in the boſom of humanity the keeneſt regret: and to this cauſe the extreme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Mary is to be attributed. The moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate and meritorious of men could not have been lamented with more unequivocal demonſtrations of grief. Immured in the deep receſſes of her caſtle, ſhe reſigned herſelf to the moſt lively ſorrow: her apartments were hung with black; the light of the ſun was excluded; and the faintly burning taper but ſerved to mark the glooms which hovered round her.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="150" facs="unknown:034162_0496_0FFC6D0370784788"/>
But emerging at length, from this extreme of grief, ſhe adopted the moſt vigorous meaſures for appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the regicides. Many circumſtances produced in her mind a perſuaſion, that the conſpirators had aimed at involving her in the king's death, and her orders for the proſecution were unequivocal and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. The ſum of two thouſand pounds, together with an annuity for life, was tendered to any individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual who ſhould give information of the perpetrators of this horrid tranſaction; and this largeſs, with the addition of a free amneſty, was proffered to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirator, who ſhould make an unreſerved diſcloſure of his own guilt and that of his accomplices. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this proclamation, placards were affixed in various public places, accuſing the Earl of Bothwell, and others, as the murderers; but as thoſe papers and placards inſinuated, that <hi>the queen herſelf had been a party concerned,</hi> ſhe very juſtly eſtimated their innocence by her own. Bothwell, ſolemnly atteſting his integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, loudly demanded a trial, and he inveighed bitterly againſt his calumniators; no poſitive proofs were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced of his guilt; the Earl of Lennox alone appeared againſt him, and not a ſingle witneſs to corroborate the charge was produced. The queen's council <hi>affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to conſider Bothwell as the ſubject of rancorous malice; the <hi>principal nobility warmly eſpouſed his cauſe,</hi> and they charged the Earl of Lennox with acting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of the moſt ignoble paſſions. The queen had frequently remarked that Lennox was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious, revengeful and paſſionate. The defamation, in ſuch general circulation, might probably reſult from his arrangements; and beſides, the impreſſion that the aſſaſſin was armed againſt her own life alſo, being indelibly infixed upon her mind, a deſign ſo atrocious, with reſpect to her, could not conſiſt with the unbroken fealty, and uniform homage, which the conduct of the Earl of Bothwell had invariably exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified. Bothwell was, however, brought to a public trial, and the jury acquitted him of all ſhare in the king's murder! I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> may be deemed, it cannot arraign the conduct of the queen; nor can ſhe, by any rational conſtruction, be involved in its guilt. Circumſtances, relative to the criminality of Bothwell, which have ſince tranſpired, were then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped in myſtery; yet, that there exiſted preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proofs, ſufficient to juſtify the ſtrongeſt ſuſpicions, cannot be denied; and, moreover, his licentious habits forcibly pointed the public odium.</p>
                           <p>The queen remained in entire ignorance of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns formed upon her by Bothwell; his behaviour indicated, in her apprehenſion, nothing more than that reſpectful attachment which was due to his ſovereign; ſhe was grateful for his zealous exertions to promote her intereſt; ſhe regarded him as a man of talents; and ſhe allowed him that conſideration, which ſhe conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed due to his abilities. Her unprincipled nobles, however, induſtriouſly ſeeking her ruin, agreed, amid the tumultuous riot of a banquet, to point out this man of crimes as a proper perſon to become the huſband of their ſovereign! and they ratified a deed, in which they extolled the integrity of Bothwell, the antiquity of his lineage, and the eſſential ſervices he had render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtate. They expatiated upon his trial for the murder of the king, upon his ſubſequent offer to meet his accuſer in ſingle combat, affirming them to amount to a perfect juſtification of his innocence; and they declared themſelves fully convinced of his integrity.</p>
                           <p>Bothwell was now in the preciſe ſituation at which his audacious wiſhes had long pointed. His ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſeizure of the queen was the finiſhing ſtroke, and fully completed his nefarious climax of villany. Mary's infinite aſtoniſhment at ſo daring an act of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated violence, from a man whoſe ſubmiſſive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had given her the higheſt idea of his reſpectful fidelity, and the bitterneſs and indignation which ſhe expreſſed, correſponded exactly with the whole tenor of her preceding life. Her reſentment was the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of outraged virtue, and her reproaches character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized

the queen and the woman, offended in a manner <hi>too atrocious to be forgiven.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Hitherto we have contemplated Mary as an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to humanity. She hath ſtruggled with many evils—ſhe hath frequently been deeply injured—but ſhe hath paſſed the ordeal brightened by calamity. Her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, her fortitude and her perſeverance have given her to emerge from every cloud; and from the hour of her birth, to the era now under contemplation, while there hath been an ample field for commendation, there hath been little to extenuate. <hi>Would that we could blot from the hiſtory of Mary, the name of Bothwell.</hi> Over a connexion ſo fatal we would drop the curtain. <hi>Surely, ſurely, it ought never to have taken place</hi>—<hi>it was, in every view, improper! Delicacy, virtue, and all thoſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are peculiarly ſexual, receive, by this tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the moſt lovely and deſerving of women, a fatal ſtab! and the tearful eye of humanity weeps over the many woes to which it was introductory.</hi> If Mary poſſeſſed no means of eſcaping from the captivity, in which ſhe was held by Bothwell, ſhe ſhould have repelled, to the utmoſt of her power, every act of perſonal violence; and thoſe injuries which ſhe could not avoid, would neither have contaminated her mind, nor infixed a ſtain upon her honour. <hi>The reception of the unprincipled offender, as her huſband, ſanctioned his guilt; and, in this inſtance, effectually proſtrated her own character! Mary ſhould have died, rather than have taken this ſtep!</hi> The bond, obtained from the nobles, may, and undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does, <hi>greatly palliate the buſineſs;</hi> but a high degree of culpability remains. Alas! alas! this is an indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtain, nor can any proceſs, however ingenious, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from a character, which impels both our love and admiration, a ſpot which female dignity will not ceaſe to deplore! We cannot, <hi>in this particular,</hi> agree with the elegant hiſtorian of Mary; nor can we acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, that "<hi>recent terror</hi>" (eſpecially if thoſe terrors are produced by the <hi>nefarious practices of an audacious offender</hi>) the more readily diſpoſeth the mind to give admittance, in favour of the violator, to the ſofter paſſions.</p>

But we dwell with pain on this part of the career of our heroine. The ſun, we know, admits of ſpots; and no human being, we have already concluded, is exempt from error. The calamities which, from this period, in rapid ſucceſſion overtook, and finally whelmed beneath their combined preſſure, this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting unfortunate, if they cannot <hi>obliterate,</hi> do, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, <hi>abundantly expiate;</hi> and it ſhould ever be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that ſhe was encompaſſed about by ſubtil and deſigning adverſaries, who ſought their own exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in her deſtruction! who, notwithſtanding the ſolemn inſtrument with which they had armed her ſeducer, delayed not to embody their adherents; and after taking every method to blacken the reputation of their ſovereign, thereby exciting againſt her the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic odium, made haſte to appear in arms, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of oppoſing her authority! It was not enough that they had confederated to ſtrip her of fame and tranquillity; ſhe muſt alſo be deſpoiled of her crown and ſceptre, and abridged of that liberty, which is the nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural right of every human being! With humid eyes we have attended to the forlorn ſufferer! we have marked her perturbation, her diſtreſs, and the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating inſults which ſhe received from him, who had become her huſband! his rude, indecent and brutal behaviour has excited our utmoſt indignation; we have beheld thoſe reiterated indignities and calam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, arming the hand of the deſpairing queen againſt her own life! and we have unheſitatingly exclaimed—Surely, there is no ſpecies of ſuffering to which ſhe is not ſubjected! Her ſeparation from the finiſhed vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, who had ſo treacherouſly betrayed her, and her voluntary ſurrender to the confederated nobles, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed a temporary relief; while their reſpectful recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, and flattering addreſs to their ſovereign, ſoothes, for a moment, our fondeſt wiſhes for her reſtoration. Had the leaſt ſpark of humanity or integrity remained among them, the queen had been ſaved. But it was a diſſolute age; the reign of perfidy had commenced; black clouds gathered; and the ſtorm advanced, tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendouſly terrific!</p>

We follow the queen to her impriſonment; we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, with glowing reſentment, the freſh inſults to which ſhe is ſubjected; we mingle our tears with the ſympathetic multitude, who lament the degraded maj<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty of their ſovereign! we liſten to her ſorrows; our attachment to the beauteous mourner is augmented, and we are ardently ſolicitous to ſnatch her from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending danger! The renewed duplicity of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles fills us with deteſtation and horror; yet we can ſcarcely forbear to do homage to that credulity and "<hi>beautiful humanity,</hi>" which characterized her, even in the moſt melancholy ſituations of her life. By the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of her enemies ſhe was now completely envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned—<hi>letters from her to her ſeducer were forged</hi>—and ſhe was, alas! irretrievably undone. See! ſhe is ſtripped of her robes of royalty!—ſhe is meanly attired!—ſhe is cloſely immured within the walls of a priſon!—and ſhe is committed to the cuſtody of a perſon, <hi>who from powerful motives is prediſpoſed to heap upon her every ſpecies of the bittereſt mortification.</hi> The triumph of Eliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abeth was at length complete!—her inſidious prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices had procured the downfal of her meritorious ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, and a detail of the real or ſuppoſed errors of Mary, vibrated upon the ear of the Engliſh queen, as the ſweeteſt muſic.</p>

                           <p>The execution of Bothwell's ſervants, who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the attempts to render them accuſers of the queen, departed proteſting her innocence, and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the preſence of Almighty God and his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant angels, that they conceived the Earls of Morton and Murray, the procurers, through Bothwell's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentality, of the king's murder—furniſh, if it were wanting, abundant confirmation of her integrity and of the guilt of her adverſaries.</p>
                           <p>Mary's eſcape from Lochlevin, and from her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant blood-thirſty ſoes, diffuſes over the tragical page a momentary gleam. We bleſs the ſenſibility of the youthful Douglas—we hail the emancipated queen, and we would gladly dwell upon the narration of her ſhort-lived triumph!—The act of amneſty, which, with ſuch unparalleled clemency, ſhe tendered to tranſgreſſors of ſo deep a die, was exactly conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that divine benevolence, which gave a luſtre to all her actions. But nothing leſs than her utter ruin could complete the ſanguinary views of her virulent adverſaries. The queen, urged by the impetuoſity of her council, ſubmitted her cauſe to the iſſue of a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. An event judging world hath condemned this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, as injudicious—her faithful adherents were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated—and the victory obtained by the regent, was completely deciſive!!! Our ſenſibilities are infinitely agonized, while we take a view of the deſolate ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who beheld from a riſing ground the flight and ſlaughter of her friends; and no words can delineate the ſorrows by which ſhe was overwhelmed. Hope,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:034162_0503_0FFC6CF0F4777908"/>
that had ſo recently dawned in her boſom, now bid her a pangful adieu! Deſpair aſſumed the regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and fearful apprehenſions ſurpriſed her ſoul.</p>
                           <p>Arriving, by haſty and perturbed movements, at Dundrenan, under the preſſure of unequalled grief, ſhe commenced her melancholy deliberations! In this forlorn condition, whither could the lovely wanderer direct her way? This was the pathetically intereſting queſtion. To abide in Scotland, was, in her idea, certain death!—To retire to France, which had witneſſed her days of ſplendor, in her preſent ſtate of humiliation, the thought was replete with anguiſh. Application had been made to Elizabeth, <hi>who had practiſed her wonted fineſſe</hi>—ſhe had <hi>ſoothed</hi> Mary during her captivity—ſhe had ſolicited her to ſeek the means of eſcaping from impriſonment, and to accept an aſylum in her domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions—ſhe had promiſed her ſhe would meet her on her way—that ſhe would receive her with all thoſe demonſtrations of amity due to their conſanguinity, and to that affection ſhe profeſſed to entertain—and ſhe had preſented her, as a memento of her amity, a ring of great value.</p>
                           <p>Mary, naturally confiding and gentle, was yet more ſoftened by affliction: She regarded Elizabeth as a friend in adverſity; and the impreſſions made by acts of kindneſs, at ſuch a period, are efficacious and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent. She eſtimated the mind of Elizabeth by that tranſcendent generoſity and genuine benevolence which was ever glowing in her own boſom; and ſhe haſted to make the perilous experiment! The Lord Herries and the Archbiſhop of St. Andrews, on their knees remonſtrated againſt her reſolution to depart for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land—but they remonſtrated in vain. Embarking, in a fatal hour, ſhe croſſed the ſtream, and appeared ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly in the dominions of a queen, who had, for many ſucceeding years, been aſſiduous in her efforts to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs and diſtract her councils—who was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed enemy of her fame and perſon, and who had invariably received and ſuccoured her moſt deadly foes!!!!</p>

                           <p>HUMANITY, my dear girl, muſt lament Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth's depraved politics, as they related to the Queen of Scots. Whatever queſtion involved the intereſts of Mary, ſeemed to poſſeſs the power of rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to action the moſt nefarious propenſities—of nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing her views, and of yielding her up to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of envy, jealouſy and every ignoble paſſion! When the Queen of Scots, ſoothed by the recent expreſſions of commiſeration which had been tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her by Elizabeth; and allured by the <hi>tender appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſiſter,</hi> confided in that ſympathy which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly prompting the efforts of delicacy, and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating thoſe acts of kindneſs that are calculated to ſuccour and reſtore the children of adverſity—when, notwithſtanding the myſtery which too often envel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oped the conduct of Elizabeth, Mary evinced her noble
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:034162_0505_0FFC6CEB585F6528"/>
and unſuſpecting nature, by ſeeking ſhelter in her kingdom; by electing her the arbitreſs of her fate, and committing her deareſt intereſts to her deciſion—Elizabeth was then furniſhed with a moſt deſirable opportunity of eraſing from the annals of her admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration, every deforming trait; of removing the odium which reſted upon her tranſactions relative to her royal kinſwoman; and of inſuring to herſelf the unbounded applauſe and veneration of poſterity. Her unfortunate rival was ſufficiently humbled; and by the indiſſoluble ties of love and gratitude, ſhe might have bound the gentle and affectionate Mary forever to her boſom.</p>
                           <p>Elizabeth, in her own dominions, was nearly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic; ſhe maintained an aſcendency in the Scottiſh councils: It would have been eaſy for her to reinſtate the Queen of Scots upon her throne; and ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure would have been princely, it would have been great, and nobly worthy the combined claims of ſex, of kindred, of misfortune, and of Queenſhip! It would have been an action ſuited to the majeſty of the ſovereign of a powerful and gallant nation. But if Elizabeth could not ſoar ſo high, had ſhe marked the arrival of Mary by thoſe tender offices of friendſhip which are the balm of life—had ſhe received her as her gueſt, yielding her thoſe honours which were due to her rank—had ſhe exerciſed her authority and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to render her ſituation eligible—had ſhe indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the lovely mourner with thoſe intercourſes of amity, which in every period of her life were ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely in uniſon with her feelings—the ſorrows of her heart had been aſſuaged; we ſhould have regarded Elizabeth with complacency, and ſought for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of her limited kindneſs, in that policy, to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of which, the exigencies of ſtate may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently condemn the philanthropic mind.</p>
                           <p>But the conduct of Elizabeth was unſexual, unjuſt, and infinitely cruel. The deſolate queen, rudely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied admiſſion to her preſence, was condemned to perpetual impriſonment; and Elizabeth, while ſhe was
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:034162_0506_0FFC6CE8E3847FB0"/>
ingenious in devices to hold her ſuffering captive in the moſt agonizing ſuſpenſe, aſſayed to juſtify her inhoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable rigour, by pleading thoſe crimes with which ſhe ſtood charged by her audacious ſubjects! Yet the queen of England had careſſed the Scottiſh nobles, when deformed by ingratitude, and recent from the haunts of rebellion! whoſe hands were imbrued in blood, and on whoſe lives were infixed the deepening ſtain of guilt!</p>
                           <p>Mary, in the anguiſh of her ſpirit, ſolicited for an interview—conſcious of her innocence, ſhe only wiſhed to be heard; but, alas! no ſympathy pervaded the boſom of Elizabeth—ſhe triumphed in the misfortunes which ſhe was aſſiduouſly employed in accumulating; and that dignified arrangement which would have reſtored an outraged and an afflicted queen to the ample and unalienated poſſeſſion of her hereditary honours and prerogatives, found no place in her delib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations! Pity ſhe could not have known that by acting the part of a ſiſter and a queen, ſhe might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreathed her brow with a garland, the perfume of which would have been immortal; but ſhe choſe to proceed in the crooked path ſhe had ſo perverſely entered.</p>
                           <p>The Earl of Murray was encouraged to accuſe his ſovereign before the Engliſh queen, while Mary ſtood aſtoniſhed at the preſumption of that princeſs, who interpreted her wiſh to narrate in a perſonal interview her misfortunes, and to exculpate herſelf from the calumnies of her rancorous foes, into a deſire of a public trial, and a ſubmiſſion to her juriſdiction! What heart but bleeds at the peruſal of a letter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed by the Scottiſh princeſs to the malevolent Elizabeth.</p>
                           <p>
                              <q>I came into your dominions to aſk your aſſiſtance, and not to ſave my life.

But you have afforded me no aid

and no conſolation. You even deny me admittance to your preſence. I eſcaped from a priſon, and I am again a captive. Can it expoſe you to cenſure to hear the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the unfortunate? You received my brother when he was in open rebellion. I am a princeſs, and your equal, and you refuſe me the indulgence.</hi> Permit me then to leave your dominions. Your ſeverity encourages my enemies, intimidates my friends, and is moſt cruelly deſtructive to my intereſts. You keep me in fetters, and allow my enemies to conquer my realm. I am defenceleſs, and they enjoy my author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, poſſeſs themſelves of my revenues, and hold out to me the point of their ſwords. In the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition to which I am reduced, you invite them to accuſe me. <hi>Is it too ſmall a misfortune for me to loſe my kingdom? Muſt I alſo be robbed of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and my reputation?</hi> Excuſe me if I ſpeak without diſſimulation. In your dominions I will not anſwer to their calumnies and criminations. To you, in a perſonal conference, I ſhall at all times be ready to vindicate my conduct; but to ſink myſelf into a level with my rebellious ſubjects, and to be a party in a ſuit or trial with them, is an indignity to which I can never ſubmit. <hi>I can die, but I cannot meet diſhonour. Conſult, I conjure you, what is right and proper, and entitle yourſelf to my warmeſt gratitude;</hi> or if you are inclined not to know me as a ſiſter, and to withhold your kindneſs, abſtain at leaſt from rigour and injuſtice; be neither my enemy nor my friend; preſerve yourſelf in the coldneſs of neutral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; and let me be indebted to other princes for my eſtabliſhment in my kingdom.</q>

                           <p>How pathetically intereſting, how modeſtly digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and how characteriſtic of the amiable writer. But Elizabeth remained unmoved; the enemies of Mary were inſpirited, ſanctioned and patronized, while the interpoſition of her friends was wholly diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Commiſſioners for the trial were appointed, and they were directed by Elizabeth to proceed in ſuch a manner, as to infix upon the reputation of the Queen
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:034162_0508_0FFC6CE4B62D4EF8"/>
of Scots an indelible ſtain! Yet in the courſe of their inveſtigation, inconteſtible proofs of her honour preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them, and they could not but commiſerate a princeſs ſo unfortunate. The deputies of Mary inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſhe ſhould be heard, but their remonſtrances were diſregarded. "<hi>An accuſation,</hi>" ſaid they, "<hi>is given; the perſon accuſed is anxious to defend herſelf; this privilege is denied to her, and yet a demand is to be made for the vouchers of her guilt! What is this but an open violation of juſtice?</hi>" Thus was every meaſure cruelly calculated to deepen the diſtreſs of the Scottiſh queen. Tremendous was the criſis ſhe had obtained—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>ick darkneſs overſhadowed her—of crimes of the deepeſt dye ſhe was accuſed, and <hi>pretended proofs</hi> were on the point of being produced! Had ſhe been <hi>conſcious of guilt, ſhe would have ſhrunk from the ordeal,</hi> but ſhe <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored</hi> and <hi>demanded</hi> permiſſion to confront her adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; and this <hi>privilege,</hi> this <hi>important requeſt,</hi> this <hi>right,</hi> was barbarouſly denied her! The artifice and duplicity of Elizabeth ſucceeded but too well; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no formal decree was obtained, yet upon the credit of papers proved (by <hi>internal conviction, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of inconteſtible facts,</hi>) atrocious forgeries, an attempt was made to ſtamp upon the public mind a laſting impreſſion of Mary's guilt. Mary inſiſted that the determination of a cauſe which had obtained ſuch gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral attention, ought to be a verdict of guilt or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; and with agonized earneſtneſs ſhe ſtill preſſed to be heard; nor can her unyielding, intrepid, and proper remonſtrances, be underſtood in any other view than as corroborating proofs of her integrity.</p>
                           <p>Elizabeth's final determination not to admit the pleadings of Mary, is agreeable to the whole tenor of her behaviour to her royal priſoner; and having ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed all compunction from her boſom, ſhe dreaded to appear before that innocence ſhe had conſigned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <q>She was ſenſible of the eloquence, the high ſpirit, and the addreſs of Mary; and while ſhe trembled to oppoſe herſelf to theſe, ſhe apprehended, as more terrible in ſo illuſtrious an aſſembly, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:034162_0509_0FFC6CE3333CED98"/>
of diſtreſs, the dignity of unmerited misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and the pride of injured integrity. She was alarmed with guilty terrors; the image of a hated rival in the moment of victory haunted her; and her diſturbed imagination painted the lofty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour of the Queen of Scots—her indignant emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the lightning of her eye. She could not think of conſenting to a meaſure, where ſhe had ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing to loſe, and nothing to gain; and ſhe was too wiſe to exhibit herſelf an open and deteſtable monument of ſpleen, diſappointment, perfidiouſneſs, rivalſhip, jealouſy and anger.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus did Elizabeth ſacrifice true glory to her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Had the Queen of Scots been leſs beautiful, leſs accompliſhed, and leſs meritorious, ſhe had not become the victim of hatred and perfidy. When it is remembered that the ingrates who appeared to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their ſovereign, abſolutely ſtood charged by the Earls Huntley and Argyle, as the abettors of the king's death, and that the expectation of the formal preſentment of the proteſtation of the two Lords, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerated the diſmiſſion of the murderers from the court of Elizabeth, it will excite equally our aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and our indignation; and humanity will bluſh at a tranſaction, which perhaps has not a parallel in the annals of hiſtory!</p>
                           <p>In the midſt of thoſe dark clouds in which Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth was ſeeking to envelope the Scottiſh princeſs, her beauty and various accompliſhments made upon the duke of Norfolk an indelible impreſſion; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of her innocence and her integrity, he ſought with impaſſioned ardour to obtain her hand in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but to indulge Mary with the ſoothings of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, would have been a mitigation of her fate, that came not within the plans of Elizabeth; and at the moment when the mutual eſteem of this illuſtrious and amiable pair had ameliorated into the tendereſt love, the attachment of the duke of Norfolk proved his ruin, and he loſt his life upon the ſcaffold, while the innocent object of his preference was ſubjected to
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:034162_0510_0FFC6CDDCB64DEC0"/>
freſh indignities! At this period, to pronounce in the preſence of Elizabeth, the name of the Queen of Scots, was ſufficient to diſtort her countenance by all the fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy of paſſion; and the Earl of Huntington, intereſted in procuring the death of Mary, was aſſociated with her more humane keeper! he was ferocious, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling, and his commiſſion authorized his inhuman ſeverities! her diſtreſſes were to Huntington matter of exultation—her favourite domeſtics were torn from her—the number of her ſervants were curtailed—the moſt ſcrutinizing watch was ſet upon her conduct—or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were iſſued for intercepting and conveying to the queen of England, letters written in the confidence of tender friendſhip; and if her priſon ſhould be ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a force adequate to her reſcue, Huntington had directions to aſſaſſinate her!!</p>
                           <p>The Earl of Murray renewed and continued his traitorous practices. He had covenanted with Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth to ſurrender to her the ſon of Mary, whom ſhe was ſolicitous to involve in the ruin of his mother, and to receive from her the Queen of Scots, with full lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty to inflict upon her whatever indignities might ſuit his wiſhes—when he was arreſted by the dart of death. Nor do I wonder that my Margaretta ſhed no tears at his exit. His talents, though exerciſed in the moſt criminal practices, were great; and theſe, with a prepoſſeſſing exterior, opened his way to that dignity, of which he was eminently unworthy. Yet a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>The enormities of which the Engliſh queen had been guilty to the Scottiſh princeſs, enkindled in the boſoms of foreign princes the deepeſt reſentments; but their remonſtrances ſerved only to call into action the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and perfidious diſſimulation of Elizabeth! The death of Mary was only wanting to fill up the meaſure of her wrongs; and although even her enemies, who witneſſed her behaviour, declared that the <q>candour, ſincerity, and moderation, which ſhe diſplayed, were
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:034162_0511_0FFC6CDC48C3BE70"/>
full aſſurances to them that on her part <hi>there was no occaſion to apprehend any improper policy or art;</hi>
                              </q> yet pretences to effectuate her ruin were induſtriouſly ſought and embraced. Mary, in the midſt of her mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, ſtill remembered that ſhe was a queen; no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper conceſſions eſcaped her; the ſeverities exerciſed toward her, produced no undue humiliation; her mind retained its native magnanimity; <q>
                                 <hi>and ſhe pitied the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant who could add contumely to oppreſſion, and deny her even the comforts of a priſon.</hi>
                              </q> Elizabeth, and her courtiers were daily affecting to diſcover plots, and machinations; every nefarious purpoſe was imputed to Mary; and the Engliſh queen was indefatigable in her endeavours, to impreſs upon the public mind, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion that her exiſtence, and the proſperity of the realm, were incompatible with the emancipation of the Queen of Scots. Mary had flattered herſelf that when years ſhould permit her ſon to aſſume the reins of government, and to act deciſively, her ſorrows, through his intervention, would know a period; and this maternal hope operated upon her grief worn mind, as the ſweeteſt ſolace. But Elizabeth had been careful to implant in the mind of the prince the ſeeds of diſtruſt and animoſity againſt his royal parent; and while ſhe excited and countenanced the rebellion of his ſubjects, ſhe directed and awed his councils, and through her influence the embroidered garment which his moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in the dreary ſolitude of her priſon had finiſhed for him, together with the jewels which ſhe had intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a memento of her affection, were returned, with indecent marks of diſreſpect!!</p>
                           <p>Elizabeth was purſuing with the ſon the ſame track which had produced the ruin of the mother; and <hi>forged</hi> letters were employed by her ambaſſador, Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph, for the purpoſe of depriving him of the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant whom he loved. Under ſuch accumulated evils it is not matter of aſtoniſhment that the health of the captive queen was rapidly declining; yet, although the moſt preſſing repreſentations on this ſubject were made to Elizabeth, they were ineffectual to procure her the

ſmalleſt abatement of the rigours of her confinement! She was unfeelingly denied the preſence of the friends who would have ſoothed her ſorrows! and ſhe was even refuſed the means of taking that air and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, on which her exiſtence ſeemed to depend!</p>

                           <p>THE intelligence of the ſeizure and impriſonment of her ſon to which the intrigues of Elizabeth had largely contributed, was a freſh ſtab to the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate queen; and from her letter to Elizabeth, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by this event, I cannot forbear a few extracts. <q>I am informed from undoubted authority, that my ſon has been ſurpriſed by rebels; and I am tortured with apprehenſion, leſt he ſhould be reduced to the peculiar infelicities of that ſituation under which I have ſuffered ſo long.</q> After ſome expreſſions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptive of her juſt indignation, ſhe adds—<q>ſince equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and right muſt ſtoop to the tyranny of your ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, I ſhall carry my appeal to the eternal God, <hi>whoſe dominion is over all the princes of the earth. To him with whom there is no craft or fraud,</hi> I lift up my voice, beſeeching him to deal with us both <hi>at the laſt judgment according to our deſerts. Secure in my innocence, I fear not to reſt ſolemnly my fate upon this impartial trial.</hi>
                              </q> Her enumeration of the injuries which ſhe had received from Elizabeth is pointed by truth; and the ſucceeding queſtions which ſhe puts to that princeſs with her ſubſequent recital, muſt have been barbed by conviction. <q>After that I had eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:034162_0513_0FFC6CD86BAA0A20"/>
from Lochlevin, and was about to give battle to my rebellious ſubjects, I diſpatched to you, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, the diamond which you ſent me, as a token of your love; and I craved your aid. I thought that what I had received as a pledge of your affections, would awaken them; and, when you beſtowed it, I was not only flattered with large promiſes of your aſſiſtance, but you even bound yourſelf by your royal word, that if I ſhould betake myſelf to your domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, you would advance to your frontiers and meet me in perſon. I fondly relied upon your honour; and, in my adverſity, I took the reſolution to throw myſelf into your arms, and to commit to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection my diadem and my perſon. <hi>But I was rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtopped upon my journey, encompaſſed with guards, and confined in ſtrong places; and, from the firſt moment of my captivity, to the preſent hour, I have endured afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more bitter and grievous than death itſelf. Twelve tedious months have paſſed ſince all communication between my ſon and me, either by letter or meſſengers, has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted. You are ſtudious to tear aſunder the neareſt and the kindlieſt ties of nature, and to ſeparate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a mother and a ſon!</hi> Is it fair or reaſonable that I, <hi>who am a mother,</hi> ſhould be reſtrained not only from giving council to my ſon, but that the diſtreſſes of his condition ſhould be artfully concealed from me? <hi>Let me beſeech you by the croſs and the paſſion of Chriſt our Redeemer, that you will bind to yourſelf him and me, in everlaſting gratitude, by permitting me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh my decayed body ſomewhere out of England, after the languors of ſo long and painful, a confinement.</hi> For me, this world has loſt its greatneſs; and if a priſon is ſtill to be my lot, if I am to know no joy on earth, do not interrupt and oppoſe me in my hopes of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. Let me have a Catholic prieſt to direct me in the road to another life, and to perform to me the offices of that religion in which, I have lived, and in which I am to die. <hi>Reaſſume the natural kindneſs of your diſpoſition; ſoften your diſpleaſure to a princeſs who is ſo nearly related to you in blood; attend at length to

my juſt complaints; let a tender reconciliation take place between us; let not the groans and ſighs of my afflicted ſoul aſcend any longer unto God; and let me depart in peace from this ſcene of ſorrow.</hi>

                           <p>James would gladly have aſſociated with his mother in the government of Scotland; but Elizabeth nefari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly oppoſed plans for the eſtabliſhment of Mary, which ſhe herſelf, to anſwer a then preſent purpoſe, had originated. The rebels of Scotland boldly urged their claims upon Elizabeth, by affirming that they had loſt the confidence of their ſovereign, and their patrimonial inheritance in conſequence of their combinations in her favour! That Mary was eager to emancipate her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the tyranny and cruelty of Elizabeth, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a doubt. A queen, detained in priſon, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly treated, while her virulent adverſaries are permitted to ravage her native realm—A mother, ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arated, during twenty revolving years, from a ſon, whoſe opening mind ſhe had wiſhed to form, embraces with ardour, every propoſition by which ſhe may hope to return to her dominions, be reſtored to the exerciſe of her royal prerogatives and to her maternal duties—Theſe were the crimes of which Mary, during her cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, was aſſuredly guilty; and upon this foundation was raiſed the ſuperſtructure of that proceſs, which, procuring her death, terminated gloriouſly for herſelf, and blaſted with eternal infamy her malignant adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. The cruelties exerciſed towards Mary in her priſon, is an outrage to humanity; any inſtance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence or pity, exhibited to the Scottiſh queen, was conſtrued into a breach of fidelity to Elizabeth, and her flatterers became emulous in acts of cruelty; while a hope was entertained that the aggravated calamities to which the royal priſoner was ſubjected, would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate her upon ſome raſh action, by which ſhe would become in reality a criminal. But her integrity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained inflexible; and her upright mind, nerved by conſcious innocence, engaged with ardour in the habits of piety; and, ſupported by the conſolatory truths of religion, continued greatly ſuperior to the deteſtable
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:034162_0515_0FFC6CD2104563D8"/>
plots fabricated for her deſtruction. Her adverſaries were enraged at the inefficacy of their diabolical ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements; and, fruſtrated in their moſt ſanguine purpoſes, Leiceſter, prime minion to Elizabeth, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched aſſaſſins to ſeize, in the gloomy receſſes of the priſon, that life which had been ſubjected to ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of calamities!</p>
                           <p>But here, even the virtues of thoſe hard-hearted ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, Paulet and Drury, made a ſtand! They ſpurned the emiſſaries of Leiceſter, and felt the degradation to which they were ſubjected. Yet, notwithſtanding they ſtopped ſhort of death, they were in the exerciſe of the utmoſt rigour. Her apartments, but two in number, were poorly furniſhed; neither were they ſufficient to ſhield her from the inclemencies of the weather; and, that they might inflict on her every ſpecies of indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they rendered her priſon a receptacle for common offenders; confining in her view, a young man, whom, after much perſecution, they deprived of life, without judge or jury! They were induſtrious in cutting off every avenue, which could poſſibly become an inlet of pleaſure to the unoffending victim of their rigour. Through the medium of a ſervant, ſhe had indulged the benevolence of her nature, by a regular diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of charity among the ſons and daughters of want, who abode in the vicinity of Tutbury Caſtle! And who but muſt execrate that unequalled inhumanity, which, having diſcovered, ſternly denied even this ſoothing, alleviation of her unparalleled woes?</p>
                           <p>But Elizabeth had not yet attained the ſummit of her wiſhes; and, perſevering in her atrocious career, her obſequious parliament gratified her by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precedented ſtatute, which made <q>
                                 <hi>a ſovereign and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent princeſs anſwerable for her conduct to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of another potentate!</hi>
                              </q> Thus was the way open for the accompliſhment of that tragical cataſtrophe, at which the ſanguinary views of the Engliſh queen had ſo long pointed; and it only remained to involve the Scottiſh princeſs in real or <hi>ſuppoſitious</hi> guilt. To enſnare and betray the injured ſufferer, arts the moſt

exquiſitely iniquitous were employed; nor was any temptation left uneſſayed, which might allure her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to practices againſt the dignity and life of Elizabeth. Babington's conſpiracy preſented a favourable occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and every probable meaſure was embraced to engage her therein; but her virtue and her diſcretion remaining inacceſſible, was proof againſt every aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault; and <hi>forgery</hi> became once more the <hi>dernier reſort</hi> of her implacable foes! Letters were written for her, to which ſhe was an utter ſtranger; and upon thoſe letters were founded her trial and ſubſequent execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!! Her cloſet was rudely broken open, without her previous expectation of ſuch an event, and her cabinets, borne to Elizabeth, were examined in her preſence; yet, amid the multiplicity of papers they contained, to the no ſmall regret of her enemies, <hi>a criminating ſyllable was not to be found!</hi> The magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity and genuine dignity, with which Mary replied to the commiſſioners appointed to proceed againſt her, aſtoniſhed and confounded even her moſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined foes. "It is," ſaid ſhe, with admirable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, <q>a matter altogether uncommon, that Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth ſhould <hi>command me to ſubmit to a trial, as if I were her ſubject.</hi> I am an independent ſovereign, and will not tarniſh, by any meanneſs, my high birth, the princes my predeceſſors, and my ſon. To ſpeak to me of commiſſioners, is a vain mockery of my rank. <hi>Kings alone can be my peers.</hi> The laws of England are unknown to me, and I have no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, to whoſe wiſdom I can apply for inſtruction. My papers and commentaries have been taken from me; <hi>and no perſon can have the perilous courage to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as my advocate.</hi>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>The deſolate captive perſiſted in denying the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the commiſſioners, yet ſhe was aware that they would, notwithſtanding, proceed to her trial; and a ſweet hope of obtaining that triumph, to which her integrity entitled her, induced this truly intereſting ſufferer to wave for a moment her hereditary queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to appear before the tribunal of thoſe uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:034162_0517_0FFC6CCEDEB4FA28"/>
who were predetermined to condemn her. Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, modeſty, majeſty and innocence, were ſtrongly pourtrayed in the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of her defence; and an attention thereto muſt wring ſympathy from the coldeſt heart that ever beat in a human boſom. "The accuſation," ſaid ſhe, <q>preferred to my preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, is a moſt deteſtable calumny. I was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with Babington in his conſpiracy; and I am altogether innocent of having plotted the death of Elizabeth.</q> After having produced irrefragable proofs of her integrity, ſhe adds—<q>I will confeſs that I have yielded to the ſtrong impulſes of nature; and that like a human creature, encompaſſed with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, I have exerted myſelf to recover my greatneſs and my liberty. The efforts I have made can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite no bluſhes in me, for the voice of mankind muſt applaud them. Religion, in her ſterneſt moments of ſeverity, cannot look to them with reproach; and to conſider them as crimes, is to deſpiſe the ſanctimonious reverence of humanity, and to give way to the ſuſpicious wretchedneſs of deſpotiſm. But the attainment of my kingdom, the recovering of my liberty, and the advancement of that religion which I love, could not induce me to ſtain myſelf with the crimes which are objected to me. I would diſdain to purchaſe a crown by the aſſaſſination of the meaneſt of the human race. To accuſe me of ſcheming the death of the queen, my ſiſter, is to brand me with the infamy which I abhor moſt. It is my nature to employ the devotion of Eſther, and not the ſword of Judith. But amidſt the inclement and unprincipled pretenſions, which my adverſaries are pleaſed to invent, to overwhelm me with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities and anguiſh, I can trace and diſcover the real cauſe of their hoſtility and proſecution. <hi>My crimes are, my birth, the injuries I have been compelled to endure, and my religion. I am proud of the firſt, I can forgive the ſecond, and the third is a ſource to me of ſuch comfort and hope, that for its glory I will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that my blood ſhall flow upon the ſcaffold.</hi>

The ſoul-affecting pleader evinced her exquiſite ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility and deep ſenſe of gratitude, when, during her trial, reference being made to the Earl of Arundel, with ſtreaming eyes ſhe pathetically uttered the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable exclamation, which has been ſo often cited: <q>
                                 <hi>Alas! alas! how much has the illuſtrious houſe of Howard endured for me!</hi>
                              </q> Beauteous and deeply wronged mourner! never was calamity more dignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, never was ſorrow more ennobled! In vain did ſhe ſolicit permiſſion to juſtify herſelf before the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh parliament, or Elizabeth and her privy council. Her enemies continued deaf to her ſolicitations, and with unprincipled effrontery, under the ſanction of a legal proceſs, in which the greateſt outrage was done to juſtice, ſentence of death was paſſed upon the Queen of Scots! nor was the execution of this unprecedented ſentence long delayed!!</p>
                           <p>Meaſures were taken to procure the conſent of James to this violation of hoſpitality, decency, and nature! But the propoſal filled him with aſtoniſhment, grief, indignation and remorſe. He ſpurned, with filial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, every ſuggeſtion upon this head, and haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſpatch to Elizabeth the moſt ſpirited and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentful repreſentations, upon the enormous violence of her proceedings. Foreign princes alſo, ſtruck with the utmoſt conſternation, and infinitely ſhocked at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious preſumption of Elizabeth, preſented her, upon this melancholy occaſion, the moſt preſſing remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but nothing ſhort of the death of Mary could ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfy thoſe baleful paſſions, which had obtained a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous aſcendency in her boſom. Mary received her ſentence with uncommon ſatisfaction, and even triumph! She however regretted, that ſhe could not obtain the attendance of a clergyman of her own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion! But ſubmitting to neceſſity, ſhe ſtill preſerved her equanimity; and when her keepers poorly deprived her of thoſe tokens and inſignia of royalty, by which ſhe had till then been diſtinguiſhed, ſhe calmly ſaid, <q>

When my enemies, therefore, have glutted themſelves with my blood, I entreat, that my remains may be carried by my domeſtics to France, where the bones of my mother are depoſited. There, my body, which never knew any quiet while my ſoul was united to it, will reſt in peace. As my ſecond requeſt, I beg that I may not be abandoned to the ſecret tyranny of my adverſaries. They may conſume me with lingering torments; or, what I dread more, they may ſully my fame with foul ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Let my execution be public, that there may be undoubted witneſſes, who may bear teſtimony to my firmneſs in my religion, and make an honeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of my dying agonies. It is my third requeſt, that my ſervants may depart out of your dominions without moleſtation, and that you will permit them to enjoy the legacies which I am to bequeath them in my teſtament. Theſe favours I implore you to grant, <hi>in the name of Jeſus Chriſt; by our conſanguin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; by the ſoul of Henry VII. our common progenitor; by our royal dignity; and, by the reſpect which you bear to our ſex!</hi> It will pleaſe me to receive an anſwer from you: Nor accuſe me of preſumption, that, while I am leaving this ſcene of things, I take the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty to remind you, that you are not to live forever;

                           <p>The ſilence of Elizabeth to theſe requeſts, and the comfortleſs and alarming ſuſpenſe in which that ſilence involved Mary, would, had the unprecedented cruelty of the Engliſh queen admitted an aggravation, have given the finiſhing touches to her ſyſtem of barbarity! Mary, however, continued to poſſeſs an aſtoniſhing meaſure of internal tranquillity; and her firm affiance in Jehovah remained a never failing ſource of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Elizabeth, with an air of levity, ſigned the death-warrant of the Queen of Scots; yet, fearful of the conſequences, ſhe ſought, by renewed application to the dagger of the aſſaſſin, to remove from herſelf the public odium.

The perturbed ſenſations, ſighs, groans, and deep anguiſh, which marked the concluding hours of Elizabeth, and which operated ſo forcibly as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her, for the ten ſucceeding days and nights imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preceding her exit, upon the floor of her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, exhibit a ſtriking contraſt to that ſerenity which illumined the parting moments of the Queen of Scots, and forcibly point the difference between the ſenſations of that mind, which, ſtained with guilt, becomes the abode of remorſe, and the calm reflections of the boſom which hath cheriſhed the propenſities of integrity, and in which white-robed innocence hath delighted to dwell.</p>
                           <p>It is worthy of remark, that Elizabeth reſigned with her life, all pretenſions to that crown, of the titles and ſucceſſion of which ſhe was ſo tenacious; that the ſon of Mary mounted the Engliſh throne; that a princeſs, lineally deſcended from her, in the fourth generation, had the glory of uniting and conſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idating the realms of England and Scotland, under one general government; and that, if we except the uſurpation of Oliver Cromwell, the Britiſh ſceptre hath, from the death of Elizabeth, been continually ſwayed by the poſterity of the Queen of Scots.</p>
                           <p>Deſirous, my dear Margaretta, to delineate to you my ſentiments, together with the reaſons on which they are grounded, I have engaged in a more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous detail than I had deſigned; yet it may lead you to an accurate ſtudy of an intereſting piece of hiſtory; and I ſhall not dilate ſo largely upon our remaining ſubjects.

                           <p>AS it is of importance to form juſt ideas of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things, I adviſe you, my dear, to give Sully's Memoirs a ſecond peruſal; and, that you may do this both with profit and pleaſure, I proceed in my curſory remarks.</p>
                           <p>You ought, my love, to conſider that the Duke of Sully was, <hi>comparatively,</hi> a private man. Henry was born for a nation, and the duke was born for the king. Henry undoubtedly poſſeſſed the talents of a great warrior and a great monarch—Sully was an able miniſter of incorruptible fidelity and uncommon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſtedneſs. But while we do juſtice to this illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious ſtateſman, we cannot, however, regard him as a faultleſs character; we think the treachery and diſſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation by which he obtained from the Count of Soiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the Princeſs Catharine, their marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, was highly reprehenſible; nor are we quite ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the duke of Sully for ſo frequently holding up to public view the diſſenſions of the royal pair. He too often unveils his hero; he dwells too circumſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon that part of his character in which alone he was vulnerable. It is true the importance of the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is thus augmented, but this does not diminiſh our diſguſt at the recital; and when he relates <hi>ſo much,</hi> and with an affectation of delicacy, pretends to <hi>conceal a great deal,</hi> leſt it ſhould obſcure the luſtre of his maſter's glory, the impoſition becomes groſsly palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; we loſe ſight of the uniformly faithful ſervant, and behold only the ungenerous and abſurd egotiſt.</p>
                           <p>Sully, it muſt be confeſſed was always at hand to extricate, but he is not <hi>therefore</hi> inveſted with a <hi>general</hi>
                              <pb n="178" facs="unknown:034162_0524_0FFC6CBAA6F53C70"/>
ſuperiority of character. The mind <hi>impaſſioned,</hi> and debilitated by any <hi>particular circumſtance,</hi> becomes, in the <hi>moment of imbecility,</hi> unequal to cool deliberation; and, amid the hurricane of the paſſions, it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon the man of reaſon to point the better way, If Henry's diſpleaſure at his miniſter was frequently without a cauſe, his reſentments <hi>appeared to him</hi> juſt; and when inveſtigation diſcovered his error, his frank acknowledgments were worthy his character; and the noble condeſcenſion with which he invariably ſought a reconciliation, was an abundant compenſation for any vehemence of paſſion to which his ardent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſubjected him. Conſtantly the firſt to condemn himſelf for every intemperate act or expreſſion, he delayed not the reparation, which was always as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and explicit as language could render it; and he declared that conſequent on every amicable eclairciſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his ſlumbers were more ſweet, and he eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the adjuſtment of theſe grievances as an addition to his felicity. We cannot deny, that if the value and importance of the miniſter was thus demonſtrated, a moſt enchanting idea of the frankneſs and candour of the monarch is alſo given. Henry was aware of the natural vehemence of his diſpoſition, and his good ſenſe was conſtantly arming him againſt the inroads of paſſion. He was fully ſenſible of the errors into which the angry man is often precipitated; but virtue nerved his boſom, and he ſucceſsfully oppoſed the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of impetuous rage. A ſeries of calamities, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his innate ſenſibility, inveſted him with ſelf command. Reaſon took the lead, and every reſentful impreſſion ſubmitted to her dictates; he became mild by habit, and reflection rendered him uniformly juſt.</p>
                           <p>Generoſity was inherent in his ſoul; and his innate conſciouſneſs of ſuperiority, while it was far removed from the <hi>debaſing effects</hi> of ſelf partiality, invariably taught him to diſdain a malicious or ignoble action. Sully obſerves, that Henry <q>
                                 <hi>never forgot to reward any additional trouble by ſome new inſtance of his bounty, and that every proof of kindneſs made upon his mind an

indelible impreſſion;</hi>
                              </q> and indeed his liberality was on all occaſions truly princely.</p>
                           <p>No, my dear—Sully was not the principal artificer of Henry's glory; nature had early marked upon the mind of the youthful prince the features of heroiſm; his face was an index of his mind, and an elevation of expreſſion and a prepoſſeſſing frankneſs formed its general contour. His manners were inſinuating and full of vivacity; and even in the commencement of his career, his virtues and his talents extorted the approbation of all who knew him; while his bravery and his military abilities rendered him the ſoul of his party. Henry cannot be juſtly charged with a want of tenderneſs, becauſe Sully's memoirs preſerve no record of his regrets on account of the death of his mother. It ſhould be remembered that at the demiſe of the queen of Navarre, Roſny did not occupy that place in the king's boſom, to which his merit after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards introduced him. Catharine de Medicis was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>ſtreſs of ſufficient addreſs to garb her treacherous and bloody politics in the alluring habiliments of reſpectful kindneſs; the Queen of Navarre, her family and adherents, were effectually deceived; nor did the wiſdom, experience and remarkable penetration of the Admiral de Coliquy, eſcape the ſnares which had been laid with ſuch exquiſite diſſimulation.</p>
                           <p>The maſſacre of St. Bartholomew, which may be principally charged to Catharine de Medicis, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtand prominent in the liſt of bloody tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Neither high birth, riches, virtue nor talents, were a protection from the fury of thoſe licenſed mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, who were inhumanly let looſe upon an unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting multitude! Peaceable and unarmed, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs inhabitants imagined themſelves in the utmoſt ſecurity, when, in one tremendous moment, the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſtruction commenced. More than ten thouſand perſons, with circumſtances of aggravated and unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alleled cruelty, were barbarouſly butchered! and ſo comprehenſive was the infernal mandate which au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized this ſhocking carnage, that it extended even
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:034162_0526_0FFC6CB4319B99A8"/>
to infants at the breaſt. The ſtreets ran with blood; and, "<hi>kill, kill, maſſacre, the Huguenots,</hi>" was the watch-word of the furiouſly zealous Catholics! That Henry, in a cataſtrophe ſo deeply tragical, ſhould feel his individual griefs abſorbed in the national infamy, in the national calamity, is a circumſtance which evinces the patriotiſm of his character; and it became him alſo to oppoſe, to the unprincipled and inſidious deſigns of Catharine de Medicis, a plan which might ſerve as a barrier to thoſe miſchiefs ſhe ſtill contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated. Henry was in no inſtance deficient in ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. His ſiſter had made an unworthy choice, and it became him, as her ſovereign and her brother, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and point her confidence; nor can his fraternal attachment with propriety be queſtioned.</p>
                           <p>Henry's firſt reception of Roſny does honour to his feelings, to his gratitude, and to his liberality; and if he was bleſt with an able miniſter, his miniſter alſo was amply recompenſed. The confidence which the king repoſed in Sully, was a proof of his wiſdom and penetration; for it was the regularity and economy of the youthful candidate for his favour, which firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him in the eſteem of his ſovereign; and this election, in a monarch, young, brave, impaſſioned, and in ſome inſtances devoted to pleaſure, fully evinced the ſolidity of his underſtanding. But a fondneſs for order ſeemed inherent in the boſom of Henry—<q>
                                 <hi>He was born with the virtues and method of economy, and therefore practiſed them without conſtraint.</hi>
                              </q> He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed judiciouſly; and, diſcriminating characters with the utmoſt preciſion, while he diveſted falſehood of its glare, he ſeemed to poſſeſs a kind of intuitive knowledge of truth.</p>
                           <p>His martial genius, intrepid bravery, and full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of military talents, in all their ſplendid variety, was evinced by his remarks, while yet a child, upon the terrors of the veteran ſoldier; by the ardour which the relation of battles enkindled in his youthful bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; by his undaunted heroiſm and juſt obſervations at the battle of Moncontour, when he had hardly attained
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:034162_0527_0FFC6CB193297CB0"/>
his ſixteenth year; by his addreſs and bravery, in quelling the mutineers in the city of Eauſe, while his remiſſion of their offences gave thoſe indications of his clemency, which his ſucceeding life abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; by his admirable conduct at Nerac, extricat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf by his valour from imminent danger; by the order of his march to, and his attack of, Cahors; by the hardſhips which, for five ſucceeding days and nights, he endured before that city; and by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted and memorable reply to thoſe who counſelled a retreat—<q>
                                 <hi>'Tis Heaven which dictates what I ought to do upon this occaſion. Remember then, that my retreat out of this city, ſhall be the retreat of my ſoul from my body. My honour requires this of me; ſpeak therefore to me of nothing but fighting, conqueſt, or death.</hi>
                              </q> Henry's reſources in the midſt of difficulties, and the ſplendor with which he emerged from the moſt deſperate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, with the facility with which he accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated himſelf to the moſt laborious occupations in the military department, conducting the miners in perſon, and animating the workmen by every proper exertion, together with his capability of enduring fatigue, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but excite our aſtoniſhment! His victory at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tras—his commiſeration for the children of adverſity, and the veneration in which he held the meritorious ſoldier—his generous aid of Henry III.—his arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the death of that prince—the invincible reſolution with which he ſurmounted difficulties ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently powerful to overcome a hoſt of warriors—his aſtoniſhing intrepidity in oppoſing himſelf, with only <hi>three</hi> thouſand followers, to an army of <hi>thirty</hi> thouſand men, alternately keeping guard in perſon, directing the trenches, ſnatching his haſty ſuſtenance in the ditch, and denying himſelf a moment's reſpite from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleled fatigues—are ſo many ſplendid claims upon our admiration! His ſucceſs, in a combat ſo unequal in point of numbers, as was the battle of Argues, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes a miraculous aſpect; nor can we withhold our veneration, while liſtening to his reply to the Count de Belin, who expreſſed his ſurpriſe at the inadequate
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:034162_0528_0FFC6CB00A7D12E8"/>
number of his troops—<q>
                                 <hi>You ſee not all, my friend; for you reckon not God and my claim, who fight for me.</hi>
                              </q> The action of Argues would ſingly have ſecured the immortality of Henry; but his arduous ſtruggles and uniform bravery multiplied his exploits, and gave them a brilliancy worthy of the finiſhed chief which nature had deſigned.</p>
                           <p>The military hero unites conduct with courage; he coolly deliberates; and, what he theoretically reſolves, he practically purſues. Henry IV. exhibited this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of character in a very eminent degree; and Sully obſerves, that <q>
                                 <hi>he never ſuffered his ardour in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to hinder him from following t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              </q> At the battle of Ivry the Gallic hero gathered freſh laurels: The excellent diſpoſition of the ſeveral diviſions, the valour with which he fought, and the victory obtained over numbers ſo greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned to his own, covered him with glory. On the evening preceding this action, and in his ſubſequent conduct, he gave ſtriking proofs of a virtuous as well as a great mind; and his tenderneſs for Sully, who had been wounded in the battle, is ſtrongly <hi>evincive of that ſenſibility, in which you ſuppoſe him deficient.</hi> Henry, conſidered as a warrior, in purſuit of glory and of a crown, (his right to which was inconteſtible) gave a remarkable proof of the tranſcendent goodneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite compaſſion of his heart, by raiſing the ſiege of Paris, at a moment when its conqueſt was within his graſp, merely to prevent that carnage which he had diſcovered his ſoldiers meditated, in revenge for the maſſacre of St. Bartholomew; and his permitting the beſieged thoſe ſupplies which it was in his power to cut off, was a freſh triumph of humanity. <q>
                                 <hi>I am not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed,</hi>
                              </q> ſaid Henry, <q>

The enemies of Henry bore teſtimony to his rare qualities, particularly to his intrepid bravery. <q>
                                 <hi>By heavens,</hi>
                              </q> ſaid they, <q>
                                 <hi>this prince deſerves a thouſand crowns for his valour!</hi>
                              </q> The ardour with which the king expoſed his perſon on many occaſions, and the vehemence with which he yielded to his inſatiable thirſt for glory, triumphed, in ſome inſtances, over that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which was generally a balance to his undaunted courage. Among thoſe daring exploits, which were ſtrongly tinctured with raſhneſs, may be reckoned the action of Aumale; where he oppoſed himſelf, at the head of one hundred ſoldiers, to the Prince of Parma, whoſe army conſiſted of thirty thouſand effective men! But the valour and conduct of his retreat is perhaps unrivalled in hiſtory. The reply of Henry to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of his friend, is the beſt apology which can be given for theſe deviations from his generally wiſe and prudent movements—<q>
                                 <hi>I cannot do otherwiſe; and, ſince it is for my glory and crown that I fight, my life and every thing elſe ought to be of no conſideration with me.</hi>
                              </q>
                           </p>
                           <p>An inſtance of the king's humanity occurs at Dreux; where, in the moment of victory, arreſting the progreſs of death, he diſtributed ſums, proportioned to their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, among thoſe who, thus doubly conquered by his proweſs and by his munificent clemency, could hardly help taking rank among the moſt faithful of his ſubjects.</p>
                           <p>Victory attached itſelf to the perſon of Henry where-ever he commanded; and it was univerſally acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged, that to his own bravery and excellent arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he was indebted for the ſplendor of his arms. At the campaign in Burgundy, and the battle of Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Francois, he even ſurpaſſed himſelf. The enemy with whom he fought were two-thirds ſuperior in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but the Gallic hero was abundantly adequate to the moſt arduous achievements; and his exploits dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that action appear almoſt miraculous: Every thing, he was ſenſible, depended upon his own exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and, at the head of one hundred and fifty horſe,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:034162_0530_0FFC6CA9E32FFAF8"/>
he arreſted the flight of that diviſion of his army which had been routed; he oppoſed himſelf bare-headed to the impetuoſity of the victors; and, completely defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enemy, ſnatched from them a triumph of which they ſeemed already ſecure; and this admirable and well-timed exertion of valour, happily ſaved his followers from that general carnage which would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably have enſued. But I do not aim at enumerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the battles and ſieges in which this monarch was engaged. I only glance curſorily over the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a hero, who was neither elated by proſperity, nor depreſſed by adverſity. He communicated a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ardour to thoſe among his followers who were the leaſt ambitious of glory. He was equal to every military duty; and his invincible bravery and indefatigable application excited that noble emulation, which is the parent of great actions.</p>
                           <p>But it is not as a military hero, EXCLUSIVELY, that Henry is entitled to applauſe—he was a patriot king. His ſubjects ſhared equally his regards, while merit was ſure to obtain his patronage. His entrance into Paris ſtrongly marked his benignity, and his paternal attachment to his people. His ſoldiers, exactly diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined, exhibited a degree of regularity that would have done honour to a well ordered family; and, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſſion of the ſquares and ſtreets, in military ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, the populace ſuſtained not the ſmalleſt injury. His enemies experienced his clemency; and in that triumphant moment when he might have taken ample vengeance, <hi>a general amneſty was proclaimed,</hi> and all thoſe who had borne arms againſt him were fully and freely pardoned. On the petition of the injured towns and villages, which, from the tremendous devaſtation made by the overflowing of the Loire, were ſtripped of all their poſſeſſions, Henry thus directs his miniſter: <q>
                                 <hi>God has given me ſubjects that I may preſerve them as my children: Let them meet with tenderneſs and charity from my council. Alms are always highly acceptable to God, and in caſes of public miſery more eſpecially ſo. It would be heavy on my conſcience, if I neglected to do every
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:034162_0531_0FFC6CA75EB87C98"/>
thing I can for their relief.</hi>
                              </q> Thus, in word and in deed, did Henry conſult the public weal. He conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered himſelf as placed at the head of a numerous fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, whoſe happineſs it was his duty to conſult; nor did he heſitate in relinquiſhing his moſt favourite pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, if he might thereby contribute to the felicity or emolument of his kingdom.</p>
                           <p>Henry's clemency to delinquents was deſcriptive of the utmoſt lenity and tenderneſs of diſpoſition. He preſerved his ſerenity and cheerfulneſs, even when ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the ſtroke of the aſſaſſin, who had aimed an ineffectual blow at his life. He laboured to preſerve Mareſchal Byron and other conſpirators; and he mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimouſly paſſed by every offence, as far as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the ſafety of his perſon and kingdom. The noble frankneſs with which he received all thoſe, who, from whatever motive, had joined the league againſt him, greatly augments the ſplendor of his renown. His way to the throne of France had been ſtrewed with difficulties and misfortunes, of a nature which required all his bravery and fortitude to ſurmount; but, having attained his hereditary right, he proved himſelf greatly worthy the royal authority with which he was cloathed. His reception of Admiral Villars, who had thrown himſelf at his feet, whom he haſtily raiſed, obſerving, that ſuch ſubmiſſion was due only to God—of the Duke of Maienne, whom he tenderly embraced, and of many others, was truly magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and ſerves to evince the inborn grandeur of his ſoul. The cheerfulneſs of his diſpoſition endeared him to his friends and the nation at large. <q>
                                 <hi>The lineaments of his face,</hi> ſays Sully, <hi>had that agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble livelineſs which forms a ſweet and happy phyſiognomy, and perfectly ſuited that engaging eaſineſs of manners, which, though ſometimes mixed with majeſty, never loſt the graceful affability and eaſy gaiety, ſo natural to him.</hi>

                           <p>The veracity of Henry was numbered among his prominent virtues. He pronounced an inviolable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to truth, the firſt requiſite in a man of genuine bravery and worth; and, when dictating the articles

of capitulation at a ſiege, the ſacred regard he was known to pay to his word, rendered it to the beſieged as acceptable a pledge, as the ſtrongeſt bonds which ſuſpicion could invent. Henry's feelings, as a father, hath not been ſurpaſſed: As a huſband, if he was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>uxorious, he was at leaſt manly and polite; and when it is remembered, that his matrimonial connexion was only the ſuperſtructure of policy, candour will confeſs, that this was the utmoſt which ought to have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a prince ſuperior to diſſimulation. If Mary de Medicis had been bleſt with diſcretion, and poſſeſſed of thoſe attractions, addreſs, and feminine del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icacy, which have diſtinguiſhed ſome ladies, ſhe might, perhaps, have rendered Henry affectionate. It is to be lamented, that Margaret of Valois was not to his taſte. I have always been particularly affected by the hiſtory of this princeſs; her merit appears to me inconteſtible: Her dignified reſignation of the king; her unremitted attention to the perſon who ſucceeded her, and the rational attachment ſhe continued to evince for the royal pair, are circumſtances which announce her truly noble, and place her, in my opinion, with the firſt of women.</p>
                           <p>Henry evinced his love of literature, by his patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of learned men; and it is with regret we proceed to ſay, that virtue muſt deplore the deep ſhade, too often thrown over the ſhining qualities of the Gallic hero. His illicit attachments frequently enveloped in clouds the noble endowments of a mind, capable of exhibiting a finiſhed model of tranſcendent excellence. Yet, while we lament a deviation ſo capital, it is with pleaſure we repeat a fact, which muſt be conſidered as an <hi>eſſential palliation of this ſingle error. Henry never ſuffered a purſuit of pleaſure, of whatever deſcription, to arreſt thoſe valuable purpoſes which marked the magnanim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and heroiſm of his ſoul.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But, you obſerve, that Henry was an apoſtate, while the Duke of Sully preſerved his religion. I am, my dear, pleaſed with your warmth upon this occaſion; and yet it is true, that actions, proper and becoming to
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:034162_0533_0FFC6CA33947C9B0"/>
an individual, are not always ſuitable to the head and repreſentative of a numerous and enlightened people. From a monarch, youthful, ardent, and devoted to mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary fame, we are not to expect an unyielding ſyſtem of divinity. Henry was bred a Calviniſt; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this is the only reaſon which produced him, in the commencement of his career, a Proteſtant. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of humanity loudly demanded a ſacrifice of his particular mode of worſhip; and it is ſurely highly derogatory to our holy religion, to ſuppoſe it calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to immolate the lives of thouſands, merely for the eſtabliſhment of a tenet, which cannot <hi>rationally</hi> be regarded as affecting the preſent intereſt or future feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the creature. Perhaps the zeal of religion has betrayed many upright minds, and it may have enkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled <hi>falſe fires</hi> in the boſom of the <hi>perſecuted,</hi> as well as the <hi>perſecutor.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>France bled at every pore; ſhe was torn by inteſtine diviſions; and her extenſive provinces were on the eve of being deluged in blood!—Ought Henry to have perpetuated the miſery of millions, merely for the ſake of ideas, which, <hi>ſtrictly ſpeaking, cannot be ſaid to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the fundamental articles of religion?</hi> Henry was a patriot king—Muſt he exhauſt thoſe talents which were calculated to eſtabliſh the happineſs of a nation, in deſtroying a people he was born to protect? Henry was a meritorious prince; he was entitled to felicity—Muſt he devote himſelf to the calamities attendant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on endleſs hoſtilities? If the king embraced the Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olic faith, he thereby became a miniſter of peace; he might lull to ſleep, or utterly exterminate the fiery zeal of perſecution; the gentle ſpirit of tolerance might be cheriſhed and invigorated; it would be in his power to arreſt and remedy the progreſs of thoſe diſorders which had deſolated France; and a happy or tragical cataſtrophe was apparently involved in his deciſion. The beneficent influence of a philanthropic example, recommended by, and originating from, the throne, would diſſeminate the mild principles of peace, love, and general fraternity. France demanded of.

Henry a reſtoration of her internal quiet. Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, affluence and ſafety were in his gift. Lacerated, and almoſt expiring, while ſhe well near deſpaired of relief, ſhe yet forcibly and energetically pronounced, that Henry's abjuration of Calviniſm would be a balm for every wound; that hoſtilities would then ceaſe; and peace, with its attendant train of felicities, would once more bleſs her wide domain! And what was the conceſſion which Henry was required to make? <hi>Not a dereliction of his God, either in the character of Creator, Redeemer, or Preſerver;</hi> and the liberality of his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents induced a perſuaſion, that the Architect of all worlds was equally ſerved by the <hi>ſincere</hi> Catholic as by the Proteſtant. The obſervation of a few ceremonies was the ſupernumerary he was called upon to embrace; and, conſidering the forfeiture emboſomed in his rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reaſon will candidly acquit him. Beſides, the king being a Proteſtant <hi>only in name,</hi> had never inveſtigated the peculiar tenets of his ſect; and the Catholic prieſts, called upon at this juncture to defend their ſentiments, produced in the royal preſence their moſt ſpecious ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; while their Calviniſtic opponents, <hi>convinced of the neceſſity of the king's converſion, veiled before them; either declining to defend themſelves, or purpoſely employing weapons which they knew to be unequal to the combat!</hi> Sully inſiſts, that <hi>internal conviction was thus, in fact, forced upon the mind of the monarch;</hi> and, as the inmoſt receſſes of Henry's heart were ever open to Sully, the above repreſentation extorts our full aſſent to the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of that miniſter.</p>
                           <p>"But Sully preſerved his religion inviolate." It appears, my dear, that the Duke of Sully had thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oughly examined his faith, and that it had become the deliberate election of his riper years. Neither was he involved in the ſame neceſſity with his maſter; his <hi>individual aggrandizement</hi> would have been his only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to the relinquiſhment of his religious ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and a motive ſo decidedly intereſted ought never to gain the aſcendency in a noble mind. It ſhould alſo be remembered, that Henry's abjuration
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:034162_0535_0FFC6C9C9C6AB820"/>
was ſtrongly enforced and accelerated by the advice of Sully.</p>
                           <p>The truth is, Henry was a philanthropiſt; and thoſe beneficent plans which, at an early period, occupied his mind, not confined to France, included the whole Chriſtian world. Indeed it is from thoſe general ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements, which, calculated upon a large ſcale, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced all Europe, that he is more particularly enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to the appellation <hi>great;</hi> and, the probability is, that had he accompliſhed his vaſt purpoſes, his wiſhes would only have been bounded by the univerſe. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was well qualified for the completion of his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous deſign; he poſſeſſed an accurate knowledge of the ſtate and various intereſts of all thoſe countries, the general emolument of which he contemplated; and his intrepidity, profound wiſdom, and rare abilities, had become a univerſal theme. If I underſtand the vaſt project which Henry had conceived, its object was to faſhion all chriſtendom into one great family, or extenſive republic, which republic was to be equitably parcelled out into hereditary and elective monarchies and ſovereign republics; amenable, however, in ſome leading arrangements to a general council; and the diviſion was to be made in ſuch a manner as to remove every occaſion of jealouſy or apprehenſion; thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting the progreſs of the devouring ſword, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſtop to that effuſion of blood, and thoſe perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual hoſtilities, which are an outrage to humanity. The members of this auguſt union were to be regulated and governed by one general plan; their preſiding head, or chief magiſtrate, was to be elected from the ſeveral potentates by the free ſuffrages of the whole; and the affairs of this complex commonwealth, were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted by general and inferior aſſemblies, conſiſting of deputies from the individual States of this Chriſtian republic; men were to be protected in the free exerciſe of their religion; toleration was to be eſtabliſhed, and the rights of conſcience held inviolate.</p>
                           <p>Henry, in the contemplation of this ſplendid achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, magnanimouſly determined to reject all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:034162_0536_0FFC6C9B18D187E8"/>
for the expenſe and hazard of the enterprize. The boundaries which he affixed to the ſeveral powers, effectually barred France from all <hi>acquiſition of territory;</hi> and he only reſerved to himſelf the glory of diſſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting over the face of Europe the rich bleſſings of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and peace. That Henry ſhould have been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of conceiving this plan, at a period when France was reduced by inteſtine diviſions to the verge of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and when he himſelf was nearly overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by misfortunes, is truly aſtoniſhing! and that when thus ſtruggling with calamity, he was able to originate and organize the moſt ardent and beneficial under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking that could occupy the mind of man, is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which muſt remain an inconteſtible proof of the grandeur of his intellect. This prodigious and ſtupendous deſign, was, at firſt, utterly rejected by Sully; and he ingenuouſly confeſſes that his rejection proceeded from a temper naturally cold, cautious and unenterprizing. But upon examining the project in all its parts, he ardently adopted it; and, as delineated in his memoirs, it appears not only practicable, but highly rational.</p>
                           <p>It is remarkable that Queen Elizabeth had projected an enterprize, which anſwered in all its parts, feature by feature, to that of the Gallic hero, and this previous to the commencement of their correſpondence upon this grand ſubject, and long before it had a being in the mind of Henry. It is to the honour of Elizabeth that ſhe was ſolicitous to effectuate a revolution ſo import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly beneficial, without having recourſe to arms. Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuggeſts an idea, that Henry, after the conference at Dover, was indebted to the Engliſh Queen for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of ſome parts of his ſcheme. But the Gallic mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, and his miniſter, were enthuſiaſtic admirers of Elizabeth; they were filled with aſtoniſhment at her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical abilities; they declare they cannot beſtow praiſes upon her adequate to her merit; they conceive that in <q>
                                 <hi>reſpect of wiſdom, penetration, and all the other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the mind, ſhe was not inferior to any king, the muſt truly deſerving of that title.</hi>
                              </q> Henry conceived
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:034162_0537_0FFC6C98B6A82830"/>
ſhe merited immortal praiſe; and he lamented for her, at her death, "<hi>as for a ſecond ſelf;</hi>" and indeed Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth's capability of conceiving, adjuſting and cheriſhing a plan ſo magnanimous, together with her whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with Henry, reflects a luſtre on her character, that greatly adds to the fervor of thoſe wiſhes, which would endow her with <hi>conſiſtent magnanimity;</hi> it cannot but redeem for her a moiety of our eſteem; and we would gladly impute her whole tranſactions with the Queen of Scots to the influence of ſome infernal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigator, who, throwing a veil over her better genius, impelled her to deeds truly diabolical.</p>
                           <p>At length, every thing was prepared for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of thoſe operations which were to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the eſtabliſhment of peace and equality, throughout the chriſtian territory. The treaſury of Henry was amply repleniſhed, his reſources were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, his army was embodied, his arrangements were made, allies were engaged, and contingencies were provided for, when the death of the Duke of Cleves, with the conſequent diſputes relative to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to his dignities and poſſeſſions, opened the way to, and gave the ſignal of, onſet.</p>
                           <p>But alas! the days of Henry were numbered! and this auguſt prince became the victim of that dark and inhuman zeal, whoſe bigotted policy hath frequently been ſtained by the blood of the moſt excellent among mankind. It was, indeed, a fearful moment, and muffled in clouds, dark and portentous—the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending genius of France, and of Europe, relinquiſhed its guardianſhip—the fiends of murder aſſumed the regency—and, when we reflect upon the ſudden diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the ſplendid proſpects, which roſe ſo fair, and promiſed ſuch vaſt emolument, around the dagger of the fell aſſaſſin, ten thouſand augmenting horrors gather?</p>

                           <p>I DO not, my dear, regret the tears you ſhed over the meritorious ſufferer—Compaſſion ameliorates the boſom; rouſes the virtues, and prepares us for the exerciſe of all thoſe kindly offices, which our relative or ſocial duties may require.</p>
                           <p>In the hiſtory of Charles I. of England, the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partialiſt</hi> will lament a virtuous and amiable prince, miſled by education, rendered unhappy by a combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cauſes, and finally betrayed to death by a treacherous and hypocritical miſcreant, who, <hi>in effect,</hi> uſurped his offices and dignity. The endearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity and ſweetneſs of diſpoſition, which Charles ſo eminently poſſeſſed, had, previous to his acceſſion to the regal dignity, enthroned him in the hearts of the people. Nature had implanted in his boſom all the qualities which go to the compoſition of a <hi>patriot king</hi>—but ſtrong impreſſions of the ſacred, irrevocable, and heaven deſcended prerogative of majeſty, had been deeply made upon his infant mind. His father had ſpared no effort to endow his ſon with ſentiments, which he himſelf had been unable to defend in any other way than by his pen; and Charles, conceiving himſelf under obligations to tranſmit, undiminiſhed, to
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:034162_0539_0FFC6C92D91A8B50"/>
poſterity, thoſe divine rights, delegated to him as a ſacred depoſit, eſteemed every encroachment as a crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal invaſion of thoſe privileges, for which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come reſponſible.</p>
                           <p>With plans, originating in views receiving from pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal influence and authority the ſtamp of rectitude, he mounted the Engliſh throne; and his meaſures were by conſequence very inclement to that ardent love of liberty, which then began to animate the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic mind, and to induce a conviction that the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of one common Parent muſt have inherited, from nature, an inherent and equal right to the tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent felicities, attendant upon <hi>rational</hi> FREEDOM. Yet Charles, <hi>taught by experience,</hi> would have become the father of his people; but the unbending ſpirit of the times, once rouſed to action, and aided by unprinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, intereſted, and hell-born ambition, laid low a monarch, who, however widely he had miſtaken the path, was, nevertheleſs, anxiouſly ſolicitous to promote the happineſs of his people.</p>
                           <p>The marriage of Charles with a princeſs of the Roman Catholic perſuaſion; his attachment to the Duke of Buckingham; the war, in which he engaged, in conſequence of that attachment; the unconſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional demands which his neceſſities impelled; his unwarrantable extenſion of authority, in levying ſhip money; the frequent diſſolution of parliament; ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal taxes; arbitrary impriſonment; billeting ſoldiers; martial laws; the ſevere and ill-judged zeal of Laud; the attempt to eſtabliſh Epiſcopacy in Scotland; the proſecution of the citizens of London, in the ſtar cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; the deſpotic proceedings of that court, and the repetition of extorted loans—were among the leading cauſes, which procured the ruin of a prince, calculated to give dignity to, and reflect honour on, any ſituation in life, in which he might have been placed. The noble ſtand, made by the people of England in defence of civil liberty, and their arduous ſtruggles for thoſe rights and privileges, which ought, indeed, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as unalienable, can never be too much admired;
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:034162_0540_0FFC6C9125E6ED38"/>
they are entitled to the eſteem and veneration of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and the manly and undaunted firmneſs, with which the Hampdens of that eventful day, oppoſed themſelves to the encroachments of arbitrary power, will continue, to the lateſt poſterity, to command the eſteem, and excite the emulation of every boſom, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of that fervid and animating glow, which a love of freedom will invariably inſpire. But, when the amiable monarch, convicted of thoſe errors, which, originating in education, had been cheriſhed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by intemperate councils, acceded to every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which freedom, organized by reaſon, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the neceſſary regulations of government, could ſuggeſt—when his rebellious ſubjects, in defiance of every amicable overture, audaciouſly continued their practices againſt the dignity, the government, the peace, and even the life of their ſovereign—every indignant feeling takes the alarm, and we heſitate not in pronouncing their proceedings truly unwarrantable, and highly atrocious. A combination in favour of the <hi>Magna Charta of Nature</hi> muſt ever enſure appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; but an attempt to ſeize thoſe <hi>preſcriptive rights of the executive,</hi> which the experience of all ages has pronounced requiſite to the due adminiſtration of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the ſupport of that ſubordination, which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſoms the general weal, is a crime, the fearful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of which, no human foreſight can calculate.</p>
                           <p>Charles, mild and peaceable, and attached with even paternal tenderneſs to his ſubjects, entered with the utmoſt reluctance into thoſe ſanguinary meaſures that were deemed neceſſary to the preſervation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal authority. Vigorous exertions, at the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the civil war, might have arreſted that torrent of misfortunes by which he was afterwards over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed. But the clemency of the monarch ſuffered the moment to paſs, in which, by proper and deciſive movements, he might have obtained his own terms.</p>
                           <p>It does not appear that the deſign was ſimply to remove obſtructions, nor to repair a decaying fabric; a project abundantly more comprehenſive than that of

curtailing the <hi>obnoxious privileges</hi> of the crown, while its <hi>beneficial powers were extended,</hi> was formed. Every baleful paſſion was abroad—miſrepreſentations and malignant aggravations were countenanced. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities obtained, with every paſſing moment, an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhing augmentation of inveteracy; and the daring purpoſe was conceived and ſyſtematized, of utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the venerable ſtructure of government, and of aboliſhing forever that power, which had been, for a ſucceſſion of ages, regarded as the foundation or chief pillar in the Engliſh conſtitution!</p>
                           <p>Deplorable was the ſtate of the monarch! Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by difficulties beyond the reach of human wiſdom to ſurmount, or even to control! And as if theſe were not ſufficient, an attempt was made to faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon him the odium of thoſe very calamities which pierced his boſom with the deepeſt ſorrow! nor did the finger of malevolence fail of pointing him out as the author of that horrible maſſacre in Ireland, of the riſe and conduct of which he was entirely ignorant, and which every principle of his ſoul deteſted. In the ſtruggle between the king and the parliament, many brave men loſt their lives. Upon the virtues of the <hi>Falklands</hi> and the <hi>Hampdens</hi> of that diſtreſsful period, every reader will pronounce a panegyric. Their magnanimity, patriotiſm, undaunted bravery, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious accompliſhments, although oppoſed in arms, will enſure them the undivided admiration of every ſucceeding generation. In the chalice prepared for the king, every bitter ingredient was to be infuſed; and the parliament, apprized of his conjugal tenderneſs and fidelity, contrived to ſtab him in the tendereſt part, by preferring an impeachment againſt the queen! Nor indeed was any ſpecies of contumely ſpared; the private papers of the royal pair were ſeized and <q>

ſilence of parliament! to the ſeveral ſtages of his degradation! to that ſurrender which his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious neceſſities impelled! to the ſubſequent ingrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude of the Scots! to the rude and barbarous zeal of the clergy! to the indecent transfer of the king's perſon, and the variety of indignities which he ſuffered in the various ſtages of his impriſonment! to his ſeizure by Joyce! to his being led about at the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of the prevailing party! now a priſoner with the army, and anon with the parliament, while he is on all ſides the victim of perfidy and unwarrantable am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition!—Theſe accumulated calamities, I ſay, wound the ſoul of ſenſibility, and are an outrage upon every ſenſe of humanity and propriety.</p>
                           <p>Imagination preſents the intereſting and highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured prince. We behold his venerable head, prema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely bleached by misfortune! his beard is neglected, and even his apparel, worn and decaying, evinces his deſolate ſituation! one decrepit ſervant only attends him! he is forſaken and ſolitary! he exhibits an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting example of the inſtability of human grandeur! Over this melancholy figure of a deeply oppreſſed ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, we cannot but weep—every ſentiment of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration is embodied—and we ſpontaneouſly rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the royal captive!</p>
                           <p>In the fate of Charles, and Mary, Queen of Scots, who was his immediate grand-parent, there is, in many inſtances, a ſtriking reſemblance. Like her's, his troubles in a great meaſure originated in religious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions. The ſame ſpirit, which in the days of Mary perſecuted Popery, now manifeſted equal acrimony againſt Epiſcopacy; and the ſame vehemence was in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe againſt the uſe of the liturgy, as had been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore oppoſed to the maſs. Both thoſe ſovereigns had the grief to meet in hoſtile fields their rebellious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and both were compelled to fly for ſhelter to an implacable foe; both were betrayed, and in both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances a <hi>ſpecial edict</hi> was procured, on which to ground the proceſs that aimed at the lives of thoſe illuſtrious ſufferers! They were alike ſtripped of the externals
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:034162_0543_0FFC6C8A27B3C9B0"/>
of royalty, and they <hi>ineffectually</hi> preferred their ardent ſolicitations to be heard in their own defence in the preſence of the two houſes of parliament! while, by a uſurpation of authority, and under the regency of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical paſſions, they were alike produced upon the ſcaffold. The fortitude and noble ſerenity of Charles was as exemplary as that of his royal anceſtor; but although his own misfortunes wrung no tears from his eyes, or degrading complaints from his lips, his very ſoul was pierced for the calamities of his friends! Yes, it conſiſts with the teſtimony of hiſtory to aſſert, that no conſideration of his ſufferings, as an individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, could deſtroy his equanimity of temper; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſeparated from the beloved companion of his boſom, and dethroned by thoſe rebellious ſubjects who were hourly aggravating their crimes, by heaping up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on degraded majeſty every ſpecies of indignity! Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though cruelly maligned, and bitterly inveighed againſt, impriſoned by his moſt obdurate foes, and infamouſly treated! yet, ſtrange to tell, the benignity of his countenance, and the equality of his deportment continued uniform and unbroken, while every move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeemed to ſay—<hi>In defiance of thoſe accumulated evils, which have combined for my deſtruction, I am ſtill a ſovereign; and, ſupported by conſcious rectitude, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity of virtue confers upon me that kind of elevation of which no earthly power can deſpoil me.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The ſoul-affecting meetings between Charles and his children, having moiſtened with the <hi>temporary</hi> tear of remorſe and commiſeration, even the eye of the obdurate Cromwell, muſt in truth be beyond the power of deſcription! Charles ſupported, through his mock trial, an admirable preſence of mind; and his intrepid fortitude and heroic firmneſs, while encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering thoſe various and brutal indignities to which he was ſubjected, evinced that true magnanimity, which could only have belonged to a mind radically virtuous. The noble independence of lady Fairfax, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted heroiſm with which ſhe bore her perſonal teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, even in the preſence of the murderers of the
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:034162_0544_0FFC6C86D30C6378"/>
king, againſt thoſe ſanguinary proceedings avowedly aimed at the life of her ſovereign, will reflect eternal honour upon her memory!</p>
                           <p>To arreſt the progreſs of meaſures ſo atrocious, it was in vain that foreign princes interpoſed their good offices; the preſſing remonſtrances of the <hi>relenting</hi> Scots were diſregarded, and the pathetic ſupplications of the weeping Henrietta were ineffectual! The Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands and the Hampdens of that day, were, alas! no more! The affrighted virtues had either fled the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bion ſhore, or were ſequeſtered in the boſom of a few upright perſons, whom the turpitude of the times had deprived of all power! Yet amid this general derelic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humanity, and prevalence of profligacy, we hail, with glowing admiration, the names of the Duke of Richmond, the Earls of Hertford, Southhamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and Lindſay, who greatly ſolicited permiſſion to relinquiſh their lives, if they might thereby redeem from death their highly injured and virtuous ſovereign! Nor can even the frozen boſom of apathy refuſe, to this attempt to extricate the unfortunate prince, thoſe unequivocal expreſſions of applauſe, that tranſcendent worth muſt ever extort! The manly demeanour and heavenly compoſure, which Charles exhibited, during the interval between his ſentence and his martyrdom, his exemplary piety, the ardour of his devotion, the cheerfulneſs with which he marked the approaching hour of emancipation, adverting to the cloſing ſcene as a "<hi>great and joyful ſolemnity,</hi>" and his addreſs to the ſorrowful clergyman who attended him in his laſt moments, are ſo many finiſhing ſtrokes of a character in which we involuntarily take an intereſt, and to which we feel ourſelves unalterably attached. What muſt have been the rectitude of that life, a retroſpect of which could furniſh no other ſubject of remorſe, than that <hi>extorted conſent</hi> which he yielded to the death of the virtuous Strafford! Eſpecially when it is remembered, that the Earl himſelf nobly inſiſted on being made the ſacrifice of a reconciliation between the king and the people, and that the withholding the
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:034162_0545_0FFC6C85481E1060"/>
royal ſanction would not, upon that occaſion, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the generous nobleman. This tranſaction, however, preſſed hard upon the mind of the monarch, and he mentioned it with regret upon the ſcaffold.</p>
                           <p>Charles poſſeſſed the virtues of the heart in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common degree, and his talents were undoubtedly great. Hiſtorians delineate him as a man of ſuperior worth, and uniform probity. They deſcribe him as the moſt finiſhed gentleman, the moſt ardent and faithful friend, the moſt humane and compaſſionate maſter, the tendereſt parent, the moſt affectionate huſband, and exemplary Chriſtian, that the times in which he lived produced. Nor can we wonder at the ſighs, tears, and lamentations, which we are told marked his exit!!</p>
                           <p>Peter the Great is our next ſubject; and this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, in regard to many circumſtances, ſtands, <hi>as far as I have known,</hi> upon the page of hiſtory without a parallel. A cloud gathered round the morning of his days, and his education was little attended to; but genius ſurmounts every difficulty; <hi>rich in native ſplendors, it is ſelf illumined;</hi> it is ſuperior to every envelopement, and no barriers can confine its progreſs. The youthful Czar early diſcovered an inſatiable thirſt for knowledge; his firſt arrangements were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptive of military ardor and talents; and enliſting in the loweſt grade, in thoſe regiments which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, organized and eſtabliſhed, he became a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate for preferment; nor would he accept promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, until his abilities had rendered his right thereto inconteſtible. When we behold the Czar of Ruſſia engaged as a labourer in the ſhip-yards of Holland and England, we heſitate not in conferring upon him the ſirname of Great! And we are at a loſs which to admire moſt, the ſingularity or the independence of that mind, which, in defiance of cuſtom, and thoſe enervating indulgencies in the gift of royalty, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced ſuch unparalleled meaſures for the benefit of a community, which his predeceſſors had been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:034162_0546_0FFC70AD39946AE0"/>
to conſider as created for their individual emolument.</p>
                           <p>Peter was laudably ambitious of acquiring every uſeful attainment, and his information was various and reſpectable. With an eye of the cloſeſt inveſtigation he viſited the artificer, and his knowledge in the mechaniſm of thoſe arts, to which he attended, was proportioned to his indefatigable diligence. In Iſtia, and in the academy of ſciences in Peterſburg, they ſtill exhibit thoſe bars of iron, which Peter himſelf, without the aid of an aſſiſtant, ſhaped at the forge of Muller, affixing thereon his own mark. He demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Muller the wages which he allowed to other workmen, and he purchaſed therewith a pair of ſhoes, which he was particularly fond of diſplaying, always obſerving, <q>
                                 <hi>I have earned them well by the ſweat of my brow, with hammer and anvil.</hi>
                              </q> Peter drew from every circumſtance all poſſible information; and, fond of conſidering himſelf as the <hi>pupil</hi> of <hi>contingencies,</hi> he was ſolicitous to make the greateſt proficiency. His talents as a ſoldier were far above a mediocrity; and although he was ſometimes unſucceſsful, yet being taught the art of war by Charles XII. of Sweden, his military fame became conſiderable.</p>
                           <p>The Swediſh monarch aſcended the throne of his anceſtors, at a period when the nation, (whoſe ſceptre he ſwayed) had attained the ſummit of proſperity; but, ſeized with a kind of military frenzy, he aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned his native dominions, fought with prodigious intrepidity a number of battles, and achieved ſuch aſtoniſhing exploits, as plunged his ſubjects into a train of evils, which well near accompliſhed their ruin!</p>
                           <p>It was from this hero that Peter learned the art of war; yet the better genius of the Czar finally prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over his maſter; and, after obtaining ſome impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant advantages, the deciſive victory of Pultowa eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his celebrity, and he had the glory of reinſtating the depoſed Auguſtus upon the throne of Poland.</p>
                           <p>The Czarina Catharine, ranks among the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary women of whom hiſtory records an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:034162_0547_0FFC70AB0F851178"/>
The child of misfortune, ſhe was reared by the beneficent interpoſition of pious charity; but, elevated by her beauty and her talents, to the throne of Ruſſia, ſhe proved herſelf abundantly worthy of the confidence repoſed in her. She was the conſtant companion of the Czar in all thoſe enterpriſes which he undertook both by land and ſea; and ſhe was, it is ſaid, both an able counſellor, and a brave general. By her wiſdom and her preſence of mind, Peter was repeatedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated from the verge of deſtruction, particularly when he was encompaſſed on every ſide at the battle of Pruth, and in the naval engagement with the Swedes, in the gulf of Finland. The order of St. Catharine was inſtituted by Peter, in honour of this Empreſs; and the inveſtiture of the candidates were in her gift. Peter appointed this illuſtrious woman to ſucceed him in the empire; and her arrangements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his death were deſcriptive of conſummate prudence. The academy of ſciences, at Peterſburg, was eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her; ſhe augmented the navy, and proſecuted the project of diſcovering a north-eaſt paſſage to China.</p>
                           <p>Ruſſia is indebted to Peter the Great for her civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation; he endowed her with power, reſpectability and dignity. He diſtributed her ennobled citizens in ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral parts of Europe, that they might thus acquire and bring home thoſe improvements ſo neceſſary for the public weal; and large gratuities were tendered to foreigners of ability, who ſhould conſent to become denizens of Ruſſia. His inſtitutions and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were numerous; his armies were organized and diſciplined after the moſt approved models; his fleets thronged thoſe ſeas which waſh the Ruſſian ſhores; he erected fortreſſes, and multiplied commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious harbours; and, allured by a patronage ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, the arts and ſciences, in the reign of Peter the Great, firſt ſound an aſylum in Ruſſia. As a legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, he was reſpectable. Peterſburg hails him as its founder; and many other cities which he reared, and canals which he trained, bear witneſs to his induſtry,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:034162_0548_0FFC70A7F268B578"/>
and to the wiſdom of his adminiſtration. He is ſaid to have been a munificent prince; and his puniſhments are deſcribed as the ſuperſtructure of juſtice. He is characterized as upright, aſſiduous and modeſt; and we are alſo informed that he had ſufficient ſelf-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to deny himſelf the intemperate uſe of ardent ſpirits, of which he was immoderately fond.</p>
                           <p>Yet many vices are attributed to Peter, who certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in ſome inſtances, was not <hi>great;</hi> and even my Margaretta complains of his rigour to his ſon. But, my love, Alexei was ſtained with many crimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that of rebellion; and you will recollect that much praiſe has been aſcribed to the rigid virtue of the elder Brutus, who <hi>unrelentingly conſented to the death of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending children.</hi>

                           <p>I REPEAT, my dear, that I am charmed with the glowing energy and ſympathetic ardour of your youthful boſom. The earneſtneſs with which you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonate the identical character traced by the hiſtorian,

(which ſo completely diveſts you of every other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs, producing a temporary oblivion of yourſelf, and giving you eagerly to embrace the joys and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the virtuous hero or heroine) is my ſecurity for your improvement; and I think it can ſcarcely happen, that the ſtudies you purſue ſhould not endow you with a fund of uſeful information.</p>
                           <p>In your ſelection from the worthies who firſt plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the virtues of civilization in this younger world, you have evinced much judgment. The private and political character of Governor Winthrop is perhaps without a blemiſh—<hi>his civiſm was the growth of reaſon</hi>—and he entertained principles which, as I conceive, are the eſſence of all thoſe governments that are the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure of rectitude, or, in other words, that compriſe the well-being of both the <hi>governor</hi> and the <hi>governed.</hi> If there was a tinge of error in the ſentiments or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of this time honoured ſage, it reſulted from that ſpirit of religious intolerance, which in his parting moments he feelingly regretted.</p>
                           <p>In tracing the eventful life of William Penn, the celebrated founder of Pennſylvania, my mind is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with an uncommon glow of admiration. It has been obſerved, that the perſecuted man becomes, in his turn, an inexorable perſecutor: But Penn is an illuſtrious exception to this general rule. He ſeems to have poſſeſſed, from nature, a mind firm and dignified, and it was apparently imbued with every virtue that can ſublime or adorn humanity. His uniform adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the religion of his election; the patient firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which he endured the diſpleaſure of a belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and revered parent; his cloſe conformity to the dictates of conſcience; and the noble independence with which he ſurrendered himſelf to obſervances that ſubjected him to the cenſure of the grave and the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule of the gay, are unqueſtionable inſtances of the ſuperiority of his mind, and commandingly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate a genius rendered luminous by its own inborn ſplendors, and cultivated by ſtudious application. Even his enthuſiaſtic zeal, <hi>as it was never tinctured by
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:034162_0550_0FFC70A4276839F0"/>
cruelty,</hi> is amiable and endearing; and we bleſs the fervid imagination, which, however pertinacious in its tenets, in no moment yields to the dark and murderous hues of prejudice.</p>
                           <p>Penn's religious ſentiments early involved him in many inconveniences; we find him while a ſtudent at the univerſity of Oxford, ſubjected to the penalties an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to non-conformity; the reſentments of his father were grievous and durable! He was frequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned; but he appeared equal to every calamity; and the elevation of his ſpirit was not to be ſubdued! He diſdained, with honeſt warmth, that emancipation from his bonds which was to be the purchaſe of an abjuration of his principles; and his captivity was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in literary purſuits. It appears that he exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited a complete example of rectitude; and had he been long held in durance, it would have confirmed the odium of thoſe meaſures by which he had been ſo arbitrarily detained: But, acquitted by the verdict of a legal proceſs, his priſon doors were thrown open; and the indignation of his father giving place to the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did virtues of a ſon, who reflected the higheſt honour upon his name and lineage, an act of amneſty ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and the demiſe of the old gentleman put him in poſſeſſion of a handſome patrimonial inheritance. His opulence, however, in no degree diminiſhing his devout and unalterable attachment to Quakeriſm, he ſtill continued obnoxious to an intolerant government. He was again impriſoned in the tower of London, whence he was transferred to Newgate, from which place, (after malice and tyranny had made an inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual diſcovery of their malignant inveteracy) he was at length releaſed.</p>
                           <p>Penn viſited many parts of Europe, and he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways induſtriouſly employed, both by preaching and writing, in diſſeminating thoſe ſentiments which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as the offspring of truth: He conferred the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt luſtre upon the ſect to which he adhered; indeed his probity, philanthropy, mildneſs of diſpoſition, talents, literature, and great goodneſs of heart, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:034162_0551_0FFC70A29F205E58"/>
as conferring reſpectability upon human nature at large; and it was a moſt beneficent arrangement in the economy of paternal Providence, which made Penn a proprietor in this new world. His abilities as a leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſlator have been extenſively celebrated; and many of his regulations have been adopted by the wiſdom and experience of later days. We bleſs the propitious events and favourable gales which wafted him acroſs the broad Atlantic; and we mark with complacent veneration his judicious ſyſtem of government, and the mildneſs of his adminiſtration. His upright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct relative to the aborigines of this country, ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to ſecure their affectionate confidence, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptive even of parental kindneſs, and was attended with the moſt beneficial effects. His ſacred regard to the rights of conſcience, induced him to eſtabliſh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve, that kind of toleration which admits the free exerciſe of all thoſe religious ſentiments that orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate in an acknowledgment of the great Firſt Cauſe, and produce the individual amenable to the laws of ſociety: And thus was Pennſylvania rendered an aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum for the perſecuted of every perſuaſion; while this circumſtance, ſays an elegant and judicious writer, "<hi>contributed more than any thing elſe to its proſperity,</hi>" Penn, in fact, effectuated his philanthropic purpoſe—<q>
                                 <hi>He ſupported power in reverence with the people; and he ſecured the people from the abuſe of power;</hi>
                              </q> and we are almoſt ready to pronounce the term of his admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration, a renovation of the lapſed nature. Indian ferocity was ameliorated by the uniform exerciſe of probity and tenderneſs: Mild equality aſſumed her moſt captivating aſpect; and the colony is ſaid to have exhibited a ſtriking reſemblance to a <q>
                                 <hi>father and his family; the latter united by intereſt and affection; the former revered for the wiſdom of his inſtitutions, and the indulgent uſe of his authority. Thoſe who were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of repoſe found it in Pennſylvania. The commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity were the ſame equal face—no one aſpired, no one was oppreſſed: Induſtry was ſure of profit, knowledge of eſteem, and virtue of veneration.</hi>
                              </q> But the patriot
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:034162_0552_0FFC709D533EB260"/>
legiſlator, ſtimulated by the ſtrongeſt incentives, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted for his native land, and clouds gathered round the infant government. Yet humanity cannot conſider the philanthropic chief as in any degree reprehenſible. The Engliſh priſons were filled with his perſecuted and ſuffering brethren; and his powerful interpoſition, on his return to the Albion ſhore, procured the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of no leſs than thirteen hundred of his friends, who were held in durance.</p>
                           <p>The plan of the city of Philadelphia, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidedly the metropolis of America, and which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the attention and extorts the admiration of ſtrangers of every deſcription, was completed under the auſpices of Penn; and it may be a queſtion, whether, in proportion as ſucceeding proprietors have departed therefrom, they have not diminiſhed the beauty, elegance and convenience of the city.</p>
                           <p>A ſuperficial obſerver may be ready to aſk—Since Penn was ſo nearly exempted from the depravity which adheres to the individuals of humanity, how are we to account for the calamities which encompaſſed him, for his frequent impriſonments, and for the misfortunes which ſeemed to attend the evening of his days? But reflection will ſuggeſt the ineffable conſolations attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant upon a courſe of virtue; and reaſon will not fail to point to that refulgent day, which, dawning in worlds beyond the ſky, will aſſuredly ſucceed the long, dark and heavy night of mortality.</p>
                           <p>The volume of manuſcripts, ſo lately put into your hands, which contains many letters upon hiſtory, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it unneceſſary to continue my remarks in this line. My future ſubjects will be circumſcribed within more narrow bounds; and I have, perhaps, ſaid enough to ſtimulate your reſearches. I break off abruptly, to incloſe the landſcape which you have ſo accurately pencilled, to our good friend, Mrs. W—. The poſt ſets off in leſs than an hour; and I only add, that you are, at this moment, every thing I wiſh. I am your affectionate mother,</p>

POSSIBLY, the number of letters, which my ſolic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude to comply with the wiſhes of Mrs. Aimwell hath engaged me to furniſh, may not have been in uniſon with the feelings of the generality of my readers. I am aware, that when a huſband and a father ſit in judgment upon the productions of a beloved wife and daughter, an impartial deciſion can hardly be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If, however, I am conſidered as reprehenſible, apologies will but augment my error; and therefore, after addreſſing a few lines to my young friend, Miſs Aimwell, I put a period to thoſe efforts, which have had their origin in a tender anxiety for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and felicity of the young proficient.</p>

                           <p>BLUSH not at receiving a letter from an old man, who is a ſincere admirer of your ſex, and who cannot ſee an amiable and deſerving young girl, but he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately becomes intereſted in her movements, and anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious relative to her deſtination. Borne on the wings of imagination, he pierces the envelopement of futurity, he contemplates her, eſtabliſhed a uſeful and important member of ſociety, at the head of a well regulated family, or performing a ſubordinate part with that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, in which conſiſts the prime excellence and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of exiſtence. If he reverſes theſe agreeable expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he beholds her adding to the circle of frivolity, ſeeking to fill up time by purſuits unworthy the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a rational being, and turning with diſdain from thoſe qualifications, which are juſtly reckoned among the firſt acquirements in female life. Surely, the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected idler,</hi> who boaſts an <hi>utter deteſtation of family at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and a total ignorance of domeſtic duties;</hi> who, abſorbed in the multifarious enchantments of cards, ſcandal and faſhion, becomes ardently ambitious of being conſidered as elevated to the very <hi>ſummit of inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy,</hi> is truly and diſguſtingly ridiculous.</p>

I will own to you, young lady, that in proportion as I conceive the charming maid is about, by her blameleſs and praiſe-worthy conduct, to add to the reſpectability and dignity of human nature, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of uſeleſs triflers, who wear away their hours without <hi>plan, object, or even motive,</hi> I feel inclined to beſtow my benediction, or otherwiſe, to yield to the impulſe of contempt; and I will further confeſs, that I generally make my admeaſurement of the deſtined progreſs of the intereſting adventurer, by the commencement of her career.</p>
                           <p>Your mamma intimates that you love my Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta, and that you will be influenced by the Gleaner. This information points the ardour of my wiſhes as they relate to you, and renders me doubly ſolicitous reſpecting thoſe occurrences, the effects of which, in a great meaſure, depend upon the uſe you make of your preſent hours. A young lady has taken a capital ſtep, and obtained an admirable baſis for the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure of improvement, when ſhe learns properly to appreciate the value of time. Thoſe important moments in which you may ſecure a fund, that will ſerve as the reſource of revolving years, are rapidly paſſing off; and it ſhould be your care, to mark them by ſuch attainments as may endear you to your friends, and render you acceptable to ſociety at large.</p>
                           <p>Your predilection for me will induce you to read attentively the letters of Margaretta and her mother, which have been produced to public view principally for your emolument: But do not, my dear, accept their ſketches of perſons, writings and events, merely upon truſt. With the beſt intentions in the world they may have erred; and I recommend it to you, to turn to the ſeveral authors they have occaſionally mentioned, and after a careful peruſal of the volumes from whence they deduce their concluſions, compare your ideas with their's; let me know the reſult; and thus give me an opportunity of tracing the coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which I perſuade myſelf will appear in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of elegant and informed minds. If Miſs

Aimwell accommodates herſelf to my wiſhes, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining to grant a requeſt, which is made with even paternal fervour, I am miſtaken if her mamma will again have reaſon to complain of her want of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to her book.</p>
                           <p>But, truſt me, dear Miſs Sophia, it is hardly poſſible to poſſeſs any thing valuable, without a due attention to method. If you ſlumber away a large proportion of the twenty-four hours, and apply yourſelf to the purſuits of the day as chance or neceſſity directs, your life is a ſcene of confuſion; what may be the work of <hi>any hour,</hi> is too often the work of <hi>no hour;</hi> and in the mean time you are ſquandering that which the wealth of both the Indies can never redeem. Summon, my lovely young friend, that reſolution which is now, it may be, dormant in your boſom; indeciſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence are alike enemies to the proficiency of induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious virtue. Reſolve to appropriate your hours, and let their regular return preſent your needle, your book, your pen, or your pencil. Happily, yours is the age of flexibility, and a little perſeverance will eſtabliſh thoſe habits, which will transform your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes into the moſt eſſential requiſites of your felicity. I can hardly conceive it poſſible to inſiſt too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or too importunately upon the incalculable value of order. It ſeems to me to be the ſtamen of every important attainment; it may be denominated the central orb of virtue; and it influences, invigorates and beautifies, both the aggregate and the minutiae of life.</p>
                           <p>Reflect a little—You are ſummoned to make one in a party of pleaſure; muſic, dancing, and all thoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial enjoyments that diſtinguiſh the convivial circle, it is expected will conſtitute the amuſement of a ſcene, at which diſcretion is to preſide. But as the occaſion will require a more than ordinary attention to your dreſs, as alterations are to be made, and ornaments are to be procured, much time muſt be devoted to preparation; and as theſe particulars naturally come under the direction of your mamma, ſhe engages to
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:034162_0556_0FFC7094C055D4A8"/>
devote herſelf to the buſineſs. But the queſtion is, <hi>when will ſhe commence her employment? ten days</hi> are to elapſe previous to the promiſed period, and there is ſurely <hi>time enough.</hi> To-morrow the robe ſhall be made; the next day the head dreſs—and ſo on. To-morrow arrives, and the appropriated hours are ſtill deferred; day after day revolves, and the neceſſary arrangements are yet at a ſtand! Mamma buſies her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as chance directs, and ſhe is occupied by her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellaneous avocations agreeably to the caprice of the moment. The important day at length preſents, <hi>and nothing is done;</hi> what a ſcene of buſtle and confuſion ſucceeds; you muſt abſolutely either tarry at home, or make your appearance very ill dreſt.</p>
                           <p>Should your houſe-maid be ſuffered to neglect or to perform the buſineſs of her ſtation without a due reſpect to order, your apartments would exhibit a ſcene of anarchy, and you might chance to repoſe upon a bed badly prepared, or perhaps not made at all. Your cook, thrown from her accuſtomed routine of duty, would ſerve your table with ſpoiled viands; and you are to congratulate yourſelf that your mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma poſſeſſes that ſpirit of government, which aſſigns to proper perſons and hours the buſineſs of the day; thus producing that uniform regularity ſo eſſential to domeſtic tranquillity. But you are not only to <hi>admire,</hi> but alſo to <hi>imitate.</hi> If induſtry and method are ſo eſſential in the inferior occupations of life, they are more indiſpenſably requiſite in the important buſineſs of forming and maturing the talents, pointing the virtues, and educating that intellect, upon which depends the future conduct of the youthful voyager.</p>
                           <p>Excuſe, my good young lady, theſe hints, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to cheriſh in your gentle boſom that flattering prepoſſeſſion, which you have hitherto acknowledged for your ſincerely attached friend,</p>

                     <p>PERHAPS there is not, in the gift of art, a more prevailing incentive to propriety of conduct, than the <hi>hope of reward.</hi> To look for a recompenſe, is very conſiſtent with the dependent ſtate of humanity; and it belongeth only to the Father of Intelligence, to move <hi>eſſentially</hi> and <hi>independently</hi> upon the great ſquare of rectitude.</p>
                     <p>Reaſon no ſooner begins to bud, than the child is ſtimulated to act rightly, by the hope of a ſugar-plum, a gingerbread toy, or that more honourable inducement, a mother's approbating ſmile. The ſtudent calleth into action every effort, allured by the proſpect of a new book, the eulogy of the preceptor, or an accelerated holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; and the man of letters, while he indulgeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations congenial with his nature, is rendered more indefatigable in his reſearches, by the honeſt hope of a ſplendid name. As the love of fame is more or leſs influential on every mind, it may be properly charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terized a univerſal paſſion; and we conceive, that the expectation of an honorary, if not of a lucrative compenſation, frequently beſtoweth the motive, and furniſheth the prevalent excitement, to good and proper actions.</p>
                     <p>Under this perſuaſion we are induced to wiſh, that in every commonwealth, town and village, ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular guerdon was aſſigned, to be annually beſtowed on ſuch perſons as had attained, in purſuits confeſſedly uſeful, a ſuperior degree of excellence. I recollect, ſome years ſince, peruſing a volume written by Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame de Genlis, which contained a circumſtantial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of an inſtitution, that would, if I miſtake not, could I tranſcribe it accurately, exactly illuſtrate my
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:034162_0558_0FFC708ED51C76F8"/>
meaning. Unfortunately, Madame de Genlis is not in my library; and a ſketch, drawn from a memory not remarkable for its tenacity, will be neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. However, without aiming at the method or language of this admired lady, it may be ſufficient for my preſent purpoſe, if I am able to preſerve the moſt prominent features of a narration that gave me much pleaſure at the time, and indelibly impreſſed on my mind a high ſenſe of the utility of an <hi>expreſsly ſpecified public recompenſe</hi> for eminent or ſingular virtue.</p>
                     <p>The inſtitution, which is beautifully and elegantly commemorated in the pages referred to, received its eſtabliſhment at a very early period after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the Chriſtian era; It was the growth of Salency, a village in Piccardy, and owed its being to a St. Medard, who was a native of that peaceful hamlet, and ſole proprietor of the territory. Surely, the mind of this St. Medard muſt have been chaſte, elegant, and highly ſuſceptible of every virtue. But thoſe amateurs of excellence, who have not traced the Feſtival of the Roſe in the highly embelliſhed writings of the French authoreſs, are here preſented with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of judging for themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The inſtitution is called, the Feſtival of the Roſe: The prize contended for, is annually furniſhed—this prize is a hat, fancifully decorated with roſes—and the elevation it confers, enhances its value far beyond all price. The candidates for this expreſſive emblem are females—it is always the reward of indiſputable ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority—all claims but thoſe of virtue, are inadmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble—the diſtinctions which originate in the gifts of fortune, beauty of perſon, or grandeur of deſcent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve not the ſmalleſt pretenſions to this honorary meed—and it is invariably adjudged by the voice of impartiality. The ceremonies attendant on the inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titure, are ſaid to be the moſt ancient which are now extant. Many centuries have witneſſed its influence, and have reaped from its excitements the moſt ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial benefits. Three village maidens are proclaimed candidates for the enſuing year; and the anceſtors of
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:034162_0559_0FFC708D50CB4D18"/>
theſe girls muſt be, for many preceding generations, perſons of irreproachable lives and unimpeached man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. What an irreſiſtible motive is thus furniſhed for the obſervance of every rule of right! The deſire of deſcending with honour to poſterity, and of ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even the icy darts of death in our offspring, is, I preſume, inherent in every mind; and the knowledge, that a ſcrutinizing inveſtigation of our actions would annually ſucceed, even after we had ceaſed to be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon this globe, would indubitably inſure a more general and exact circumſpection of conduct.</p>
                     <p>The claims of the three lovely competitors, when eſtabliſhed by meritorious anceſtry and perſonal worth, are formally preſented to the Lord of Salency, whoſe office it is, to elect from this trio, the candidate whoſe conduct, on a ſtrict inveſtigation, he ſhall regard as the moſt faultleſs. Every conſiderable action is brought to view; the beſt poſſible information is ſought; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are heard; circumſtances are compared; the moſt upright concluſions are formed; and the Lord of Salency proceeds to proclaim the beauteous para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, queen of the approaching year. Nor is his taſk invidious; for emulation, in the boſom of females, whoſe minds are properly turned, and who are edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with ſuch ſplendid expectations, never degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into envy—they are ſenſible that an election muſt be made—they are within the circle of excellence—it is glorious to be conſidered as a candidate—to make one of ſuch a trio, they have ſtood upon the verge of perfection—another year may witneſs a confirmation of their claim—they have only to commence anew their efforts—thoſe efforts which the corroſive murmurs of diſcontent would forever blaſt—and they heſitate not to join the acclamations, which reſponſive hail the lovely <hi>competitor.</hi> Many days previous to the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny attendant on a beſtowment of the prize, the name of the ſucceſsful candidate is publickly announced, and the ſacred aiſles reverberate her praiſes; a certain day in the year is appropriated to the celebration of this feſtival; its revolution is rendered important, by the
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:034162_0560_0FFC70876F5366F8"/>
reward it confers on virtue, and it is graced, by every effort of rural taſte. It is ſelected from the vernal ſeaſon—its pleaſures are long anticipated, and its dawn is marked by all the fervour of youthful expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, ſanctioned by the matured complacency of lengthening years. To the ſequeſtered haunts of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the Lord of Salency ſhapes his path, and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with a kind of veneration, a cottage which has reared to maturity ſuch tranſcendent excellence; he receives the hand of the daughter of worth, and he conducts her, who is arrayed in all the charms of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant modeſty, to receive the reward, deliberately and righteouſly adjudged to merit.</p>
                     <p>The rays of royalty have ſought to caſt over this inſtitution, additional luſtre. A monarch of France, perſuaded of its beneficial effects, and charmed with its ſimplicity, diſpatched a favourite nobleman, who was commiſſioned to preſent to the matchleſs maid a ring of value, with a ribbon of expreſſive blue; and from this epoch the crown of roſes is adorned by a blue ribbon, which flows therefrom in graceful ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; while amid the time honoured wreath, a ring obtains a conſpicuous ſituation; and the choſen maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, who are ſelected to make up the train of the queen, wear on their ſhoulders a blue ribbon in the manner of a ſcarf; thus carefully preſerving the memory of an attention, which they naturally regard as truly dignifying. The queen, <hi>on the day of her coronation,</hi> is diſtinguiſhed by every poſſible mark of elevation; the proceſſion is intereſtingly and pleaſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affecting; the new elected ſovereign is attended by twelve young girls, arrayed in white garments, and decorated by blue ribbons fancifully diſpoſed; twelve youths, who likewiſe wear the uniform peculiar to the day, form her eſcort. She is preceded by bands of vocal and inſtrumental muſic; and the commencement of the proceſſion is announced by the martial, deep toned, and animating ſound of the drum. The ſtreets of the happy village are lined by long and thick ranges of admiring ſpectators, who are collected for
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:034162_0561_0FFC7085EB8F3EC0"/>
the purpoſe of rendering to merit the voluntary hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the heart. Through theſe ranks the dignified maiden paſſes along—every tongue joins to applaud, and ſpontaneous benedictions mark her footſteps. On the lips of the ſurrounding matrons dwells the eulogy of diſcretion—aſſembled fathers hail the auſpicious era; they recount the meritorious maidens whom they have ſeen thus triumphantly conducted to the fane of virtue, they compare the preſent with the paſt, and, diveſted of every particle of miſanthropic rancour, they mingle in the mirthful train.</p>
                     <p>In the centre of the temple, a conſecrated ſeat is converted into a kind of temporary throne, which, adorned with more than regal ſplendor, receives the elevated nymph. Religious rites ſucceed, which having performed, the venerable clergy lead the van, and the Lord of Salency, taking the hand of the elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lady, is joined by her appropriated train, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the populace, who in goodly numbers throng the ſtreets, while loud and continued acclamations are heard, until they reach the chapel of St. Medard, when a ſudden and affecting ſilence pervades the whole of this promiſcuous multitude. The officiating clergyman then holding in his hand the emblematical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decorated hat, with a ſolemn and affecting tone of voice, pronounces thereon a bleſſing. He expatiates with devout energy on the ways of wiſdom, <hi>they are indeed ſtrewed with flowers.</hi> Behold how bending thouſands proſtrate at the ſhrine of virtue; ſee how well, even in this life, her votaries are rewarded; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how lovely is her appearance; ſhe is captivating as the morning of life, beautiful as heaven, and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as the daughters of paradiſe. Thus proceeds the man of God, ſtill holding the crown of roſes, while the enchanting maiden kneels at his feet. What an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating and truly intereſting ſcene! how deep muſt be the impreſſions of ſuch a moment! what noble incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to rectitude are hereby furniſhed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

and perſuaſive voice of truth, ſeemeth to experience on the ſpot, the intuitive glow of virtue. Religion appears enrobed in lovelineſs; a kind of pious awe is conſpicuous in every countenance; while the prieſt, having in a dignified, animated, and ſolemn tone of voice, completed his pathetic eulogium, places upon the meritorious head, that crown which in the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reaſon, is of more intrinſic value than all thoſe ſplendid gems that ever yet encircled the brow of royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The ſolemn act of coronation thus decently and properly performed, a <hi>Te Deum</hi> commences, in the courſe of which, the proceſſion is again formed; and the blooming ſovereign, attended as at the firſt, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by her well earned crown, enters once more the church; and, proceeding to the middle of the choir, takes her ſtand as before, exhibiting, until the concluſion of the ſervice, an example of modeſt and genuine devotion.</p>
                     <p>The rites of public worſhip being concluded, our young queen hath next to receive the renewed homage of an affectionately attached and crowded audience, who attend her to a conſecrated ſpot, fitted up by the hand of rural elegance, in which beautiful receſs, this daughter of excellence, and queen of innocence, is met by duteous and expecting ſubjects, who approach her with thoſe ſimple gifts that make up the riches of the village ſwain, and which ſhe receives as the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary tribute of well diſpoſed loyalty. She is then eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corted with the ſame demonſtrations of reſpect, to her uſual place of reſidence, where it is at her option to ſpread for her noble conductor and his retinue, the feaſt of innocence.

until, perhaps, (for the diminution of virtue ſo illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, could not but be marked with exquiſite regret) the lovely model had ſunk the claims of maidenhood, in thoſe more complicated duties, which are involved in the dignified character of a matron.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhould be imagined that our fair authoreſs in the recital, from which the foregoing particulars are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ollected, is leading us over the enchanting grounds of fiction, it is ſtill capable of improvement; and the ſcheme, although the offspring of imagination, may, nevertheleſs, when made the ſubject of legiſlative con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, ſuggeſt hints, and be productive of plans, friendly to the cauſe of every ſpecies of excellence. From conſpicuous rewards of merit, the female world ſeem injudiciouſly excluded. To man, the road of preferment is thrown open—glory crowns the military hero—the bar, the pulpit, the medical career, the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, the merchant, the ſtateſman, theſe all have their <hi>points</hi> of <hi>eminence;</hi> and <hi>virtue,</hi> blended <hi>with firſt rate abilities, may conduct their poſſeſſor even to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Chair of the United States.</hi> But the ſex, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to exiſting regulations, can enjoy but <hi>ſecondary</hi> or <hi>reflected</hi> fame; and he, who ſhall be happy enough to add a new motive, to thoſe virtues which are natal in the female boſom, will, undoubtedly, deſerve well of mankind.</p>
                     <p>On this ſubject I am reminded of an obſervation I lately heard from the lips of <hi>one</hi> of the moſt valuable of our countrymen. In our hoſtile fields he contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a long tried and well approved veteran; <hi>and his victorious arm, ſince the completion of the revolution, hath been employed in quelling an audacious inſurrection.</hi> In the boſom of peace he is a reſpectable and illuſtrious citizen, actively engaged for the promotion of the general weal; his leiſure hours are, nevertheleſs, devoted to literary purſuits; and his well written manuſcripts, will, I pleaſingly believe, enrich this younger world with a number of truly elegant and uſeful productions. This Chriſtianized ſage obſerved,—He had often thought that in proportion as the
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:034162_0564_0FFC707E77BAB170"/>
female proficient advanced in the career of excellence, in exact ſuch proportion ſhe <hi>regained her ſuperiority in the ſcale of being. "It is evident,"</hi> ſaid he, "<hi>that the woman was originally the head of the man,</hi> for thus the ſacred text pronounceth—<hi>The conſequence of thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion ſhall be, that thy huſband ſhall rule over thee,</hi>" from whence he inferred, <hi>that, previous to her declenſion, ſhe was inveſted with ſovereignty;</hi> otherwiſe, her ſuppoſed puniſhment muſt have been conſidered as an unmean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parade of words.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps the deſire of ſway attributed to females, may inveſt this idea with a powerful ſtimulus to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of conduct; and yet I ſhould queſtion the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a ſuperſtructure erected upon ſuch a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

A ſpirit of independence naturally involves an attempt to call into action thoſe efforts, from which the reſpectable eſtabliſhment at which we aim, muſt generally reſult; and he, who poſſeſſes ability to ſhape his own fortune, provided integrity is the main ſpring of his movements, will aſſuredly find the juſtice of his claims upon the eſteem of mankind fully acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged.</p>

An attempt to bias the mind of a child, can hardly be juſtified by reaſon: Nature ſhould make her choice; and the parent, with all thoſe aids he may be able to command, ſhould implicitly follow her direction. Yet, while I acknowledge the propriety of ſuch a procedure, I am free to own, that ambition, irreſiſtibly operating in my boſom, would ſpontaneouſly point my views to the learned profeſſions; and was the ſuffrage of my wiſhes deciſive, I ſhould certainly qualify my ſon to take upon him the duties of an able lawyer.

Doubtleſs, my readers have frequently admired the pleadings of the ingenious Portia, in the Merchant of Venice. Suffering the terrors of apprehenſion for the worthy Antonia, we are ready, in his favour, to break the ſtaff of juſtice, and to violate thoſe laws by which the ſacred bands of government are cloſely bound, and all its ſalutary and eſſential rights protected. We liſten with eagerneſs to the newly announced advocate; and we experience a degree of horror while we hear him pronounce, <hi>that the Venetian law cannot deny</hi> the forfeit: that there is no power in Venice can alter a decree, &amp;c. &amp;c. Yet we are ſoothed by his beautiful expoſtulation—<q>
                           <hi>The quality of mercy is not ſtrained; it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven, upon the place beneath. It is twice bleſſed; it bleſſeth him that gives and him that takes.</hi>
                        </q> But the ſentence is paſſed!—Antonia muſt prepare his boſom for the knife! and we are ready to wiſh ourſelves poſſeſſed of the power of the baſiliſk, that ſo we might daſh from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence the inhuman Shylock, who ſtuns us by his vociferations. <q>
                           <hi>A Daniel come to judgment; yea, a Daniel. O wiſe young judge, how I do honour thee,</hi>
                        </q> &amp;c. But if our indignant feelings are wrought up to the higheſt pitch, how exquiſitely gratifying is the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous tranſition; and how do we echo thoſe applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes beſtowed on the diſguiſed Portia, when ſhe emphat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ically proceeds to ſay, <q>
                           <hi>Take thou thy pound of fleſh; but in the cutting, if thou doſt ſhed one drop of Chriſtian blood, thy lands and good, are, by the laws of Venice, confiſcate,</hi>
                        </q> &amp;c. Thus, upon a ſingle thought, obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous when conceived, the ſcene of death is changed; juſtice preſerves her ſacred rights, and mercy beams triumphant.</p>
                     <p>Every reflecting mind muſt have remarked how frequently the concatenation of ideas aſſociates remote reſemblances, and under this influence, the develope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment produced by Portia, brings to my recollection a little narrative that I received from a perſon of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and obſervation.

                     <p>A gentleman reſiding in one of the ſmall towns in the neighbourhood of the city of Dublin, and poſſeſſing a genteel competency, not only ſupported the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an ancient family, but even added additional luſtre to thoſe claims his anceſtors had poſſeſſed upon the eſteem of mankind. He knew the full value of the independence he enjoyed; and, although genuine hoſpitality, that true Hibernian trait, ſuſtained no diminution in his individual character (his ſtyle of living being in fact munificent) he was yet well aware that the obſervation of a regular ſyſtem of economy was the ſureſt foundation for the continued exerciſe of that liberality which was inherent in his nature. Having no offspring of his own, he had taken into his houſe a favourite nephew, who naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the object of all thoſe tender feelings and various emotions that ſucceed each other in the boſom of a parent. His education was on the moſt liberal plan; and every incitement to improvement was generouſly furniſhed. The judicious arrangements which had been adopted, were crowned by ſucceſs, and the young gentleman attaining his twenty-firſt year, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed a mind well informed, admirably intelligent, and extenſively accompliſhed. It was a received opinion that he would ſucceed to his uncle's eſtates, and the youth himſelf had imbibed, as a matter of courſe, theſe reverſionary expectations. The old gentleman was ſenſible of this conſequence of his indulgent pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronage, and it became to him a ſource of anxiety. He ſaw it probable that his nephew, entertaining an idea that a reſpectable eſtabliſhment was already ſecured to him, would aim at no meritorious achievement—that he would devote himſelf to a life of imbecile inactivity, ſupinely paſſing thoſe hours which ſhould be marked by application, diligence and uſefulneſs; and, ſolicitous to teach him properly to eſtimate his own value; to
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:034162_0569_0FFC7072D8B66698"/>
rouſe to action the energies of his ſoul, and to open his views to thoſe reſources which depended entirely upon himſelf—he deliberated long, fondly ſtruggling with that ardent affection which nature had authorized, and habit confirmed. At length, however, he had recourſe to an expedient that was, perhaps, as ſingular as it proved propitious; and on the evening of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene day, devoted to literary eaſe, our good old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſummoned his nephew to his cloſet, addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to this effect:</p>
                     <p>"I think, Sir, it is now ſome months ſince you have written Man, and from your firſt dawn of being, I have ſtill ſupported you. Nature hath furniſhed you with ſolidity of underſtanding, and ſhe hath connected therewith great brilliancy of imagination; nor have the aids of education been wanting. Perhaps my plans have been too extenſive; but the event will either furniſh my acquittal, or faſten upon my mind a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of error. I have hitherto diſcharged to you, Sir, the part of a parent; you have been in all reſpects diſtinguiſhed as though you had been in fact my ſon; yet you are not my ſon; you are only my brother's ſon. You poſſeſſed no legal claims upon me, but I have qualified you to ſhape your own fortune, and that too in a reputable and genteel line of life: You know, Sir, that the neceſſary ſteps have been taken to furniſh you with credentials for your appearance at the bar—thoſe credentials you now poſſeſs; and your future eminence reſts wholly on your own efforts. But you are yet to learn that from this night you are to look for no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aid from me! I have provided two excellent horſes, and an honeſt man to attend you in quality of a ſervant. With to-morrow's ſun you muſt depart for Dublin, there to take ſuch ſteps for your reputable eſtabliſhment as your deliberate and beſt informed judgment ſhall dictate. Here are twenty guineas—they will ſerve you till you come to ſome deciſion. I ſincerely wiſh you ſucceſs; but whatever may be your circumſtances or exigencies, expect no further favour from me, nor ever reckon on another ſhilling of my

fortune. This is the laſt time I will ever meet you until you are inveſted with that property and reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability which ſhall give you a right to the independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that abilities like yours ought ever to command. Neither will I, until that period ſhall arrive, hold with you the ſmalleſt intercourſe. This hour I draw the ſeparating veil; and I am, with regard to you, to all intents and purpoſes, as if I had ceaſed to exiſt! Farewel, young man! May God go with you, and may the bleſſings of virtuous induſtry reſt upon your head."</p>
                     <p>The careful, the paternal friend, having thus uttered himſelf, (to conceal emotions which he had till that moment governed) ruſhed inſtantly from the cloſet, and ſought ſhelter in the retirement of his bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; while the young man, ſinking under a thouſand mingling ſenſations, and almoſt petrified by aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, paſſed the night in a manner which may be better imagined than delineated. He, however, knew his uncle too well to remonſtrate; and, actuated by diſappointment, tender regret, and perhaps a tinge of reſentment, with the early dawn he bid adieu to that native village, and to thoſe ſweetly rural haunts, which, from his infantile days, had been to him an Eden of delight; where he had imaged all that he conceived of bliſs, and ſketched ſuch years of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as never yet revolved ſince paradiſe was forfeited by man's tranſgreſſion.</p>

He wiſhed for a retired apartment, and he requeſted to ſee the landlord. The hoſt entered; and the eye of our ſorrowful youth immediately marked a fixed melancholy which ſeemed to brood in every feature of his face. Softened by what he then conceived the moſt dreadful of misfortunes, his ſympathetic feelings were eaſily arreſted, and he ſpontaneouſly queſtioned—"What is the matter, landlord?" The landlord, unlike to other landlords, was not diſpoſed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative; he returned an ungracious anſwer, and as if to avoid further interrogation, abruptly quitted the apartment. "<hi>This poor man,</hi>" ſaid our young proficient in the ſchool of adverſity—"<hi>this poor man is afflicted;</hi> affliction is fond of ſociety; I will court his confidence, nor will I yield the purſuit until I have extorted the ſecret of his ſufferings."

"Suffer me, Sir, to repeat my inquiries; I am not actuated by idle curioſity, but calamity ſeeks compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionſhip; I, too, am a ſon of ſorrow, and we may poſſibly aid each other." "<hi>No, Sir,</hi>" returned the landlord, "aid is out of the queſtion; but my ſtory is eaſily told, and it is too notorious for me either to expect or with concealment.</p>
                     <p>"This inn, Sir, with all that it contains, was once mine. The traveller, each day, contributed to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my honeſt gains, and I deemed myſelf beyond the reach of indigence. But, alas! on one fatal evening, three gentlemen, apparently poſſeſſing integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and abounding in affluence, took apartments under this roof: They were engaged in a law-ſuit, and they had claims to eſtabliſh, which required time to inveſtigate. They depoſited in my hands a large bag of gold, to an immenſe amount, obtaining my promiſe that I would not deliver it, except the where party united to demand it. Some weeks had ſucceeded this tranſaction, when, going abroad in the morning, as I imagined to proſecute their buſineſs, one of the aſſociates returned in great agitation, conjuring me to
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:034162_0572_0FFC706B65781638"/>
produce the gold, affirming that their cauſe was brought on, that they ſhould obtain a verdict on that day, and, if they were not poſſeſſed of the immediate means of gratifying their advocates, it would be loſt for want of the neceſſary efforts in their favour. In a moment of weak credulity, I yielded up the depoſit, nor was apprized by a ſingle foreboding of the ruinous conſequences, until the return of evening brought the other two coadjutors. I met them with a face of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation, concluding they had obtained a fortunate deciſion; but judge of my ſurpriſe when I learned that many days would probably elapſe, before they could be gratified by a hearing, and that they had not yet made their arrangements. My aſtoniſhment was beyond expreſſion; yet I was not apprehenſive of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to myſelf. Conſcious of my own integrity, I ſimply related the truth, and aſked them what ſteps they would take? With abundance of <hi>ſang-froid,</hi> they replied, they had no ſteps to take—they had deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered a ſum of money to my care, obtaining my prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe that it ſhould continue as a depoſit, not to be relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed but at the united demand of the parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and that, of courſe, they ſhould aſſuredly require it at my hands! Nothing could exceed my conſternation; they delayed not to make their requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and they took care it ſhould be attended by the legal formalities. Neither my abilities nor my incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation admitted of a reimburſement ſo unjuſt. I made application to council, and was flattered by a certainty of a favourable iſſue. An action was ſpeedily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced. Pleadings have been heard, and lawyers' fees, together with many <hi>etceteras</hi> have exhauſted my reſources. I have been barbarouſly pillaged—to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is the day appointed for a final hearing—ruin ſtares me in the face; and if I eſcape impriſonment for life, both myſelf and family muſt be turned out houſeleſs wanderers, commencing in the evening of our days, the ſad progreſs of indigence and beggary!"</p>
                     <p>"You are then poſitive that judgment will go againſt you," replied the young novitiate. "O, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly,"
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:034162_0573_0FFC7068EA485740"/>
cried the landlord, "the law, I am told, cannot be wreſted in my favour." "Permit me," returned our adventurer, "to obtain your confidence; you behold, in me, a perſon qualified to take upon him the part of an advocate for the oppreſſed; and, if you will join me to your council, I feel aſſured that your affair will terminate happily." "What, Sir," exclaimed the landlord, "are you ſeeking the glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thoſe hard earned gains, which your wealthy brethren have ſo rapaciouſly plundered? No, Sir, I have no more pieces to ſquander; and I ſhould not be ſorry, if I knew I ſhould never more behold the face of one of your mercenary profeſſion."</p>
                     <p>The young man, allowing for the petulancy of a perſon, who apprehended himſelf on the eve of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the victim of misfortune, pointed by injuſtice, mildly returned—"It is neceſſary, landlord, in order to your being conſidered as my client, that I receive a retaining fee. I have, in my own mind, no doubt of obtaining a ſucceſsful iſſue to your buſineſs; one guinea, however, will be ſufficient; and if I do not procure a verdict in your favour, I pledge my honour that I will return it." The landlord drew up a heavy ſigh—"<hi>You look like an honeſt man—you may be an honeſt man—God forbid that I ſhould ever ſuſpect an honeſt man. Here, take it—'tis my laſt piece, and may it redeem its maſter's property.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Matters thus adjuſted, the eventful morning at length dawned; the court was aſſembled, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for the plaintiffs and defendant prepared to call into action their moſt energetic abilities; while a reſpectable jury, arranged in due form, ſtood fixed in mute and ſolemn attention. The council for the plaintiffs urged, that the depoſit had abſolutely been made, and a promiſe obtained that it ſhould remain as a ſacred truſt—they expatiated eloquently and learnedly on theſe facts; and they concluded with a ſolemn appeal to the jury, praying for a grant of that reſtitution, which they ſo juſtly demanded. The council for the defendant endeavoured to invalidate
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:034162_0574_0FFC70668471C588"/>
thoſe affirmations, inſiſting on the expediency of ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proofs. It was their plan to perplex, by croſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and at any rate, to procure a ſuſpenſion of the final determination. In ſhort, it became evident that <hi>law,</hi> and <hi>apparent</hi> juſtice, were for once conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to appear in oppoſition to a deciſion, which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed equity of every mind would have unheſitating<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounced; and no hope for the poor, deſpoiled, and betrayed landlord ſeemed to remain.</p>
                     <p>Juſt at this juncture our young gentleman produced himſelf at the bar. It was his firſt pleading, and his mien and geſtures were marked by a graceful and prepoſſeſſing diffidence. His diploma was unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, and he was announced as an advocate for the defendant. A confuſed murmur pervaded the court; and the council, on both ſides, betrayed une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal marks of diſapprobation. It being, however, beyond their power to conteſt his credentials, he was permitted to proceed; and, with a modeſt aſſurance, he conciſely delivered his ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>"My lords, and gentlemen of the jury—I ſtand up as council for the defendant; and to avoid giving this honourable court, and this reſpectable jury, any further trouble, we diveſt ourſelves of every ſubterfuge—we acknowledge the juſtice of the pleadings of the council for the plaintiffs—we freely acknowledge the depoſit, and the conditions on which ſaid depoſit was made; which conditions were, that no part of the property ſhould be returned, without the preſence of the parties ſeverally intereſted; and whenever <hi>the three individuals, from whom we received the truſt, ſhall all unite to make the demand, preciſely conformable to the letter of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, into which we entered,</hi> we are ready to deliver up the whole of the depoſit, with which we were charged."</p>
                     <p>Aſtoniſhment immediately moulded the features of the court; the extricating expedient was ſo ſimple, ſo obvious, ſo exactly conformable to the <hi>letter,</hi> as well as <hi>ſpirit</hi> of equity, and in the ſame moment ſo replete with protection to the upright but too credulous landlord, that it was wonderful it had not before oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred.
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:034162_0575_0FFC706402F6CA00"/>
But it is hardly poſſible to give an idea of the unbounded joy of an Iriſh populace, aſſembled upon ſuch an occaſion. Their ſympathetic feelings had irreſiſtibly engaged them on the ſide of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hoſt, who it ſeems had uniformly ſuſtained the character of an honeſt man. Loud and affecting ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes reverberated from every quarter—they embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the young advocate in their arms—they would have borne him to his lodging upon their ſhoulders, and they could hardly be prevailed on to remit theſe clamorous teſtimonials of their approbation. The landlord—but agreeably to my uſual cuſtom, on every of theſe occaſions, I very freely bequeath the delineation of his tranſports, and his gratitude, as an exerciſe for the imagination of the ſuſceptible reader.</p>
                     <p>To our young adventurer, the high road to fame and fortune was now thrown open; handſome grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications were poured in from every quarter—he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended with rapid ſteps the hill of eminence, and he ſoon became enriched beyond his moſt ſanguine expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. The whole of the judicious plan, laid by his venerable, his paternal friend, now became obvious to his underſtanding; he ſighed to embrace once more the hand of him, who, having endowed him with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pability, had compelled him to thoſe movements, from which originated his ſplendid fortunes; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, upon a remarkable fine morning, a ſuperb equipage, he took his way to his native village, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by every veſtige of that independence, which his uncle had made the condition of their future inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. The ſhades of evening brought him to thoſe well known haunts, where he found the good old man, reclining in an arbour, which formed a fit receſs for age and contemplation. With expreſſions of grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, duteous and unbounded affection, he inſtantly proſtrated himſelf at the feet of this venerable parent, (whom he properly and pathetically hailed as his guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian genius) and his reception exceeded his fondeſt hopes.</p>
                     <p>The old gentleman evinced his wonted firmneſs and dignity of character; but theſe prominent traits
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:034162_0576_0FFC70627AB08D28"/>
were, however, blended with all a father's tenderneſs. Having raiſed his nephew, he claſped him to his boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om—"You are welcome, my ſon—right welcome to theſe aged arms, and to this, your rightful heritage—Think not you have any information to give me—the faithful being, whom I beſtowed on you as a ſervant, has been my conſtant correſpondent; and, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of my inſtructions, he has proved a cloſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of your actions. No movement has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from me: and my emotions almoſt deny me utterance, while <hi>I pronounce that I know, and I approve.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>This reſpectably venerable ſage continued, to life's extreme, a complacent witneſs of the elevation and confirmed celebrity of his nephew; and ere he cloſed the ſcene of mortality, his laſt rational act pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this ſon of his adoption the ſole heir of all his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions. Thoſe of my readers who are acquainted with the private hiſtory of the celebrated Mr. Delany, one of the moſt able and eminent law practitioners in the city of Dublin, will readily recognize theſe outlines.</p>

                     <p>I PITY, from my ſoul, every candidate for literary fame! If they are warm in the purſuit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with ardour in the profeſſion of their election—if they are induſtrious in their application, and unof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending in their ſubjects, diligently labouring to endow them with every valuable property, of which they are ſuſceptible—if the precepts they inculcate are enforced by the example of their own lives—if they do and are all this, they certainly have <hi>much merit,</hi> and are entitled to no ſtinted ſhare of that applauſe, for which they are probably ſolicitous. But alas! how are their ſteps environed with peril! their family, their education, their perſons, their characters—theſe all become ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubjects of converſation! while their matter, and
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:034162_0577_0FFC705E51DC4018"/>
their manner, are regarded as free plunder, and the invidious critic is deaf to the voice of candour!</p>
                     <p>What author but trembles at the critic's laſh! and how many are deterred from the eventful path, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the lion in the way! And was <hi>real merit</hi> ſoothed and encouraged, were faults detected and pointed out with mildneſs, was ſtrict <hi>impartiality obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and juſtice always the aim,</hi> I, for my part, ſhould bid the lion roar on, wiſhing, very ſincerely, that his terrors might become properly influential.</p>
                     <p>It is the opinion of ſome perſons of ſound judgment and great abilities, that nothing more is left for a modern writer, than to give a <hi>new dreſs to old ideas;</hi> but great men are not infallible, and poſſibly this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion may be rather haſtily drawn. Solomon ſaid "<hi>there was nothing new under the ſun;</hi>" but ſince the days of Solomon, what profound diſcoveries have been made; how momentous, how honorary, and how uſeful! How have the arts and ſciences improved, and how has knowledge increaſed in the world. The uſe of the loadſtone—printing, that capital vehicle of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation—the art of war, <hi>meliorated</hi> by the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and uſe of gun-powder, &amp;c. &amp;c. while hardly a day paſſes, on the which novelty peeps not out.</p>
                     <p>It is, perhaps, true, that the heavieſt charge prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt literary adventurers, is that of plagiariſm: After an original thought, a hue and cry is raiſed—it is traced from author to author—the cheek of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is tinged with the indignant bluſh, excited by ſuſpicions of fraud; and a group of reſpectable char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters are ſuppoſed to ſtand convicted of the high crime of <hi>knowingly</hi> and <hi>wittingly purloining their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours' goods.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To condemn, upon preſumptive evidence, is both treacherous and cruel, and it is a procedure which finds no place in the deciſions of equity. I do not contend that plagiariſm is never practiſed—far from it; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it conſtitutes the eſſence of many a volume, and that it is a kind of depredation, which is too often the <hi>dernier reſort</hi> of the ſcribbler; but I <hi>inſiſt,</hi> and I can
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:034162_0578_0FFC705CBB965D30"/>
produce proof poſitive of my aſſertion, that the charge of plagiariſm is frequently <hi>unfounded,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>unjuſt.</hi> Originality is undoubtedly rare, and it is probable it will become ſtill more ſo. A writer finds many ſubjects touched, and retouched, if not wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; and, ſhould his abilities embrace a new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or even a novel arangement, he is condemned, ere he can eſtabliſh his hypotheſis, however ſelf evident it may be, to combat the giant prejudice, to wage war with a hoſt of cavillers, to oppoſe himſelf to the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſhafts of criticiſm, and to withſtand the ſecret machinations of envy. But, every diſcouragement notwithſtanding, I humbly conceive there is much more originality in the world, at this preſent time, than is commonly imagined.</p>
                     <p>What, I would aſk, conſtitutes originality? or, in other words, cannot an original thought be twice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? Let not the critic ſneer, before he permits me to explain myſelf. An idea is expreſſed in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and a ſtander-by declares—"<hi>I had this moment the ſame thought, Sir.</hi>" Query: In whoſe boſom was the idea original? Suppoſe, that in the days of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, there had ariſen, in the wilds of America, or in any other remote part of the globe, a genius, who had delineated every idea of that immortal bard, who had painted the charms of another Helen, arming monarchs and heroes in the licentious cauſe of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious woman! whoſe fertile brain had teemed with other Hectors, ſkilfully oppoſing them to that Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean arm, which was nerved for their deſtruction; ſuppoſe his ſentiments, his ſimilies and expreſſions had been nearly ſimilar; and, (ſince nature, liberal in her operations, might have produced a <hi>ſecond prodigy,</hi> the ſuggeſtion cannot be juſtly ſaid to wear the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>impoſſibility</hi>) ſuppoſe proof irrefragable had been furniſhed, that not the ſmalleſt intercourſe had ſubſiſted between theſe children of indulgent munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and that they had not even a knowledge of each other's exiſtence; ſhould we not, in ſuch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, have characterized both bards, as poſſeſſing original excellence?</p>

For my own part, I am ſo far from regarding it as wonderful, that a <hi>ſimilarity of talents ſhould exhibit a ſimilarity of ideas, and even of expreſſions, that I am really aſtoniſhed ſuch ſimilarity is not more frequently demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> Let us reflect for a moment—Two beings, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with ſtrong underſtandings and clear percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are educated in different and far diſtant parts of our world; but their language, their government, and particularly their religion is the ſame; from the ſame decalogue their precepts are drawn; virtue is the goal to which they are pointed, and from one ſource every excitement to virtue is educed. Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is at length attained; and, ſetting down to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template a given ſubject, ought they to be accuſed of plagiariſm, although their productions receive a kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſtamp?</p>
                     <p>The good divine, whoſe mind hath been early im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued from that identical fount at which his cotempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries have quaffed, receives a like education, and like academical honours; and with religious ſentiments exactly correſponding with his brethren, he mounts the pulpit, and opens the ſacred book, ordained at once a ſtandard of his teſtimony, and the origin from whence he is to deduce thoſe momentous truths, on which he is to expatiate. His text cannot vary, and he may be a ſtranger to the <hi>flagitious crime of ſtealing,</hi> although the branches growing upon one root, ſhould reſemble each other.</p>
                     <p>A writer may, <hi>without being a juſt ſubject of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,</hi> enrich his page with the moſt brilliant thoughts of another; <hi>he may himſelf be deceived;</hi> from extenſive and miſcellaneous reading, ſcattered ideas, ſentiments, and ſometimes ſentences, are collected.

I once had a friend—were I at liberty to name him, every individual, acquainted with his <hi>uncommon worth,</hi> would bow to his ſuperior merit: Ah! how have his fine qualities and gigantic talents been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by a train of adverſe circumſtances, all pointed and brought home to his boſom, by a natural propenſity to melancholy.

Our bard, thus highly qualified, employed himſelf one morning in penning a poetical epiſtle to a friend, whoſe abilities were reſpectable.

                     <p>But, while <hi>I pledge my veracity</hi> for the <hi>authenticity</hi> of the foregoing anecdote, I readily grant that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſeldom concur to produce events of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; and, conceding thus far, I expect that every perſon accuſtomed to reflection, will unheſitatingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the propriety of what I have advanced, (viz.) <hi>that ſimilarity of ideas and expreſſions, when the ſubject is the ſame,</hi> may often originate in different minds, evidently obtaining in thoſe boſoms, where inborn integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and conſcious propriety had implanted <hi>ſo ſtrong a ſenſe of right and wrong,</hi> as to create a juſt and ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous abhorrence to whatever could, <hi>in the remoteſt degree, be denominated plagiariſm.</hi> I had lately an opportunity of converſing on this ſubject, with a female, to whom I am <hi>naturally attached</hi>—ſhe has for many years been a ſcribbler, and ſhe feelingly lamented that ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly ſeen ideas, and complete ſentences, iſſue from the preſs, which had long been contained in her manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, and which ſhe had flattered herſelf with the privilege of preſenting, as <hi>original thoughts!</hi> This, however, happened more frequent in her proſaic, than in her poetical productions; yet, even in the laſt, ſhe adduced ſome inſtances of conſiderable ſimilarity; from which, by way of illuſtration, and for the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the reader, I take the liberty to ſelect two. On the 28th of January, 1784, this penwoman wrote ſome lines on a particularly intereſting occaſion, which lines contain the following ſimile:
<q>
                           <l>As the fond matron, while the flame aſcends,</l>

                        <hi>Early in the year</hi> 1784, copies of the whole of this poem were put into the hands of ſeveral gentlemen, who may perhaps recollect it; but ſtill it is <hi>only a manuſcript;</hi> and it is not until within a few months, that ſhe has met with that beautiful production, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, the Botanic Garden, the offspring of an elegant European pen, <hi>firſt publiſhed in the year</hi> 1793; in which ſhe obſerved, in the following highly finiſhed lines, <hi>the ſame thought.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>" Th' illumin'd mother ſeeks with footſteps fleet,</l>
                        <l>" Where hangs the ſafe balcony o'er the ſtreet;</l>
                        <l>" Wrapt in her ſheet, her youngeſt hope ſuſpends,</l>
                        <l>" And panting, lowers it to her tip-toe friends:</l>
                        <l>" Again ſhe hurries on affliction's wings,</l>
                        <l>" And now a third, and now a fourth ſhe brings;</l>
                        <l>" Safe all her babes, ſhe ſmooths her horrent brow,</l>
                        <l>" And burſts thro' bickering flames, unſcorch'd, below."</l>

                     <p>Now it is <hi>demonſtrably certain,</hi> that neither of theſe writers <hi>borrowed,</hi> or, more plainly ſpeaking, <hi>purloined</hi> from each other. Producing, therefore, the foregoing lines as a proof in point, I proceed to the ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Previous to her peruſal of the Botanic Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſhe had been requeſted to write an ode on a very affecting occaſion: This ode was to be publickly chaunted, for the benefit of a worthy young man; and it was an addreſs to the benevolence of the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It is not my deſign to give the ode entire; I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſcribe the part which is neceſſary to introduce the lines that ſhe imagined ſimilar—thus they are expreſſed:
<q>
                           <l>YE ſpirits bland, from heav'n deſcend,</l>

Yet theſe Eſſays, although the offspring of many a careful hour, deducing very poſſibly their higheſt charm from novelty, have now loſt, even in my own eſtimation, much of their power to intereſt and to pleaſe; and I do not, I am free to own, very deeply lament their fate.</p>

with ſuch unremitted tenderneſs, culling for it the faireſt flowers, <hi>gleaning</hi> every ſweet, and adorning it up to my beſt abilities; and now to find, that after all, I have been rearing the bantling of another! It is really almoſt too much for my philoſophy to bear; nor can my atmoſt equanimity prevent the hag vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from adding another ſcore to thoſe furrows, which time and diſappointment have already ſo deeply indented!!!</p>

                     <p>MANKIND are too prone to conſider opulence and grandeur as ſynonimous with the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments this world has to beſtow; and every effort is made for the purpoſe of aſſuming that ſtyle of living, which may produce us candidates for a rank in aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies that are frequented by perſons who are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the firſt people in a village, a town, or a city. Alas! alas! how erroneous is this calculation! Under the ſmiling countenance, which, to the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial obſerver, appears the ſeat of contentment, what woes, what cluſtering evils may rankle! The broad laugh, deſcriptive of ſuch extravagant marks of glee, why it may be the frantic expreſſion of deſpair; while thoſe contemplative features, where penſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection ſits enthroned, may be the index of a mind attaining tranquillity by viewing perſons and things preciſely in that arrangement which enſureth compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. Appearances, it is undeniably true, are not to be truſted; and the experience of every day evinceth, that a ſuperb houſe, rich furniture, and ſplendid equipages, are not always <hi>infallible</hi> marks of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of their poſſeſſor.</p>
                     <p>My friend, Pelatiah Carewell, was returning home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, after a weariſome journey, taken for the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of ſome articles of traffic, for which his frugality
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:034162_0586_0FFC704977ACF5D0"/>
induced him to imagine he could not afford to pay the commiſſions conſequent on committing their ſale to other hands. Nearly exhauſted by fatigue, he had hardly ſtrength ſufficient to urge forward his horſe, who ſeemed equally as diſpirited as his maſter. He was in an open ſleigh, on a very rough road; it was in the inclement month of January, and the rude winds buffetted thoſe locks which time had plentifully ſprinkled with venerable grey. Thus was Carewell circumſtanced, when a ſuperb carriage, finiſhed in the higheſt taſte, paſſed rapidly by him; the horſes, richly capariſoned, were in a foam; the curtains in the front of the carriage were cloſely drawn; it was attended by two ſervants, whoſe livery was perfectly well known to Carewell; and by a glance catched at the ſide glaſſes, he diſcovered a gentleman who was the companion of his boyiſh years. They were natives of the ſame little hamlet, were bred at one ſchool, and began buſineſs with ſimilar proſpects. But Claudius had left the rural ſeat of his anceſtors, and for many years had figured on a very large ſcale in the metrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olis. He had been a noted ſpeculator, had dipped deeply in navigation, and had accounts open with ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery capital houſe in and about the city. Carewell imagined the preſent expedition of Claudius had for its object a viſit of ſtate to his aged parents, who ſtill continued at the village; and he reflected on the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated ſituation to which fortune had raiſed his quon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam ſchool-fellow, with ſenſations tinged with the deepening hues of envy.</p>
                     <p>How partial, thought he, are the diſpoſitions of what we term Providence; from the hour in which I could write man, I have obſerved a uniform ſyſtem of economy; the beloved woman, who did me the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to accept my hand at the altar, hath exemplified, through her whole life, a perfect model of diſcretion. Frugality has been the order of our houſe: every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary expenſe has been abſolutely precluded, and yet my circumſtances are very moderate; and if I would not leave pennyleſs thoſe whom I have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:034162_0587_0FFC7047E5F42BD8"/>
into being, I am, in advanced life, neceſſitated to continue thoſe exertions, and that rigid obſervance, which has attended me through my commercial career.</p>
                     <p>Claudius, on the contrary, entered on the privileges of manhood with marked avidity; he plunged head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the ſtream of pleaſure; he has never been known to deny himſelf a ſingle indulgence; his build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are magnificent, his furniture is in the higheſt ſtyle, his town and country houſes are crowded with ſervants, his dreſs is that of a nobleman, his equipages are multiplied and ſplendid, and both himſelf and fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily are in the firſt line at every place of public and private amuſement. What, in the name of wonder, is the ſource of his proſperity? and to what cauſe am I to trace my own comparative depreſſion?</p>
                     <p>Such were the murmurings of Carewell; he drew up a heavy ſigh, and gloomy diſcontent pervaded his boſom. It was juſt at this juncture that the high ſheriff of the county paſſed him, as it ſeemed, in full chace! This was a phenomenon that arreſted the whole attention of Carewell; for an officer of juſtice had never before been known to viſit the peaceful hamlet of B—. His curioſity urged him forward, and he had no ſooner reached his own dwelling, than he learned that Claudius had been taken into cuſtody, juſt as he was entering the door of that cottage in which he drew his firſt breath! that his fine eſtates were all attached, and that it was ſuppoſed, upon an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſtribution of thoſe poſſeſſions which Claudius had ſo nefariouſly obtained, his numerous creditors would not receive a ſingle ſhilling on the pound!!</p>
                     <p>Carewell dropped a tear over the errors and the misfortunes of Claudius. He entered his little par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour—neatneſs preſided, the blazing hearth had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the poliſh of induſtry, the kettle boiled for tea, the elbow chair was placed in order, and Amanda, with open arms, and a ſmile of rapture, welcomed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. His children, too, crowded around him; and a little ſpruce waiting maid, under pretence of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranging
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:034162_0588_0FFA656AB7B7D310"/>
the tea apparatus, catched a peep; while a domeſtic, who had grown grey in his ſervice, took the opportunity of repleniſhing the fire, to hail once more the benign countenance of his maſter. Carewell ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf—his eyes and hands were raiſed to heaven, and exclamations the moſt extatic burſt ſpontaneouſly from his lips.</p>
                     <p>"This decent and completely finiſhed tenement is my own; my income, combined with my regular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, beſtows on me the bleſſings of competency; every thing about me is elegant: Amanda is the moſt amiable and tender of women: my children come forward with diſpoſitions that authorize the moſt pleaſing expectations; no man can advance a demand which I cannot immediately diſcharge. What is ſhow, pomp, and all the retinue of faſhionable pleaſures? real happineſs dwells not with them. Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy apparel, cards, plays, aſſemblies—henceforth I ſpend no ſigh on ſuch frivolities. Contentment ſhall meet me in the boſom of my family, and gratitude, eternal gratitude, ſhall raiſe her altars in my breaſt."</p>
                     <p>Carewell and Claudius are contraſts which are ſtrongly marked; but the intervening ſhades are many, and from their example more than one uſeful leſſon may be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; the fallacy of appearances are ſtrikingly exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and we learn to eſtimate the value of economy. We have ſaid that profuſion is not generoſity; and the propriety of this obſervation muſt be ſufficiently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious. Many a time has the humane and well deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eugenio been called to lament that his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant benefactions to proſtitutes, vagabonds, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſites, have prevented his beſtowing ſmall ſums, that would have furniſhed honeſt induſtry with the means of obtaining a livelihood. Society is not benefited by the ſhilling I ſquander on him, who, depoſiting it in the next whiſky or rum ſhop, will iſſue thence a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to his ſpecies, and probably in a ſtate of inebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, which, rendering him incapable of attending to himſelf, may produce him, with diſlocated or broken limbs, a burden on the next pariſh. But how clear
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:034162_0589_0FFC704527285A60"/>
are his claims on my property, who ſues for the means of equipping himſelf with the implements of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, manufacture, commerce or navigation. The truth is, the neceſſity of <hi>diſcriminating,</hi> muſt be appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to every ſober obſerver. <hi>Principle, plan, regularity, economy, charity</hi>—a wiſe man will embody every of theſe requiſites, and to their combined adminiſtration he will conſtantly ſubmit his movements.</p>
                     <p>Stories ſeem naturally to produce or grow out of each other; and a little narration, although perhaps not exactly analagous to the foregoing obſervations, floats, notwithſtanding, amid the viſions ſelected by fancy.</p>
                     <p>Flauntinetta was educated by the hand of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but it is not always that education can overſtep nature, and Flauntinetta continued vain, ſilly, and conſequently devoted to all the vagaries of folly. She loſt her father in her infancy, who, repoſing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect confidence in the good underſtanding, integrity, and tenderneſs of her mother, had left the whole of a very decent property at her abſolute and ſole diſpoſal; and committing alſo her daughter to her direction, he had reſigned into her hands the authority with which nature had inveſted him. Flauntinetta was ſoon capable of calculating her mother's income; ſhe knew ſhe was in eaſy circumſtances, and her warm imagination repreſented her funds as ſufficient for ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing, which vanity and ambition had taught her to conſider but as reaſonable appendages to a young lady of her figure and rank, and who was, beſides, an only child. Honoria had educated her daughter on the moſt liberal plan; and, labouring to implant in her opening mind a perſuaſion that the mere exteriors of pomp were beneath her attention, no day paſt, in which ſhe was not ſolicitous to inſtil ſome elevating principle or meliorating truth. Flauntinetta, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, continued refractory; ſhe ſickened for the haunts of diſſipation; was never happy but when viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or receiving viſits; and thoſe public entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which ſhe was not permitted to partake, were
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:034162_0590_0FFC7041C9A77750"/>
viewed with the deepeſt regret. Silks of the richeſt kind, laces of the higheſt price, jewels, &amp;c. &amp;c. theſe all made a part of her reprehenſible wiſhes; and ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery maternal check produced an altercation, during which ſhe tacitly accuſed Honoria of mercenary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, of undue ſeverity, and want of affection.</p>
                     <p>Honoria, while ſhe aſſiduouſly endeavoured to tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> her views into a right channel, and to erect thoſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary guards, which her tenderneſs and her anxiety convinced her were neceſſary, firmly perſevered in prohibiting every improper indulgence. She was a <hi>diſcreet</hi> as well as a <hi>fond</hi> mother; and her affection was chaſtened by judgment. The circles in which ſhe permitted her daughter to mingle, paſſed individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually under her judicious inſpection; and inſtead of the richly covered brocade or golden tiſſue, the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel perſon of Flauntinetta was habited in a neat, plain luteſtring; her laces were chiefly Engliſh rather than Bruſſels; and whenever her muſlins were wrought, the flowers were the reſult of her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. She was ſometimes ſeen at a public aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but more frequently at a play; and theſe amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with private dancing parties, occaſional viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſome rural excurſions, during the fine weath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, conſtituted the routine of her diverſions.</p>
                     <p>But theſe economical regulations were a conſtant ſource of vexation to Flauntinetta. "<hi>See, mamma,</hi>" ſhe would exclaim, "<hi>how richly yonder lady is habited;</hi> ſhe looks divinely enchanting, and abſolutely moves a goddeſs." "And ſee, my dear," returned Honoria, "yon beauteous nymph, how exactly that plain muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin is fitted to her elegant form; ſhe is a lovely young woman; her countenance is an index of ſerenity, and I could almoſt venture to pronounce, that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, truth and honour, with every feminine virtue, are the reſidents of her boſom." Still, however, Flauntinetta entirely diſapproved her mother's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; and ſhe determined, whenever fortune ſhould put it in her power, to make herſelf large amends for
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:034162_0591_0FFC703F2D2AA328"/>
the penurious diſcipline to which ſhe was, for the preſent, conſtrained to ſubmit.</p>
                     <p>Thus rolled on the hours and days, which at length uſhered in the deſtined morn, equally dreaded by Honoria, and wiſhed by Flauntinetta. It was the morning that was to witneſs her eſpouſals to a man of merit, and of handſome property. The beauty of Flauntinetta had procured her an eſtabliſhment, that, had her mind correſponded with her perſon, would have been fully commenſurate with thoſe fine qualities ſhe would then have poſſeſſed. And Honoria, ere ſhe reſigned that power over her daughter, with which nature and the confirming arrangements of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had inveſted her, enforced with <hi>increaſing ardour</hi> all thoſe excellent precepts ſhe had ſo often inculcated; but Flauntinetta heard her with alarming coldneſs, ſecretly reſolving to diſobey her in every particular! and ſhe was no ſooner a houſe-keeper, than, ruſhing into the ſtream of diſſipation, ſhe mingled with the moſt inconſiderate of its votaries, freely indulging in amuſements which reaſon and diſcretion refuſed to warrant. Over the mind of her huſband ſhe obtained an entire aſcendency, who was ready to exclaim with Milton's Adam, <q>
                           <hi>That what ſhe wills to do or ſay, ſeems wiſeſt, virtuouſeſt, diſcreeteſt, beſt; all other knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge in her preſence falls degraded.</hi>

A period of five years, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, terminated the career of vanity, and the cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe was truly deplorable!

Flauntinetta, the long incorrigible Flauntinetta, became a widow; and both herſelf and children were totally deſtitute!! It was in the moment of her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, that the eyes of her underſtanding being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe conſequently beheld the revered guardian of her youth, adorned with every virtue which can digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy humanity; and, once more ſheltered under the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal wing, ſhe hath, at length, learned to eſtimate the value of rational tranquillity.</p>

                     <p>TO develop the various avenues to the human mind, extenſive knowledge of men, as well as books, is neceſſary. Virtuous principles are ſometimes ſo completely muffled by vice, as not to emit even the moſt attenuated ray by which to aſcertain their exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and it ſhould be the buſineſs of thoſe who are ſkilled in the complicated windings of the heart, to make every effort to reclaim its wanderings. Mild perſuaſion often procures the beſt effect; and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

paſſions are frequently mollified and duly attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered by acts of kindneſs: Yet it is a melancholy truth, that there are individuals who are proof againſt the interference of tenderneſs; and it is beyond a doubt, that in ſuch inſtances coercive meaſures become abſolutely indiſpenſable. Adverſity ſometimes proves a powerful operator; it throws down the barriers reared by the impious hand of atrocity; it breaks in pieces the nefarious purpoſe; it aſſuages the tumult, and ſmooths the aſperities of the ſoul; and it brings to light and eſtabliſhes thoſe ſentiments of virtue, which were proſtrate in the boſom. A well authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated illuſtration of this truth is ſtrikingly preſented in the records of a family, who have long been reſpectable dwellers in the State of New-Hampſhire.</p>
                     <p>Mercator, an opulent gentleman, in the interior part of that diviſion of our country, beheld the wealth he poſſeſſed, and all the independence it conferred, as the fruits of his own induſtry; and having in early life ate the bread of carefulneſs, he knew how to appreciate the harveſt, conſequent on his laudable exertions. He had laid in her grave the affectionate companion of his youth; but he continued wedded to her memory, and two boys, the only ſurviving pledges of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love, ſhared equally the affections of his boſom. Their education was preciſely the ſame; but nature, true to herſelf, aſſerted her own prerogative; and, in defiance of every rule of art, produced them perfect contraſts to each other.</p>
                     <p>Acetus, the eldeſt, was a prodigy of vice! Deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the utmoſt degree of which humanity is capable, he ſeemed to know no joy but in the moſt daring acts of atrocity; and it was wonderful that he ſtopped ſhort of an ignominious death. Yet, although highly criminal, he, however, poſſeſſed the moſt inſinuating addreſs; and having the art to throw over his enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the tranſient veil of concealment, he had obtained, while on an excurſion at a diſtance from his native village, the heart of a truly amiable woman, whom he wedded; and it was hoped that a virtuous connexion
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:034162_0594_0FFC7037E1FF1448"/>
would produce his reformation. But ill habits are not eaſily corrected. The libertine too ſoon threw off the maſk; and the misfortunes of the ill-fated Matilda, with her two beautiful children, were pronounced ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remediable!</p>
                     <p>Adraſtus, the younger ſon of Mercator, was induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, frugal and diſcreet; and with the exerciſe of generoſity and every ennobling virtue, he was familiar. To Acetus, as his eldeſt born, Mercator had appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the better half of his poſſeſſions; and he purſued every method which involved the leaſt probability of rendering him worthy his name and family: Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately he remonſtrated, ſoothed and threatened; but Acetus was inacceſſible to every mode of attack; and large ſums, conferred by the indulgence of his father, inſtead of being converted to the aid of an injured wife and her helpleſs innocents, were devoted to the bottle, ſquandered at a gaming table, or laviſhed on proſtitutes! Mercator had but one ſtep more to take: He aſſured Acetus, that his ſucceeding to any part of his eſtates reſted wholly on his total change of conduct. Acetus ſmiled at the unmeaning threat. That Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator ſhould diſinherit him, he conceived, an event not contained in the chapter of poſſibilities; and, confid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the <hi>ſeverely tried affection</hi> of his father, he diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded this, as he had every other previous meaſure, and perſevered in the path of ruin!</p>
                     <p>Months rolled on. Mercator drew near the cloſe of life; and, being in the full exerciſe of his reaſon, he deliberately proceeded, in the moſt ſolemn manner, to the conſtituting that teſtament, which, bequeathing to Adraſtus, his youngeſt ſon, his vaſt poſſeſſions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed that young man his ſole heir, and legally cut off all the prior pretenſions and natural expectations of Acetus! A few ſucceeding weeks placed Mercator upon his death-bed; and his diſſolution, accelerated, poſſibly, by the atrocious irregularities of his enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly offending ſon, was ſpeedy and unexpected!</p>
                     <p>The hopes of Acetus now utterly extinguiſhed, all the energies of his ſoul took the alarm; and deſpair,
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:034162_0595_0FFC703571C758E0"/>
in his boſom, became the parent of the moſt aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exertions! With a kind of ſullen indignation, he ſtrode from the manſion of his late father, and making ſale of the few moveables which remained to him, in a tenement conſtituting a part of the paternal eſtate, and now devolving to his brother, he pathetically addreſſed the innocent victim of his unwarrantable irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: "Go, my Matilda," in a tone of deſpondency he exclaimed, "go—return to the ſcene of thy better days—<hi>I bleſs God that thou haſt yet a father to ſhelter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </hi>—Take theſe cherub children; bear them to the author of thy being—he will receive them—<hi>he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a father</hi>—Acetus has no more a dwelling—<hi>I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain the little moment that I breathe under this roof!</hi> Leave me, my Matilda, ſole object of my love and of my commiſeration—leave, to his unparalleled miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, thy wretched huſband. <hi>Acetus has not now the ability to provide for Matilda, or to ſuccour her infants.</hi>" Through all the devious paths of vice, in which Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus had ſo daringly ſtrayed, Matilda had never wholly loſt that aſcendency, which a mildly virtuous woman ſo naturally maintains, even in the boſom of culpabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; yet, on this occaſion, her tears and her remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances were ineffectual! On her bended knees ſhe ſupplicated him ſtill to continue her the partner of the woe-fraught ſcene—but ſhe ſupplicated in vain; and, well near ſinking under the mighty preſſure of her calamities, ſhe returned to that abode, which had wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed her early hopes and fears, and from whence, on the wings of high-plumed expectation, ſhe had ſo late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flown. But, to receive the hapleſs wanderer and her lovely children, a father's wide extended arms, and ſtill more ample heart, were tenderly expanded; and ſhe continued with this revered and natural protector, a melancholy and beautiful model of ſweet propriety.</p>
                     <p>Acetus, penetrating very far into the interior part of the country, laid out what he had raiſed from the ſale of his goods in uncultivated lands, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at a low rate; and he immediately applied himſelf, with unremitted diligence, to the felling trees,
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:034162_0596_0FFC70318A64DBB0"/>
and all thoſe preliminary arrangements, ſo neceſſary upon new grounds. To all his bad habits, in one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive moment, he bid an eternal adieu; and ſuddenly he became that very Acetus, which the good Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor had, through a long ſucceſſion of years, laboured to produce. His efforts were prodigious; what man, induſtriouſly intent upon emolument, could accompliſh, he aſſuredly did: But ſtill he was alone; and having expended every ſhilling he could command in his orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal purchaſe, he had not the means of procuring la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, nor could he obtain thoſe additional grounds which were highly neceſſary to the completion of his eſtate. It was at this juncture, that the difficulties of his ſituation appeared to him in their moſt glaring colours, when a blank cover ſupplied him with bills to the amount of one thouſand pounds! It was to no purpoſe that he diligently ſought to inveſtigate the ſource of this opportune relief; and, in a manner equally myſterious, ſums, anſwerable to his <hi>real exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> were from time to time furniſhed.</p>
                     <p>At the expiration of a few years, Acetus ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf enriched beyond his moſt ſanguine expectations. His grounds were extenſive, remarkably productive, and uncommonly well ſtocked. His buildings were multiplied, many of them elegant, and all of them in excellent repair. Heaven ſmiled propitious on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed prodigal, and all his enterprizes were crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>In an elegant carriage, conſtructed for the occaſion, Acetus appeared before the paternal dwelling which had ſheltered his Matilda. The tender mourner had continued ignorant of the fate of her huſband! Acetus was to be in all things eccentric! Mechanically ſhe approached the window—ſhe raiſed her humid eyes—Acetus iſſued from the carriage!—"Gracious Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en!" ſhe exclaimed, "continue my reaſon—my Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus approaches. My children, behold your father!" In a moment ſhe was in the arms of her huſband!—Acetus was reſtored to her—this circumſtance was of itſelf calculated to render her, beyond expreſſion, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:034162_0597_0FFC702D0F0DB2E0"/>
—But he was reſtored to virtue too—and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worthy, not only of the tenderneſs of an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate wife, but of the approbation of reaſon, and the eſteem of every good perſon.</p>
                     <p>Acetus, accompanied by the father of Matilda, ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily removed his family to his own ample and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious ſeat. Arrangements, preſcribed by diſcretion, and ſanctioned by reaſon, now took place. Matilda was the charming directreſs, and happineſs became the order of their lives. It was juſt one month after Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda was reinſtated in all thoſe privileges and immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to which ſhe was in every view entitled, that Acetus received the ſubjoined letter from his brother.</p>

                           <p>"My ſon, my dear Adraſtus, preſerve this writing, and, as you value my bleſſing, let no eye trace its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,

era which engendered pride in heaven, and plunged a third part of its denizens into the abyſs of guilty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, a ſpirit of diſorganization hath prevailed; and it is only in proportion as the diſorders in the mental world are rectified, and the mind informed, that we become ſolicitous for the general good, and are confirmed proſelytes to the beauty and propriety of order. It is undeniably true, that cuſtoms, inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the well being of ſociety, have ſometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained undue influence; againſt theſe, to ſet ourſelves in array, is laudable; but ſtill, thoſe rules which have obtained the ſanction of revolving ages, ſhould not, it appears to me, be diſcarded for trivial inconvenience.</p>
                     <p>My reflections have been thrown into this train by a little incident, and a ſimple tale, which perhaps I cannot do better than narrate, as the ſubject of this Eſſay. It was on the evening immediately preceding our laſt annual Thankſgiving Day, that a worthy tradeſman, ſeated in my parlour in a contemplative at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, with folded arms, and eyes fixed on the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hearth, as if he was preparing to pronounce a pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric upon the beauties of my fire ſide, very gravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked: <q>This Thankſgiving Day is really an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition on the free citizens of this State. It hath abſolutely ſwept away more of my running caſh, than would have ſupported my family decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a full month. I declare I ſhould rejoice greatly to ſee the obſervance of a period, which orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inates ſo much extravagance, eraſed from our cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of old faſhion cuſtoms, and I would very readily ſign its death-warrant.</q> There is ſome reaſon in your complaint, ſaid I; and if it has noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to recommend it but barely cuſtom, I alſo would freely conſign ſaid day to oblivion. It is true, it may be urged, that it is rational and pious to devote a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular day to offer up our joint praiſes, and to manifeſt our united gratitude to that omnipotent and all-gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Being, who gives us ſo richly to enjoy; but to this it will be replied, that our oriſons and thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought to aſcend with every returning day, that
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:034162_0601_0FFC702B7526C020"/>
God is not now honoured by the blood of thoſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, which are the uſual victims of a Thankſgiving Day; that luxury enervates both bodily and intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual health; and, that my friend, the tradeſman above cited, is not the only ſufferer from the extravagant profuſion of a Thankſgiving Day.</p>
                     <p>All this is pointed by conviction; but my mind, fond of inveſtigating, doth not eaſily yield its aſſent to a diſputed hypotheſis; and in the courſe of the week which contained our laſt annual gala, I termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated a ſentimental ramble, during which I had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly reflected on the ſubject, by a viſit to a valuable woman, whom I have long known; and obſerving, that in her accuſtomed manner ſhe had diſtinguiſhed the era by diſtributing to the neceſſitous, I could not forbear remarking on that benevolence which was eminently prevalent in her boſom; while, on her part, that ſhe might effectually arreſt words which were iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a panegyric on her virtues, ſhe immediately drew my attention to an unfortunate female, with whom ſhe had juſt parted. This female was born in a rank of life generally exempted from ſervile depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for he who derives his ſupport from the real or imaginary exigencies of the opulent, admitting he is induſtrious and frugal, almoſt neceſſarily commands reſpectability; and the young Urſula was cradled in the tranquil receſſes of competency; ſhe was nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cultured, and reared to maturity by parental ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; and the peaceful morning of her days was protected by a father's love. But Heaven deprived her of her maternal parent, whoſe place was ſoon fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſtep-mother; and a train of thoſe evils ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, which too commonly reſult from ſecond mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, when children were the offspring of the firſt.</p>
                     <p>Urſula was marked the daughter of ſufferance; but a ſhort interval ſucceeded her father's ill judged connexion, ere ſhe was reduced to the neceſſity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for herſelf; various misfortunes have attended her ſolitary ſteps; and, mortified and diſpirited by the proſtration of her early hopes, the diſpoſition of
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:034162_0602_0FFC7029DD01DF70"/>
her mind hath acquired a gloomy kind of acrimony; ſhe hath paſſed through life without forming a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular connexion, a prey to regret, diſſatisfied with herſelf, and with a world to which ſhe is ſo little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted. She is now far advanced in years, and ſhe is ſtruggling with infirmities. A ſcirrhus, from the progreſs of which ſhe at times ſuffers exquiſite pain, is gradually poiſoning the ſprings of life; yet ſhe may ſtill live long; and although her exertions to obtain the <hi>means of living</hi> have been marked with unremitted induſtry, ſhe hath, notwithſtanding, been frequently reduced to the laſt extremity. Of pecuniary inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, however, ſhe hath ſeldom been heard to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. She hath almoſt invariably preſerved a decent kind of pride, which hath impoſed upon her lips, in this reſpect, the ſeal of ſilence.</p>
                     <p>But on the day immediately preceding our laſt Thankſgiving, comparing, doubtleſs, the aſpect of this returning feſtival to thoſe which had formerly met her view, her fortitude forſook her; and, pale, emaciated and deſponding, ſhe ſought the parlour of my philanthropic friend. The children of misfortune know where to apply; and the road to the dwelling of the beneficent matron was pointed by a thouſand good actions.</p>
                     <p>"<hi>What ſhall I do, Madam?</hi>" ſaid Urſula, as ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the apartment, <q>I fear, alas! I fear that I muſt at length ſubmit to the rigour of my fate. <hi>To-morrow will be Thankſgiving Day,</hi> and I have not enough in the world to purchaſe a ſingle baſket of coal!</q> "Pray what is the price of a baſket of coal?" Probably the fifth part of a dollar, more or leſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the caprice or mercenary diſpoſition of the vender. <q>Not enough to purchaſe you a baſket of coal! Aſtoniſhing! but cheer up, Urſula, you ſhall ſpend your Thankſgiving Day with me; and I would adviſe you to recollect that He who commanded you into being, hath all hearts at his diſpoſal; that he is the friend of the deſtitute; and that the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to which we are ſubjected, are the diſpenſations
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:034162_0603_0FFC7033E83F7F50"/>
of paternal wiſdom, of paternal love.</q> Urſula bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſilence; ſhe was too full to ſpeak; but an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting kind of patient reſignation ſeemed gradually to pervade her grief-worn countenance.</p>
                     <p>Juſt at this period, a gentleman entered the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He had occaſionally ſeen Urſula, and he was a man of humanity. Urſula, afflicted, and much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, would have modeſtly retired; but our philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropic gentleman detained her. <q>How are you, Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula?</q> "Well, I thank you, Sir," returned the poor unfortunate. "You do not look well, Urſula—<hi>to-morrow will be Thankſgiving Day</hi>—I would have every heart glad <hi>on that day</hi>"—and he gave Urſula a handſome benefaction. Excellent memento! we will record this circumſtance in favour of <hi>Thankſgiving Day;</hi> and, if it is found, that the cuſtom of adminiſtering to the neceſſities of our fellow-mortals, is coeval with this feſtival, we will, without heſitation, pronounce its eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>
                     <p>Urſula courteſied, burſt into tears, and withdrew. A ray of hope once more illumined the boſom of the cheerleſs traveller; ſhe was animated to new exertions, and again reſuming her plans of induſtry, ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſat out for the purpoſe of ſecuring ſome work, which a fear ſhe ſhould not be able to accompliſh, had induced her to relinquiſh. On her way, ſhe looked in on a perſon, whom ſhe had been regularly in the habit of aſſiſting, for the reimburſement of a debt, incurred in order to provide herſelf with a ſmall bed, on which to repoſe her weary limbs. Urſula poſſeſſed great rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and integrity of ſoul; and the reflections occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a recollection of engagements ſhe might poſſibly never be able to fulfil, had frequently tortured her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; but ſhe now met her creditor with an invigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated proſpect of being one day able to diſcharge the laſt farthing.</p>
                     <p>Lucinda was her creditor; ſhe is a young and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able woman; ſhe is an orphan too, and altogether dependent on her own efforts for her ſupport: But, while ingenuity is her handmaid, competency hovers
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:034162_0604_0FFC70267788A8D8"/>
round her; and thoſe females, whom ſhe ſo largely contributes to adorn, muſt experience genuine compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, while they contemplate ſo fair a model for thoſe of the ſex, to whom niggard fortune hath been parſimonious of her favours. Admirable young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man! upon thy decent features, elegance and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing modeſty ſits enthroned; propriety mingles in thy train; and, while I admire thy virtues, I will daily pray, that thy love of independence may be crowned by ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>"Urſula," ſaid Lucinda, <q>you are indebted to me juſt fourteen ſhillings—to-morrow will be <hi>Thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Day</hi>—Were it in my power, I would prepare <hi>for this day,</hi> by an action which ſhould calm every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed mind, wipe the tear from the cheek of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and huſh to peace the ſigh of anguiſh; but, however limited my abilities, what I can, I will—From henceforth, that is, from <hi>Thankſgiving Day,</hi> you are free; and remember, that for your future work you are entitled to full and prompt payment.</q> This was not the firſt time Lucinda had taſted the luxury of doing good; for never had ſhe ſent a bundle of work to Urſula, in which ſhe did not convey a half-worn gown, cap, ſkirt, &amp;c. &amp;c. Yet, let me repeat, Lucinda cannot command a ſingle penny, but what ſhe receives as a compenſation for her ingenious and perſevering efforts at her needle. She is ſingle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>protected—but conſiſtent virtue ſtill remaineth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable ſhield! Do you wiſh to know what ſpot contains this wonderful paragon? Go then, and do homage to a little milliner, not a hundred miles from Cornhill!</p>
                     <p>Urſula bleſt her youthful benefactreſs, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to communicate her good fortune to my benevolent and ſympathizing friend. It ſeemed, upon that day, that the genius of benignity had been buſily employed in favour of Urſula. By a removal, to which ſhe had been ſuddenly and unexpectedly neceſſitated, ſhe was loſt to ſome well diſpoſed perſons, who had frequently aſſiſted her; neither was her place of refuge within the
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:034162_0605_0FFC702324CB1528"/>
knowledge of thoſe officers of the church, with whom ſhe communicated, who had been entruſted with the diſtribution of benefactions, collected for the uſe of the indigent children of ſorrow; a kind hearted man had interpoſed in her behalf, and her proportion of the charitable appropriation awaited her, at her hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abode.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thankſgiving Day</hi> arrived—it was whiſpered that Urſula had ſaid ſhe had not ſufficient in the world to purchaſe a baſket of coal—one and another, on <hi>that day,</hi> contributed more or leſs liberally; and a cheering ray of competency, diffuſing its genial influence over the declining life of poor Urſula, her heart was made glad.</p>
                     <p>Thankſgiving Day is, in our country, a munificent feſtival. It hath, in every view, its beauty and its propriety—all orders, and every deſcription of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, aſſemble, to offer up their general acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and devout oriſons to the Parent of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. The week, on which this jubilee is appointed, is devoted to the moſt benevolent purpoſes—to the recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the claims of the unfortunate, to the implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the boſom of the orphan, the bud of hope, and to the making the <hi>widow's heart ſing for joy.</hi> See the thronged ſtreets—crowds of deſtitute perſons aſſert their <hi>accuſtomed prerogative</hi>—they paſs on to the dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of affluence—the ſeaſon, habit, and the feelings, conſequent thereon, conſpire to render liberality ſtill more liberal. Every preſent want is ſupplied, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity is conſtituted almoner, a face of hilarity diſplac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that anxiety, which naturally clouds the brow of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering poverty; they return to their now joyful retreats—they ſmile over the ſudden plenty—their hearts overflow with gratitude—their ſpirits are attuned to praiſe—their diſpoſitions are in uniſon with their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens—they chant the ſong of <hi>thankſgiving</hi>—they join in grateful proſtrations to the God of their life; and, the expectation of this <hi>Thankſgiving Day</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſerves to mitigate the calamities, and to ſoften the penury, of the intervening year.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="260" facs="unknown:034162_0606_0FFC70219FD52F68"/>
Let me, therefore, leaving my honeſt friend, the thrifty tradeſman, to lament for his "<hi>running caſh,</hi>" frankly acknowledge myſelf a confirmed advocate for THANKSGIVING DAY. May the wiſdom of our legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors continue to recommend, and may our well diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and orderly citizens cheerfully obey—may they honour this feſtival in their <hi>accuſtomed manner</hi>—may it ſtill be diſtinguiſhed as the <hi>poor man's holiday</hi>—and may it be the coeval of this Columbian world. Yes, I will own, that I am enthuſiaſtically fond of following, as far as may conſiſt with rectitude, the example of my anceſtors. I bow with reverence, to the holidays which they have conſecrated as ſacred; and, above all, I am extravagantly—yea, paſſionately, fond of <hi>Thankſgiving Day.</hi>

                     <p>THE great ſecret of deciding with accuracy, abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the breaſt of deliberation; haſty conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions muſt ever be hazardous, and a rational man will never ſubmit that to chance, which patient and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inveſtigation may reduce to certainty. I have for many years had the felicity of ranking Patronius among my intimate friends; we have lived in the moſt unreſerved confidence; and I do not recollect a ſingle inſtance, wherein he has ever been neceſſitated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract an opinion which had received publicity from his adoption.</p>
                     <p>He is never aſſuming; his ſentiments are always advanced with modeſty, and by conſequence the bluſh of error never tinges his cheek. I am aware that this is a high panegyric, but an analytical examination of the ſyſtem of Patronius, will, if I miſtake not, evince
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:034162_0607_0FFC702015329ED8"/>
the practicability of a wiſe man, whatever may be his internal perceptions, <hi>appearing to obſervers</hi> always in the right.</p>
                     <p>It is one of the firſt principles of Patronius, to liſten to the ſentiments of thoſe with whom he aſſociates, before he hazards even a conjecture of his own; and as he has an averſion from controverſy, he never ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon a ſubject, except with a view of <hi>giving</hi> or <hi>receiving</hi> information. He is, on no occaſion, the noiſy diſputant; he will not <hi>contradict peremptorily,</hi> nor aſſert <hi>dogmatically;</hi> he does not preſume that a thing <hi>is, or is not,</hi> preciſely as it happens on a curſory view to ſtrike his perception. He is a cloſe reaſoner, <hi>but then he is a reaſoner;</hi> his diſquiſitions are marked with calmneſs; and he would prefer remaining ſilently attentive during the moſt intereſting converſation, to the uttering a ſingle ſyllable in favour of an hypotheſis which he conceived falſe and untenable. Hence, it will be concluded, that he is much more frequently a hearer than a ſpeaker, and this, indeed, of neceſſity happens; yet perſuaſion dwells upon his lips, and his opinions are rarely ever aſcertained, that they are not inſtantaneouſly adopted. His character is marked by firmneſs; he is known to be conſiſtently virtuous; and his <hi>movements,</hi> rather than his <hi>language,</hi> are <hi>deciſive.</hi> He is an accurate definer; and when he ſpeaks, ſilence, in rapt attention, bends to hear. He propoſes his ſubject at large; marks, with preciſion, its general contour; expreſſes thoſe ideas ſuggeſted by an aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate view thereof; and methodically proceeds to indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual obſervations, from whence he deduces his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive and ſelf-evident concluſions.</p>
                     <p>Truth is the great object of his purſuit; and his reſearch after this ineſtimable gem is uniformly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted with moderation. He is a pupil of the Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſchool; and, by a regular ſeries of queſtions put to his opponent, the invidious taſk of refutation is ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and his tenets are eſtabliſhed without involving thoſe rancorous feelings which are too commonly the appendages of diſputation. By this mild mode of
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:034162_0608_0FFC701DB47BFD48"/>
convincing, Patronius is ſure never to offend. Perſons are imperceptibly informed; they admire his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, without envying its brilliancy; and I have frequently ſeen the brow of this accompliſhed victor adorned by the cheerful voices and ready hands of the grateful vanquiſhed, with the faireſt laurels that ever grew in the aromatic haunts of animating praiſe! From interrogatory arguments, Patronius derives an obvious, advantage; he is ſpared the arrogance of aſſertion; conviction is gradually produced; and ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery one is ready to join iſſue in opinions which become ſelf-evident, which they have helped to elucidate, and which, with a pleaſing perſuaſion of their authenticity, pervade the mind. Thus are the feelings of compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency invigorated; prejudice imperceptibly undermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that pertinacious adherence to a favourite ſentiment, ſo natural to human pride, when attacked with leſs judgment, ſkilfully diveſted of its impoſing power. Patronius generally leaves it to his little au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to furniſh with the garb of words, the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which he has irrefragably demonſtrated; and hence, ſhould his reaſoning undeſignedly have connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a latent error, he is ſpared thoſe unpleaſant ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which would have attended the neceſſity of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hypotheſis, had he propoſed or defended it with obſtinacy: Thus he is a ſtranger to the <hi>culpability</hi> of error; and my eulogium is, <hi>ſtrictly ſpeaking,</hi> a ſober fact—its <hi>conſcious bluſhes never ting<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> his cheek.</hi> I grant that Patronius has been rarely equalled; and that he is placed in our world, a luminary of the firſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; and yet, I humbly conceive, I may propoſe him as a model for imitation; for although we may never reach the ſummit he hath attained, emulation may nevertheleſs produce its effect; and every advance we make toward the point of rectitude, will be honourable to ourſelves, and beneficial to ſociety.</p>
                     <p>Patronius has the felicity to combine thoſe qualities which have been ſuppoſed heterogeneous; and, while his movements are the reſult of cool deliberation and noble firmneſs; while his conduct is under the guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:034162_0609_0FFC701A55329AF0"/>
of prudence and propriety, the fervour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of his regards amount to the enchanting and amiable enthuſiaſm, inſeparable from ſublime and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly friendſhip. Patronius evinceth that a ſtrong and well regulated mind is ſuſceptible of <hi>every excellence;</hi> and his actions may, in the ſame moment, be conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as the ſpontaneous growth of nature, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of educated wiſdom—they are rich and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly productive; they are luxuriant as the wild and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminating impulſes of unſyſtematized liberality: But a <hi>nice</hi> inveſtigator will obſerve them carefully pruned by reaſon, and circumſcribed by the incloſure of diſcreet munificence.</p>
                     <p>I do homage to the active mind of Patronius. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, it is ſaid, will always command reſpect; and, from full conviction, I receive this ſentiment into my <hi>treaſury</hi> of <hi>incontrovertible facts.</hi> Will a weight of years deſtroy the energy of talents ſo conſpicuouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inent? If it will, we could almoſt breathe a wiſh to arreſt the progreſs of time; and with a little variation we apply and devoutly aſpirate the Homeric petition in favour of Neſtor; "What now thou art, Oh! ever mayſt thou be; and age the lot of any ſage but thee." But the uniform temperance of Patronius, will entitle him to an old age of health; while his mind will continue cheerful and active, purſuing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interruptedly a courſe of uſefulneſs to the lateſt period of his mortal exiſtence; thus finiſhing his career with thoſe meliorated ſplendors that in the morning of his days ſhining with ſtrong effulgence, emitted the faireſt hopes of meridian excellence. While he lives he will poſſeſs the applauſe of his fellow men; and poſterity will learn to venerate his memory.</p>
                     <p>"The applauſe of his fellow men!" cries Apathy; "And pray, good Mr. Gleaner, of what uſe will this be to Patronius? Pleaſe to inform us to what the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of his fellow men will amount?

with which ſhe hath encompaſſed the hero, hath at length become inſufferable; it hath ſtruck blind a number of well meaning individuals; and it hath ſo far excited the rancour of the ſcreech-owls of our day, that, if the guardian chief ſhould not ſuddenly eſcape to his native ſkies, it will be wonderful if they do not for the time being; envelop him in that denſe atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere which circumſcribes their own ideas; it will be aſtoniſhing, if, encircling him by the murky clouds of envy, they do not deſpoil him of the vagrant fame. Yet, lured by the charms of a conduct irreproachable, ſhould fame continue to enwreath <hi>the honoured brows of Waſhington,</hi> as worth ſo rare is ſeldom the growth of mortality, pretenſions more equivocal muſt ſubmit to the veil of obſcurity, or conſent to become the ſport of alternate cenſure and applauſe. Praiſe is an airy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity; a breath beſtows it, and a breath retracts; it ſoothes for a moment, but it ſoon evaporates; it ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the mind, inſinuating a perſuaſion, that, having reached the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of intellectual attainments, every future effort is ſuperfluous, and it renders us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient under the moſt gentle and neceſſary reproofs. For my part, although I may admire your Patronius, I nevertheleſs throw my gauntlet, and poſitively aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the inutility of every ſpecies of commendation; being fully able to prove its inability to confer happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and its inefficacy on the morals of mankind. He who expects his peace from the eulogizing voice of fame, is making his couch on the pointed thorns of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price—is building a ſuperſtructure on the fluctuating waves of opinion, than which nothing is more futile and unſtable. I truſt not then the treachery of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the bubble fame is not an object of my purſuit; and I am regardleſs of the opinion of the world."</p>
                     <p>Stop, ſtop, Mr. Apathy—attend a moment, if you pleaſe. The world is a vaſt, an ample theatre, and its inhabitants are an audience to each other—we are alternately actors and ſpectators; and, if we hold in contempt the opinion of thoſe who are aſſembled as our judges, the probability is, we ſhall ſoon view with

indifference thoſe virtues, the attainment and practice of which, is the purchaſe of their eſteem; and it is to be feared we ſhall ultimately become unworthy of the good we have learned to deſpiſe.

But, was there no individual whom we wiſhed to impreſs—was there no heart, on whoſe fair tablets we were anxious to ſtamp ideas of our merit, theſe external ornaments would, perhaps, be but little ſtudied; nay, in defiance of cuſtom itſelf, the probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, they would gradually be totally laid aſide.</p>

Mr. Apathy, you have then loſt an admirable incentive to conſiſtent rectitude, and you have but one ſtep further to go—you have only to throw off thoſe feelings of reſtraint, which have hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto influenced you, in regard to that all-pervading Being, who created the world and thoſe intelligencies whom you now ſo heroically deſpiſe—you have only to leap this barrier, and you rank with the four-footed tenants of the ſoil! your fears and your expectations are, like theirs, bounded by the gratification of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To the duration of communicable good, you are a ſtranger; for you cannot participate the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thoſe, whom you contemplate with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned and ſyſtematic contempt.</p>
                     <p>But, as I would hope this globe, in its extenſive round, contains not the human being, who is, in his heart, at all times, and upon every occaſion, an unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Atheiſt; ſo I pleaſingly believe, that there exiſts not a rationally intelligent man, or woman, who is not

ambitious of that fair fame, which is, ſooner or later, the accompaniment of virtuous deeds.</p>
                     <p>The Gleaner, ſolicitous to cultivate the good and amiable qualities of his readers, would endow them with that delicacy which trembles at the voice of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, and which, enwrapping itſelf in the mantle of propriety, is ſedulouſly careful to avoid even the ſhadow of ſuſpicion. He would endow them with that kind of ſenſibility, or exquiſite perception, which ſhould produce them primarily deſirous of rendering themſelves well pleaſing to Deity; and, thus inſuring the approbation of their own hearts, he would next implant the ardent wiſh to conciliate the eſteem, affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and judiciouſly diſtinguiſhing applauſe of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy perſons of every deſcription; nor could he, it is humbly conceived, preſent his friends, the younger part of them particularly, with a more powerful ſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulus to, or truly efficacious taliſman of, CONSISTENT VIRTUE.</p>

                     <p>AS there is no idea, by which I am ſo exquiſitely tortured, as that of annihilation, I naturally turn, with diſguſt and horror, from the reaſonings of him, who, laying impious hands on that principle of
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:034162_0613_0FFC700FE5D783E8"/>
animation which originates in Deity, would confound it with the common maſs of matter; and who, with grub like induſtry, having enveloped himſelf in his earthy cone, entertains as little expectation of breaking his ſepulchral encloſure, as the reptile who thus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically encruſts itſelf.</p>
                     <p>"Mamma," ſaid my little grand-daughter to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garetta, "Mamma, where do butterflies go?" I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, that a child may aſk a queſtion which would puzzle a Sir Iſaac Newton to reſolve. But although neither the wiſe nor the untaught may be able to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant <hi>learnedly</hi> on the deſtination of butterflies, yet do we take inexpreſſible pleaſure in tracing their various and ſurpriſing tranſmutations, and in dwelling with eager attention on their eventful career, until, borne on the gentle zephyr, they become tenants of the aërial world.</p>
                     <p>May not the butterfly be conſidered as a humble figure of the creature Man? In its reptile ſtate it ſeems faſtened to the earth; it is indefatigable in its attempts to obtain that ſubſiſtence it will need but a little while. At length it is evidently on the decay; it ſets about preparing for its departure; it makes ready the filaments in which it enwrappeth itſelf; it enfolds and contracts them; gradually they become a ſepulchral cruſt, in which ſecurely enveloped, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed inſect <hi>apparently bids a final adieu</hi> to the buſy ſcenes in which it hath taken ſo laborious a part. But mark the aſtoniſhing change: Theſe habiliments of death are thrown off—the hideouſly diſguſting form is no more—its newly acquired wings are expanded—they aſſume a variety of hues, and look as if deſigned in the gayeſt moments of a fertile and brilliant imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination. Hardly will the little flutterer deign to reſt on the boſom of that earth, to which it formerly ſo cloſely adhered; and, perched on ſome beauteouſly fragrant flower, and indulging in all the rich variety of ambroſial food, it ſips the emboſomed ſweets. With what aſtoniſhing celerity its movements are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed—lightly it purſues its elevated path, and we
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:034162_0614_0FFC700E5E637310"/>
gaze with admiration upon its wonderful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Was not the whole proceſs ſubmitted to our obſervation, we ſhould call in queſtion its reality; and cold philoſophy would teach us, firſt, to reaſon—ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to doubt—and, finally, to embrace the creed of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</p>
                     <p>Man, in his preſent ſtate of being, moves heavily on this opaque globe—he is principally ſolicitous, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters which appertain wholly to this life—he is often anxiouſly oppreſſed, while every acceſſion to that property he is carefully ſeeking to augment, does but increaſe his burdens. But whatever impediments may ſeem to bar his way, he, however, advances on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward—he attains the period when his quick ſenſe of earth-born joys is no more—he verges on the days on which he can ſay he hath no pleaſure—for a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he abides, and his open grave is prepared—he is incloſed in the narrow houſe, and the green turf clothes, with undiſtinguiſhing verdure, the hallowed ſpot where he repoſes. Do we ſay that we have bid him an eternal adieu? we do not ſpeak correctly; for, in the morning of the reſurrection, he ſhall burſt the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers of the grave—he ſhall iſſue from the chambers of the tomb. Behold how mortality hath put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality—he is beautiful as the inhabitants of the celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial world—he hath become as a winged ſeraph—he mounts, he ſoars on high—he purſues his trackleſs way—he attains the heaven of heavens, and he min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles with the angels who ſurround the throne of Deity.</p>
                     <p>Is my figure exceptionable?—I ſhall not contend—I did not expect it would anſwer in all its parts. I think, however, ſome of its features will be acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged ſtriking; and I could as eaſily, had I not ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar demonſtration, believe the reſurrection of the body, incloſed in yonder tomb, as I could lend my credence to the egg, the worm, the cone, the aurelia, and the butterfly.</p>
                     <p>Yet, I do not vehemently inſiſt on the reſuſcitation of this time-worn tenement. In the bloom of youth, and vigour of my days, my reluctance to a final ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:034162_0615_0FFC700C318980D8"/>
from organs ſo incomparably well adapted to my exigencies, was extreme; but a length of years have revolved—the fine machine is going to decay—I begin to detect its inconveniences—it is a heavy clog upon my purpoſes—and, when I am bounding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with all the celerity of thought, I am retarded and pulled back by its unwieldy properties. I natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wiſh for a vehicle more agile; and imagination, darting into futurity, anticipates accommodations more conſonant with my wiſhes. Hardly a day paſſes, in which I do not diſcover, in my preſent reſidence, new inſtances to prove that the building is greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; nor is this a circumſtance of regret. My glaſs informs me, that time hath furrowed my face; that my eyes no longer ſparkle with the vivacity of youth; that the gloſſy ornaments of my head are rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idly giving place; that my form is bent; that I hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in my gait, &amp;c. &amp;c. No matter—my attachment to this earthly reſidence is alſo on the decline, and I will ſupport, with fortitude, the ſufferings which may be neceſſary to its diſſolution. Whether my all-wiſe and omnific Father will raiſe it again on a nobler principle, is a queſtion that cannot greatly agitate my mind, ſince I know that his paternal goodneſs will or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain for me, preciſely that habitation, which ſhall be the beſt calculated for the full enjoyment of all my faculties. If I—if my beſt ſelf can eſcape from this wreck of nature, I am then ſure to be as "<hi>bleſt as I can hear;</hi>" and, the <hi>ſuperiority</hi> and <hi>inferred durability</hi> of ſpirit, is beyond a doubt.</p>

                           <hi>for the mental</hi> faculties decay with the corporeal; <hi>thus evincing the truth of the hypotheſis, which deſcribes them as both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing together.</hi>

                     <p>But againſt ſuch a comfortleſs and derogatory ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent I enter my proteſt. The immortal principle of life, retaining, <hi>in this debilitated body,</hi> its priſtine vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, glows indignant at the humiliating idea; and, notwithſtanding the <hi>decaying organs by which it operates,</hi> it ſtill aſſerts its own inherent fervours. <hi>Age</hi> cannot,

in <hi>reality,</hi> curtail the inborn powers of the ſoul; their elaſticity, for want of uſe, may be abridged, but their <hi>native energies</hi> can never depreciate. From the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which the immortal mind becomes a ſojourner in mortality, certain organs, by which it is to operate, are aſſigned to the celeſtial reſident, and theſe organs become the medium of its manifeſtations. In infancy the mental faculties are under a neceſſity of awaiting the acquirements of that progreſſing machine, in which they are enveloped; and the reaſon is obvious; the moſt ſkilful artiſt muſt be furniſhed with inſtruments proper to his occupation. In the vigour of manhood the ſoul ſtill finds many a laudable wiſh ungratified—its habitation is not in every reſpect accommodated to its views—it would move with all the rapidity of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—it would take the wings of the morning, and compaſs the globe in a day—it would deſign and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute in one and the ſame moment—and the reſtleſs anxiety it experienceth is a preſumptive proof, that it is appointed to a higher and more perfect ſtate. Old age arrives—and the <hi>bodily organs, ordained for diſſolution, experienceth the imbecility that marked the ſtate of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi>—the impriſoned ſpirit aſſays to quicken the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh ſtream—it endeavours to rouſe the torpid pulſe—it would render flexile the ſtiffening ſinews—with tremulous anxiety it ſearches every compartment, throws its inquiring glance through each avenue, and would act upon the complicated machine as in thoſe days when it appeared ſo much under its command—but it will not be—and it is in vain to ſtruggle againſt a ſtatute which hath paſſed the great ſeal of Heaven. The retiring immortal at length becomes conſcious that it is on the eve of its departure; it collects its ſcattered faculties, and, ſubmitting to that ſtate which bears a ſtrong reſemblance to inactivity, and which is impoſed by neceſſity, it awaits, with more or leſs reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the approaching moment of its final emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. But ſhall we for this expatiate on its dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed luſtre, ſtrip it of its immortality, prepare its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral dirge, and conſign it to the gulph of oblivion?

Strange perverſion of ideas! moſt illogical concluſion! and truly unworthy ſacrifice of all thoſe commanding incentives to virtue and ſplendid hopes, that originate in an expectation of future exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>That it is highly irrational to characterize the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal mind, from the <hi>demonſtration</hi> it maketh of its faculties by the medium of <hi>decaying bodily organs,</hi> is apparent from a variety of conſiderations. An illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trative figure this moment preſents. I take my ſeat in the midſt of a reſpectable company—a muſician is introduced—I have heard much of this performer—he is very eminent, underſtands every branch of muſic, is unequalled in the line of his profeſſion, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly excels upon the piano-forte—the inſtrument is opened, and he commences his efforts with a favourite piece of muſic. But what a futile attempt!—ſounds the moſt diſcordant iſſue from the piano—not a ſingle note is in uniſon—the flats and ſharps are confounded—he is out of time—<hi>a child, practiſing his leſſon,</hi> would have produced better tones. O horrid! I exclaim; ſurely, the artiſt is either groſsly deficient, or he has <hi>loſt thoſe exquiſite powers of execution, for which he has been ſo highly celebrated; his faculties, probably, are on the decay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>"Miſtaken man," replies the maſter of the houſe, "your conjecture is erroneous; nothing can be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the truth. <hi>The inſtrument, my good Sir, is out of tune; nay, more, an accident hath deſpoiled it of its principal keys; the complicated machinery is obſtructed in its moſt capital parts; in ſhort, it is worn out by time, diſaſtrous removals, and unſkilful uſage.</hi>" Ought I not to feel conſcious of my injurious eſtimation of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician? Does not the circumſtance of the <hi>decayed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument</hi> reſtore my high raiſed ideas of <hi>his abilities?</hi> and will it not be proper, that I henceforward render him the homage which muſt ever be due to ſuperior acquirements?</p>
                     <p>I confeſs, I take a ſuperior pleaſure in tracing, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and cheriſhing, every idea which eſtabliſhes the <hi>pre-eminence, independence</hi> and <hi>immortality of the mind;</hi> and, in the multifarious reflections I have anxiouſly
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:034162_0618_0FFC700783FF2D98"/>
made on this ſubject, I have derived much conſolation, from recurring to the ſurpriſing activity the ſpirit of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten evinces, when the bodily organs are faſt locked in the embraces of the <hi>image</hi> of <hi>death.</hi> I have thought, that the action of the ſpirit is in no moment <hi>entirely ſuſpended;</hi> and although I have paſſed many nights without a <hi>conſciouſneſs</hi> of having dreamed, yet it does not therefore follow, that the mental faculties have been unemployed. The moſt pleaſing viſions have ſometimes gathered round my ſleeping hours; meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od and propriety have been in full exerciſe; but when the re-action of the corporeal organs has re-called the vagrant ſpirit, only diſjointed images have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it has been beyond my power to recover a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle connected idea. Again, I have only been able to recollect that I <hi>have dreamed,</hi> without the veſtige of an impreſſion, by which I could trace the nature of the viſion. From theſe facts I gather, that I may dream without being at all conſcious, after the ſhadows of the night have fled, that my mind has been thus occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied. It appears to me of conſequence, to eſtabliſh the <hi>conſtant activity</hi> of the ſoul; for, if it can, for a ſingle moment, be diveſted of its conſciouſneſs and the appendages of animation; if it can <hi>ſlumber with the body,</hi> it may ſlumber for ages, it may loſe its identity, it may ſink into oblivion; and we are, by conſequence, conducted to the comfortleſs verge of materialiſm! But having expreſſed myſelf freely on this ſubject in an Eſſay, which may in future be ſubmitted to the public eye, I wave it for the preſent.</p>
                     <p>I know that dreams are whimſical, perplexing and fallacious; yet we do not always underſtand their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin or tendency; and, I conceive, there may be anal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogies in nature, of which we are entirely ignorant. One thing appears to me certain, that dreams furniſh no inconſiderable evidence of that <hi>pre-eminence, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence</hi> and <hi>immortality,</hi> which I am ſolicitous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. A perſon far advanced in years, and entering on the winter of life, every day accumulates infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Suffering under a ſevere paroxyſm of the gout,
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:034162_0619_0FFC70054230D250"/>
after a ſucceſſion of hours marked by anguiſh, nature, quite exhauſted, forgets itſelf in the arms of ſleep; to the couch of miſery the pain-worn body is ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; but the gladdened ſpirit, as if felicitating it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on its momentary exemption, indulges the full ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer of fancy. The ſcene is inſtantly changed—a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing revolution ſucceeds—youth again blooms on the cheek—the nerves are new ſtrung—the ſinews re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their wonted agility—the blood flows briſkly through the veins—health braces the frame—hope glows in the boſom—the heart leaps for joy—all is enchantment, the enchantment of the morning of life—he contemplates the tendereſt attachment—he forms new connexions—he becomes impaſſioned—and he feels over again the ardours of youth. But alas! the fleeting viſion is on the wing—a creaking door—an impertinent footſtep—the charm is broken—and the mind is again embodied by age, infirmity, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſuffering. Yet, I aſk, has it not thus produced a proof of its <hi>pre-eminence</hi> and <hi>independence;</hi> and may not its <hi>immortality</hi> be fairly inferred?</p>
                     <p>But it is ſaid, that we vainly deduce a proof of the immortality of the ſoul from dreams, ſince there are exiſting many ſtrong reaſons to ſuppoſe, that dogs and ſeveral other animals dream. And let them dream—they have my cheerful permiſſion; nor have I any objection to thoſe <hi>faithful creatures bearing me company in my native ſky.</hi> I ſhould be charmed with a treatiſe which ſhould prove, beyond the ſhadow of a doubt, the future and immortal exiſtence of every animated being. I ſhould be right happy to witneſs the era predicted by the prophet Iſaiah, who tells us, that the lion and the lamb ſhall lie down together; and ſhould they be led by the hand of blooming innocence, the ſcene would be ſtill more highly wrought. In one word, could I anſwer my little Margaretta's queſtion, "<hi>Where do butterflies go?</hi>" it would become to me a new ſource of pleaſure.</p>

But circumſtances may have combined to deny the means of inſtruction; and the proprietor of genius may paſs thoſe years when he ſhould have been entered and continued the pupil of ſcience, without receiving thoſe adventitious aids, which, with lapidarian influence, would have given to acknowledged merit the moſt brilliant poliſh; and if under a predicament unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably diſadvantageous, he attains to eminence, if although unfaſhioned by the cultivating hand of a preceptor, he burſts through thoſe intercepting clouds in which a variety of unpropitious arrangements had enveloped the morning of his days, and, rich in native reſources, blazes forth in meridian luſtre, we ſurely can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not heſitate to ſubſcribe to the juſtice of that deciſion, which, eternizing his name, inveſts him with immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.

Grammaticaſter may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly convict him of a falſe uſe of nouns and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouns, of confounding modes, tenſes, verbs and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs, and of the heinous crime of miſtaking a colon for a full ſtop; but the judicious critic will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to find the child of nature miraculouſly impreſſed with an accurate knowledge of the refinements of dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor intuitively familiar with thoſe rules which originated in convenience, and are the production of the combining efforts and continued improvements of ſucceeding centuries. The candid inveſtigator will be occupied, while peruſing the compoſitions of unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated abilities, in ſearching for thoſe natural beauties that are the offspring of genius; theſe he will point out to public view, while he will take a ſublime pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure in <hi>imagining</hi> the ſummit his author would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, had he been aſſiſted by education.</p>

Had Grammaticaſter lived in the days of Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear, he would undoubtedly have attacked, with true Zoiluan rancour, the ſplendid Bard of Nature. The <hi>two Witches ſolus,</hi> which Shakeſpear is ſaid to have introduced, would have excited his moſt ſplenetic indignation; and he would have ſought out, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable avidity and wonderful ingenuity, thoſe bagatelle, denominated defects, thence <hi>deciſively</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the divine poet of Avon wholly deſtitute of merit of every deſcription. Poor Grammaticaſter, how his ſoul is wrung by envy! See where, with fiend-like aſpect, he hovers over the flowery haunts of genius; malignantly induſtrious, he is buſy in collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deforming weeds, which, amid a garden ſo richly furniſhed, have perchance ſprung up; theſe, with invidious cunning, he combines; he eyes them with all a murderer's ſavage exultation; <q>
                           <hi>he grins over them a ghaſtly ſmile;</hi>
                        </q> and, after paſſing them through his pericranium, he produces them from the magic proceſs as high crimes in the court of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erature!</p>
                     <p>The conduct of the admirer of Shakeſperian worth, or, in other words, of him who is capable of viewing with a ſteady eye the luminous path of genius, is the reverſe of this. He traces the embodied prodigy to his morn of life; he beholds him the ſon of care; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious circumſtances deny his continuance even at a free ſchool; he is accuſtomed to the moſt rigid econ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omy, and he is initiated into all the penury of traffic; he is early bound by the ties of matrimony, and to a life of labour he is apparently deſtined. An accident, however, of a dark and unwarrantable hue, appears to be the procuring cauſe which unexpectedly engages him in the moſt arduous purſuits; and theſe preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing facts will augment the aſtoniſhment and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all thoſe who candidly reflect upon his ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent achievements, and upon the unequalled elevation to which he ſoared; they will operate as a ſponge, which will, <hi>in effect,</hi> eraſe from his pages all thoſe pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadillos, that in an author receiving a regular educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:034162_0623_0FFC6FFB5484C6F0"/>
would have been unpardonable. Far from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peding his eagle flight, they ſeem to point more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly his inimitable attainments; they are foils, which like ſpots in the ſun, ſtrikingly contraſt his original luſtre, and irreſiſtibly enforce the vigour of an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that hath proved a rich and inexhauſtible ſource, from which many a leſſer light has borrowed its effulgence.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Hannah Moore, (the celebrity of whoſe char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter might almoſt ſanction error) writing to Mrs. Montague in favour of the milk woman of Clifton, and ſpeaking of Shakeſpear, elegantly embodies thoſe ideas which I am ſolicitous to enrobe. But Voltaire characterizes this prodigious and incomparable genius, as a <hi>barbarous poet!</hi> Milton alſo is ranked in the ſame claſs by this <hi>civilized writer!</hi> yet it will not be within the compaſs even of a Voltaire, to diminiſh thoſe ſplendours neceſſarily attached to luminaries of the firſt magnitude in the literary hemiſphere.</p>
                     <p>As the ſatellite of Miſs Moore, the milk woman muſt ſtill be conſidered; and, if it is true that an adverſe cloud hath for a time intercepted the beneficent rays of that reſplendent orb, preventing the continuance of their genial influence on the humble daughter of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, the innate refulgence of an intellect, both elevat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and informed, will undoubtedly conſume every opaque impediment which hath officiouſly obtruded; and ſhe will once more receive to favour the gentle female whom ſhe hath preſented to obſervation, and whom ſhe ſo kindly ſheltered.</p>
                     <p>Woodhouſe, the Criſpian bard, extorts our pity and our admiration: Like the milk woman, common read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and writing comprized the whole of his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, from an application to even theſe uſeful branches of ſtudy, he was taken when he was only ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en years of age. Perhaps Miſs Moore's account of Mrs. Yearſley, might be ſtrictly applied to Woodhouſe; but, be this as it may, he was, however, bred a ſhoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, at which buſineſs, he was no more than a journeyman, and condemned to labour with indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:034162_0624_0FFC6FF9CFD47D80"/>
induſtry, for the ſupport of a beloved wife, and an infant progeny. We cannot but venerate both his genius and application; while we view him ſeated at his depreſſing employ, the pen and ink are at his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow; he arreſts the couplets as they preſent, and, penning them down for future reviſion, he again pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues the duties of his occupation. Of his thirſt for knowledge, we receive a very high idea, when we contemplate him after a day paſſed in earning the ſcanty pittance adjudged the price of his labour, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriating thoſe hours uſually devoted to the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſlumbers of the night, to the obtaining that intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual food, fortunately ſo amply ſupplied by books, with which the indulgence of his patron at length furniſhed him; and we yield him our full commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when we hear him in his poem, entitled Spring, penſively complain, not indeed ſo much for himſelf, as for the beauteous fair one whoſe fate was entwined with his. The circumſtances and ſcanty advantages of the poet, induces us to allow to his lays their <hi>full merit; and the invidious attempt to point out a blemiſh,</hi> would ſeem to connect a degree of criminality. Thus thought the elegant bard of the Leaſowes, when, with the utmoſt tenderneſs, and a benevolence truly charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic, he commended, ſanctioned and patronized; while his dignified condeſcenſion was only equalled by the gratitude of Criſpin, who was ambitious of elevating almoſt every poetical eſſay, by the admired name of Shenſtone.</p>
                     <p>Imagination, when tracing the progreſs of genius, unaſſiſted by education, neceſſarily ſtops to drop a tear of regret over the misfortunes, and to render the tribute of applauſe, indiſputably due to the merit and ſublime genius of Chatterton. Uncommon youth! with what facility did he arreſt and annex whatever could enrich and embelliſh; and how wonderful was the progreſs of this untutored bard! Excellent young man! de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded, whilſt thou ſojourned among mortals, of whatever could ſoothe, invigorate, or ſuſtain; thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence became the forfeit! and nought, alas! remains
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:034162_0625_0FFC6FF5F40D60E0"/>
for poſterity, but to raiſe a monument to thy memory, which ſhall endure as long as the ſmalleſt veſtige of intellectual worth ſhall continue.</p>
                     <p>But the efforts of genius, unaſſiſted by education, are alike entitled to ſuperior panegyric, whatever track it may purſue. To the natural powers of a Brindley, the celebrated projector of navigable canals we do reverence; and, while we envy the felicity of the Duke of Bridgewater, who firſt called into action talents, ſo inherently energetic, we unheſitatingly confeſs that the total ignorance of art which Mr. Brindley evinced, while ſubmitting to the inveſtigating interrogations of the Houſe of Commons, renders ſtill more conſpicuous the magnitude of his underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>The contemplation of the powers of nature, is, undoubtedly, a delightful employ: <hi>Native</hi> talent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſts with <hi>independent</hi> luſtre; and every inſtance of <hi>unaided excellence,</hi> ſtamps an idea of the <hi>inherent value of intellect.</hi> Mankind are proportionably dignified, as the <hi>inborn worth</hi> of that celeſtial emanation, which animates them to action, is acknowledged and eſtabliſhed; and, impreſſed with this ſentiment, I am free to own, that I trace with ſingular ſatisfaction, the brilliant efforts of untaught abilities, warmed to admiration and ſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulated to exertion by the unborrowed rays which they emit; I love to baſk beneath the genial beam; and I hoard, with all a miſer's induſtry, the golden treaſure.</p>
                     <p>KULIBIA, a Ruſſian peaſant, commemorated in Cox's travels, is a rich inſtance of the wonderful powers of nature; he will ever be grouped with examples of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary genius; and the bridge, thrown over the river Neva, which he projected, with many other achievements of his <hi>untutored</hi> abilities, will continue to bear teſtimony to the ſublimity of his intellect.</p>
                     <p>The conſideration of neglected education hath been the ground, on which the ſuperſtructure of female abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities hath been reared; it hath inveſted women of elevated underſtanding with an indiſputable claim to <hi>ſuperior</hi> eſtimation; for when ſucceſsfully ſtruggling with thoſe diſcouragements which are peculiarly ſexual;
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:034162_0626_0FFC6FF46EDBB658"/>
depreſſed by a ſituation neceſſarily humiliating; and checked by the invidious ſneer of the ſupercilious and pedantic critic; when, in defiance of every impediment, with talents almoſt wholly uncultivated, they boldly ſeize the palm of merit, we are unavoidably compelled to yield them that reſpectful veneration <hi>due only to mind,</hi> and which intellectual excellence muſt ever extort. But the apology for female deficiencies, furniſhed by want of education, will not, in future, be acknowledged as valid; the partial diſtribution of advantages which has too long obtained, is, in this enlightened age, rapidly giving place to a more uniform ſyſtem of information; and the frequently conteſted queſtion, reſpecting the intellectual pretenſions of the ſexes, may one day be diſcuſſed on fair and equal ground.</p>
                     <p>In the family of Alexy Michaelovitch, Czar of Ruſſia, a ſtriking inſtance is recorded where ſuperiority of underſtanding ſhone forth with decided brilliancy in the female line. Feodor and Ivan, ſons of the Czar, evinced in every particular a marked inferiority of intellect, while their ſiſter, the Princeſs Sophia, was endowed by nature with all thoſe ſhining talents, and that ſolidity of underſtanding in which her brothers were ſo remarkably deficient. Eminently qualified for her high ſtation; although a woman of uncommon beauty of perſon, ſhe combined therewith firſt rate abilities. She poſſeſſed an extraordinary knowledge in the theory of government; and ſhe knew how to reduce to practice its true ſpirit. Of perſons of genius and learning ſhe was the avowed and liberal patroneſs; and the introduction of polite literature into Europe, was encouraged and ſanctioned by her example. At an era when the loweſt ſpecies of compoſition both aſſumed and diſgraced the name of morality, this elegant princeſs occupied her leiſure hours in tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Medicin Malgrelui of Moliere. She alſo compoſed a tragedy, ſuppoſed to be the firſt extant in the Ruſſian language; and a circumſtance which adds eſſentially to the merit of this eſſay, is, that it was
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:034162_0627_0FFC6FF20C775478"/>
the production of a period when the moſt dangerous intrigues were excited and fomented againſt her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; when the ſpirit of rebellion was abroad; and, when, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>A ſenſation of painful and inſurmountable diſguſt has ſometimes arreſted my perception, when I have made one in the drawing-room of an imperious wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, whoſe awkward efforts to aſſume that dignity which is never annexed to affectation, have rendered her truly ridiculous. The approach of timid excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is announced; it enters in the perſon of a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, whoſe unaſſuming manners and retiring ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs inſtantly call up to recollection Mary Woolſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft's beautiful apoſtrophe to modeſty.

adverted to; and at her appearance the moſt prepoſſeſſing ſenſations ruſh upon the mind. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the drawing room advances a few ſteps, then recedes back, <hi>ſtands erect, courteſies formally, looks for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding, and aſſumes, as ſhe ſuppoſes, airs of importance;</hi> while, in the eſtimation of reaſon, ſhe is only giving an exhibition of <hi>inſufferable haughtineſs.</hi> In the mean time, the lovely maiden (perhaps in ſome way a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant) is abaſhed at a reception ſo little correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with her wiſhes. Of her want of conſequence, and the invidious triumph of the lady, there are many witneſſes; ſhe is covered with bluſhes; ſhe ſeems to ſhrink into herſelf; confuſed and diſcompoſed, ſhe haſtens to a ſeat; and, diveſted of that innate compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency which true politeneſs is ſolicitous to cheriſh, ſhe liſtens in ſilence during the continuance of her ill-fated viſit, to a redundance of nonſenſe, diſſertations on faſhion, and refinements on ſcandal.</p>
                     <p>True politeneſs is but another name for benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. It is ſtudious to contribute to the eaſe and happineſs of thoſe with whom it is connected—it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth to give conſequence to timid worth—it ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to elevate the humble mind, and it diſdaineth to affect ignorance of thoſe characters and perſons whoſe claim to attention is indubitable, and <hi>whom it heſitates not to careſs in its private parties.</hi> Nature, when ſhe produces her offspring, inveſts them with <hi>equal claims;</hi> and <hi>death</hi> reduces them to one <hi>common level</hi>—but vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are the paths which interſect the paſſage from the cradle to the grave: Subordination is undoubtedly neceſſary to the well-being of ſociety; and, without ſeeking to ſap the foundation of inſtitutions which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the public weal, we only contend for that affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which is proper to every condition, and well calculated to ameliorate thoſe mortifying circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attached to humble life.</p>
                     <p>The celebrated Mrs. Wright, introduced by her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common talents to a perſonal knowledge of the nobil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and gentry of the kingdom of England, had, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her reſidence in that country, an opportunity of
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:034162_0629_0FFC6FECF92D0238"/>
making many characteriſtic obſervations; and, in one of her letters, ſhe humorouſly contraſts the manners of the woman well educated, and poſſeſſing habitual and <hi>real ſuperiority,</hi> with thoſe of a female, conducted by a variety of fortuitous events to move in a ſphere for which neither her natural nor acquired abilities had qualified her. Mrs. Wright devoted a fine winter morning to calling <hi>en paſſent</hi> on ſeveral of her patrons; and among the number of thoſe whom ſhe attended, and who were ambitious of obtaining celebrity, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting in their liſt of acquaintance the votaries of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, was the lady of a baronet, who had been raiſed from obſcurity, to <hi>all</hi> the privileges annexed to rank and title.</p>
                     <p>In the ſuperb manſion of this <hi>chance created lady,</hi> Mrs. Wright, after ſending up her name, was reduced to the neceſſity of waiting a tedious interval; and, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the chilly blaſts of December were abroad, no genial blaze decorated, by its cheering flame, the gloomy chimney! It is true the elegant apartment, in which ſhe waited the convenience of <hi>the lady,</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in high taſte; but this circumſtance did not poſſeſs a ſufficient intereſt in the boſom of Mrs. Wright to charm her ſenſe of ſuffering; and ſhe regarded the ſummons, which admitted her to the preſence of the proprietreſs of the manſion, as an emancipation from a very unpleaſant ſituation. The reception ſhe obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was, however, not more to her taſte. <hi>The lady</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the moſt petrifying airs of ſuperiority; and both her language and her manner were cold as the icy breath of the northern tempeſt: But Mrs. Wright, having the addreſs to curtail her viſit, hurried away to lady N—, at whoſe toilette, <hi>ſan ceremonie,</hi> ſhe was immediately admitted, and inſtantly engaged in that pleaſing interchange of civilities, which ſo frequently marks a female <hi>tete-a-tete.</hi> Lady N—chatted fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly; ſoothed the ſelf complacency of our Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can adventurer, by eulogizing the art in which ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated future eminence; and, after completing the labours of the toilette, agreeably to a previous appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:034162_0630_0FFC6FE9E14DC1C0"/>
accompanied her to the royal preſence; and the benign condeſcenſion of the Britiſh queen, was evinced by ſtill higher demonſtrations of affability, than thoſe which had graced the manners of lady N—.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Wright, penetrated with the moſt lively grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſet no bounds to her joy or her admiration; and, after narrating the particulars of this interview, ſhe obſerved, that in exact ratio as ſhe approached the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral and ſplendid ſource of genuine magnificence, the mild regency of urbanity became more ſtrikingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent.</p>
                     <p>Thus the orb of day, with regular munificence, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth over the globe its genial influence; while the glow-worm ſparkles only for thoſe who take their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within its narrow limits.</p>
                     <p>From a gentleman intimately converſant with Mrs. Wright, I have been furniſhed with ſome anecdotes relative to this extraordinary woman, which, as their authenticity is unqueſtionable, I ſhall preſent, as a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographical ſketch, that I preſume will not be altogeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unintereſting.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Wright was a branch of a family, reſiding in Croſſwicks, in the Jerſies, of obſcure extraction, and humble circumſtances; but remarkable for the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities, which diſtinguiſhed its individuals. Of her father, Mr. Lovel, many ſingularities are narrated; but, as it appears that his life was unoffending, he had a right to the indulgence of his innocent caprices. After his demiſe, his eldeſt ſon determined to erect for himſelf a dwelling, agreeably to the faſhion of his own ideas; and he combined with this reſolution the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ambition of preparing the materials with his own hands. He not only deſigned, but executed; and, both the tenement and its furniture were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of his ingenious induſtry, while every article evinced the ſkill of a maſter! He next conſtructed a ſpinnet, from which, <hi>ſelf taught,</hi> he drew ſuch tones, as are not often ſurpaſſed. The violin, too, became ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the verſatility of his genius; and he both made
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:034162_0631_0FFC6FE85A13DF70"/>
that pleaſing inſtrument, and executed thereon the moſt extenſive compoſitions.</p>
                     <p>It appears, that either from want of ability or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, Mr. Lovel, the old gentleman, had not been over ſolicitous reſpecting the education of his children. Mrs. Wright was apprenticed to a mantua maker, with whom ſhe continued, until ſhe was miſtreſs of her buſineſs. She formed her matrimonial connexion early in life, which connexion was unhappy; and her little family drew their whole ſupport from her induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious application. But, although her conduct during this part of her life was truly meritorious, yet, as her exertions were apparently the reſult of neceſſity, they did not pointedly evince thoſe remarkable talents, which eventually produced her in the firſt circles in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of England; nor did the demiſe of Mr. Wright produce an immediate change in her arrangements—the mantua making buſineſs ſtill afforded her a kind of ſubſiſtence—her week's work procured her week's ſupport, and her hours revolved in their accuſtomed routine, until an accident, rendered important by its conſequences, originated a ſurpriſing revolution. A woman, offering wax figures for ſale, ſtopped at her door; when Mrs. Wright, poſſeſſing a large ſhare of that curioſity inſeparable from ſuperior abilities, queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned her relative to the compoſition of her commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and, for a ſmall conſideration, obtained that infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which proved to her the ſource of uncommon celebrity, and great pecuniary emolument. The celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſpark of genius, ſo long dormant, was inſtantly blown into a flame; and, immediately throwing up her buſineſs, ſhe became the ingenious fabricator of a new and aſtoniſhing creation! Her ſucceſs was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond her moſt ſanguine expectations: from fancy fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, ſhe proceeded to particular reſemblances; and from her faſhioning fingers grew the moſt finiſhed likeneſſes. General admiration was excited, and the gratitude of thoſe, who beheld exact tranſcripts of their beloved connexions thus multiplied and perpetuated, knew no bounds.</p>

Bordentown, where ſhe had reſided during her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſoon became too narrow a field for the diſplay of talents ſo rare, and ſhe removed to the city of New-York, where ſhe advanced rapidly in the career of fame! She ſoon furniſhed a ſpacious apartment with her figures, conſiſting of the moſt celebrated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, in ſacred and ſecular hiſtory, aſſociated with reſpectable moderns, and beings, copied from her own imagination. By the liberality of her patrons, ſhe was amply ſupplied with the neceſſary dreſſes, and her rooms became the reſort of the curious, the gay, and the idle. Her next attempt was painting; and her eſſays, in this elegant art were by no means deſtitute of merit. Among other performances, ſhe painted a miniature of Governor Tryon, which was eſteemed an admirable likeneſs. Thus, uncommonly qualified by the liberal hand of nature, the orbit of this younger world being judged a ſphere too contracted for abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſo ſplendid, ſhe was encouraged to croſs the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic; and, furniſhed with letters to Doctor Franklin, then reſident in England, and many other reſpectable characters, ſhe bent her courſe over the great waters, taking with her ſome of her moſt capital pieces, as ſpecimens of her abilities. Governor Tryon encloſed, by Mrs. Wright, the miniature ſhe had painted, as a preſent to his ſiſter, then maid of honour; this proved a moſt happy introduction. The lady, charmed with the accuracy of the ſimilitude, was proportionably pleaſed with the inſtrument; and it is hardly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to add, that her good offices were, from that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſecured. The protection and aſſiſtance of Doctor Franklin was in courſe, and the nobility and gentry, of every deſcription, were numbered as her patrons. To her American collection of illuſtrious perſonages, ſhe added, while in England, the moſt celebrated char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters of that nation. Even their majeſties ſubmitted their heads to the proceſs of her art, and a juſt tribute of applauſe was rendered her, by all ranks. Lord Chatham was among the foremoſt of her favourers; he was an admirer of <hi>native genius,</hi> and a likeneſs of
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:034162_0633_0FFC6FE4A3687FB8"/>
this truly patriotic and deſerving nobleman, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of her ingenuity, now figures among the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ornaments of Weſtminſter Abbey.</p>
                     <p>Thus countenanced, and thus ſupported, her income, it will be readily believed, was ſufficiently lucrative: She generally averaged nineteen guineas per week; and, conſidering the rapid progreſs ſhe had made to attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo ſplendid, conſidering her origin, and group<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame view her eſtabliſhed and unequivocal celebrity, we are ready to ſuppoſe her in poſſeſſion of a fulneſs of felicity; but, it is, alas! true, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent happineſs is not the growth of humanity.</p>
                     <p>As Mrs. Wright poſſeſſed great depth of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, her intellectual powers were, of courſe, much exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and the calculation of the probable conſequences of events, was to her a continued ſource of inquietude. She was a profound politician, and her regrets, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſtruggles in which her native country was involved, were immeaſurably afflicting. Her attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſoil on which ſhe had drawn her firſt breath, was natural, if not laudable; but, it is to be wiſhed that ſhe had forborne to engage in a conteſt, ſo invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as that of an ardent diſquiſition, relative to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic men and meaſures; eſpecially, as it ſeems to have put a period to thoſe advances ſhe was ſo rapidly making toward a ſplendid eſtabliſhment of herſelf and family. It has been obſerved, that, although ſhe was capable of the moſt ſolid and forcible reaſoning, yet, her converſation was often ſo fervid and irregular, as to originate an idea of a derangement of intellect; this, probably, was the reſult of a warm imagination, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in early inſtruction, and a want of the habit of methodizing her ideas; and, from this trait of incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in her obſervations, and manner of expreſſing her ſentiments, her character, <hi>in fact inoffenſive,</hi> may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have been miſunderſtood. But, be this as it may, ſhe experienced unequivocal marks of the decline of public favour; and a conviction ſo painful, together with combining circumſtances, induced her to paſs over into France, where, under the auſpices of Doctor
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:034162_0634_0FFC6FE22957B5B0"/>
Franklin, ſhe was known, diſtinguiſhed, and eſteemed. At the cloſe of the war, ſhe, however, returned to England, thus demonſtrating a decided preference to the Albion ſhore; and ſhe expreſſed the warmeſt wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for the perfect reſtoration of amity and unreſerved confidence between the United States and their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent country. This aſtoniſhing woman finiſhed her mortal career in the month of March, 1786.</p>
                     <p>In the family of Mrs. Wright, genius ſeems to be hereditary: Her ſon now takes rank in the firſt line of painters in the iſland of Great-Britain; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but wiſh him a double portion of that ſpirit of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation, which is ever ſtimulating to the higheſt attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the gift of fame.</p>

This is the ſelection of many a judicious traveller; but beſides that the curtailed days of September and October frequently ſpread the evening ſhades, before the diſtant tour is performed, I have many other cogent reaſons for preferring the vernal months to a more advanced ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>The morning of the year lifts its young head, and the enthuſiaſm of enchantment is in its gift; and although I do not contend for its intrinſic ſuperiority over the more ſubſtantial bleſſings attendant upon

harveſt home, yet, to the pleaſed eye of contemplation, it is adorned with inimitable charms. Many and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious are the advantages it poſſeſſes—its ſucceſſion is the wiſh of every heart—it diſplaceth the long dreary nights, which, with gloomy regency, have pervaded the wintry months—it unbars the gates of life—the ſnow clad mountains once more lift their green heads—the howling blaſts of winter are no more—the tepid airs are abroad—deſcending ſhowers ſucceed each other—the mildly beaming ſun emits its genial rays—all nature aſſumes an intereſting aſpect—and the pleaſures of poſſeſſion are inſeparably blended with thoſe of anticipation. Look where the ſpreading branches are loaded with the ſweet ſcented and promiſe giving bloſſom. See the flowery tribes expand their odoriferous leaves—the ſurrounding atmoſphere is richly perfumed—every breeze bears its proportion of the grateful effluvia, and we bleſs the ſalutary gale. The mellow toned warblers of the vernal ſeaſon purſue their azure path, or enchantingly carol in the branches. The orient beams of light ſmile along the ethereal plain; not a view but is ſtampt with the moſt pleaſing impreſſion of which it is ſuſceptible—but is fraught with images of rational pleaſure; nor can we do leſs than partake the general joy.</p>
                     <p>Juſt returned from a tour of friendſhip, my heart at this moment glows with all thoſe complacent ſenſations inſpired by an extenſive view of nature, garbed in her moſt faſcinating charms. My excurſion has led me through a delightful diviſion of the Union, diverſified by grove crowned hills, romantic vales, enamelled meads, and broad meandering ſtreams. My route lay along Connecticut river, and through that part of the State of Maſſachuſetts, which led me over Charles river, Malden, Beverly, and Eſſex Merrimack bridges. Every obſerver who hath traced this circuit, will readily acknowledge that it takes in a tract abounding with the ſublime and beautiful. The moſt rapt ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ruſhed on my ſoul, while the poverty of words neceſſitated me to remain ſilent.</p>
                     <p>

The laſt mentioned bridge pronounces a panegyric on the abilities of the ingenious Mr. Palmer. It is totally different from the others, and appears to me to be a complete piece of architecture. It hath a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle arch which meaſures 160 feet from baſe to baſe, and its elevation in the clear is forty feet above high water mark. The liberty, granted by the legiſlature of Maſſachuſetts, for the erecting this bridge, was, I am told, clogged with conditions of a ſingular nature; but the particular ſtipulation deſigned to cruſh it, has given it the nobleſt effect; its ſtability, by a wonderful contrivance, has received an aërial completion; and, while it exhibits every idea of durability of which its materials are ſuſceptible, it happily unites what is not always combined with this fundamental advantage, a light and airy contour; and its finiſhing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>truly elegant. Great commendation is due to the meritorious artiſt. With much labour he hath ſince thrown a bridge over that difficult ſtream, commonly known by the name of Bloody Point Ferry; and he is now, we are told, employed in the Federal City, where, we doubt not, his talents and application will receive an adequate recompenſe.</p>
                     <p>Eſſex Merrimack bridge is uſeful and productive beyond the moſt ſanguine expectations of the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. It joins an enchantingly romantic little iſland to the main land: Its works are ſo wholly detached, as to wear the appearance of two bridges; and the convexity produced by the arches, is extremely beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. A commodious houſe of entertainment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining dancing and dining halls, are frequently the ſcene of thoſe pleaſurable hours which the gentlemen and ladies of Newbury-Port devote to hilarity: it is diſtant from that reſpectable emporium only three miles, on a fine level tract, ornamented on either hand with trees of various growth, elegant ſeats, diſtant hills, and verdant plains. From the window of this convivial tenement, we have a view of a beautiful grove on the right, and the towering bridge on the left; and, I am inclined to think, our country produces few more
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:034162_0637_0FFC6FD89DECD7C8"/>
captivating ſcenes than are to be found upon Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack bridge, and its environs.</p>
                     <p>I have enjoyed ſome delightful hours in the courſe of my tour; I have brightened the chain of amity, and the heart of confidence is invigorated. My af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections expand, they glance comprehenſively on the univerſal family of man; and I feel that humanity, of whatever deſcription, or wherever found, is inſcribed by the finger of Deity, is in poſſeſſion of the unalien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rights of fraternity.</p>
                     <p>Warmed by the genial heat of a vernal day, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid quits the ſolitude in which he hath been immur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he inhales the ſalutary breeze, and he becomes invigorated by the parent beam. The reſurrection of the year is alſo a ſolace to old age, and it is frequently regarded as a figure replete with conſolation. "How fares you, Plato?" cried my friend, "I thought this fine ſeaſon would bring you along; and I am glad to ſee you with all my heart."</p>
                     <p>Plato is a black man, born in Africa, who has num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, according to the moſt accurate calculation which can be obtained, one hundred years; and he was for ſixty years of his life the confidential friend and faithful ſervant of his maſter. The good old gentleman, when dying, evinced his high ſenſe of the merit of Plato, by beſtowing on him his liberty, and bequeathing him a piece of land, ſpacious enough to afford him, and a woman whom he had wedded, an ample ſupport. A neat built cottage was upon the ground, it was ſuitably and conveniently furniſhed, and the legacy comprized the neceſſary farming uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils.—"I am glad to ſee you with all my heart, Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to," ſaid my friend—"<hi>Tanke,</hi> Sir, <hi>tanke,</hi>" replied Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, "I come one <hi>pring</hi> more; I do know if I <hi>eber</hi> come agen; but all winter, when <hi>e cold weder</hi> and <hi>e torms</hi> come one after <hi>anoder,</hi> I <hi>tink</hi> I go and ſee maſer's friends ſoon <hi>eber e come pring.</hi> I got no new <hi>quaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> maſer's <hi>quaintance</hi> good enough for Plato; ſo I <hi>go e</hi> ſee <hi>dem,</hi> and <hi>den</hi> Plato <hi>e</hi> go home, make <hi>e</hi> old woman glad to hear <hi>e</hi> friends all well."</p>

Happy advantage of years, which thus properly throws down thoſe diſtinctions of which we were once ſo tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: which gradually ſlopes the way to that equality, reſerved for us in the ſilent tomb; and which may probably, in ſome degree, obtain, in the more perfect ſtate of being on which we verge. Plato's ſpring was a kind of renewal of his youth; and the anticipated regency of the vernal months, helped to cheer and buoy up his ſpirits when the wintry blaſts ſounded fearfully in his ear.</p>
                     <p>A few weeks ſince, and the trees diſrobed of their verdant foliage, bent beneath their icy burden; the vigour of the ſeaſon arreſting the progreſs of the ready boatman, impoſed upon his induſtry its incontrovertible embargo. How ſtrongly pointed is the captivating reverſe—the jocund ſwain reſumes his agricultural employ; he carols gratefully as he haſtens over the dewy lawn; he turns the fertile glebe; he ſtrews the promiſe giving ſeed; and the golden days of harveſt riſe to his imagination. The roſy milk maid paſſes cheerfully on; ſhe joins the muſic of the groves, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, as ſhe trips along, the ruſtic lay. Aurora, with her purple fingers, hath opened the gates of morn; the heavens are fringed with gold; the ſun-beams glitter over the azure vault, and the children of econ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omy reſume their various employments. Again the boatmen ply their oars; the emancipated river invites their efforts; once more it becomes the path of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and a little foreſt floats upon the boſom of the ſilver ſtream.</p>
                     <p>I love the various excurſion; and the different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and cuſtoms, obſervable even in neighbouring towns, are to me ſources of inſtruction as well as amuſement. Perhaps, were I to characterize my countrymen from my own experience, I might orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate very erroneous ideas; yet the faithful recorder will regiſter as he obſerves; and, impelled by truth, I have to ſay, that as far as hath come under my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, Columbia hath not neglected to acknowledge the claims of the ſtranger. Wherever I have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:034162_0639_0FFC6FD4ED131000"/>
hoſpitality hath hailed me welcome; and the grateful greetings of civility, when far diſtant from my native haunts, hath vibrated pleaſantly on my ear. With a contemplative eye I have paſſed on, and the tracing of reſemblances hath been one of my pleaſures: many a dignified matron hath reminded me of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Mary; to the ſympathizing fair one I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the ſtory of her conjugal faith, and the loves of my Margaretta and her Hamilton hath arreſted the attention and intereſted the feelings of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous female, who, unacquainted with their perſonal attractions, could only be influenced by a predilection for intrinſic worth.</p>
                     <p>But I give place to a lady whoſe tour of pleaſure ſeems not to have correſponded either with her expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations or her merit, and whoſe remarks may ſerve as a proper ſupplement to this Eſſay.</p>

any requeſt, importunately urged, agonizes me beyond deſcription; and I have frequently done vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to my moſt favourite wiſhes, and broke in upon plans that have been regularly arranged for a whole year, merely becauſe I had not the firmneſs to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſolicitations of thoſe, who did not care three braſs farthings what became of me or my views.</p>
                           <p>But, to begin my journey—I ſat out, eſcorted by my brother, a modeſt, docile young man, altogether as unequal to oppoſition as myſelf; we had taken places in the ſtage, a front ſeat in which is generally thought the leaſt eligible; but as it was my wiſh to inhale the perfumed breeze, and to indulge myſelf with viewing the beauty of the ſurrounding proſpects, I had ſtipulated for one of thoſe ſeats. I was not, however, permitted to occupy it; my remonſtrances were ineffectual; <hi>the travellers too well underſtood what belonged to politeneſs,</hi> to let me remain in a ſituation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to duſt, wind and ſun; and I was compelled to take my quarters in a back ſeat, where I was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nearly ſuffocated in the want of air, and had noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in view but the number of very <hi>civil perſons,</hi> who had thus contrived, with a politeneſs on which they plumed themſelves very highly, to intercept every oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proſpect.

reached the abode of my friend, than, avowedly for the purpoſe of contributing to my felicity, a numerous family, in all its branches, was thrown into confuſion; a redundancy of apologies poured from every mouth, and they expreſſed, in the moſt moving terms, their regrets that their abilities were not proportioned to my ſuperabounding merit. The children, too, were in diſhabille—Mary's ſlip happened to be the worſt ſhe had; Catharine's holiday ſhoes were immediately or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered out; and the eldeſt ſon, that he might exhibit his parts to the beſt advantage, was directed to pin on thoſe ruffles which were ſewed to tape, and carefully reſerved to ornament his perſon on thoſe gala days, which occaſionally occurred in the family; but a new ſcene of diſorder was thus opened, one of thoſe ſaid ruffles was unfortunately loſt, in ſearch of which the whole houſe was engaged, and every thing turned topſy turvy; yet, although each individual largely ſhared the perplexity produced by this accident, the ſearch proved ineffectual, and maſter Johnny was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the neceſſity of ſetting down to ſupper with only one ſolitary ruffle! The good man of the houſe was thus furniſhed with an admirable opportunity of expatiating on female <hi>nonſicallities</hi> and <hi>primoſities,</hi> and his ſatirical remarks were only ſuſpended for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of helping to load my plate.

the enſuing day, ſcorched by the intenſe rays of a meridian ſun, I was dragged over grounds, that evinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing ſo much as the ill taſte of the owner, and returned to take my ſeat at the dinner table, where the incidents which occurred ſeemed but a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſcene opened the preceding evening</p>
                           <p>A round of viſits ſucceeded, all of which were in the ſame ſtyle. I recollect one afternoon, a timely ſhower having given a peculiar ſweetneſs to the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breeze, being on one of theſe ſame viſits, I antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated the pleaſure of my walk homeward, diſtant about two miles; but this very ſhower, from which I had promiſed myſelf ſo much, proved a new ſource of vexation. The lady of the houſe, fearful that I might take cold after the rain, inſiſted on my accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cloak; it was to no purpoſe I aſſured her it would be particularly inconvenient to me; ſhe was not to be outdone in good breeding; the cloak was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced—it was a <hi>thick ſatin, lined, and full trimmed with a rich dark ſable!</hi> I glowed ſpontaneouſly at its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach! but notwithſtanding all my reſiſtance, I was arrayed in this cloak; and I returned to my tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary home in a profuſe perſpiration. I might, Mr. Gleaner, proceed in my narration; but I have nearly got to the bottom of my paper. If I am properly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, you may hear from me again; and, in the mean time, I take the liberty to add, that I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>true politeneſs to conſiſt in making people eaſy, and in permitting our connexions to enjoy themſelves in their own way.</hi> I am, good Mr. Vigillius, your moſt obedient humble ſervant, and conſtant reader,</p>

                     <p>ALL the energies of benevolence, reſponſive ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, heavenly commiſeration, a heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the moſt extenſively munificent plans, a head to faſhion, and perſeverance to execute—All theſe I have ſeen contained in the compaſs of one little frame; and this frame, invaded by the deſpoiler, was conſtantly ſtruggling to make head againſt the inroads of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiate victor, whoſe deſpotic ſway will continue, until the renovating morning, when He, whoſe government is univerſal, ſhall annihilate the power of a tyrant, who hath hitherto exulted to deſtroy.</p>

Thou wert hailed as the friend of the deſtitute, who experienced, as ſurely as they made application, either thy bounty or thy extricating interference. While a ſingle piece remained, thy purſe continued open; and when thy immediate powers of aiding thy ſuffering brethren were exhauſted, thy acceſs to kindred benevolence, facilitated by thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common merit, furniſhed additional ſupplies; and ſuch were thy reſources, that the means of repleniſhing thy own funds were ſtill at thy command.

It can hardly be neceſſary to name a man, whoſe general celebrity was ſo ſtrongly marked. The ſons of ſorrow will not forget to revere his memory; the liſping tongues of the children of gratitude will ſtill chant the praiſes of the philanthropiſt; and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded benevolence of a Joſeph Ruſſell may wake to extacy the yet unborn admirer of tranſcendent excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Doubtleſs, he was a branch of the Shandian family; "<hi>the milk of human kindneſs,</hi>" with a never ebbing current, flowed in his veins; nor did any Le Fevre languiſh, within his knowledge, to whom he did not haſten to adminiſter the oil and wine of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I recollect an anecdote relative to this benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent man, not perhaps generally known; and, as I conceive it will ſtrikingly evince his affinity to the Shandian ſtock, I feel impelled to produce it. The circumſtance adverted to, took place in his youth, when his pulſe beat high for pleaſure, and the hilarity of his diſpoſition frequently preſented him at the ſhrine of genuine humour.</p>
                     <p>A party of young men had determined to devote a morning to ſhooting. Ruſſell, the ſoul of every enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was ſolicited to join in the predatory ſcheme; and, unſkilled in the ſcience of refuſal, the tenderneſs of his diſpoſition was for once ſacrificed to his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating temper. The evening preceding the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment was ſpent in preparation for the important enterprize; and, at the peep of day, accoutred <hi>cap-a-pie</hi> for the occaſion, he joined his depredating comrades. They marched for a time in a compact line; but judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſo formidable a body would ſpread the alarm through the little community, againſt whoſe rights they were plotting, they conceived ſome manoeuvring neceſſary; and, departing in ſeparate directions, they prepared to ambuſh the little beings, who, alas! poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed neither policy nor defence, ſufficient to enſhield either their own lives, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> that of their beloved neſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
                     <p>Ruſſell placed himſelf in a cumbent poſture on the velvet margin of a limpid ſtream, almoſt ſurrounded
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:034162_0645_0FFC79494AC1B538"/>
by the tall trees that towered on its banks; his piece, primed for execution, was by his ſide, and ſcarce a breeze interrupted the peaceful ſerenity of the ſcene. The ſun was juſt riſing above the horizon, and its ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant influence, darting through the foliage, ſpangled every dew-drop, and glittered over the azure boſom of the ſlowly winding rivulet. The birds, at length, flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in the branches, began the progreſs of the day. A parent robin perched on an extreme bough, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending exactly over the head of our young adventurer, unconſcious of the miſchiefs that awaited him, incau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly kept his airy ſtand. The ambuſhed foe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his piece, took aim, graſped the trigger, and was on the point of diſcharging his piece, when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary warbler, apparently in the moment of his fate, poured forth from his little throat ſuch a ſtream of melody, as was more than ſufficient to arreſt the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of a much greater adept in the ſcience of bird-killing. The faſcinating notes vibrated on the ear of Ruſſell with ſwan-like efficacy; he dropt his piece, and again reclined perdue; he ſtill liſtened; but his deſign was to <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ear,</hi> and not to <hi>deſtroy.</hi> The robin was ſoon joined by numbers of the feathered choir, who, mingling their matin lays, continued melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly chanting; the ambient zephyr echoed the ſtrains; every breath was in uniſon, and the muſic of nature floated around. It was a ſcene worthy of benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and the rapt ſoul of Ruſſell acknowledged its congeniality. "Bleſt innocents!" he cried, <q>go, war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the ear of the maternal bird, and glad, by your ſweeteſt carols, the domeſtic neſt; narrate, my little flutterers, how you have diſarmed your enemy, and ſay, that againſt lives ſo unoffending, his hand ſhall never more be raiſed.</q> The birds, as if obedient to his mandate, or, more ſtrictly ſpeaking, alarmed by the ſound of his voice, ſpreading their party-coloured wings, inſtantly diſperſed; and Ruſſell, ſhouldering his firelock, triumphantly left the grove.</p>
                     <p>To the raillery conſequent on the tenderneſs of his nature, he was fully equal. His party had, what they
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:034162_0646_0FFC518BDABBDF40"/>
termed, a ſucceſsful morning; and the feathered vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims they produced, evinced the <hi>deathful</hi> valour of their exploits. Ruſſell, on that memorable day, feaſted on vegetables, in all their maturity of excellence and rich variety; he conſecrated the era ſacred from the repaſt of blood; and the ripened ſtrawberry, meliorated by refined ſugar and a flowing bowl of cream, crowned his deſſert; nor was he ever after known to attempt aught againſt the defenceleſs and tuneful inhabitants of the grove.</p>
                     <p>I have thought that Ruſſell's robin was a fit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion for Uncle Toby's fly; and, that the annals of benevolence may no longer record the Shandian ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition as a ſolitary inſtance, it is here inſerted. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend alſo, that the benign feelings which preſerved the life of the robin, were original in the boſom of Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell; for, at that period, his eye had never travelled over the heterogeneous pages of Triſtram Shandy.</p>
                     <p>The action, however trivial, was indicative of the diſpoſition of the man; and it may be viewed as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle thread of that web, the texture of which was equal and conſiſtent. He was, in the moſt extenſive ſenſe, a philanthropiſt; the poet has perfectly delineated him. His ſympathy and humane exertions primarily embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe whoſe alliance to his blood naturally demanded his aid; but the rays of his beneficence, diverging from a centre ſo virtuouſly infixed, extended their genial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to his fellow-citizens at large; and the human being exiſted not, whoſe claim to his regard he refuſed to acknowledge. Nay, his capacious mind, emanating from the Parent of the univerſe, encircled, by its over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing aſpirations, every being of every deſcription. He anticipated the extermination of evil; and he ſaw, in imagination, vice, and its concomitant, ſorrow, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed from the wide extenſive circle of all intelligence. No wonder then that earth poſſeſſed, in his eſtimation, ſuperior charms, and that, viewing it as the production of a ſupreme and beneficent Architect, it was dreſſed for him in ſmiles. When the ſevering angel caught from his embraces hoſe he beſt loved, he felt, it is
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:034162_0647_0FFA65BBEA921DF8"/>
true, a pang; but that pang was tranſient; and, wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his cheek the natural tear, his elevated ſpirit rejoiced in the aſſurance, that he alſo was in a ſtate of progreſſion, and that he ſhould ſoon rejoin them in a new and improved ſtate of being. Thus he paſſed on; and, while he bleſſed the bounties of Omnipotence, the virtues of heaven were imaged in his boſom. Spirit of Pope! immortal bard! forgive this appropriating paraphraſe of thy rich and beautiful verſification; a deſcription of the philanthropiſt muſt invariably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve thy well ſelected ideas; and it ſuits with thy mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence to beſtow, from thy abundance, a portion of that thou canſt ſo well ſpare.</p>
                     <p>Benevolence—philanthropy—The name and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Mr. Joſeph Ruſſell has been conſidered as ſynoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous with theſe virtues. Should I attempt to particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize his deeds of worth, innumerable inſtances would crowd around. Thronging fellow-citizens, aided by counſel and by pecuniary gratuities—bankrupts reinſtated—the little tenement and houſehold goods of the widow redeemed from the mercileſs graſp of the unfeeling creditor—helpleſs orphans accommodated with pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal friends—public meaſures, tending to the general good, powerfully ſupported—ſtrangers hoſpitably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and taught to hail a ſecond home.</p>
                     <p>What were the feelings of the amiable, the youthful La Fayette! How ſwelled the boſom, and how beat the pulſe of his worthy preceptor, when, in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble guiſe of perſecuted foreigners, their wandering footſteps firſt preſſed the threſhold of the benevolent Ruſſell! firſt met, in that celebrated abode of genial hoſpitality, a reception ſo amply ſuited to their exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and their merits.</p>
                     <p>But vain in my recital. A virtue ſo uncommon, and marked by ſuch a multitude of inſtances, dazzles by its refulgence; and, although many of his philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropic exertions, which ſhould have been recorded by the living fingers of immortal fame, enveloped by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, and clouded by a train of ſucceeding cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, are nearly eraſed from the tablets of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity;
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:034162_0648_0FFA65C0173383A0"/>
yet they are regiſtered in the archives of heaven; from their imagined obſcurity they ſhall again emerge; and, in the day of retribution, they ſhall blaze forth with additional ſplendor.</p>
                     <p>But hark! what plaintive ſounds are thoſe which vibrate on the ear? The voice of the penſive Elmira, borne on the ſtream of imagination, ſtrikes ſuddenly on my memory; it breathes the ſweet accents of grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude. Let us liſten to its pathetic ſtrains.</p>
                     <p>"Forbear, my friend," ſhe exclaims, "Oh! forbear—cloſe not the page of panegyric, until I pour thereon my tributary ſorrow—until I recite a ſimple tale, and give a liſt of benefits, which demand of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the boldeſt note that ever yet hath iſſued from lively gratitude. My days of proſperity were paſſed at a diſtance from the philanthropiſt; I had heard of him by the hearing of the ear, but my eyes had never ſeen him. My morn of life was happy; cheriſhed in the boſom of parental tenderneſs, and bleſt with every requiſite which my ſituation demanded, no rational wiſh remained ungratified. My wedded days ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and my power of contributing to the felicity of my connexions, was rendered more various and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I dreamed not of portending evils, eſtabliſhed, as I conceived, in life; I looked not for the burſting ſtorm. Suddenly, however, it aroſe, and it deluged all thoſe fair proſpects which had bleſt my youth; ſurrounded by the waves of adverſity, I was nearly overwhelmed by its billows. Writs of attachment; irritated creditors, and ſheriffs' officers ſurrounded thoſe doors that were barricaded with a frightful kind of vigilance. Abridged of liberty, that gem of incalcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable value, whoſe cheering influence gilds by its own genial rays, even the cottage of freedom, I ſteeped the hours in tears; and, at the ſhrine of comfortleſs calamity, both my health and my reaſon were alike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molated. My name was unknown to the philanthropiſt, but my ſufferings became its paſſport; and, unſolicited, the benevolent Ruſſell had the goodneſs to plead my cauſe: Perſuaſion dwelt on his tongue; there was a
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:034162_0649_0FFA65D15247DEE0"/>
kind of magic in his virtues which generally operated ſucceſsfully. What mortal could achieve, he did; and, to mitigate thoſe ills he could not cure, he bent his utmoſt efforts. Change of air, exerciſe, a long journey—theſe were propoſed by medical gentlemen for the reſtoration of my proſtrated health and ſpirits. I commenced my melancholy excurſion; my unknown friend met me on my way: It was in the beautiful village of D—, that I firſt ſaw the philanthropiſt; he eſſayed to chaſe ſorrow from my mind, and to rekindle in my boſom the pleaſures of anticipation. His kind interference followed me to the end of this tour of neceſſity; and he mingled with the deareſt of my friends to gratulate my return. Nor did his beneficent efforts ceaſe here; he was indefatigably perſevering in my favour, taking in my fate the deepeſt intereſt, aiding me with genuine delicacy, triumphing in every propitious event, and warding, as far as he might, every adverſe cloud. His acts of goodneſs to me, were the coevals of his being, and the laſt day of his abode in mortality witneſſed his benevolent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
                     <p>"Cruel was the ſtroke of death; it proſtrated the hopes of the deſolate; it precipitated from the ſummit of felicity to depths of ſorrow the female whom he judged worthy of his confidence; it blaſted the filial expectations of that incomparable young man, who, it is ſaid, inherits with his father's name his uncommon virtues; and it clad in mourning the PUBLIC MIND. Benevolent Man! Matchleſs Citizen! and now, indeed, <hi>Divine Philanthropiſt!</hi> Let the tears that marked thy exit, proclaim thy value. But <hi>reflection</hi> arreſts the tide of ſorrow; it impoſes ſilence on my lips, and I bow obedient to the beheſts of THE ALMIGHTY."</p>
                     <p>Poor Elmira!—yet we believe her gratitude hath not too far emblazoned; and we therefore conſtitute her ſketch a true ſpecimen of the benevolent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly uſeful life of the late uniformly philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropic and <hi>virtue honoured</hi> JOSEPH RUSSELL.</p>

adapted the ſacred text; and a paraphraſe thereon might be entitled, an admeaſurement of the virtues and the uſefulneſs of this univerſal benefactor.</p>
                     <p>"<hi>When the ear heard me, then it bleſſed me.</hi>" Forlorn and diſconſolate, the children of adverſity were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed about by ſorrow; they looked, and there was no one to help, when ſuddenly the renovating voice of commiſeration vibrated gratefully on the ear. Cheer up, ye ſons and daughters of ſorrow, behold the almoner of your God! Our common Father hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted me with a portion of his property, that I may diſtribute to the neceſſities of the deſtitute: Come, therefore, my friends, and permit me to beſtow that, to which your claims are indubitable. "<hi>When the ear heard me, then it bleſſed me;</hi>" nor is this ſtrange, ſince ſo few people know how to approach the children of penury, with that conſideration which their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances demand; no wonder that the voice of him who was exerciſed in acts of benevolence, ſhould extort ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, even from the perception of frigidity.</p>
                     <p>"<hi>When the eye ſaw me, it gave witneſs to me.</hi>" Yea, verily, from the contemplation of benignity, we derive ſenſations truly pleaſurable; we trace, with a kind of conſcious pride, thoſe actions which confer a dignity on humanity; and, if ſickening envy is compoſed by the powerful opiates of ſelf-intereſt, we give full ſcope to our admiration; our eyes are ſuffuſed by the tear of rapture; they delight to mark the philanthropiſt, and they follow, with ineffable complacency, ſo illuſtrious an ornament to humanity. "<hi>When the eye ſaw me, it gave witneſs to me</hi>"—the reaſon is obvious—"<hi>Becauſe I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherleſs, and him that had none to help him.</hi>" Excellent motives of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency! indiſputable teſtimonies of tranſcendent merit! he bent an ear to the lamentations of poverty—he preſented the means of living, and thus cut aſunder the bands of affliction—he protected the fatherleſs—he hailed, with the gentle ſoothings of paternal conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the bereaved orphan—he became the guide of his youth—he conſtituted the fund from which he
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:034162_0652_0FFA65E37496AD50"/>
drew an ample ſupport—in one word, he was the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of his life.</p>
                     <p>"<hi>The bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon me.</hi>" Do we not ſee the deſolate ſtranger?—he has not where to lay his head—he is an exile from the place of his nativity—his natural connexions are no more—his ſpirit is broken by infirmities—the ſorrows of his heart have invaded the ſeat of life—his brow is furrowed by thoſe cares, which, alas! have proved ineffectual—his pallid cheeks are hollowed by the excavating hand of agonizing woe—his frame is emaciated—he trembles on the brink of the grave—"<hi>he is ready to periſh.</hi>" But Ruſſell was the friend of the friendleſs—"<hi>of him that had none to help him.</hi>" Hark! do we not hear the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edictions of gratitude?—they are wafted upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed gale of fame—"<hi>he who was ready to periſh</hi>" now ſwells high the notes of praiſe—exiſtence aſſumes to him another aſpect—hope is reſtored to his boſom—motives for attachment to life are ſuddenly multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto him—his wants are liberally ſupplied—and, upon the head of his munificent benefactor, his tongue invoketh bleſſings.</p>
                     <p>"<hi>And I cauſed the widow's heart to ſing for joy!</hi>" Poor, deſolate mourner! at the period which inhumed in the gloomy manſions of the grave, him in whom her ſoul delighted, her widowed ſpirit calculated on an unbrok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſucceſſion of melancholy days; but the heart of the good man ſtill beat compaſſionately. In the boſom of Ruſſell dwelt the virtues of commiſeration—pleaſant is the voice of amity, its honied accents ſounded grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful on her ear, and her heart once more "<hi>ſings for joy.</hi>" Yes, undoubtedly, the path of Ruſſell was the path of rectitude; it was pointed by righteouſneſs, and wiſdom influenced his election; for admirable is the judgment of that philanthropiſt, who becomes "<hi>eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, and a father to the poor;</hi>" who inveſtigat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the cauſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="307" facs="unknown:034162_0653_0FFA65EBBAD7D7C0"/>
they are productive of general benefit, and they are entitled to univerſal applauſe.</p>
                     <p>That Mr. Ruſſell richly merited the eulogy of virtue, the unaffected ſorrow with which all ranks of people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded his exit, fully evinceth. To repeat, that he well diſcharged the filial duties, and was the principal prop of a venerable parent, who ſtill lives to mourn his depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure; to celebrate his attachment to the orphan children of a deceaſed brother; to dwell on his delicate and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful affection to the amiable females who ſucceſſively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the partners of his heart; to deſcant on his pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal goodneſs to thoſe of whoſe exiſtence he was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; or, to expatiate on his beneficent regards to the individuals who compoſed his houſehold, would be but a ſuperfluous attempt to diſtinguiſh and dignify propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, which are the reſidents of almoſt every boſom; and, had Mr. Ruſſell poſſeſſed only theſe common at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments of humanity, which are but a <hi>refined modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> he would have merited no tributary lay, and his panegyriſts would have incurred the charge of adulation. But to the <hi>friend of the friendleſs,</hi> to the univerſal benefactor, the bard of integrity ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly raiſeth the ſong; and, although the ear of death is heavy, that it cannot hear, yet we pleaſingly believe, that the immortal ſpirit ſleepeth not; nor is it irrational to ſuppoſe, that it ſometimes bends from its etherial elevation, liſtening with complacency to the effuſions of gratitude, to the expreſſed commendations of thoſe virtuous children of men, whoſe approbation it once delighted to merit.</p>
                     <p>To communicate benefits is truly godlike; and, in proportion as we are made inſtrumental in diſſeminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting happineſs to our fellow-creatures, exactly in ſuch proportion we imitate Him who went about doing good. The exerciſe of munificence is invariably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded with a glow of ſatisfaction; and perhaps this veſtige of an illuſtrious and divine original, is never totally obliterated from the heaven-born mind. That Mr. Ruſſell was eminently conſpicuous for the <hi>number</hi> and <hi>value</hi> of his beneficent acts, the concurrent teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:034162_0654_0FFA65F6EF4CC7A8"/>
of thoſe who beſt knew him unanimouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim. Seldom have we known a character who hath ſo fully united the ſuffrages of all ranks in this partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular; and it is, we conceive, on this ground, that the ſplendor and eclat of his life is chiefly reſted.</p>
                     <p>His integrity and punctuality as a merchant; his extenſive commercial knowledge, with the vaſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which accrued from his mercantile career, were but the appendages of ſound policy, ingenuity, habit and application. The eaſy manners, the gracefully elevated deportment, the freedom of acceſs, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine politeneſs, attributed to Mr. Ruſſell, but deſignate the gentleman. Early introduced to, and making a reſpectable part of, the moſt genteel circles, it would have been rather ſurpriſing, if his deportment had not been that of a man thoroughly well bred. His wealth, and conſequent importance, might poſſibly place him at the head of thoſe ſocieties, over which he preſided with honour to himſelf, and advantage to them; and his opulence may be ſuppoſed to have been his paſſport to many other honorary diſtinctions. But it has been preſumed, that affectionate ſympathy and unreſerved ſincerity are not <hi>generally</hi> the <hi>neceſſary reſult of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with what is called high life;</hi> and for theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive virtues, we are inclined to give the deceaſed philanthropiſt full credit; they were unqueſtionably inherent in his boſom; and hence iſſued thoſe fertiliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtreams, which made glad the ſons and daughters of ſorrow; hence originated that cheerful and equal diſpoſition of mind, and that frankneſs of temper, which baniſhed ſuſpicion, and authorized the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocal confidence; and, to the ſame ſource we may likewiſe trace his unbounded hoſpitality, and that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and grateful welcome, with which he ever greeted the footſteps of the ſtranger.</p>
                     <p>Religion diffuſed over the excellent qualities of his heart her meliorating influence; he reverenced her laws, and bent in humble acquieſcence and filial obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to her dictates. Her miniſters poſſeſſed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful and diſtinguiſhing regards; he conſtantly lent
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:034162_0655_0FFA65F9F7E2FDD8"/>
them his countenance; he was particularly fond of patronizing men of merit in this line; and the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome benefaction which he beſtowed on the fund ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the relief of thoſe among their widows, whoſe circumſtances are embarraſſed, is evincive of his attachment to, and conſideration for, this venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble body. Here again we are brought round to a contemplation of that liberality, on which we have choſen principally to rear the ſuperſtructure of his fame. It is ſaid that Mr. Ruſſell annually appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated <hi>twelve thouſand dollars</hi> to private charities! What an ample relief muſt this ſum, diſtributed by the hand of economy, have afforded to thoſe indigent ſufferers, who were the penſioners of his bounty! How do the virtues which give birth to ſuch liberal arrangements command eſteem! how do they endear the man, and exalt the citizen! And who but muſt painfully regret the exit of a perſonage, by whoſe departure ſuch rich and copious ſtreams are, alas! ſuddenly dried up? Who but muſt ſupplicate the Fountain of munificence, that they may again ſpring forth in the lives of his deſcendants? who, if they purſue the path marked out for them by their illuſtrious anceſtors, will unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably inſure to themſelves the higheſt poſſible honours, the eſteem, confidence and approbation of their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the peace of their own boſoms, and the plaudit of their Creator.</p>
                     <p>But the munificence of Mr. Ruſſell was not <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively</hi> ſhared by thoſe claimants, to whom his judgment apportioned occaſional gratuities; nor was it wholly confined to the citizens of Columbia. Mankind in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, according to their neceſſities, ſeemed to be the object of his beneficence, while his diffuſive and equal regards extended their genial influence to the far diſtant ſhore. Inſtances of his generoſity are, queſtionleſs, echoed in many a clime; but a recent example, ſtrikingly in point, may ſerve as a cloſe to this ſketch.</p>
                     <p>A reſpectable houſe in a celebrated European em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porium, (the capital of which was ſuppoſed immenſe) celebrated for punctuality and probity, ſuddenly ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:034162_0656_0FFA65FCDC368CA8"/>
payment, and aſtoniſhment pervaded every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of our merchants. This misfortune was not attributed to ill conduct, but rather to a ſucceſſion of adverſe accidents; and an arrangement was ſpeedily produced, which enabled one of the firm to viſit Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, for the purpoſe of collecting outſtanding debts. This gentleman arrived in the town of Boſton, the metropolis of Maſſachuſetts, (which place Mr. Ruſſell then dignified by his preſence) under the preſſure of very unpleaſant circumſtances. Both the houſe and heart of the generouſly hoſpitable Ruſſell were open for his reception. A travelling prince could ſcarcely have been received with higher marks of reſpectful atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he found in the boſom of this worthy fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, during his abode there, an elegantly pleaſing aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum. But this was not enough—the kindneſs of the American merchant ſtopped not here. From the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod which announced the failure of the European houſe, no commercial negociation had been entruſted to its firm. Under ſuch a cloud the wary trader ſtood aloof; but the boſom of Mr. Ruſſell poſſeſſed a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetic chord, which, as ſurely as his eye glanced on the children of adverſity, uniformly vibrated to pity; he regarded the claims of misfortune as ſacred; and he conceived, that the ſuffering individual impoſed on him duties which were indiſpenſable. Through the <hi>powerful aid</hi> and <hi>extenſive influence</hi> of Mr. Ruſſell, two ſhips, richly laden with Weſt-India productions, and calculated, with their cargoes, to amount to not leſs than <hi>forty thouſand pounds,</hi> were conſigned to the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate houſe! The emoluments ariſing from the ſale of theſe valuable appropriations, let the arithmetician compute. What an advantageous re-commencement of buſineſs was thus furniſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what a benign luſtre is thereby thrown over the American name! But a further act of beneficence remains to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted.</p>
                     <p>On the departure of the European, Mr. Ruſſell, with that delicacy which is the appendage of munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent actions, preſented him with bills, for his ſeparate
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:034162_0657_0FFA6601071F5958"/>
and ſole uſe, to the amount of <hi>five hundred pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi> incloſing, alſo, like ſums for ſimilar purpoſes, to the unfortunate gentlemen with whom he ſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected!!! To throw the veil of ſilence over virtues thus ſplendid, would, we conceive, betray a phlegmatic or an envious mind; and the advantages reſulting from eulogizing the meritorious dead, are too obvious to need enumeration.</p>
                     <p>The panegyriſt of the everlaſtingly abſent, if he lev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies no tax on ſurvivors, cannot be accuſed of intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed motives; he has but expreſſed his admiration of what he has conceived <hi>abſtractedly good;</hi> he does not do homage to the creature, for he regards every vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as emanating from Deity; and he is morally and religiouſly certain, that he riſks nothing by proſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the image of his Creator, wherever it may conſiſt with the arrangements of Omnipotence to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it.</p>

                     <p>THE experience of every day evinces that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity is ſubject to error; thoſe calculations that we fancy we have made with the greateſt accuracy, frequently, by proving the reverſe of truth, betray our total ignorance both of cauſes and effects. I have
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:034162_0658_0FFA6605487BE3E8"/>
ſometimes feaſted, by anticipation, for many days, on the refined and genuine pleaſures which I confidently believed would reſult from the collection of a ſelect party of ſentimentaliſts, who were, by appointment, to devote a few hours to the ſocial enjoyments of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. My heart has beat high with expectation, and I have haſted with avidity to the place of rendezvous; but, in vain have I watched for the moment of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in vain ſighed for the richly enrobed thought, which I might bear as a trophy from a ſcene where I had calculated to partake the feaſt of reaſon; for, ſtrange to tell, the gems of intellect were muffled in the thickeſt clouds—not a ray was elanced—and the company have ſeparated without a ſingle obſervation which could merit an inſcription upon the tablets of memory!</p>
                     <p>But, if I have been neceſſitated to confeſs that expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, originating in reaſon, have proved fallacious, my mortification has been amply balanced by oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities from which I have reaped a large ſupply of intellectual enjoyments, where I have looked for taſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſilence, or noiſy mirth.</p>
                     <p>Conſiderations of intereſt, the duties of good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, or motives of general civility, have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently introduced me to parties, that, but for the obligations thus impoſed, I ſhould have avoided. Yet, in theſe reſorts, a rich repaſt has awaited me! Nature, unadulterated, and replete with ſterling worth, has ſtood confeſſed; ſilence, impreſſed by reſpectful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, has hung on the lips of the hearers, and thus endowed with energy even the <hi>timid ſpeaker.</hi> Inquiry has produced inquiry; a ſubject of converſation has obtained the general ear; individuals have alternately expreſſed their ſentiments; rational concluſions have been deduced; and I have returned home, informed, complacent and happy.</p>
                     <p>"<hi>We are to have a pantomimical exhibition at the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre—will you go, Mr. Vigillius?</hi>" ſaid an inquirer; No, Sir—I deteſt pantomimes. Speech was beſtowed on man as a diſtinguiſhing mark of ſuperiority; and
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:034162_0659_0FFA68CAE97AFCF0"/>
it is, methinks, a ſtrange depravity of taſte, which, reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this dignifying advantage, confineth the performer to dumb ſhew: Beſides, I have an inſuperable averſion to the degradation of the "<hi>human form divine." Man was made in the image of his Maker,</hi> and I regard the debaſement of this image, as abſolute profanity. The antic geſtures which the pantomimical performer fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently aſſumes, in my opinion, do violence to every idea of propriety; and I pity the mind which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently vitiated to draw amuſement from ſuch fantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſources.</p>
                     <p>"<hi>I will not diſpute the correctneſs of your taſte, Mr. Gleaner,</hi>" returned the gentleman, "<hi>but the pantomime is to be preceded by Shakeſpear's Tempeſt, or Enchanted Iſland.</hi>" What lover of the drama but feels his boſom glow at the mention of this immortal bard? I had read the Tempeſt, but I had never ſeen it on the ſtage; and a friend, whoſe judgment no votary of ſcience hath ever yet impeached, had informed me its <hi>ſtage effect</hi> was wonderful.</p>
                     <p>Yes, I will go by all means; and, elated by the moſt ſanguine expectations, in a front box I obtained a front ſeat.

But, from this moment, I experienced little elſe but diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and diſguſt. Some of the fineſt ſentiments were ſo mangled and mutilated, that it became impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to re-unite them, or to endow them with that divine energy, thus extinguiſhed by their diſſolution, which was breathed into them by the creative bard, when they firſt received the vital principle. Whole ſpeeches were ſo mouthed and miſrepreſented, that we ſmiled were we ſhould have wept; and were fretting with vexation, when the genuine wit of the inimitable author ſhould have excited the moſt mirthful approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! Yet the part of Proſpero was well ſupported; he
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:034162_0660_0FFC518A035122E8"/>
ſeemed apprized of the gravity of his character, and he ſeldom forgot his dignity. Ariel, alſo, the ſpirit Ariel, her ſylph like movements would indeed have become an inhabitant of the blue expanſe; ſhe was exactly what we could have wiſhed her, as near celeſtial as the habiliments of mortality would permit; not a ſoul but bleſt the winged viſion, and not a hand but was raiſed to approbate her emancipating aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Her "<hi>follow, follow, follow,</hi>" ſtill vibrates melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly on my ear; indeed, even the moſt phlegmatic muſt confeſs that Miſs Harding is a very lovely and a very promiſing child. With reſpect to the other performers, they generally overtopped or undervalued their parts; and, although Dorinda and Miranda were very engaging women, yet they ſeemed to have little idea of that artleſs ſimplicity with which the education they were ſuppoſed to receive, ſhould have inveſted them; and I ſuſpect it will be ſome time before they will be qualified for an aſſumption of Shakeſpear's capital characters.</p>
                     <p>The play over, I was hurrying away, with the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reflection that I had loſt an evening; but in the moment of my intended departure, I was arreſted by the obſervation, that a <hi>ſerious pantomime</hi> was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. <hi>A ſerious pantomime!</hi> repeated I. I will ſtay then, and ſee of what ſtuff a <hi>ſerious pantomime</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. La Forete Noire, or the Picture Diſcovered—this was the title of the piece; and, to my great aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, it poſſeſſed every feature of a well conceived and regular comedy. The plot was evident and ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly worked up; it had its <hi>Protaſis,</hi> its <hi>Epitaſis,</hi> and its <hi>Cataſtaſis;</hi> and theſe introduced a moſt happy <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe.</hi> Whether the <hi>unities</hi> are ſtrictly preſerved, I cannot exactly determine; but if they are not, while Shakeſpear abounds with precedents of the utmoſt latitude in this reſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an inferior author will hardly become inconſolable for ſuch defects.

to devour the contents; and while ſhe traced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traced the lines, we read, in her agitated countenance, the ſtrongeſt emotions; Suddenly ſhe aroſe, and now, with quick and perturbed ſteps, anon ſolemn and ſlow, ſhe traverſed the ſtage, evidently ſtruggling to obtain that ſelf-command, which may put her in poſſeſſion of ſome degree of calmneſs—her efforts prove ineffectual, and ſhe haſtens to the wainſcot, where, touching a ſecret ſpring, the pannel flies back, and exhibits a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait, to which ſhe addreſſes the moſt impaſſioned aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Every one readily concluded that the picture was the reſemblance of a perſon whoſe image was unqueſtionably engraven on her heart, and whoſe letters ſhe had been ſo fervidly peruſing. On the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of footſteps ſhe retouched the ſpring, and the friendly pannel again concealed the object to whom ſhe had been breathing her tributary ſighs. A figure, on whoſe brow the dignity of manhood ſat enthroned, next approached; ſhe haſtened to meet him; and we heſitated not to pronounce him the original of the portrait, the writer of the letters, and the man of her affections. A tender interview having ſucceeded, the almoſt diſtracted fair one warned him of approaching danger; and, ſo irreſiſtible, ſo heart affecting were her pleadings, that, yielding to her energetically enforced wiſhes, and tearing himſelf from her embraces, he reluctantly made his eſcape from the open caſement to which ſhe had conducted him. Our heroine then approached an apartment, and a particular ſignal produced from thence a beautiful boy, whom ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with ſuch animated tranſport, as induced us to pronounce, without heſitation, that ſhe preſſed him to a maternal boſom: After ſhe had evinced, by a variety of animated geſtures the inherent claim he poſſeſſed to her protection, ſhe led him, all agitated and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, to her toilette, and, putting into his hands a letter, the peruſal of which produces in the child the unequivocal expreſſions of ſurpriſe, affection and filial duty, ſhe has once more recourſe to her treaſure behind the wainſcot; ſhe points it out to the little
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:034162_0662_0FFC51829D85DC80"/>
cherub, who, in a tranſport of duteous attachment, aſſays to graſp the reſpected figure, leaps on his feet, throws abroad his hands, claſps them in a petitioning attitude, as if ſoliciting a father's benediction; and, in ſhort, demonſtrates, beyond the power of language, every emotion which could be ſuppoſed to triumph in the affectionate boſom of innocence, on an unexpected diſcovery of the author of its being. Juſt at this junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a loud noiſe interrupted the ſweet and amiable effuſions of young attachment; the boy was hurried to his place of concealment, the picture veiled, and the lady prepared to meet the approaching ſtorm; nor was ſhe long held in ſuſpenſe. Her father entered, and, ignorant of the marriage ſhe had clandeſtinely procured, he was accompanied by a perſon, whom from his dreſs we conclude to be an eccleſiaſtic, whom he commands her to receive as her future huſband. The authority of this father was marked by auſtere ſeverity; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined with unrelenting ſternneſs, and it was evident that he would admit of no appeal. The lady entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but her ſupplications were ineffectual; her tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic father continued obdurate. It appears he is one of thoſe grey beards, againſt whom Octavian, in the Mountaineers, is ſo juſtly exaſperated; and of courſe he is peremptory and deſpotic, and his weeping daughter is left to receive the man in black as her intended lord and maſter. He, good ſoul, appears to poſſeſs a comfortable ſhare of <hi>ſang-froid,</hi> and a moſt ludicrous ſcene enſues, to which the lady puts an end by making her eſcape; when her would be lover ſneaks off in a manner which may be termed mock heroic.</p>
                     <p>The ſecreted child then preſents himſelf, who, peeping from his confinement, and finding no one to croſs his path, is compelled, by a very natural curioſity, to retrace the lines which had given him ſuch ſurprizing information; he ſeizes the work-bag, and, ſkipping with it to the front of the ſtage, places himſelf in a convenient attitude for examination; one letter is taken out, and another, and another,
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:034162_0663_0FFA65B9418BCC38"/>
which, not proving the paper he wiſhed, are careleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toſſed about, until, with childiſh impetuoſity, he graſps the whole parcel, and after throwing them promiſcuouſly over the floor, relinquiſhing the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, he haſtes to catch one more glance at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved portrait, by which he had been ſo much cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated. With ſkilful hand he touches the ready ſpring, the obedient pannel yields to his preſſure, and he again exhibits thoſe teſtimonies of a duteous heart which are ſo becoming, and in him ſo hazardous. But as the tremendous thunder and the lightning's glare, to him who had promiſed himſelf a ſerene ſky, or as the roar of the hungry lion, to the traveller who dreamed of ſecurity, thus fearfully portentous ſounded the tread of authority in the ear of the poor affrighted victim, who, all trembling and appalled, flew to his place of ſhelter, regardleſs of the letters that ſtrewed the floor, and utterly forgetting to veil the treaſured portrait. The old gentleman entered, and, ſtarting with aſtoniſhment at the lettered floor, he happened to ſtumble upon the explanatory paper which the boy had overlooked; he reads, and a hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane of the paſſions ſucceeds; all is revealed; the clandeſtine marriage, the child, his ſecret reſidence, the pannel—he raiſes his eyes, and the uncovered picture vouches the authenticity of every ſyllable! He traverſes the ſtage, ſtamps, diſtorts his figure, and acts a part proper for the madman, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and unrelenting cruelty had rendered him. With demonſtrations of ungovernable rage, he makes his way to the ſanctuary of innocence; and, rudely ſeizing the little ſufferer, he ſeems about to ſacrifice him to his vengeance; but the uproar producing the entrance of two ill-looking fellows, the beauteous boy, with expreſſions of ſavage barbarity, is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them! In vain the little unfortunate kneels and ſupplicates; his pleadings avail him not; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of his mother, while it heightens the agony of the ſcene, procures no relenting in the breaſt of the grandfather! She weeps, proſtrates and implores;
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:034162_0664_0FFC5180CBA00F18"/>
but had ſhe aſſailed the rude winds, or the impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrable rock, her interceſſions had been as effectual; driven to deſperation, ſhe ſeizes the lovely child, and once more preſſes him to her maternal boſom; by command of her ſavage parent, he is torn from her embraces, and forcibly hurried away by the ruffians to whom he is committed! while the diſtreſſed lady, fainting in the arms of her attendant, is borne off, and the ſcene is thus terminated.</p>
                     <p>We were next introduced to a dreary foreſt, where we met the little exile, for whom we were ſo deeply intereſted, with the two ruffians, who ſeem on the point of imbruing their hands in innocent blood!! By the moſt heart-affecting geſtures, the little mourner diſcovers the agony of his ſoul; but mercy is denied him, and he trembles on the verge of eternity, when he is ſuddenly reſcued by the captain of a banditti, who, putting thoſe <hi>authorized</hi> aſſaſſins to flight, takes the boy under his protection. The robber's deſign to guard the child was unequivocally expreſſed, by his wrapping him in his enormous cloak; and when the ſucceeding ſcene preſents the aſſembled banditti, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing their various booty, we are prepared to admire their chief, who uncovers the reſcued innocent as the fruits of his expedition. The diſguſt expreſſed by the nefarious fraternity, is the conſequent reſult of their depravity; and we cannot but tremble for the little wanderer, although apprized that his protector is at hand, when we find him on the point of being ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to the turpitude of their feelings. His ſecond reſcue by the commander of theſe atrocious offenders—his ſubſequent pleadings for him whoſe hand was raiſed to take his life—the appeal of the chief to his ſubordinates—his ſtriking compariſon between the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited clemency of that infant, and their unmanly and groundleſs malice—with the extorted applauſe and reconciliation which enſued, were finely imagined, and a moſt wonderful piece of acting.</p>
                     <p>On the diſperſion of the robbers, we are called to witneſs a ſtruggle in the boſom of the little hero, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:034162_0665_0FFC517E916D49D8"/>
his gratitude to his preſerver and his filial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. He wore on his breaſt the miniature of his mother; this picture captivated the robber, and he endeavoured to prevail on the boy to relinquiſh it. Agitated to an extreme, he entreats permiſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it—any thing elſe he would part with—but that picture, claſping it to his heart, that picture muſt ſtill remain with him. The robber offers him in exchange an elegant watch—this charms him—he ſeizes it with avidity, views it over and over, admires it much, claps it to his ear—and then, catching the picture, preſſes it to his lips, and, with a ſmile of ſelf-complacency, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers up the watch. The robber, (I can hardly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on myſelf ſo frequently to beſtow on him this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable epithet) charmed by the ſtrength of his filial affection, and admiring ſo much firmneſs in a mind ſo young, made him a preſent of the watch, and led him off in triumph.</p>
                     <p>The eventful foreſt then preſents the lady herſelf, ſurrounded by the banditti. Either a voluntary exile from her father's houſe, or driven thence by his ſavage cruelty, ſhe had wandered forth, and, ere ſhe was aware, her trembling ſteps had led her to thoſe haunts of horror!! All the energies of commiſeration are now rouſed to action. A female—in a thick foreſt—ſurrounded by the moſt hardened wretches—no eye to pity, and no hand to protect. The abandoned villains evidently meditate the worſt of purpoſes—rudely they graſp her hands—they ſeem to confer on a diviſion of their prize—and, like ſavage beaſts of prey, they exult over their agonized victim. The diſtreſs of the lady is beyond deſcription—her fine treſſes hang in diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ringlets on her well-formed ſhoulders—anguiſh riots in her pallid countenance—and ſuccour, alas! is placed beyond all rational hope. At this moment, the captain of the banditti, accompanied by his little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, makes his appearance—a tranſient gleam of joy illumes the grief-worn countenance of the lady—ſhe ſnatches her child to her boſom—but alas! the chief, more enchanted by the original than the picture,
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:034162_0666_0FFC5178C9486378"/>
immediately prefers his ferocious ſuit—he is rejected with ſpontaneous marks of deteſtation—a pointed po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard ſeems to be the alternative, to which, preſenting her defenceleſs boſom, ſhe ſmiles beneath the expected ſtroke. The mode of attack was then changed; and, while her beloved child is held by two of the moſt hardened of the banditti, a ſword is pointed at his breaſt, which, it appears, her continued refuſal will pierce with the ſtroke of death! Is it poſſible to imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine a ſituation more ſhockingly intereſting? Her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were wrought up to a degree of frenzy—deſpair nerved her efforts—and, with more than mortal cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, ſhe flew, and, ſnatching the boy, fled with him from her purſuers! Again, however, ſhe was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; but in the ſtruggle, the general attention being arreſted by the lady, the boy eſcaped, and ſhe is borne off by the banditti.</p>
                     <p>But the pantomime draws towards a cloſe, and hope begins to dawn. We are preſented with the hero of the piece; his figure is commanding, and his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance unites the traits of thoſe virtues, which go to the conformation of the gentleman and the ſoldier. His company is drawn up on the ſtage, and he is in the act of performing the manual exerciſe, when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly a little cherub, agitated and trembling, ruſhes forward, and, kneeling at the feet of the military com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, ſupplicates his extricating hand; and, to make certain the aſſiſtance which he ſolicited, he preſents the picture of his mother, then a ſuffering captive in the hands of the moſt abandoned of the human race. The picture was inſtantly recognized; and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, paternal affection, joy, grief, love, deteſtation, pity, indignation, tender apprehenſion, and determined bravery, in one pathetically intereſting and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contraſt, were ſtrikingly grouped. But no time was to be loſt. Inſtantly, in a manner expreſſive of the hurricane in his breaſt, catching his ſon in his arms, and followed by his ſoldiers, he purſued his way to that receſs of atrocious villany, to which his little guide directed. The conſequences were preciſely
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:034162_0667_0FFC51760D4B07C8"/>
what might have been expected; the robbers were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in thoſe haunts which they had believed ſecure; a ſkirmiſh enſued; fire-arms were employed; ſucceſs declared on the ſide of rectitude; the banditti were completely defeated; and the victor, when in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of plunging his ſword into the boſom of their chief, finds his arm arreſted by his heroic boy, who forcibly repreſenting the obligations he was under to this generous delinquent, who had repeatedly reſcued him from the ſtroke of death, induced his father to raiſe him from the deſpairing attitude he had aſſumed, and to extend unto him the hand of forgiveneſs.</p>
                     <p>The parent of the lady now enters. Sorrow had meliorated his breaſt, and he ſeeks his daughter in that foreſt whither he ſuppoſes ſhe had wandered. Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports unutterable grew in his ſoul at this rencountre; reconciliation and pardon dwelt on every feature and in every expreſſive geſture; and the piece concludes with an act of general amneſty, which poſſeſſes the power of conferring happineſs upon every worthy individual.</p>
                     <p>I will not ſay that I have given an accurate ſketch of <hi>La Forete Noire.</hi> I ſaw it only once—ſome months have ſince elapſed, and my memory may have been treacherous; but, during its preſentation, I was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted, alarmed and ſoothed, and the fineſt feelings of my heart were in exerciſe. From Shakeſpear's Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt I expected much, but I had the mortification to witneſs its murder! Pantomimical mummery I abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—yet the pantomime proved a rich entertainment; and, felicitating myſelf on the various talents with which humanity is endowed, I was happy they could be thus called into action; and I rejoiced in that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating pliability which beſtowed the power of embodying the feelings, even without the aid of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>

                     <p>I COULD wiſh, methinks, that men of letters, and profeſſors of the fine arts, would, by mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, form themſelves into one great and illuſtrious commonwealth, appointing their ſeveral officers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees of correſpondence, and perſons duly qualified to examine the claims of every candidate, who became deſirous of a ſituation in their community; and I ſhould, moreover, be ſolicitous that the republic, when organized, ſhould be careful to impreſs on the minds of their delegates, the neceſſity of obſerving, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of thoſe pretenſions which might come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, the ſtricteſt <hi>impartiality.</hi>

                     <p>There are grades in the intellectual as well as the natural world; and he, who may fill one ſtation with reſpectability, may be utterly inadequate to the duties of another.

ambition, becomes an irreſiſtible ſtimulus. The claſſic periods of a Belknap are not the production of every pen, nor is the energy of a Ramſay the growth of every mind; yet, the ſtory of this new world, and the intereſting events of the revolution, may become the exerciſe of humbler talents; and, garbed in ſimple language, may, for a certain claſs of readers, poſſeſs peculiar charms. From the lyre of Philenia iſſues the moſt captivating ſtrains; correct, and highly poliſhed, her deathleſs page may ſtand without a rival; but, ſhall the <hi>lowly muſe,</hi> for this, reſign thoſe magic pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which give luſtre to the eye of grief, and ſweetly whiſper the ſoothing joys of mild tranquillity? Forbid it, every rich, ennobling motive, which ſwells to emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No—rather let the trembling candidate, mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Philenia as a ſtar of guidance, call into action eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glowing energy, each bleſt incitement, which may allure to eminence, and adventurouſly aſſay the radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant path, in which the lovely viſion, with beamy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, ſo ſplendidly ſucceeds.</p>

I would have every deſcription of intellect exactly in its proper place; I contend, only, that the ſmalleſt ſpark of genius, ſo far from being quenched by <hi>cold neglect,</hi> or extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>chilling blaſts of criticiſm,</hi> ſhould be furniſhed with thoſe incitements, which are calculated to blow it into a flame; and, was genuine fraternity the broad baſis of the commonwealth, which I have imagined—was every individual cloſely united in the bonds of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, a reciprocity of good offices would be ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly cultivated, a combination of efforts procured; and the archives of the correſponding ſecretary, being conſidered as the ſacred repoſitory of every ingenious plan, or literary attempt, the united abilities of the wide extenſive republic, thus concentrated, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a magazine of rich materials, from which the beautiful and auguſt temple of arts and ſciences would attain a degree of perfection hitherto unknown.</p>

It has been a general complaint, eſpecially among a particular claſs of men, that genius has never, except in the ſhort luminous intervals of one or two brilliant epochs, been advanced to that elevation, to which its rare qualities gave it an indiſputable claim; and yet, my memory, at this moment, furniſhes me with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that render this hypotheſis rather problematic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Pindar, we are told, continued, almoſt a complete century, one of the brighteſt luminaries in the literary hemiſphere. Warriors of the firſt deſcription, and ſtateſmen of the moſt elevated rank, contended for his regards. His ſacred poeſy was acknowledged by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry order of the people—it filled the temples of the gods; and his divine odes, ſongs, and paeans reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the Delphian aiſles. The miniſters of Apollo, erecting his ſtatue, placed it among the moſt conſpicuous ornaments of their temple; and the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thean voice audibly pronounced, that one half of thoſe early fruit offerings, with which the pious Religioniſt, on each returning year, failed not to gratify the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated attendants of the Delphian rites, ſhould be regularly appropriated to him! Thus was the poet, while enrobed in mortality, inveſted, by the voluntary arrangements of gratitude, with a participation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honours! and, when he aſcended to the celeſtial abodes, his remains were diſtinguiſhed by every dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onſtration of the high eſtimation in which he was held. His fellow-citizens decreed, as a teſtimonial of their veneration, the monumental pile; artiſts combined their moſt arduous efforts, and the beauty of the ceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph which aroſe in the hippodrome, and which was conſecrated to the memory of Pindar, continued to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort the admiration of every obſerver, during ſix re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving centuries. Nor was this all—his uncommon worth and ſingular abilities became the heritage of his deſcendants: In the days of Plutarch, the poſterity of the bard received a portion of the ſacred victim. The houſe which he had inhabited became a barrier to the vindictive progreſs of the enraged Spartans; and even the Macedonian chief did a kind of homage to this dwelling.</p>

It is true, the fate of Homer may be oppoſed to the ſplendid fortunes of Pindar; but every thing relative to that prince of Grecian poeſy ſeems to be envelop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the thick folds of obſcurity. I remember once to have read a life of Homer, wherein I was informed that he received the name <hi>Homer</hi> inſtead of <hi>Meleſigenes,</hi> by which he was originally deſignated, in conſequence of his <hi>blindneſs;</hi> and yet, the ſame writer afterwards aſſerts, not only that <hi>ſeven cities</hi> contended for the honour of his birth, but alſo, that there were <hi>ſeven dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Homers,</hi> who lived at diſtant periods of time, and whoſe abilities and fortunes were various. Query: <hi>Were theſe Homers all blind?</hi> Perhaps all that is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>inſpired author</hi> of the Iliad, is, that his <hi>mental powers were unrivalled;</hi> and that his fame, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting added luſtre from each revolving age, hath thus evinced its <hi>unqueſtionable right to immortality.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Apelles received for his picture of Alexander, graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thunder-bolt, the full ſum of four thouſand pounds. He ſtood high in the favour of his ſovereign, who ſeemed to conceive ſcarce any gratification too liberal for talents ſo conſpicuous; even the beautiful Campaſpe was not withheld, and Apelles continued, through life, to enjoy all thoſe honours which his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent abilities richly merited. But antiquity fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes many proofs of the reſpect which was, in the early ages, paid to <hi>mind,</hi> and the high eſtimation with which <hi>intellectual ſuperiority</hi> was regarded; nor am I willing, haſtily, to conclude that the moderns are wholly deficient in this particular.</p>
                     <p>The career of Addiſon was both honorary and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crative; and, from the fortunate moment which put a copy of his Latin verſes into the hands of Dr. Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter, he ſeems to be reaping all thoſe marks of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe which were due to his genius and his appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. That noble patron of letters, Sir John So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, the Macenas of the court in which he lived, obtained for Addiſon, from his ſovereign, a penſion of £. 300 per annum, to diſcharge his travelling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034162_0675_0FFC5496D7DB96F8"/>
ſubſequent to which we find him the attendant of prince Eugene. He was rewarded for the celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed poem which he entitled the Campaign by Godol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin—he accompanied lord Halifax to Andover—he was repeatedly ſecretary for the kingdom of Ireland—he was created one of the Lords Commiſſioners of trade—and laſtly, he obtained the poſt of Secretary of State.</p>
                     <p>The literary fame of Pope was equal to the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt expectations that ever bard, even in the moment of poetic frenzy, could have indulged; and his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary emoluments alſo inveſted him with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome property. The ſubſcriptions which he obtained for the tranſlation of the Iliad amounted to £. 6000; and he received beſide, from Linto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the bookſeller, no leſs than £.1200. After a patronage ſo liberal, he purchaſed his celebrated receſs at Twickenham, where he realized the luxury of filial tenderneſs, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timental retirement, the independence to which he was ardently attached, and that kind of friendſhip which is the rich growth of diſintereſted eſteem. Yet the literary annals of the Britiſh page recounts the ſtory of a writer, of no inconſiderable celebrity, who abſolutely yielded up his exiſtence for the want of that ſupport ſo neceſſary to its endurance. But poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in this inſtance, <hi>economy</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> might be wanting. Prudence is not always the appendage of genius; and the moſt liberal benefactions may prove inſufficient, if diſcretion is not conſulted in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation. Later times have given us an example in the perſon of the unfortunate Savage; the efforts of his friends, to place him in any degree of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, were rendered ineffectual by his irregular conduct. Occaſional largeſſes but furniſhed the means of renewed imprudencies; and the penſion he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Queen Caroline was annually ſquandered in a privacy, attended with circumſtances of ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, from a knowledge of which his ſenſe of propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety impelled him to exclude his moſt intimate friends. But his juſtly celebrated biographer realized all the ſweets of an eaſy competency, accompanied by the ſoothing reflection, that what he poſſeſſed was ſhe
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034162_0676_0FFC549340DEC740"/>
well earned reward of natural endowments, and of acquirements which perhaps have not frequently been ſurpaſſed.</p>
                     <p>But whether the general ſuffrage of mankind hath preponderated in favour of genius, I do not preſume to determine; my preſent object is only to eſtabliſh a perſuaſion of the neceſſity of a union of plans, and a combination of efforts, in order to the procurement of any deſirable end. It is with pain I have marked the operation of that rivalſhip among the children of ſcience, which too often terminates in a rooted averſion from each other. The acrimony and confirmed hatred of competitors, in any profeſſion, is as unjuſtifiable as it is injurious; and it is from a view of the alarming effects, too often conſequent on a ſimilarity of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that I have taken the liberty to ſuggeſt the neceſſity of ſome general arrangements, which may open a line of communication, promote fraternity, and eſtabliſh confidence and affection.</p>
                     <p>I am aware, that, agreeably to the deciſion of the Abbé Raynal, thoſe are attentions which ought to be regarded as wholly foreign from the contemplations of an American. According to that writer, the rays of genius never have, nor ever will, ſhed their genial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the benighted boſom of a native of this younger world; puniſhed even <hi>beyond</hi> the <hi>fourth gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration</hi> for the crimes of their anceſtors, they are doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>by the pen of this philoſopher,</hi> to experience an utter dereliction of all thoſe rare abilities, which could give them a title to enroll their names in the annals of fame! But tranſcendently excellent as was the Abbé Raynal, he was however cloathed in the habiliments of mortality; and while thus inveſted, we are not to ſtamp his ideas with the ſeal of infallibility. America has given birth to philoſophers, politicians, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors of the firſt deſcription; ſhe numbers alſo a long liſt of celebrated proficients in the polite arts—Weſt, Copeley, and Trumbull, natives of her ſoil, now take rank in the higheſt claſs of their profeſſion, on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bion, ſhore; and it is ſaid <hi>their admired productions are

referred to, as a proof of the flouriſhing ſtate of painting in the iſland of Great-Britain!</hi> We are fearful to give this article of information all the colouring of which it is ſuſceptible, leſt we ſhould be ſuſpected of a deſign to invigorate that cenſurable and acrimonious kind of rivalſhip, we have profeſſed a ſolicitude to ſuppreſs.</p>
                     <p>Apelles, when painters are <hi>the ſubject,</hi> will always be obſerved as a prominent figure; and the finiſhed touches of his pencil were marked by the winged en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys of fame. Yet did Apelles extend his regards to every competitor; he was conſcious of that ſuperiority with which nature had endowed him; and he ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly confeſſed that he ſuppoſed himſelf without rival or imitator, in the gracefulneſs of his figures and atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; but, with that grandeur of ſoul which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves a deteſtation of all unneceſſary prevarication, he acknowledged his inferiority in many other branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of his art. For the purpoſe of viewing and admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the performances of his cotemporary, Protogenes, he travelled to Rhodes. The <hi>firſt rate</hi> talents of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togenes would have blown up the paſſion of jealouſy in a mind leſs liberal; but, diſdaining to ſubmit to an impulſe ſo ignoble, he transfuſed into the breaſt of the artiſt the ſentiments of laudable ambition. He drew him from his ſolitude, enhanced the value of his pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and, pointing out to the Rhodians his elevated abilities, he extorted from them that applauſe, which, while they were laviſh of their commendations of a ſtranger, they had, until that period, denied to worth which was the growth of their own ſoil.</p>
                     <p>Addiſon and Pope appear to have been, in ſome ſort, under the influence of a ſpirit of literary acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: Envy, it is but too obvious, more than glanced on their minds; and the murky clouds of diſcord, dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, for a moment, the pure luſtre of two of the brighteſt luminaries in a conſtellation, which will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to irradiate the lateſt ages. Of their diſunion, poſterity will judge; partizans will enliſt upon either ſide; and it is left for the careful inveſtigator of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erary annals, to decide who was the aggreſſor, or with
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034162_0678_0FFC548B49001B90"/>
whom the continuance of rancour remained. But the enthuſiaſtic admirer of Addiſon, will bluſh, while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the accuſation lodged againſt the elegant moraliſt, whom he hath ever delighted to honour; he can ſcarcely believe him ſuſceptible of duplicity, or that he could poſſibly, while deſcanting on a meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous production,

                                       <p>Dear Sir, that very <hi>Medium</hi> you ſo juſtly admire, never appears more ſelf-balanced, than when it is the origin of that kind of conduct, which forms an equilibrium between inflexible ſeverity and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable indulgence.</p>

                                       <p>Right, good Weſton—perfectly right—you have ſpoken like an angel—<hi>a Medium</hi> is ever ſelf-balanced—it is the centre of perfection—the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's ſtone—the genuine <hi>panacea</hi> for every evil. It is that divine alchymy, the operation of which will finally tranſmute this iron age of ours, reſtoring the golden reign of philoſophy and of reaſon. I tell you, Weſton, I will abſolutely write a book, in the which I will prove, that nothing more is neceſſary to eſtabliſh general tranquillity, than the uniform obſervance of this ſame <hi>Medium.</hi>

When I have told her all theſe things, and much more, Sir, ſhe would turn away to wipe off the tears, and then, lifting up her white hands and beautiful blue eyes to heaven, Robert, ſays ſhe, your Maſter is a good young man, and a bleſſing will ſurely attend him.</p>

                                       <p>Why, now, Col.

My name is Ralph Maitland, Sir; and I am determined to act for myſelf—I have not yet got into my dotage, Sir.</p>

matter; it is not in my power to communicate felicity, for the young woman, being a rational young wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, is herſelf perfectly convinced, that her connexion with my ſon would, in the nature of things, be highly prepoſterous.</p>

                     <p>PERHAPS there is not, in the whole catalogue of maſculine virtues, a more deſirable attainment, than that <hi>ſyſtematic bravery,</hi> which is the reſult of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, deduced from a <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>philoſophical view of the propriety of thoſe arrangements, conſequent on the agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a preſcient and all-wiſe Firſt Cauſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The true hero enters the field of battle with intrepid valour—his innate ſerenity of mind is produced by a regular and well digeſted train of reflections—with a degree of tranquillity, beyond the reach of accident, he mounts the breach, and, with manly firmneſs, he leads on the martial band—the alacrity of his move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are obvious; and, with fortitude unappalled, he prepares to meet the foe—innumerable deaths ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round, yet he continues uniformly ſedate—he devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates not to the right, nor to the left; but, to more than probable deſtruction, he marches on, and the language of his conduct ſeems to be: "To die is not an evil; when found in the bed of honour, it is even eligible. As death is a <hi>natural,</hi> it is, <hi>therefore, a beneficial event:</hi> If I am under the guidance of a <hi>ſupreme, all-wiſe, and all-gracious Being,</hi> his regulations in regard to me, muſt be replete with judgment, rectitude and mercy. To die is the lot of humanity; the preſent mode of exiſtence muſt terminate; and every man, at ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod or other, muſt inevitably ſubmit to the pangs of diſſolution. Let me, then, meet the angel of death, while engaged in a laudable purſuit; I ſhall only be removed from one ſcene of things to another; the curtain will ariſe upon a higher order of beings; and I ſhall ſtill continue under the cognizance of a pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creator. Honour demands my attendance in hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:034162_0755_0FFC53AB91DA6B58"/>
fields; let me, then, cheerfully obey: The voice of my country hath called me forth; the career is meritorious; glory beams its moſt tranſcendent rays; and, at the deſtined goal, I ſhall receive my laurel crown. Avaunt! then, every ghaſtly ſpectre; nor preſume to pervade, by the chaotic influence of diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganizing heſitation, the region of my imagination. Length of days are not <hi>principally</hi> to be deſired—let me rather devote my life to the ſervice of thoſe with whom I ſtand connected—let me rather dignify the term of my probation, by achievements which deſerve to be immortalized! In a righteous cauſe I have drawn my ſword—if I fall, my exit is both expected and honorary, and I am prepared to meet my fate—if I eſcape, it ſhall be my care to aſcertain the juſtice of my claim to the warrior's meed, and Fame's loud clarion ſhall reſound my deeds of arms!"</p>
                     <p>Thus, come life, come death—tranquillity is the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's portion; integrity preſides in his boſom, and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is his birth-right: He goeth forth to the battle, and his countrymen, his friends, and his brethren, fall around!—Humanity drops a tear—but fortitude is ſtill an invulnerable ſhield; while, undiſmayed by dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and beyond the reach of perſonal apprehenſion, he triumphs in the midſt of ſlaughter; and if, at length, the miſſive weapon urged againſt his life, ſhould transfix, by a mortal wound, he ſmiles beneath the icy darts of death—his equanimity is ſtill the ſame; and with placid compoſure he will reſign his breath. Such are the endowments he ought to poſſeſs, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth on a military career.</p>
                     <p>The true hero is alſo a uniform patriot—his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is circumſcribed by the public weal; and ſo well doth he love his country, that, although he poſſeſſeth the ſoul of valour, yet, if the councils of peace are dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by, and conſiſt with honour, he will embrace them as his chief <hi>deſideratum.</hi> He loves, and he will protect his country—her emolument is the <hi>ultimatum</hi> of his wiſhes; but ſtill he is a citizen of the world, and the wounds of humanity transfix his ſenſibility.
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:034162_0756_0FFC53A8EC576CD8"/>
He is the guardian of the people's rights—but he gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not on the ſword, except the manifeſto of their grievances is ſtamped by the broad ſeal of juſtice. A well regulated government is the ſovereign dictator of all his actions—his arrangements are the reſult of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and his appeal is to the laws which are ordained. He loves his country—but he is not ſolicitous to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large her boundaries—he remembers that Rome, when ſhe ſtyled herſelf miſtreſs of the world, was not, in fact, more reſpectable than when her luſt of domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was confined within a narrower circumference. He is not actuated by that wild ambition, which, with maddening influence, urged the baleful progreſs of the Macedonian chief—he feels no Robeſpierian thirſt for human blood—he will never cry havoc, but when hard neceſſity compels—nor will he, but in the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, let looſe the dogs of war. Thus, while every circumſtance of his life evinceth the energy of that <hi>amor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </hi> which gloweth in his boſom, the broad philanthropy of his diſpoſition is ſtill proclaiming him the friend of man.</p>
                     <p>The profeſſion of arms is uſeful and reſpectable. The Patriot Warrior is deſervedly in poſſeſſion of the eſteem of mankind; and, if he acts a conſiſtent part, he is an ornament to human nature. It is in this walk that a WASHINGTON, the illuſtrious Hero of this younger world, hath reaped undying laurels! and his immortal deeds illume, with new-born ſplendors, the brave man's path!</p>
                     <p>His early virtues authorized the moſt ſplendid predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and, although ſequeſtered in his firſt years amid his native ſhades, the neighbourhood of his Vernonian groves contained the only witneſſes of his youthful prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs; yet, from the ſtudies in which he was engaged, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the moſt ſubſtantial and beſt kind of information, while the uſeful and the pleaſing enriched and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his mind. The mountain breeze endowed him with the glow of health; and he procured, from the pleaſurable and ſalutary toils which diverſified the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting ſcenes of rural life, a firm robuſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:034162_0757_0FFC53A767A27048"/>
expanded limbs, and a graceful, majeſtic, and well proportioned exterior.</p>
                     <p>His filial piety was early evinced. At that period of ardent expectancy, when the vivid buds of hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to unfold their tender leaves; when tip-toe imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination aſſumed its richeſt colouring, and the opening proſpect was arrayed in the moſt ſplendid hues; juſt as the intereſting youth had attained his fifteenth year, <hi>although entered, under the moſt favourable auſpices,</hi> on board a ſhip of war, and only not embarked—in a moment ſo critical, he was withheld from the event<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful purſuit, by the tender remonſtrances of a mother, who, not availing herſelf of the authority with which nature had inveſted her, condeſcended to employ the language of entreaty. Soon, however, the venerable matron called into action that Grecian firmneſs, which was inherent in her boſom; and the youthful hero, while engaging in the military career, was enriched by the maternal benediction.</p>
                     <p>How honorary were his firſt onſets! and how ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly did they evince the unequalled abilities, that gave him an indiſputable claim to thoſe united ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages, which have ſo repeatedly proclaimed him the <hi>Man of the People</hi>—the man who deſerved, and who hath received, both the military and the civic wreath.</p>
                     <p>Illuſtrious citizen! how faultleſs and how glorious are the ſplendid tranſactions which have marked and dignified thy eventful life! What American but muſt delight to trace the gradual ſteps, by which thou haſt advanced to thy preſent, <hi>perhaps unparalleled, eminence!</hi> Viewed in the aggregate, or in detached inſtances, thy adminiſtration muſt furniſh the boſom of every contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative Columbian with immeaſurable complacency! A glow of conſcious exultation pervades reflection—thou art our countryman! we claim kindred with thy worth; and we derive a kind of reſpectability from this national affinity! Let us <hi>trace</hi> and <hi>retrace—the theme is rich—its intereſt to an American ear will ſtill accumulate; and revolving ages will confeſs it inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible!</hi>

It was a happy moment, in which our venerable legiſlators hailed a Waſhington, as Commander in Chief of the forces of United America! Armed with the weapons of defence, and girding on the ſword of power, his progreſs was aſtoniſhing, and his achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments truly important! Confuſion fled at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; diſcipline ranged itſelf under his banners; order preſided in his arrangements; and ſimple, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trained villagers became a regular army of brave, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and effective ſoldiers! The termination of the firſt campaign was worthy of the <hi>philanthropic ſoldier;</hi> and HUMANITY will record thoſe diſpoſitions, which reduced the Britiſh to the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of yielding up the metropolis of the State of Maſſachuſetts, <hi>without the effuſion of a ſingle drop of blood,</hi> among the foremoſt of his deeds of worth. But every thing was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a Chief ſo amply endowed by nature, and who blended with the <hi>firſt abilities,</hi> that <hi>prudent caution</hi> ſo requiſite in the catalogue of a <hi>ſoldier's virtues</hi>—who, while he was never <hi>arrogant</hi> or <hi>aſſuming,</hi> was, on every great occaſion, <hi>nobly firm</hi> and <hi>becomingly dignified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The beſt principles of philoſophy were early im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in his boſom. His <hi>paſſions, all arranged by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, were kept in uniform ſubjection.</hi> He knew no party; and againſt the inroads of prejudice he erected the ſtrongeſt barriers. He was incapable of illiberal views or concluſions; and his movements, ever dictated by a ſound underſtanding and a well regulated judgment, were invariably marked by propriety. Accuſtomed accurately to inveſtigate, he became familiar with both the <hi>probable</hi> and the <hi>poſſible.</hi> He underſtood the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive concurrence of events, and was, in a good degree, prepared for the conſequences of the meaſures which he adopted. Always contemplative, his faculties were habituated to exerciſe; and hence his mind became invigorated and capacious, while he acquired the power of readily recognizing truth, and of embracing, in the midſt of difficulties, the moſt ſalutary and extricating expedients. To this effect is the ſketch, which thoſe, who are the beſt informed, have given of the <hi>Hero of
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:034162_0759_0FFC53A119315740"/>
this new world;</hi> and the ſplendor of his career hath ſurpaſſed the higheſt ſtrains of eulogy!</p>
                     <p>His reply to the annunciation of his appointment to the conſpicuous and honorary ſtation, to which the combining ſuffrages of his country had elevated him, while it is amiably ingenuous and truly noble, is alſo evincive of unaſſuming worth and intereſting diffidence. Modeſty is a gem, which, advantageouſly diſpoſed, may ſparkle becomingly, even among the aſſemblage of manly virtues; and it frequently diffuſeth a luſtre over the braveſt exploits! Illuſtrious man! admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is taſked, when ſeeking to clothe, in language ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate to their ſplendor, the matchleſs deeds which have marked a life ſo fraught with uſefulneſs! It is not aſtoniſhing, that his election to office was unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous—it is not ſurpriſing, that he was received, by all orders of people, with every demonſtration of applauſe, nor, that the army, in particular, evinced their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by the moſt unequivocal acclamations of joy.</p>

                     <p>All eyes were toward him; and every tongue was emboldened to expreſs the various ſentiments of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and a fluctuating populace, which, ignorant that their army was, in many inſtances, deſtitute of

Innumerable were the difficulties and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips with which he was condemned to ſtruggle; alarming diſappointments of many high-raiſed expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, general dejection, and an almoſt total defection of reſources! What muſt have been the feelings of the <hi>Patriot Warrior,</hi> on the repeated deſertions, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful to the American character, which, at ſome diſaſtrous periods, were the events of every hour! How muſt he have agonized, while witneſſing the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal gloom pourtrayed in the countenances of his reduced troops—"<hi>the militia departing in whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:034162_0761_0FFC539A3926C0A8"/>
and their example infecting the regular regiments,</hi>" while ſubjected, by the neceſſity of retreating, to the moſt mortifying ſenſations, and forbid by prudence to exonerate himſelf from the defamatory remarks, originating in thoſe inevitable movements! Yet, by that innate probity which ever maintained its regency in his boſom, he was once more rendered greatly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to the ills that encompaſſed him; and, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that his line of conduct would beſt conduce to the accompliſhment of that independence, at which America juſtly aimed, he calmly ſubmitted to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary envelopment, anticipating the elucidating criſis, which, withdrawing the veil, would preſent cauſes and effects in their true point of view.</p>
                     <p>Cowardice, alſo, dared to produce among the ranks of freemen, its daſtardly adherents!! O WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON! what were the conflicts of thy heroic ſpirit, at that portentous era, when all thy rhetoric was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in vain—when both thy example and thy au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority were ineffectual to the rallying thoſe <hi>panic-ſtruck men,</hi> who abandoned thee in thy utmoſt extremity!!! It cannot be matter of ſurpriſe, that, in a moment ſo tremendous, thou wert deſerted by thy wonted ſereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—that the calm region of thy boſom became unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually tempeſted, and, that the hurricane within well near proſtrated the barriers of reaſon.</p>
                     <p>This moſt intereſting period of the American revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and the effect of theſe calamitous events on the mind of her hero, is ſtrikingly ſketched by the hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: "The General having embarked in the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can cauſe <hi>from the pureſt principles,</hi> viewed, with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite concern, a behaviour ſo ſhameful! His ſoul was harrowed up with apprehenſions, that his country would be conquered, her army diſgraced, and her lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties deſtroyed. He anticipated, in imagination, that the Americans would appear to poſterity in the light of high-ſounding boaſters, who bluſtered when danger was at a diſtance, but ſhrunk at the ſhadow of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Extenſive confiſcations, and numerous attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, preſented themſelves in full view to his agitated
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:034162_0762_0FFC5396EC7879C8"/>
mind. He ſaw, in imagination, new formed States, with the means of defence in their hands, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious proſpect of liberty before them, levelled to the duſt. Impreſſed with theſe ideas, he hazarded his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for ſome conſiderable time, in rear of his own men, and in front of the enemy, with his horſe's head toward the latter, as if in expectation, that, by an honourable death, he might eſcape the infamy he dreaded from the daſtardly conduct of troops, on whom he could place no dependence." To this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliating and diſpiriting 15th of September, 1776, ſucceeded a train of calamities; for, although the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed ſoldiers, in one gallant action, retrieved their military fame, misfortune, with baleful wing, ſtill brooded over the American ſtandard. Unutterable was the diſtreſs of the hero; and his embarraſſments and regrets, when retreating with his few remaining followers, deſtitute and forlorn, without the means of procuring the indiſpenſable neceſſaries of life, muſt have exceeded even the powers of conception! "Scarce an inhabitant of the towns through which he paſſed, could be induced to join his almoſt deſerted ſtandards, while he beheld numbers daily flocking to the royal army, to make their peace and obtain protection. When he contemplated on the one ſide, a numerous, well appointed, and full clad army, dazzling the eyes of the ſoldiers with the elegance of uniformity, and on the other, a few poor fellows meanly cloathed, ſinking under the preſſure of accumulated wants, and flying for their ſafety, what words can deſcribe his <hi>augmented</hi> ſufferings, as he thus witneſſed the American army re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhing its General—the people giving up the cauſe—ſome of the leaders going over to the enemy—and the Britiſh commanders ſucceeding in every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize!"</p>
                     <p>But the Genius of Columbia, and of Waſhington, at length aroſe triumphant! It ſuddenly pierced the denſe clouds which had ſo long obſcured its radiance! Trenton and Princeton firſt experienced its reſuſcitating influence—brilliant was its progreſs—and auguſt the
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:034162_0763_0FFC539370785B10"/>
arrangement, which, in the moſt critical conjuncture, ſtationed the hero betwixt the contending parties! See! he marches on to death or victory! his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and his example are now gloriouſly influential! The ſoldiers bravely follow, and incalculable advantages are obtained!—deciſive conſequences enſue—captivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towns are evacuated—the clouds are rapidly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing—and the <hi>ſun of liberty,</hi> with genial influence, once more expands the tender buds of hope!—But, to deſcant upon the merits, the hardſhips, and the ſplendid and ſubſtantial ſervices of a Waſhington, vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umes are inſufficient!</p>
                     <p>Truly arduous was his taſk. "To preſerve order," ſays the narrator of his actions, "and ſubordination, in an army of free republicans, even when well fed, clothed and paid, would have been a work of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty—But to retain them in ſervice, and reſtrain them with diſcipline, when deſtitute, not only of the comforts, but often of the neceſſaries, of life, requires addreſs and abilities of ſuch magnitude, as are rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found in human nature. In this choice of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, General Waſhington not only kept his army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, but conducted with ſo much diſcretion, as to command the approbation, both of the army and of the citizens."</p>
                     <p>Glorious meed! May the benign rays of gratitude, cheriſhed through theſe emancipated States, ever gild the laurels which it entwines. Every true American, paſſing on from theſe ſucceſs crowned ſcenes, will hail with pious rapture the memorable day which placed the Patriot Warrior at the head of theſe infant repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics. Juſt ſuch a Father—juſt ſuch a Leader—juſt ſuch a Guardian of our long conteſted rights, our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igencies required. Grateful and upright retribution! happy unanimity!—thus did the hero merit—well had he earned the righteous tribute—and, in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of America, the 30th of April, 1789, muſt ever be conſidered as a prominent epoch; for on that day, her beloved WASHINGTON received the inveſtiture, which cloathed him with all the authority that FREE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN COULD CONSENT TO DELEGATE.</p>

And now the oaths of office are adminiſtered—Mark! what fervour of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion glows in his manly features, as he repeats the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn affirmation!—See! with what inimitably becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing piety, he bends to kiſs the ſacred volume!—Hark! what a burſt of applauſe ſucceeds—loud and repeated acclamations! Oh! may he long live to iterate a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ſo auguſt, an elevation ſo unparalleled!</p>
                     <p>A ſpectator has happily ſketched the uncommonly intereſting ſcene, and expreſſively delineated his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent feelings. "It ſeemed," ſays he, "from the number of witneſſes, to be a ſolemn appeal to heaven and earth at once. Upon the ſubject of this great and good man, I may perhaps be an enthuſiaſt; but I confeſs, I was under an awful and religious perſuaſion, that the Gracious Ruler of the univerſe was looking down at that moment, with peculiar complacency, on an act which, to a part of his creatures, was ſo very important. Under this impreſſion, when the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor pronounced, in a very feeling manner, "Long live GEORGE WASHINGTON!" my ſenſibility was wound up to ſuch a pitch, that I could do no more than wave my hat with the reſt, without the power of joining in the repeated acclamations which rent the air!"</p>
                     <p>From that eventful era, what tranſcendent wiſdom hath marked the regency of this illuſtrious, this <hi>time-honoured man!</hi> How accurately hath he diſtinguiſhed merit! how deliberate are his counſels! how firm and impartial are his deciſions! and how judicious are his rewards! While he is the patron of the good, he regards even the ſons of ſedition with lenity: Their progreſs over the weſtern mountains, was marked by
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:034162_0765_0FFC538CB4256938"/>
the hero with ſuch regrets as became a patriotic chief; yet, amid the impending ſtorm, his equanimity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unruffled; with placid dignity he aſſumed that power, which, as a ſacred depoſit, he had accepted; while the angel pity preſided at his deliberations, and ſweet mercy pointed all thoſe arguments which the heavenly pleader knew to urge. The poor delinquents were viewed with paternal tenderneſs, and humanity dropped a commiſerating tear! Rectitude, however, aſſerted its prerogative, and the ſword of juſtice was <hi>more than half unſheathed</hi>—This was enough—Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, appalled, and ſhrinking from the awful face of offended government, ſought ſhelter in oblivion; and the golden reign of order was again reſtored.</p>
                     <p>Thus honourable hath proved the military career! thus ſplendid is the path of the <hi>Patriot Warrior!</hi> Envy ſickens at the view; but her pointed arrows have loſt their murderous powers—the ſlanderous tongue of envenomed faction is either mute or ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual—and through thy borders, bleſt Columbia! the healing voice of truth, peace, and unexampled proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, auſpiciouſly reverberates.</p>

                     <p>IT is a melancholy truth, that the beſt minds, when outraged by injuries, and rendered callous by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of unmerited misfortunes, too often become the
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:034162_0766_0FFC5815338C55B8"/>
receptacles of inflexible auſterity. The virtuous phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropiſt, urged by his ardent love of mankind, paints individuals agreeably to his ſenſe of moral rectitude; he hath imaged in his mind a pleaſing model, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineates the virtues which he conceives attainable, he is ſolicitous for the elevation of the human character; what he wiſhes, he conſiders as practicable; and, adopting an admeaſurement of accompliſhments that rarely ever exiſt, he is continually ſubjected to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and that kind of diſguſt, which terminates in a cynical arrangement of thoſe propenſities that were originally replete with the beſt affections of which humanity is ſuſceptible.</p>
                     <p>The little narrative, ſelected as the ſubject of this Gleaner, is a ſtriking proof that miſanthropy obtains its moſt rampant growth in the ſoil of virtue; that misfortunes are its manure, the impaſſioned ſighs of anguiſh its genial atmoſphere, and the torrents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending on the cheek of woe its fertilizing ſhowers.</p>
                     <p>Octavian was a youth, whoſe dawn of being au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized the higheſt expectations; amid an aſſemblage of the moſt brilliant qualities, he poſſeſſed that endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing benevolence and tenderneſs of diſpoſition, which would become thoſe attendant ſeraphs appointed to hover round the children of mortality. The young philanthropiſt was an enthuſiaſt in his attachment to his ſpecies, and he was fond of believing their virtues inherent, and their vices the reſult of caſualty or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign agency. His education was truly judicious, and every year ſerved to advance and to ameliorate thoſe rare qualities that enriched his mind. His ſenſibility was extreme; and the ardour of a luxuriant fancy taught him to regard this globe as a paradiſe, and its inhabitants as adminiſtering ſpirits, ordained as aids to each other. Even reaſon ſeemed to quaff the intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icating draught; and as his fine underſtanding was embelliſhed by a pleaſingly prepoſſeſſing exterior, and the demiſe of his excellent parents had early made him the entire maſter of a very handſome property, perſons were not wanting, who, by the exerciſe of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:034162_0767_0FFA66119B3A2760"/>
urbanity, contributed to heighten and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſweet deluſion.</p>
                     <p>Thus accompliſhed, and thus circumſtanced, did the young Octavian commence the eventful career of life. Honour, highly wrought, and glowing with the moſt liberal purpoſes, was created the maſter ſpring of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery movement; while rich in conſcious worth, and eſtimating perſons and things by his own feelings, he ſeemed to tread enchanted ground, gaily anticipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more happineſs than the calculation of experience would aſſign to a million of mortal lives. He looked around, and the wide extenſive globe, with the blue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene of heaven, alike conſpired to ſwell his heart with ineffable rapture; his path was ſtrewed with flowers; pleaſures, laudable in their ſource, were the compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of his days; and from the far diſtant haunts, and ſituations the moſt barren, he induſtriouſly extracted a motive for complacency. Thus enchantingly the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid viſion ſwam before him; ſuſpicion ſlept in its cav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erns; friendſhip aſſumed its moſt benign aſpect; and love, garbed in all the captivating allurements of youth and beauty, unveiled before him its bewitching fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; the irreſiſtibly commanding paſſions aſſerted their inborn vigour, and every faculty was engaged. Nature, when ſhe attuned his heart to the refinements of amity, rendered him alſo capable of the tender paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in its utmoſt extreme, and its ungovernable emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and delicious tumults ruſhed forcibly on his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; a viſion of halcyon days ſucceeded; freely he indulged the dream of fancy; and, without a ſingle pauſe of diſcretion, he wedded the young, the gay, the beauteous <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> incautiouſly entwining thoſe bands which were to enſure felicity, or to tinge with the blackeſt hues his future deſtiny!</p>
                     <p>But Octavian heſitated not to affirm, that he had attained the ſummit of bliſs; and it muſt be confeſſed, the catalogue of his enjoyments was ample; virtuous, rich, ſentimental, enamoured with the world, bleſt with a choſen friend, whom he conceived attached to him by every tie which the moſt cordial amity could
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:034162_0768_0FFA6618FA456778"/>
throw about the heart; and, to complete the picture, wedded to a female who had been followed by a crowd of candidates for her favour, who <hi>apparently</hi> returned his tenderneſs with equal ardours, and whoſe move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſeemed the reſult of diſcretion; was there a good which Octavian poſſeſſed not?—Once more he turned his admiring gaze, and the face of contentment gladdened his eye, while the voice of congratulation vibrated ſweetly on his ear. He had been accuſtomed to embrace <hi>appearances</hi> as <hi>realities;</hi> and while benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence acquired new energy in his boſom, again he bleſſed the celeſtial countenance of humanity.</p>
                     <p>In this delirium ſome months rolled away; but the child of proſperity generally becomes a mark for the envenomed ſhafts of the invidious. <hi>Envy ſet on foot her machinations—injurious reports were whiſpered</hi>—the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Octavian were wounded, and the darts were urged by thoſe on whoſe <hi>good offices he had fondly calculated.</hi> Friendſhip, truth and honour, he no longer ſuppoſes them the inmates of every boſom, and ſuſpicion rankled in his breaſt. He traced the tale of ſcandal, and ſome <hi>oblique hints</hi> glanced on the faith of that <hi>early friend,</hi> whom, from the firſt dawn of reaſon, he had cheriſhed as his life's rich treaſure. For a moment he became petrified by the <hi>intimation,</hi> while horror aimed at his peace an icy dart. Alas! from that fatal period the dark paſſions were all unchained: Miſtruſt, aſſuming the aſcendency, commenced its regency, and the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of ſo indefatigable and eagle eyed a ſcrutator produced a conviction of the blackeſt perfidy. The diſcovery was, however, gradual; at firſt, prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, equivocal or hollow appearances of kindneſs, a manifeſt declination of wonted attentions, the ardours of attachment indiſputably ſubſiding, the total diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearance of thoſe honeſt tranſports which had ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each glowing feature, eſtrangement ſucceeding, the ſilken bands of amity, "<hi>ſtring after ſtring,</hi>" by cold reſerve, "<hi>were ſevered,</hi>" the habits of generous confidence gave place to icy diſtance, and the agoniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing era at length preſented, when inſult, contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:034162_0769_0FFA664D5277E3D8"/>
diſdain, and barbarous ridicule keenly pointed the perfidy, which thus beyond a doubt was demonſtrated. The injuries Octavian had received were moſt atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; under the ſacred name of friendſhip, the aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned wretch whom he had truſted had ſeduced the too credulous Meſſalina! who, becoming an eaſy prey to the deſtroyer, imbibed with avidity his licentious principles; while abundantly more criminal than the well known Ninon de L'Encloſe, (who broke no ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn vows) her amours were notoriouſly multifarious, and caprice was ordained diſtributor of her guilty favours!!!</p>
                     <p>Poor Octavian! who but muſt weep his unmerited fate! <hi>The world, on which he leaned,</hi> has pierced him through with many ſorrows; from what an eminence is he precipitated! how hath his golden dream of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs vaniſhed! how agonizing is the void in his boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om! All elſe he might have borne—but to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming force of a calamity ſo deeply aggravated, what Stoic fortitude could have remained inacceſſible? In that tremendous hour, which gave indubitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the infidelity of the deluded Meſſalina, what conflicting emotions, what ſoul harrowing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were concentrated! There, where his confiding heart had fondly truſted, where he had accumulated his beſt and deareſt wiſhes! ſhe, who was the object of his unbounded admiration, who he was poſitive united every thing which he believed of virtue, who was the univerſe to him!!—Suddenly conviction was forced upon him; the ties of love are rudely torn aſunder, and the cup of felicity is daſhed from his lips! Octavian ſaw himſelf alone in the world; an object of truſt exiſted not; thick darkneſs enveloped his mind, and he ſickened at the journey of life! Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of motive, the vigour of exertion expired, and the blandiſhments of hope were at an end. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences were natural; for while retroſpection was replete with all the anguiſh of regret, the pencil of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity was employed in ſketching viſions the moſt dark and comfortleſs; and the conſtant recurrence of
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:034162_0770_0FFA664FCC131080"/>
memory to thoſe gaudy viſions, which had ſo deeply impoſed on the confiding morning of his exiſtence, loudly proclaimed in the ear of his underſtanding, that ſuſpicion, ever on duty, was the only guard he could oppoſe to the baſe treachery of deep, deſigning, artful man.</p>
                     <p>Thus thoſe ſentiments, formerly arranged by mild benignity, taking their hue from the moſt endearing ſweetneſs of diſpoſition, now arming againſt each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, produced a chaos in his breaſt; where bloomed the ſweet flowers of complacency, there ſprung the poiſonous weeds of miſtruſt and bitterneſs of ſpirit; while thoſe rich fervours which nerved the glowing purpoſes of benevolence, now miſerably warped by diſappointment, heightened the rancour of the miſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrope, pointed his implacability, and produced him the determined enemy of his ſpecies; and thus on the ruins of philanthropy were unfurled the miſanthropic banners; gloomy malevolence raiſed high its ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, and war, inveterate war, was declared againſt humanity! His abhorrence of mankind hourly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented; nor did he aſſay to ſtruggle with feelings which procured him a tranſient and ſavage relaxation from inquietude; but ſtudiouſly cultivating the ſevereſt auſterity of diſpoſition, after procuring a divorce from the perfidious woman who had completed his ruin, he took refuge in the retired receſſes of his own apartments, uniformly ſecluding himſelf from every inquirer.</p>
                     <p>It was at this period, that, urged by pity, and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to point his views to that futurity, which is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed humanity truly conſolatory, I often preſented myſelf at his door; but although I petitioned in a ſupplicating tone for entrance, I could never gain ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance; and, truſting that reaſon, when time had ameliorated his deep regrets, would reſume her ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry guidance in his boſom, I forbore to preſs upon his ſorrows the continuance of a requeſt altogether una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, and obviouſly conſidered as impertinent.</p>
                     <p>There were others, however, who, more perſevering or more curious, forcibly paſſed thoſe doors, which
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:034162_0771_0FFA667206804A98"/>
Octavian had determined to bar againſt every foot but that of one domeſtic, whoſe ſervices the exigencies ſo intimately inwoven with exiſtence rendered abſolutely neceſſary. The unfortunate man received the intrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with inflexible reſentment; and, accuſing them of an unwarrantable violation of thoſe privileges to which as a citizen he was entitled, he added, that he had looked for ſecurity within his own walls, but that he was fearful the globe could furniſh no place of refuge againſt the inroads of an animal ſo ſavage as the human; and ſternly inſiſting on their immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, he affirmed that if they continued their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome moleſtations, as he ſhould be far from oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf to their united ſtrength, he ſhould be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to commence the life of a wanderer, ſeeking ſome remote cavern, where he might hide himſelf from the hated viſage of beings who excited his moſt abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent feelings, and from whom his full ſoul revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!! Our gentlemen, abaſhed by a rebuff ſo uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and ſo determined, haſtily retired. But Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian, ſuſpecting that he ſhould be ſubjected to their future encroachments, ſuddenly withdrew himſelf from their knowledge; becoming a voluntary exile from fortune, friends, and all thoſe blooming hopes, which, in the gay metropolis where he received a being, had approached him in the moſt faſcinating garb. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on his departure, a man of merit, who was his relation, took poſſeſſion of his eſtates; from which the unhappy and ſtill notoriouſly guilty Meſſalina receives an annual proviſion.</p>
                     <p>I have frequently converſed with the preſent poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of thoſe eſtates; but his ſilence to every queſtion relative to his kinſman, hath been firm and invariable; and I deſpaired of obtaining further information of the loſt Octavian, until proſecuting ſome weeks ſince a journey which I was neceſſitated to make; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of an unavoidable detention, I was benighted in the midſt of a road that I had ſeldom travelled; and a ſudden and violent ſhower of rain, adding to the inconvenience of my ſituation, I haſtened for
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:034162_0772_0FFA669BC6F55770"/>
ſhelter to a neighbouring wood, where I had not remained many moments, when a remote glimmering attracting my attention, my curioſity was irreſiſtibly excited; and I determined to follow the clue which the light preſented: Diſmounting, therefore, and ſecuring my horſe, I made the beſt of my way over the rougheſt road I have ever paſſed; when, arriving at a ſmall cottage, almoſt emboſomed by a tall growth of trees, I knocked vehemently at the door; and the pelting rain at that moment ſo ſtrongly enforced the propriety of my demand, that a reluctant entrance was cautiouſly granted: The door was opened by an old man, bent by a weight of years; and the wary heſitancy which marked his movements, contributed not a little to augment my ſurpriſe.</p>
                     <p>"<hi>It is a man, Sir,</hi>" in faultering accents, ſaid he to a groteſque figure, who, with folded arms, occupied a corner of the hermitage. "<hi>Well, well,</hi>" returned the Recluſe, in a tone of diſpleaſure, "<hi>let him continue during the violence of the ſtorm, but when that ſhall abate he muſt not delay his departure!</hi>" With an addreſs the moſt inſinuating I could aſſume, I approached the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocious maſter of this myſterious cell, who, catching a glance of my countenance, haſtily endeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal himſelf from my obſervation. The expreſſion of anguiſh which ſuddenly pervaded his features, was, however, but too evident; and under an aſſumed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimony, it was obvious that he harboured the moſt corroding glooms! His ſorrows were contagious; my ſympathetic feelings inſtantly confeſſed their power, and commiſeration impelled an eſſay to alleviate his misfortunes. Summoning therefore all the rhetoric of which I was maſter, I proceeded to urge whatever I imagined might aſſuage the anguiſh of a mind ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling with the ills of life. He heard me with a kind of ſullen diſdain, when, taking advantage of my firſt pauſe, and waving his hand with an emotion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, to my great aſtoniſhment he replied, "<hi>I know you, Sir—I know you, Mr. Vigillius,</hi> from my boyiſh years I have known you; <hi>you are ſaid to be a man of

virtue;</hi> but I am not to be deceived; my name is Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavian, Sir—the <hi>ſuffering, the betrayed Octavian; I was betrayed by virtue, Sir; hear this, and learn the neceſſity of your inſtant departure.</hi> I deteſt the affectation of rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude—it is but a maſk to conceal the blackeſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; but if you would ſtill wear the ſemblance of integrity, I charge you to conceal the place where my wretchedneſs hath found an aſylum. No one until now hath penetrated my retreat; my ſecret hath been lodged only in the boſom of this aged man, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Had Octavian been fully aware of the alteration he had ſuſtained, his ſecret might have remained in his own boſom: I ſhould never have recognized him; that expreſſion of divine benevolence, which mantled on his cheek, had given place to a deep and hollow countenance, the hue of which was become pallid and unpleaſing; on his ſmooth and well turned forehead, grief had imprinted her furrowing characters; habit had bent his fine figure, while ſorrow, anticipating the hand of time, had bleached his head, every hair was white, and his unrazored beard ſwept venerably on his boſom! If the ſtranger at firſt ſight had ſtrongly intereſted me, the early loved and long lamented Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavian now took full poſſeſſion of every faculty of my ſoul; and, graſping his hand with a ſudden exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pity and admiration, I preſſed it alternately to my lips and to my boſom.</p>
                     <p>"<hi>No, Sir, I will not leave you;</hi> Providence has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted me to this cell, and nothing but violence ſhall turn me from the path to which our common Father hath directed me!" A tranſient acknowledgment of ſurpriſe eſcaped Octavian, at the energy of my words and manner; and, in defiance of his impaſſioned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, devoting the whole night to him, I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to awaken him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o thoſe ſympathies, which had ſo long remained proſtrate in his boſom. I confeſſed that he had been the victim of a deep deſigning vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:034162_0774_0FFA66F3040E5868"/>
aſſociated with a perfidious woman; but his mind, I obſerved, had been too highly wrought, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in mankind in the aggregate, impoſing on his underſtanding, had blinded him to the neceſſity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation. I acknowledged that vice, in its moſt odious practices, was but too prevalent; yet I aſſerted that examples of generous rectitude were frequent in our world; and I held up to his view many inſtances, ſelected from the preſent day. Good and evil, it was notorious, alternately predominated; and it was a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, highly incumbent on minds faſhioned like his, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of remaining ſequeſtered amid the ſolitary wilds of nature, to occupy their underſtanding and their judgment in deviſing methods for the extirpation of crimes, and for the promoting and eſtabliſhing the intereſts of virtue.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were the themes on which I largely expatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but, alas! my efforts effectuated not the deſired purpoſe: And, while he affirmed that his hatred and deteſtation of his ſpecies were utterly inſurmountable, the <hi>vehemence of his manner enforced a ſtrong conviction of his ſincerity.</hi> Repeatedly he implored me to leave him; but my perſevering ſolicitude was not eaſily overcome; nor did I quit the cottage, until I obtained what I eſteemed a capital conceſſion, permiſſion to repeat my viſits. And ſhould I be the fortunate inſtrument of reſtoring Octavian to the world, with all thoſe ſocial feelings with which the omnipotent hand of his Creator endowed him, I ſhall then poſſeſs at leaſt one claim to the gratitude of mankind; and I ſhall, in ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious event, with honeſt exultation, again produce him an object worthy the attention and approbation of the moſt meritorious among my readers.</p>

                     <p>I am free to own, that I am wonderfully attached to this ſame Propriety; I would careſs her as my boſom friend; ſhe ſhould be an attendant ever on duty; and I would conſtitute her the inſeparable companion

But it is not enough that ſhe is reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the choice of her apparel; her perſon, thus prepoſterouſly arrayed, is now ſeated at the card-table, and now placed at the head of the dancing party, grouped with girls and boys, who, while they ſoothe her by the moſt flattering encomiums, impatiently wait the opportunity of turning her into deriſion; ſhe <hi>walks down the ranks;</hi> and, having unfortunately <hi>no ear for muſic,</hi> ſhe is commonly out of time and place; and, in the ſame moment that ſhe is thus ridiculous, ſhe fancies herſelf the object of univerſal admiration!</p>
                     <p>Poor deluded lady, ſhould thy eye ever glance over this page, let not its ſincerity offend; truſt me it is penned by one who is ſuitably impreſſed by a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for thy virtues, and who has repeatedly combated in thy behalf. It is beyond a doubt, that thy ſolicitude to pleaſe is not only juſtifiable, but laudable; and the prime error in thy arrangements, hath been the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting to engage that <hi>propriety</hi> which is a guide every way adequate to the conducting us through the moſt intricate paths. That thou haſt miſſed thy goal, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced as thou art, cannot be matter of wonder: We regret thy diſappointment, and as we are in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of ſuch documents concerning thee, as convince us that thy ruling paſſion is ſtill ſtrongly operative in thy boſom, we are happy that it is not yet too late to
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:034162_0778_0FFA68C590EEBF50"/>
ſketch for thee a plan, which, if adopted, will infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inveſt thee with that deſideratum at which thou haſt ſo long ineffectually aimed.</p>
                     <p>We will be careful to abridge thy pleaſures as little as poſſible; and, as ſociety may be requiſite to cheer the winter of age, we will agree that thy extenſive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance ſhall be the coevals of thy convenience. Of parties of pleaſure, under the direction of amity and corrected hilarity, we decidedly approve. Muſic has been ſtyled intellectual food; and dancing combines the advantages of exerciſe, with convivial enjoyment. But, although we unheſitatingly allow thy frequent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, we cannot admire thy <hi>individual wanderings;</hi> thy ſmiles and thy preſence may ſanction youthful glee, while no <hi>antique movements abſurdly point the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable appearance thou haſt received from the hand of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive time.</hi> Doſt thou want exerciſe, thy convenient carriages wait but thy command to waft thee to the charming receſſes of the village groves; and all the rural pleaſures of which the peaceful hamlet is produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, are at thy command. A celebrated writer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us that the poliſhed ſons and daughters of France always refuſe to mingle in the dance, after they have paſſed the age of thirty. <hi>French etiquette</hi> has long been diſtinguiſhed and obſerved; and I am free to own, that I admire the <hi>propriety</hi> of this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
                     <p>There is, unqueſtionably, a period when the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the human being ought to aſſume a dignity of character, when they cannot conſiſtently nor graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcend to frivolity; and we ſhould be careful that we do not forfeit that reſpectability, which is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of years. Obſerve the time-honoured matron who hath enliſted under the banners of <hi>propriety;</hi> her brow is not contracted by ſeverity—ſhe preſides in the circles of gaiety, without caſting a cloud on their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments—ſhe mingles in the parties of the youthful candidates for pleaſure; and thoſe remarks which ſhe is occaſionally induced to make, drawn from the treaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury of wiſdom, are calculated both to delight and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:034162_0779_0FFC5813AE36DB38"/>
Her ſentiments are the growth of a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, enriched by experience, and they are pointed by candour; ſhe is regarded as a model, and beloved as a friend; her language is never adulatory; and yet ſhe haſtens to render that juſt tribute of praiſe which ſhould be conſidered as the unalienable reward of merit. When ſhe is under the neceſſity of pointing out a fault, the perſuaſive energy and conviction of her remarks, combine that kind of mildneſs, which is always ſure to ſoothe, while they effectuate the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation they are deſigned to procure; her looks, her movements, her every arrangement, is deſcriptive of <hi>propriety;</hi> condeſcending dignity is inſcribed on the features of her finely expreſſive countenance, and all who behold her are conſtrained to admire and to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate the truly <hi>conſiſtent matron.</hi> By the benedictions of the young people of both ſexes, ſhe is conſtantly followed—they court her ſociety with avidity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from her preſence cheerful, grateful, and compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atively happy. In her gratuities ſhe judiciouſly <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminates,</hi> and ſhe uniformly prefers aiding the efforts of the deſerving orphan, who, by the aſſiſtance of her needle, is ſtruggling to obtain a decent ſupport, to the pleaſure of adding a few yards of lace to the ornaments of her greateſt favourites. Once I knew ſuch a female; but alas! ſhe is now no more—the big ſtream of una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing ſorrow marked her exit; the virtues clad in ſables joined the funereal proceſſion; <hi>propriety</hi> mourned the deceaſe of the moſt unoffending of her votaries, while the regrets of all ranks of people were produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a general lamentation. Sweet is the recollection of her life; and her memory, embalmed by her worth, will endure until the powers of retention ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to oblivion.</p>
                     <p>If thoſe in whoſe boſoms a deſire to pleaſe irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly predominates, gave themſelves time to reflect—if they would eſtabliſh the regency of <hi>propriety,</hi> conviction would unavoidably follow, and they would then know that a regular and perſevering conformity to her dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:034162_0780_0FFC5810C4CE6C48"/>
is the only career, the unclouded ſplendor of which can effectually ſilence the clamours of rancour and the hootings of envy. The confounding different periods of time and deſtroying thoſe diſcriminating marks which are calculated to deſignate characters, muſt always diſguſt; the man who would mount the breach, cloathed in canonicals, would be alike prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous with him who ſhould aſcend the pulpit, arrayed in a ſuit of full trimed regimentals! and the giggling Miſs who has juſt completed her tenth year, habited in the gravely fancied garb, deſigned to enrobe the decent limbs of the venerable matron, is not more ridiculous than the woman of ſixty, whoſe ill choſen ornaments an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer no other purpoſe than to render her an object of deriſion! The truth is, ſhe thus excites attention to the years ſhe hath numbered, forcibly pointing her longev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity by the very method ſhe hath taken to conceal it! her gay apparel ſeems to multiply the furrows on her face, every unbecoming article apparently deepens her wrinkles, and renders ſtill more hollow the hollow of her cheeks.</p>
                     <p>Cuſtom has judiciouſly affixed to the various ranks in ſociety its aſcertaining marks, and we cannot ſee her barriers thrown down, or the ruſhing together of the different claſſes of mankind, without regret. Had I been born a female, it is very poſſible I might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted as females do; but however this might have been, I think I could not have denied that the fantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical trappings of dreſs are <hi>always</hi> indicative of a frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous mind. It muſt be confeſſed that plainneſs of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel is much more deſcriptive of dignity of character than embroidered veſtments, furbelowed robes, or full dreſſed caps. Singularity of dreſs is a peculiar trait in the principles of quakeriſm, and the garb of this ſect is calculated to give a rational impreſſion of their tenets. The plain quaker-coloured ſattin, neatly ſewed togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the milk white muſlin or lawn, faſhioned into the becoming handkerchief and well ſet colf—in ſhort, the <hi>tout enſemble</hi> of the modeſt quaker's attire hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:034162_0781_0FFC580D77542B58"/>
extorted the moſt unequivocal teſtimonies of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. A maiden thus clad prefers at firſt ſight her claim to our eſteem—we are not impelled to an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation of the value of that time ſhe hath murdered at her toilette—we have no uſeleſs appendages to calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and we indulge a pleaſing hope that ſhe has devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her hours to the cultivation of her underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>I do not recollect ever to have heard a ſingle gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man expreſſing his ſentiments on dreſs, who has not been deciſive in his preference of the quaker habit. I know ſome men who are mute on almoſt every other ſubject, who, whenever this is introduced on the tapis, are even eloquent in the avowal of their admiration—and ladies of the beſt underſtanding have regularly giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en their voices on the ſame ſide of the queſtion. How then does it happen that every deſcription of women among us, quakers excepted, are ambitious of exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much of ſhow in their apparel, and of making as glittering an appearance as their ideas of the rules impoſed by elegance and propriety will admit? This is an enigma reſerved for THE SEX to explain; and in the mean time it may be preſumed, that when the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod arrives which ſhall render it <hi>faſhionable</hi> to accuſtom females to an early attention to <hi>uſeful ſtudies,</hi> which ſhall teach them to reaſon, inveſtigate, and compare, and to invigorate their underſtandings by a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and a conſequent adoption of thoſe arguments which reſult from ſound ſenſe, and are recognized by truth—when, I ſay, in the hiſtory of human nature, this period ſhall have diſplaced the adminiſtration of frivolity, I will pledge my reputation that their dreſs will become an object of leſs importance, that it will be remarkable for its ſimplicity, and that every ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity will be baniſhed from the toilette.</p>

wounded by the little archer; this, however, is conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for there is a myſtery in the ſtory of my good mother, which, although my curioſity is wound up to the higheſt pitch, I could never yet unravel.</p>

                                       <p>It is not more ſtrange than true, Emily. Major Camden commenced his acquaintance with my mother by ſaving her from imminent danger: She was taking an airing on a very rough road—her hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes took fright—the driver was thrown from his ſeat—a precipice was in view—and her deſtruction had been inevitable, had not Providence ſent Camden to her aſſiſtance, who ſaved her life at the riſque of his own!</p>

                                       <p>The gratitude of my mother was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded; mine alſo was powerfully engaged—for a time it deceived me: Camden declared himſelf my lover; but although I have long ſince underſtood the ſituation of my own heart, I am not permitted to deal explicitly with Major Camden.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE paſſed one of thoſe days, that, on ſober reflection, I would gladly reiterate. The morning roſe delightfully ſerene; and, having offered at the ſhrine of Deity our early oriſons, I propoſed to Mary a viſit to our children; an enchanting little jaunt produced us at Hamilton Place. Edward met us with cuſtomary expreſſions of kindneſs, and Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta with thoſe demonſtrations of affection that have ever marked her conduct. We paſſed ſome delightful moments amid the captivating endearments of the little William and his ſiſters, and their ſociety operated as the ſweeteſt ſolace to our minds. On the entrance of leſs intereſted friends, we were, however, conſtrained to diſmiſs the lovely prattlers; and, beſtowing on them the benediction of affection, we committed them to the care of a faithful woman, to whom Margaretta, when <hi>unavoidably engaged,</hi> is in the habit of entruſting them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="164" facs="unknown:034162_0830_0FFC576FDDD2CFB8"/>
The commencement of the converſation, after the children had retired, took a turn extremely adverſe to my wiſhes—<hi>Britiſh enormities,</hi> and <hi>Britiſh ingratitude</hi> was the theme; and I, who ſpontaneouſly ſhrink from inſtances of <hi>human depravity,</hi> naturally turned with diſguſt from the ſubject. It is true I am a Gleaner; but, I am, nevertheleſs, at a world of pains to winnow my multifarious collections; and I muſt be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their utility, before I can conſent that the bitter ingredients ſhould obtain the aſcendency even in a ſingle eſſay. Fortunately for me, the courſe of thoſe obſervations, which were iſſuing with a ſufficient quantum of acrimony, was unexpectedly arreſted, and conducted into an oppoſite channel, by the interference of a young gentleman, a Captain L—, whom I have long regarded with no ſmall complacency: The ſeeds of every virtue are implanted in his breaſt; but conceiving an averſion from the <hi>oſtentious parade</hi> of excellence, he hath, I have imagined, embraced a contrary extreme; and his fine qualities, are, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, veiled by appearances, which the ſuperficial regard as expreſſive of propenſities directly oppoſite to thoſe that are paramount in his boſom. Young as he is, he ſeems preciſely to have eſtimated the value of the human character; the man of <hi>real virtue</hi> will ever find him warmly attached to his intereſt; and he is ſincerely beloved by every one to whom he is <hi>fully known.</hi> All the energies of his ſoul have to-day been called into action; and his fine eyes, ſparkling with even more than their wonted luſtre, while he plead the cauſe of truth, evinced the <hi>kindred virtues</hi> which are inherent in his boſom.</p>
                     <p>He introduced his teſtimony by obſerving it was very probable the Britons might, in many inſtances, have been offenders, but that his own experience was an exception to clamours, which he imagined were far too general; and he proceeded to inform us, that, having taken the command of a ſhip, he had croſſed the Atlantic with all the prejudices of an American; that, with the pride of a young man enthuſiaſtically
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:034162_0831_0FFC576E3A64E5F8"/>
devoted to his country, he had anchored in the river Thames; that he went on ſhore prepared to repel inſults, and with a high ſenſe of the haughtineſs and ingratitude of the Engliſh nation. Circumſtances, however, ſoon produced a pleaſing revolution in his mind; the diſpoſal of a large and various cargo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced him to different deſcriptions of people, all of whom he found eaſy of acceſs, and fair and open in their dealings. The knowledge that he was an American, ſeemed to augment his conſequence; and every one appearing eager to ſerve him, he was led to wonder whither the arrogance and reſerve attrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uted to thoſe Iſlanders had vaniſhed. Retiring to his ſhip, he was indulging a reverie on this ſubject, when an unknown voice, obſerving to one of the ſhip-mates, who was lighting him into the great cabin, that he had but recently heard the name of the commander, arreſted his attention; he had ſcarce time to form a conjecture, ere the ſtranger preſented himſelf before him.</p>
                     <p>"Your name, Sir, I am informed, is L—; but information is ſuperfluous; your features have taken too great hold on my mind ever to be eraſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from."—The ſtranger advanced with open arms—The American ſtood collected—"You have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of me, Sir; I have not the pleaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you."—"Probably not, Sir; and yet I have often claſped you to my boſom; you uſed to be ambitious of a place on my knee; and your innocent remarks have amuſed me, during ſome very gloomy hours. My name is P—. I was captured by Captain N—, commander of the ſhip S—<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a man, <hi>in whoſe boſom true nobility ſeemed inherent.</hi> I have ſaid a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, that his ſpirit was too big for his body; and when, after my return home, I put to ſea again, one of my leading motives for wiſhing to make a prize of Captain N—, was, that I might be furniſhed with an opportunity of emulating his acts of generoſity. But in your father's houſe, Sir, I found even a pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal home. God bleſs the honoured man—Does he
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:034162_0832_0FFC57696BC9F9E8"/>
ſtill live? If he does, the wandering ſufferer may yet obtain a friend and father, who is not only an honour to the American name, but to humanity at large."</p>
                     <p>Captain L—, it will not be doubted, received a man ſo deeply impreſſed with the virtues of his father, and on whoſe boſom the <hi>laws of gratitude</hi> ſeemed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, with the requiſite attention. The grateful Briton would have conducted him immediately to his houſe; he entreated him to take up his quarters there; and, although pained by a refuſal, his frequent invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while he continued on the river, hardly left him an unappropriated day. Captain P—quitting his employ on the ocean, had entered into a line of buſineſs which empowered him to ſupply the naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor with many articles of which he was in want; and the American commander, with a view of giving him the preference, made continual application to his warehouſe: But occupied, previous to his departure, in cloſing his accounts, he commiſſioned the perſon whom he had employed to diſcharge the debts he had contracted, to wait on his hoſpitable friend for his bill; when, to his great aſtoniſhment, he was informed that he had no pecuniary demands upon him. He imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately haſtened to the compting-houſe of the merchant.—"What can you mean, Sir, by the meſſage I have juſt received? Am I not indebted to you for articles to a conſiderable amount?"</p>
                     <p>"No, indeed, Sir," returned the <hi>ſea diſciplined veteran,</hi> while an honeſt tear glittered in his eye—"<hi>Your father has rendered it impoſſible for you to become my debtor!!</hi> I wiſh to God the articles to which you refer, were of greater value. Commend me to the good man to whom you are returning; and if you are not diſpoſed to affront a brother Sailor, you will mention this affair no more." This was ſufficient; our young gentleman was neceſſitated to <hi>defer the day of retribution.</hi> They drank together a parting bottle; and he hoiſted ſail with far other ideas of Engliſh men and manners than thoſe with which he had caſt anchor.</p>

While Captain L—was concluding his recital, we were joined by Seymour and his Serafina, who had recently returned from an excurſion into the State of Vermont; and they related a little narrative alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in point; for the <hi>authenticity of which the Gleaner pledges his veracity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Captain A—, a Britiſh officer of family and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, was one of the many brave men, who, induced by a ſenſe of duty to their ſovereign, or erroneous ideas of the cauſe in which they engaged, armed and embodied themſelves for the purpoſe of exterminating from this new world all oppoſition to the mandates of a government, uſurping an unwarrantable ſovereignty, and peremptorily inſiſting on the power of binding, in all caſes whatſoever, a people ſeparated from them by the broad Atlantic, and who had never been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in their national or legally conſtituted aſſemblies.</p>
                     <p>Captain A—ſhared the fate of many of his aſſociates in the war; and after a number of marches and counter-marches, he was reduced to the neceſſity of ſurrendering to thoſe undiſciplined men, whom he had hardly deigned to conſider as ſoldiers. He was committed to the care of a Major B—, then ſtation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a metropolis, well known in the commercial world; this officer, from the dawn of the revolution, had glowed with a holy zeal in his country's cauſe; he was foremoſt in thoſe ranks who diſtinguiſhed themſelves in defence of that liberty, for which ſuch countleſs heroes fought and bled; and in addition to the rank of Major, he was inveſted with that of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary of Priſoners. Captain A—received every indulgence of which his ſituation was ſuſceptible; the Commiſſary knew how to appreciate his virtues, nor was any effort left unaſſayed, which it was imagined might render his captivity eaſy. Love, all potent love, ſeconded theſe benign arrangements, and the brave, the humane ſoldier was in every view a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered man; but he was received by the lovely ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his heart with enchanting lenity; honour was regent in her boſom, frankneſs dwelt on her lips, and
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:034162_0834_0FFC576173A3B618"/>
ſhe intuitively felt that ſhe might confide. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental ſanction awarded her election; the holy prieſt received their vows; and to a heart ſo faithfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted, the bonds of captivity became indeed ſilken.</p>
                     <p>Thus bleſt by friendſhip and by love, it cannot be matter of aſtoniſhment, that a ſtrong predilection in favour of America triumphed in his boſom; nor that he was with the foremoſt in offering up his ardent vows for the ſucceſs of her battling chiefs. It is true, when the final adjuſtment of the preliminaries of peace left the priſoner at liberty to return to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country, that, accompanied by his Honora, he departed with the reſt; but he departed with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined reſolution to return as ſoon as the poſture of his affairs would permit; and on his arrival in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he was ſo indefatigable in procuring thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements, which were neceſſary to the ſale both of his patrimonial and acquired eſtates, that he very ſpeedily re-embarked for this new world. His voyage was proſperous, and he arrived here, fluſhed with the moſt pleaſing expectations.</p>
                     <p>Diſpatch neceſſarily attends the tranſactions of an active and an ardent mind, and but a ſhort period elapſed, ere he poſſeſſed himſelf of a large tract of moſt excellent land in the Geneſſee country, where, taking his ſtand, he conceived the laudable reſolution of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting round him as many induſtrious, well diſpoſed and ſober citizens, as ſhould feel a freedom to embrace plans, which combined as their object, not only his own emolument, but the advancement of the country of his adoption, and of all thoſe individuals who might be diſpoſed to adopt his views. It is hardly poſſible to conceive of a ſituation more pleaſingly elevated than that of beſtowing protection, with the means of competency, and obſerving in return the ſpontaneous fruits of gratitude. Yet Captain A—was but half bleſt; for his moſt diligent reſearches could diſcover no veſtige of the friend, who in the night of adverſity had illumined, by his beneficent interpoſition, the thick darkneſs by which he was ſurrounded.</p>
                     <p>

Major B—, from the era which diſbanded the American army, had been involved in a ſeries of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes! Generous, perhaps to an extreme, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently humane, the neceſſities of his dependents were, <hi>in effect</hi> his own; he was wedded to a woman, lovely in her perſon, and ſuperior in her mind; his infant train, even in the eſtimation of a diſintereſted obſerver, were highly promiſing, and the care of an ancient and widowed mother devolved ſolely on him. No pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary reward awaited his ſervices; his pay had never exceeded his expenditures; and the cloſe of the war conſigned him to penury.</p>
                     <p>Would that his fate exhibited a ſolitary inſtance! Oh, America, America! where is the harveſt which thou haſt treaſured for thy war-worn chiefs? Is pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty the wreath which thou reſerveſt for the brow of thy ſoldiers? When will my country be fully exon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated from the charge of ingratitude? When will ſhe aſſign to deeds of worth a ſuitable and adequate compenſation?</p>
                     <p>Major B—poſſeſſed an undaunted ſpirit, and, with a view of warding off the impending evil, he had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up ſums of money, expecting that, by ſome propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious adventure, he ſhould be able to extricate himſelf from his embarraſſments. Hope was warm in his boſom, and he was ſanguine enough to imagine he ſhould be able to diſcharge the laſt farthing of his arrearages; but all his enterpriſes failed; the waves of misfortune ſwiftly ſucceeded each other; an arreſt terminated his career, and he was immured within the comfortleſs walls of a priſon. That he ſhould long remain in durance was, however, improbable; every ſentiment of humanity embodied for his releaſe, and his known integrity and irreproachable character pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his enlargement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet he was thrown pennyleſs on an unfeeling world; and the conſequent ſituation of thoſe beloved claimants, who poſſeſſed the deareſt right to his aid, produced ſorrows which harrowed up his ſoul; reaſon tottered on her throne, and he was driven to the verge of deſperation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="170" facs="unknown:034162_0836_0FFC575E55CF0DB8"/>
Reflection, however, at length produced a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly calm; the ſtorm of the paſſions ſubſided; and, reſolving to retire far from the knowledge of thoſe with whom he had once aſſociated, he took ſhelter on the extreme verge of a newly located townſhip, in the State of Maſſachuſetts, bordering on that of Vermont. Here, deſpoiled of every other reſource, and ſinking under a weight of calamity, his health impaired and his ſpirits broken, the brave, the benevolent officer, with a wife who would have added new luſtre to a diadem, with a lovely and intereſting family of children, and an aged mother—here, in this deſolate ſpot, renting a ſmall houſe on the country road, and putting up a bill for entertainment, he depended for his ſubſiſtence on the neceſſities and caprices of the paſſing traveller; while the ſcanty pittance he thus obtained, was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a variety of humiliating circumſtances, as to render the burden of life almoſt inſupportable!</p>
                     <p>It was on a fine evening in June, juſt as the parting rays of the ſun had darted his ſetting beams on the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern mountains, that this meritorious ſufferer indulged his corroding melancholy at the door of his cottage. Sorrow had well nigh obliterated from his memory all traces of Captain A—, and he remained in entire ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of his return to America. A ſuperb phaeton appeared in the road, and, conſcious of his ſituation, he ſhuddered at its approach. It ſtopped—a ſervant alighted, and a gentleman and lady iſſued from the carriage. Nothing of this kind had ever before made its appearance in that place, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> its vicinity, and the ſpirit of the care-worn ſoldier almoſt died within him. He ſurveyed his gueſts; and as he reverted to the inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of that proviſion which it was within his abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to make, the anguiſh of his mind was more than proportioned to the occaſion. It was too late, however, for the travellers to proceed farther that night; no other public houſe was within many miles; and with an air of ineffable benignity, the gentleman handed the lady in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cottage; but hardly had he paſſed the threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old, when, glancing the highly honoured Veteran, in a
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:034162_0837_0FFC5755A1C1B558"/>
voice of extacy, inmingled with aſtoniſhment, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed:</p>
                     <p>"<hi>Great and good God! who do I ſee?</hi>—Major B—, is it poſſible, or do the viſions of the night once more mock my wiſhes? Tell me, are you indeed my incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable friend?" He haſtened forward—in a moment they were locked in each others arms; the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate man almoſt gaſped for breath; to reſpond was not immediately in his power. At length, however, he articulated—"<hi>Yes, yes, I am indeed your once happy—now deſolate friend. My proſpects</hi>—<hi>where are they? Fled</hi>—<hi>gone forever.</hi>" "Cloud not," interrupted Captain A—, (for the feelings of the reader have doubtleſs already recognized the grateful Briton) "could not, I charge you, the happineſs of this unexpected meeting, by unavailing reflection; but, embracing henceforward the ſame hopes and fears, let us, on this memorable evening, reciprocate vows of eternal amity, and let us mutually conſent to put it beyond the power of fate again to ſeparate us."</p>
                     <p>The expreſſions of Mrs. B—and Mrs. A—were even more impaſſioned than thoſe of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; they had been attached in early life—and the night was ſpent in mutual congratulation, mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citals, and reiterated profeſſions of undiminiſhed and unalterable regards, while the travellers failed not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly to bleſs that curioſity, which, leading them to make the tour of the eaſtern States, had thus beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them the objects whom they had ſo long una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailingly purſued.</p>
                     <p>To penury, and all its gloomy attendants, Major B—has now bid adieu. Captain A—preſented him with a deed of gift, conveying to him, and his heirs for ever, as a patrimonial inheritance, one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand acres of the beſt of his land. Two thouſand more are his, at half the price for which they are ſold to original purchaſers; and he is to diſpoſe of theſe to the beſt poſſible advantage. His eldeſt daughter is adopted into the family of his patron, and treated in every reſpect as a child of his houſe; he is furniſhed
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:034162_0838_0FFC57541E460BB8"/>
with ſufficient ſums to remove his family; a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious habitation is erected for him on his own grounds; again he baſks in the full meridian of ſociety and of friendſhip, and the ſun of proſperity gilds the evening of his days. The ſenſations of his ſoul are frequently too big for utterance; he gazes on his matchleſs bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, and the tear guſhes in his eye; ardent affection, and grateful admiration are impreſſed on his manly features, while geſtures, abundantly more expreſſive than the moſt emphatic language, pourtray the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of his ſoul.</p>
                     <p>His venerable parent lived only to ſee the clouds of adverſity diſperſe; her parting ſpirit bleſt the reful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent beam of light, and haſtened, without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining regret, to the paradiſe of its GOD.</p>

                     <p>YES, it is poſſible, there may perhaps have been individuals, who, in the moſt extenſive ſenſe of the word, have merited the appellation, <hi>Citizens of the World</hi>—whoſe ſtrong minds, ſtruggling ſucceſsfully againſt every view which hath not received a general contour, and proſtrating at the ſhrine of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the aggregate, have conducted as if the vaſt globe was their country, the venerable pair o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Yet, I take leave to aſk the reflecting and intelligent reader, if this divine expanſion is not, ſtrictly ſpeaking, the property of Deity? and whether thoſe who affect his attributes are not guilty of arrogant aſſumption? Man is a limited being; his movements are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed

within narrow bounds; his eye can take in, at a ſingle view, but a ſmall portion of our world: If he would tranſport himſelf from place to place, his progreſs, impeded by a variety of incumbrances, muſt be gradual; and if he would traverſe the globe, he muſt devote to the arduous enterprize the revolution of many ſucceeding months. Every individual is nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſarily deſcended from a particular family; nature implants her attachments, and the hand of violence can alone uproot them.</p>
                     <p>The Deity views, at a ſingle glance, the univerſe outſpread before him—he is not confined to time, or place: Every created being is the offspring of his commanding <hi>fiat;</hi> and the unbounded diffuſion of his copious and impartial regards, is therefore an effect neceſſarily reſulting from a great and Omnipotent Cauſe. When we are diſencumbered from theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial machines, and move with the velocity of ſpirit, the probability is, that we ſhall partake more eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially the properties of our Divine Original. But dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent diſpenſations authorize a varied economy; and the difficulty (and, in almoſt every inſtance, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility) of ſurmounting inherent and local attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may, perhaps, like every other prominent fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of nature, be attended with its coeval advantages.</p>
                     <p>"I cannot, for my ſoul," ſaid Albinus, as arm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der arm he croſſed State-ſtreet with Degeneus—"I cannot, for my ſoul, obliterate my local partialities. Born in London, the name of an Engliſhman operates as a kind of charm; I involuntarily yield him a moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of my affection; and I am better pleaſed to meet a good character from that country, than from any other part of the globe." I would adviſe Albinus not to attempt the extermination of his local partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: In other words, I would adviſe him not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the liſts as a combatant againſt <hi>parent Nature.</hi> Hath not the preferable love of country, hath not fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily attachments their advantages? In what period of the world was not the real patriot held in admiration? and is not patriotiſm another word for a zealous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:034162_0840_0FFC574F9C56AF38"/>
to the intereſts of our country? It is certainly laudable to cultivate and invigorate a ſpirit of <hi>general philanthropy;</hi> but ſtill, is it not according to the courſe of things, that the ardent glow ſhould embrace "<hi>friends, parents, neighbours, firſt?</hi>" until, in a regular progreſſion, circles thus formed ſucceed each other, while nature views complacent, the order and gradual advances of her children.—Let us pauſe to inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate for a moment.</p>
                     <p>The fact advanced is, I preſume, ſelf-evident; and I conceive its utility is as clearly demonſtrable. The approbation of thoſe with whom we are connected, frequently furniſhes the moſt powerful incentive to virtue. Every local preference produces a motive to proper and becoming actions; they continually ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as ſo many mentors, ſuggeſting and nerving the purpoſes of virtue. Shall I wound the tender boſom of her to whom I am indebted for my exiſtence? Shall I transfix the paternal feelings of that white-headed man, who, from my firſt dawn of being, has watched over me for good? Shall I outrage the manly tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which my brothers have cultivated toward me? Shall I call a bluſh into the cheek of my ſiſters? Shall I do violence to the confidence of friendſhip, or cover with confuſion the countenance of my fellow-citizens? Theſe are conſiderations which ſometimes operate on the man, keeping him ſteady to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements of rectitude, even when the agency of the vicegerent in his breaſt is ſuſpended, or becomes inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual in its adminiſtration.</p>
                     <p>Are we removed from that ſpot of earth, where firſt the purple ſtream commenced its vital flow? the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which echoing fame will waft to thoſe dear na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive haunts, becomes, in our eſtimation, an object of the greateſt magnitude. What ideas will the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch and ſuch an action originate? How will my connexions, who ſtill continue there, be affected by ſuch a particular ſtep? and what will they think of my conduct, on any occaſion, on which all the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of my ſoul may have been called into exerciſe?
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:034162_0841_0FFC574CCF1E2DA0"/>
Thus I am induced to think, that a venerating attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the opinions, and a ſolicitude for the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of thoſe with whom we were early in the habits of amity, have a tendency to originate and confirm a regular ſyſtem of propriety, to eſtabliſh a ſcrupulous accuracy of conduct, and frequently to operate as the taliſman of every laudable exertion. I am not a friend to the <hi>deſpotiſm</hi> of prejudice; I would diſcountenance <hi>undue</hi> partialities; and I contend only for the utility of <hi>prominent</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſhing,</hi> not <hi>excluſive,</hi> regards. He, whoſe range is the univerſe, will, too, probably, become alſo an itinerant in virtue; or at leaſt, the diſſipation of his views may gradually conſign his merit to oblivion. I do not aſſert, that my ideas may not be erroneous; I pretend not to fill the chair of infallibility; but it is, perhaps, well to put the beſt face on a <hi>neceſſity,</hi> which ſeems compriſed in the very complexure of our nature.</p>
                     <p>Local attachments, we have ſaid, (and we believe, with a few exceptions, it will be found true) inſinuate themſelves into, and become interwoven with, the very fibres of our exiſtence; and their invincibility, when it is remembered that we are under the direction of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Wiſdom, is a commanding proof of their util<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. Much time hath elapſed ſince I bid adieu to my native place; but neither years nor diſtance can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate the ſenſations which cluſter round reflection, as I contemplate that, <hi>to me,</hi> intereſting ſpot. It was the ſcene of my early pleaſures; and the recollection of its dear domeſtic haunts are right precious to my ſoul. There, too, were paſſed the moſt agonizing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I have ever yet endured. The authors of my being have long ſince ſlept in the duſt; but their aſhes hallow that earth, which will ever be entitled to, and which will ſtill poſſeſs, my veneration. Misfortunes elouded my youth—my path was marked by ſorrow. Many painful events have conſpired to throw a gloom over the place of my birth—I would not return to it—I would not again commence a dweller there; but my moſt ardent benedictions will ever reſt upon it;
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:034162_0842_0FFC574746241908"/>
and the affectionate attachment and approbation of its inhabitants will ſtill conſtitute one of the principal ſources of my complacency. I rejoice in its proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and I cannot hear it named with applauſe, but my heart acknowledges an accompanying glow of ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction.</p>
                     <p>The love of our country has been deemed a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal paſſion; and ſtrong muſt be the intereſt that can ſuperſede its operations. It is obſerved, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of every climate, and the ſubjects of every State and kingdom, are ſo ſtrongly operated on by local at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments, and their conſequent partialities, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their own ſpot of earth the beſt of all poſſible ſituations. The elegant ſongſtreſs of the Albion world does not paint too highly, when ſhe ſays:

                     </p>
                     <p>Inſtances have been known, where a fondneſs for the ſcenes of infantile life, and the ſportive days of boyhood, have enabled perſons, in an advanced ſtage of their exiſtence, to encounter numerous difficulties, for the purpoſe of viſiting a ſpot, which fancy hath continued to paint in all the vivid colours beſtowed on it by the glowing imagination of youth. It is true, if, urged by tender recollection, they quit their <hi>more</hi> commodious accommodations, the probability is, that, rendered peeviſh and frigid by years, and not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the viciſſitudes of time, the termination of a fatiguing jaunt may generally give them expreſſions and feelings, ſimilar to thoſe of Doctor Johnſon, when, departing from the city of London, he devoted a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his time to the pleaſingly remembered haunts of Litchfield. Yet, I conceive, the multiplication of inſtances of this kind will not break the charm: The

faſcinating influence of juvenile pleaſures will ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; they will take poſſeſſion of the heart with pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompaniments; and <hi>memory</hi> will ſtill revert to the native lawns, the native hills, groves, meadows, rocks, and ſtreams, with all thoſe correſponding rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which thrilled the boſom, when firſt the dawn of admiration awakened every ſenſe to the ſweet enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm of new-born rapture.</p>
                     <p>Yes, the <hi>amor patrioe</hi> is a natural, a beneficial, and a laudable paſſion—May it ever glow with Decian energy in the Columbian boſom—May we continue to regard, with filial veneration, our country's Warriors, her Patriots, and her Stateſmen—and may we enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, with fervid exultation, thoſe able proficients in excellence, who daily throng the ſplendid paths of fame!</p>

                        <hi>Naturally</hi> and unalterably attached to this New World, I love and revere its Conſtitution, its laws, and its government; and I would obliterate every circumſtance that might either immediately, or eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, envelop in clouds its dignity, its honour, or that national magnitude, to which it is ſo rapidly advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Columbia has been accuſed of ingratitude! and of exerciſing an impolitic and penurious economy, in her pecuniary rewards, to thoſe to whom ſhe has dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated the moſt important truſts! Poſſibly, Uzza like, I may be actuated by undue officiouſneſs, when I would aſſay to put forth my hand to touch the tottering ark; and yet I cannot forbear to mourn the fate of thoſe unrewarded veterans, who are conſigned to all the glooms neceſſarily attendant on blaſted expectations; and who, wounded by ingratitude and neglect, are at this moment ſtruggling with thoſe depreſſing evils, which are the appendages of diſappointment, penury, and conſequent regret. And is that arrangement, I would aſk, which appropriates to <hi>firſt rate abilities,</hi> for exertions that require <hi>every faculty of the mind, and all of life,</hi> only a ſcanty pittance, that will ſcarcely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the articles neceſſary to exiſtence, either honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or judicious?

                     <p>I am perſonally acquainted with ſome gentlemen, highly meritorious as individuals, whoſe abilities are ſplendid, whoſe integrity is without a blemiſh, and whoſe accurate diſcharge of the truſt repoſed in them hath met with univerſal approbation: Yet theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen have been compelled to relinquiſh their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, merely becauſe the emoluments annexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, were inadequate to the ſupport of their families! Devoted as I am to my country, I will repeat, that I lament the neceſſity which is multiplying inſtances of this deſcription! and with all humility I aſk—Is it not worthy the wiſdom of government to conſider, whether a remedy for this growing evil is not within the limits of its authority?</p>

                     <p>It will ever remain an incontrovertible fact, that, while the underſtandings of men are diſſimilar, they can never contemplate perſons or things in the ſame point of view; and, if they would learn to diſſent with moderation, and diſcard from their vocabulary a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, for which, madneſs only can apologize, this world of ours would be a much more tolerable place of reſidence, than, in the preſent diſpoſition of party, it is likely to become.</p>
                     <p>It is true, I cannot regard a <hi>pure unmixed democracy</hi> as that preciſe form of government, which is, in <hi>all its parts,</hi> the moſt friendly to the beſt intereſts of mankind. I cannot think that the <hi>art</hi> of legiſlation is within the knowledge of <hi>every man.</hi> He whoſe mind is <hi>filled</hi> with agricultural or commercial purſuits, whoſe education and ſubſequent occupation has been <hi>principally</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a particular buſineſs or profeſſion, cannot, I have conceived, obtain ſufficient leiſure to inveſtigate, with the requiſite attention, the great <hi>art of government;</hi> and, as I have regarded power, in <hi>unſteady</hi> and <hi>unſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> hands, as a great evil, ſo I have called that man miſguided, and an invader of the public peace, who, advancing the doctrine of claims, hath inflated the fanciful and ſuperficial with erroneous ideas of retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prerogatives, which, by their own free ſuffrages, they had voluntarily relinquiſhed. He who violently or inſidiouſly deſtroys the unqueſtionably neceſſary ſeries of ſubordination, who produces the various claſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of mankind as uſurpers on thoſe orders, which, in the ſcale of being, take rank above them, muſt inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably throw a nation or a ſtate into ſtrong convulſions; nor, will reaſon authorize ſuch an attempt, ſave in the laſt extremity. When the officers of government are choſen—when they are legally inaugurated, and have, in due form, taken their appropriate places, I am free to confeſs that I adopt, in an unqualified ſenſe, the

                     <p>I confeſs that a <hi>Federal repreſentative Republic</hi> is the government of my election, and under the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States of Columbia I would chooſe to paſs my days; yet, I poſſeſs no right to impoſe my ſentiments on my brethren; nor can I be juſtified in flaſhing the <hi>lie in his face,</hi> who would maintain op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite principles. A paragraph is produced in to-day's paper, which I conceive fundamentally and totally wrong; but, is it not poſſible that the veracity of the writer may, nevertheleſs, remain unimpeachable? may he not have been miſinformed, and under the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an error, in which circumſtances, beyond his control, may have involved him? may he not have given preciſely that repreſentation which appeared to him literally true? and, would it not beſt conſiſt with the character of the rational man, to reſpond with mildneſs, and that candour which generally points the luminous rays of conviction?</p>
                     <p>Every ſenſe of propriety is lacerated by the ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemanlike warmth, with which a certain claſs of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical writers handle each other; and, for myſelf, when purſuing my vocation, in my accuſtomed routine of duty, I eſſay to <hi>glean,</hi> in thoſe copious fields, the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered grain which may perchance remain, my feelings are too often barbarouſly mangled by the briars and thorns with which they abound. If great national queſtions are to be agitated, why not enliſt under the banners of reaſon, and manage the important propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with cool and temperate diſcuſſion? Why not light the torch of inveſtigation, and, after deliberately and minutely ſcanning one by one, circumſtances and poſitions, why not calmly ſubmit the deciſion to the unbiaſſed ſuffrages of a great, an enlightened, and a free people? Why muſt the reputation of <hi>individuals</hi> be blackened, and ſentiments and opinions arraigned,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:034162_0847_0FFC573A12015448"/>
altogether foreign from the ſubject in debate? Why is <hi>philoſophy</hi> maligned, and the <hi>caution of wiſdom</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliouſly attributed to the moſt unworthy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing of motives? Why is firm, unyielding integrity, warm and glowing in the common cauſe, accuſed of the temerity which marks the ariſtocrat—of abſurdly aſpiring to a monarchical eſtabliſhment, and of thoſe unwarrantable views which the ſoul of rectitude abhors?</p>
                     <p>If there exiſts reaſons why particular men are not competent or eligible to certain offices of ſtate, would it not be noble, and in the true Horatian ſpirit, to ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice <hi>private feelings to the public weal;</hi> and, heroically appearing even againſt the deareſt of our friends, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the public eye, thoſe unpropitious features, or pernicious plans, which, endangering the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, unqueſtionably render the candidates, embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch adverſe ſentiments unworthy the confidence of their conſtituents? If the reprehenſible particulars were, with all requiſite decency and honeſt frankneſs, boldly pointed out; if chapter and verſe were cited; and if <hi>the name</hi> of the accuſer was affixed to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment, the matter then properly introduced to the public mind, would be in an honourable train, free inquiry would ſucceed, and truth thus placed within our reach, the creſt fallen culprit would ſink to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion which he merits; while the hero, who, influenced by no other motive than zeal for the public cauſe, riſked the eternal enmity and gave a mortal blow to the reputation, perhaps of a friend, would be crowned with thoſe unfading honours which ſhould ever be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the real patriot.</p>
                     <p>It is to be regretted that the <hi>anonymous defamer,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though adorned with news-paporial diſtinctions, ever obtains the ſmalleſt conſideration. Was the dignity of legiſlation mine, it ſhould ſtand conſpicuous in my code of laws, that every <hi>unclaimed</hi> and <hi>unſupported</hi> alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, intended as derogatory to a character, ſhould be eſteemed as operating, in all reſpects, to the <hi>building</hi> up, <hi>elevating</hi> and <hi>confirming ſaid character;</hi> and, did calumny thus <hi>defeat its own purpoſe,</hi> only the diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted,

                        <hi>Diſorganizers of government, fomenters of confuſion, friends to anarchy.</hi>—Diſcarding all theſe irritating epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets of reproach, I would rather denominate that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable claſs of citizens which, at preſent, conſtitute the democratic party, <hi>miſguided ſons of liberty.</hi> It is matter of ſerious mortification, that we cannot exoner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the advocates of the cauſe of our election from the odium of unjuſtifiable and indecent warmth; but, when, as if no human delinquent could furniſh an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſufficiently atrocious, the arch incendiary, who filled the beautifully tranquil walks of paradiſe with diſobedience, diſorder, and conſequent death, is ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned from his Tartarean domains, as the prototype of combinations of men who certainly enrol in their catalogues, names which are an honour to human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—when, I ſay, ſuch intemperate and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory inſtances of aggravation are notorious, the vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of reaſon muſt bluſh for the unwarrantable out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage which is thus done to virtue, in the perſons of thoſe whoſe lives have been ſquared by her dictates. We are deſirous of ſeeing virtue and vice, truth and error, delineated in the ſtrongeſt colours: but, let them not be blended with the rage of faction, nor deformed by the frenzy of paſſion; let reaſon hold the pencil; let the ſtyle of painting be that of veracity; let the tints be accurately combined, and meliorated by can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; let the diſpoſition of light and ſhade evince the touches of a maſter—of a maſter thoroughly informed and perfect, as well in execution as deſign; and let the ſtriking exactneſs of the reſemblance ſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous.</p>
                     <p>We pity the mind which is not ſufficiently expanſive to embrace the man of worth, whatever his political,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:034162_0849_0FFC573282FEEFF0"/>
or even his religious ſentiments may be; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the preſent head of the Columbian Union concentrates in his own great and virtuous mind every excellence which can adorn humanity, it yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to acknowledge the luſtre of thoſe gems which demonſtrably irradiate the boſoms of ſurrounding worthies? We thank God that the ſuperabounding weight of merit abundantly preponderates in the Fed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſcale; but we would be therewith content; and, ceaſing to detract from the virtue of individuals, who <hi>lament what they eſteem ruinous in the adminiſtration of our government, or even of the Conſtitution itſelf,</hi> we would allow them all the applauſe to which they are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertibly entitled. Nor need we have recourſe to unrighteous methods; the deciſion is in proper hands, and the majority will entwine in their inveſtigations that wiſdom which ſhall point out the man of virtue as a ſucceſſor to the auguſt Father of this younger world, which ſhall raiſe to the preſidential chair, him whoſe brave, undaunted ſpirit, unappalled in the midſt of danger, hath riſen ſuperior to every trial. <hi>The oft proved friend of his country's cauſe,</hi> who, unawed by the acrimonious breath of faction, and unbiaſſed by the adulatory ſtrains of intereſted men, will purſue the ſhining path of rectitude.</p>
                     <p>Let us then ceaſe by unmanly reproaches to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode the feſtering wounds of diſcontent; we are indeed brethren, and contention is therefore moſt improper! It will never ceaſe to be true, that <hi>divided</hi> we ſhall fall an eaſy prey to an invading foe, and that our bond of union is the taliſman of our proſperity. We would rather hear an enumeration of the virtues of our oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents than attend to a diſquiſition of errors, which <hi>our political ideas render ſelf evident.</hi> And prominent in the liſt of meritorious characters, who have become the victims of malevolence, we diſtinguiſh the reſpectable name of J—s!

Are we not, we would aſk, the workmanſhip of the Supreme Architect of heaven and earth?

                     <p>THE reader is requeſted to conſider the four ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding numbers as ſupplementary to an Eſſay, which made its appearance, ſome years ſince, in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical publication of a miſcellaneous nature. The particular paper to which I advert, was entitled, <hi>The Equality of the Sexes;</hi> and, however well I may think of that compoſition, as I do not conceive that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is exhauſted, I have thought proper, treading in the ſame path, to ſet about collecting a few hints, which may ſerve as additional, illuſtrative, or orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.</p>
                     <p>And, firſt, by way of exordium, I take leave to congratulate my fair country-women, on the happy revolution which the few paſt years has made in their favour; that in theſe infant republics, where, within my remembrance, the uſe of the needle was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal attainment which was thought <hi>neceſſary</hi> for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the lovely proficient is now permitted to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate a moiety of her time to ſtudies of a more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and elevating nature. Female academies are every where eſtabliſhing, and right pleaſant is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation to my ear.</p>
                     <p>Yes, in this younger world, "the Rights of Women" begin to be underſtood; we ſeem, at length, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to do juſtice to THE SEX; and, improving on the opinions of a Wollſtonecraft, we are ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the <hi>quantity,</hi> as well as <hi>quality,</hi> of mind. The younger part of the female world have now an ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable prize put into their hands; and it depends on the riſing generation to refute a ſentiment, which, ſtill retaining its advocates, grounds its arguments on the incompatibility of the preſent enlarged plan of female

education, with thoſe neceſſary occupations, that muſt ever be conſidered as proper to the department and compriſed in the duties of a judiciouſly inſtructed and elegant woman; and, if our daughters will combine their efforts, converts to the new regulations will every day multiply among us. To argue againſt facts, is indeed contending with both wind and tide; and, borne down by accumulating examples, conviction of the utility of the preſent plans will pervade the public mind, and not a diſſenting voice will be heard.</p>
                     <p>I may be accuſed of enthuſiaſm; but ſuch is my confidence in THE SEX, that I expect to ſee our young women forming a new era in female hiſtory. They will oppoſe themſelves to every trivial and unworthy monopolizer of time; and it will be apparent, that the adorning their perſons is not with them a <hi>primary</hi> object. They will know how to appreciate perſonal advantages; and, conſidering them as beſtowed by Nature, or Nature's God, they will hold them in due eſtimation: Yet, conſcious that they confer no <hi>intrinſic</hi> excellence on the <hi>temporary</hi> poſſeſſor, their admeaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>real virtue</hi> will be entirely diveſted of all thoſe <hi>prepoſſeſſing ideas,</hi> which originate in a beautiful exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior. The noble expanſion conferred by a liberal ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation will teach them <hi>humility;</hi> for it will give them a glance of thoſe vaſt tracts of knowledge which they can never explore, until they are accommodated with far other powers than thoſe at preſent aſſigned them; and they will contemplate their removal to a higher order of beings, as a deſirable event.</p>
                     <p>Mild benignity, with all the modeſt virtues, and ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſexual grace—theſe they will carefully cultivate; for they will have <hi>learned,</hi> that in no character they can ſo effectually charm, as in that in which nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them the <hi>pre-eminence.</hi> They will accuſtom themſelves to reflection; they will inveſtigate accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and reaſon will point their concluſions; Yet they will not be aſſuming; the characteriſtic trait will ſtill remain; and retiring ſweetneſs will inſure them that conſideration and reſpect, which they do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume

Thinking juſtly will not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their minds, and refine their ideas; but it will correct their diſpoſitions, humanize their feelings, and preſent them the <hi>friends of their ſpecies. The beauteous boſom will no more become a lurking-place for invidious and rancorous paſſions;</hi> but the mild temperature of the ſoul will be evinced by the benign and equal tenour of their lives. Their manners will be unembarraſſed; and, ſtudious to ſhun even the <hi>ſemblance of pedantry,</hi> they will be careful to give to their moſt ſyſtematic ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and deductions, an unaffected and natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. They will rather <hi>queſtion</hi> than <hi>aſſert;</hi> and they will make their communications on a ſuppoſition, that the point in diſcuſſion has rather <hi>eſcaped the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory</hi> of thoſe with whom they converſe, <hi>than that it was never imprinted there.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, that every faculty of their minds will be occaſionally engroſſed by the moſt momentous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; but as often as <hi>neceſſity</hi> or <hi>propriety</hi> ſhall render it incumbent on them, they will <hi>cheerfully</hi> accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date themſelves to the more <hi>humble duties</hi> which their ſituation impoſes. When their ſphere of action is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, when they become wives and mothers, they will fill with honour the parts allotted them. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, theoretically, with the nature of their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and experimentally with themſelves, they will not expect to meet, in wedlock, with thoſe faultleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, who ſo frequently iſſue, armed at all points, from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They will learn properly to eſtimate; they will look, with pity's ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eye, on the natural frailties of thoſe whom they elect partners for life; and they will regard their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues with that ſweet complacency, which is ever an attendant on a predilection founded on love, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily combining eſteem. As mothers, they will aſſume with alacrity their arduous employment, and they will cheerfully bend to its various departments. They will be primarily ſolicitous to fulfil, in <hi>every inſtance,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can <hi>juſtly</hi> be denominated <hi>duty;</hi> and thoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, which have heretofore been devoted to frivolity,

                     <p>Such, I predict, will be the daughters of Columbia; and my gladdened ſpirit rejoices in the proſpect. A ſenſible and informed woman—companionable and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious—poſſeſſing alſo a facility of temper, and united to a congenial mind—bleſt with competency—and rearing to maturity a promiſing family of children—Surely, the wide globe cannot produce a ſcene more truly intereſting. See! the virtues are embodied—the domeſtic duties appear in their place, and they are all fulfilled—morality is ſyſtematized by religion, and ſublimed by devotion—every movement is the offspring of elegance, and their manners have received the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poliſh. A reciprocation of good offices, and a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual deſire to pleaſe, uniformly diſtinguiſhes the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals of this enchanting ſociety—their converſation, refined and elevated, partakes the fire of genius, while it is pointed by information; and they are ambitious of ſelecting ſubjects, which, by throwing around humanity, <hi>in its connexion,</hi> additional luſtre, may implant a new motive for gratitude, and teach them to anticipate the rich fruition of that immortality which they boaſt. Such is the family of reaſon—of reaſon, cultivated and adorned by literature.</p>

                        <hi>The idea of the incapability</hi> of women, is, we conceive, in this <hi>enlightened age,</hi> totally <hi>inadmiſſible;</hi> and we have concluded, that eſtabliſhing the <hi>expediency</hi> of admitting them to ſhare the bleſſings of equality, will remove every obſtacle to their advancement. In proportion as nations have progreſſed in the arts of civilization, the value of THE SEX hath been underſtood, their rank in the ſcale of being aſcertained, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in ſociety acknowledged.

well atteſted facts,</hi> which the ſtudent of female annals hath carefully compiled.</p>
                     <p>Women, circumſcribed in their education within very narrow limits, and conſtantly depreſſed by their occupations, have, nevertheleſs, tinged the cheek of manhood with a guilty ſuffuſion, for a puſillanimous capitulation with the enemies of their country. Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the loom and the diſtaff, they have beheld, with indignation, their huſbands and their ſons flee in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: With claſped hands, and determined reſolution, they have placed themſelves in their paths, obſtructing their paſſage, and inſiſting, with heroic firmneſs, on their immediate return to death or conqueſt! They have anxiouſly examined the dead bodies of their ſlaughtered ſons; and if the fatal wounds were receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in front, thus evincing that they have bravely faced the foe, the fond recollection of their valour has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſource of conſolation, and they have ſung a <hi>requiem</hi> to their ſorrows! Women, in the heat of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have mounted the rampart with undaunted cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, arreſted the progreſs of the foe, and bravely reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued their beſieged dwellings! They have ſucceſsfully oppoſed themſelves to tyranny and the galling yoke of oppreſſion! Aſſembling in crowds, they have arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves for the combat—they have mingled amid the battling ranks—they have fought heroically—and their well-timed and well-concerted meaſures have emancipated their country! They have hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtroke of death in its moſt frightful form; and they have ſubmitted to bonds and impriſonment, for the redemption of their captive huſbands!</p>
                     <p>The character of the Spartan women is marked with uncommon firmneſs. At the ſhrine of patriotiſm they immolated nature. Undaunted bravery and unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached honour, was, in their eſtimation, far beyond affection. The name of Citizen poſſeſſed, for them, greater charms than that of Mother; and ſo highly did they prize the warrior's meed, that they are ſaid to have ſhed tears of joy over the bleeding bodies of their wounded ſons!</p>

When Europe and Aſia were infeſted by armed multitudes, who, emigrating for purpoſes of devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſettlement, perpetrated the moſt ferocious acts, among all thoſe various tribes of unprincipled invaders, <hi>no diſcriminating line ſeems to have marked the ſexes;</hi> wives ſubmitted to ſimilar hardſhips with their huſbands; equally they braved the impending dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and their efforts and their ſufferings were the ſame: Nor can their habits of endurance and patient fortitude admit a rational doubt.</p>
                     <p>The women of Hungary have rendered themſelves aſtoniſhingly conſpicuous in their wars againſt the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Empire—But proofs abound; and numerous actions might be produced to evince, that courage is by no means <hi>excluſively</hi> a maſculine virtue. Women have frequently diſplayed an intrepidity, not to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by men—neither is their bravery the impulſe of the moment. They not only, when trained by educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inured by ſubſequent habit, riſe ſuperior to the fears of death; but, with unimpaſſioned and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date compoſure, <hi>they can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

They have achieved the moſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing adventures; indulgencies have been extended to them on the well-fought field; and they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired with the weapons of death in their hands! Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by devotional zeal, and ſtimulated by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime expectation of an opening heaven, and a glorious immortality, they have ruſhed into the flames, have aſcended the ſcaffold, have ſuffered the diſmemberment of their bodies, have ſubmitted to the tortures of diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and to the moſt excruciating racks, in defence of truth! nor hath the voice of murmuring or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint eſcaped their lips!</p>
                     <p>Women have publickly harangued on religion—they have preſented themſelves as diſputants—they have boldly ſupported their tenets—they have been raiſed to the chair of philoſophy, and of law—they have written fluently in Greek, and have read with great

facility the Hebrew language. Youth and beauty, adorned with every feminine grace, and poſſeſſing em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inently the powers of rhetoric, have pathetically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured the mitred fathers and the Chriſtian monarchs to arm themſelves for the utter extirpation of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies of their holy religion.</p>
                     <p>In the days of knight-errantry, females, elevated by the importance with which they were inveſted, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminated unerringly between the virtues and the vices, ſtudiouſly cultivating the one, and endeavouring to exterminate the other; and their attainments <hi>equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the heroiſm of their admirers;</hi> their boſoms glowed with ſentiments as ſublime as thoſe they originated; generoſity marked their elections; the impaſſioned feelings, the burſt of tenderneſs, were invariably blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with honour; and every expreſſion, every move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was deſcriptive of the general enthuſiaſm. Pride, heroiſm, extravagant attachments; theſe were common to both ſexes. Great enterprizes, bold ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, incredible bravery—in every thing the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men partook the colour of the times; and their taſte and their judgment were exactly conformed. Thus the ſexes are congenial; they are copyiſts of each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and their opinions and their habits are elevated or degraded, animated or depreſſed, by preciſely the ſame circumſtances.</p>
                     <p>The Northern nations have generally been in the habit of venerating the Female Sex. Conſtantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in bending the bow, in exploring the haunts of thoſe animals, who were the victims of their pleaſures and their paſſions, or of urging againſt their ſpecies the miſſive ſhafts of death, they nevertheleſs baniſhed their ferocity, and aſſumed the mildeſt manners, when aſſociating with their mothers, their ſiſters, their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, or their wives. In their ample foreſts, their athletic frames and ſinewy arms were nerved for bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, while the ſmiles of ſome lovely woman were the meed of valour; and the hero who aſpired to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the beautiful arbitreſs of his fate, author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:034162_0861_0FFC5714EBD7D4C8"/>
his wiſhes, and eſtabliſhed his pretenſions, by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inent virtue, and a long ſeries of unbroken attentions.</p>
                     <p>A perſuaſion, that the common Father of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe manifeſts himſelf more readily to females than to males, has, at one period or another, obtained, more or leſs, in every diviſion of the globe. The Germans, the Britons, and the Scandinavians—from theſe the ſuppoſition received an eaſy credence. The Grecian women delivered oracles—the Romans venerated the Sibyls—among the people of God, the Jewiſh women propheſied—the predictions of the Egyptian matron were much reſpected—and we are aſſured, that the moſt barbarous nations referred to their females, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they fancied beyond the reach of human efforts: And hence we find women in poſſeſſion of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of religion, the <hi>arcana</hi> of phyſic, and the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of incantation. Writers aſſert, that ſeveral nations have aſcribed to women the gift of preſcience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that they poſſeſſed qualities approximating to divinity; and the ferocious German, emboſomed in his native woods, renders a kind of devotional reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Female Sex.</p>
                     <p>Such is the character of thoſe periods, when women were inveſted with <hi>undue elevation;</hi> and the reverſe preſents THE SEX in a ſtate of humiliation, altogether as unwarrantable. The females among the ſavages of our country, are repreſented as ſubmitting to the moſt melancholy and diſtreſſing oppreſſion; ſlaves to the ferocious paſſions and irregular appetites of thoſe tyrannical uſurpers, who brutally and cruelly outrage their feelings. They encounter for their ſupport, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible hardſhips and toils, inſomuch that, weary of their own wretched exiſtence, the women on the banks of the Oronoko, urged by compaſſion, not unfrequently ſmother the female infant in the hour of its birth; and ſhe who hath attained ſufficient fortitude to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this <hi>maternal</hi> act, eſteems herſelf entitled to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional reſpect. Commodore Byron, in his account of the inhabitants of South-America, informs us, that the men exerciſe a moſt deſpotic authority over their
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:034162_0862_0FFC5710E9243618"/>
wives, whom they conſider in the ſame view they do any other part of their property, and diſpoſe of them accordingly: Even their common treatment of them is cruel; for, although the toil and hazard of procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing food lies entirely on the women, yet they are not ſuffered to touch any part of it, till their imperious maſters are ſatisfied, and then he aſſigns them their portion, which is generally very ſcanty, and ſuch as he has not an appetite for, himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus have the Sex continued the ſport of contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies; unnaturally ſubjected to extremes; alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in the mount of exaltation, and in the valley of unmerited degradation. Is it wonderful, then, that they evince ſo little ſtability of character? Rather, is it not aſtoniſhing, that their attainments are ſo numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſo conſiderable? Turning over the annals of different ages, we have ſelected a number of names, which we purpoſe, in our next Eſſay, to cite, as vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of THE SEX's merit; nor can we doubt, that their united ſuffrages will, on a candid inveſtigation, effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually eſtabliſh the female right to that <hi>equality with their brethren, which, it is conceived, is aſſigned them in the Order of Nature.</hi>

by the circumſtances and the perſons, but the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is the ſame." This celebrated and truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable biographer has yielded every thing that we wiſh; and the teſtimony of ſo nice a diſtinguiſher muſt be conſidered as a very powerful auxiliary.</p>
                     <p>It is not our purpoſe to analyze the properties of mind; we are inclined to think, that accurately to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate, or draw the intellectual line, is beyond the power of the beſt informed metaphyſician within the purlieus of humanity. Beſides, as we write for the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and as it is notorious that a number of <hi>well atteſted facts</hi> have abundantly more weight with <hi>the multitude,</hi> than the fineſt ſpun ſyſtems which ever iſſued from the archives of theory, we ſhall proceed to ſummon our witneſſes, arranging their teſtimonies with as much or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as the curſory turning over a number of volumes, to which a deficiency in memory neceſſitates us to apply, will permit; and here, (leſt the patience of our readers ſhould reluct at the idea of the mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley circle, to which they may apprehend they are to be introduced) we take leave to inform them, that we ſhall be careful to abridge, as much as poſſible, the copious depoſitions which may preſent.</p>
                     <p>Many centuries have revolved, ſince the era, when writers of eminence, giving a catalogue of celebrated women, have made the number to amount to eight hundred and forty-five: From theſe, and ſucceeding atteſtators, we ſhall ſelect a few, not perhaps the moſt ſtriking, but ſuch as occur the moſt readily. Our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is to prove, by examples, that the minds of women are <hi>naturally</hi> as ſuſceptible of every improvement, as thoſe of men. In the courſe of our examination, an obvious concluſion will, we conceive, force itſelf on ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery attentive and ingenuous reader. If the triumphs and attainments of THE SEX, under the various oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with which they have ſtruggled, have been thus ſplendid, how would they have been augmented, had not ignorant or intereſted men, after clipping their wings, contrived to erect around them almoſt inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable barriers. Deſcartes expatiated on the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical

abilities of <hi>the ſex;</hi> and, if their ſupporting themſelves with aſtoniſhing equanimity under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated oppreſſions to which they are not unfrequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubjected, may be called the practice of any branch of philoſophy, the experience of every tyrant will evince their proficiency therein. But the highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable and truly honourable court, is, we preſume, convened; the jury are empanneled, and we proceed to the examination of the witneſſes, leaving the plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to thoſe ſilent ſuggeſtions and inferences, which, we are aſſured, will voluntarily enliſt themſelves as advocates in every ingenuous boſom. The pending cauſe, as we have before obſerved, involves the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of the female intellect, or the maintaining the juſtice and propriety of conſidering women, as far as relates to their underſtanding, in <hi>every reſpect,</hi> equal to men. Our evidences tend to prove them—

                     <p>And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> They are alike capable of enduring hardſhips. A propoſition ſo ſelf-evident, ſupercedes the neceſſity of either arguments or witneſſes. On the women of Brittany, and the females among the ſavages of our own country, fatigues almoſt incredible are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Imbecility ſeems to have changed ſexes; and it is in theſe inſtances, <hi>maſculine weakneſs and feminine vigour.</hi> THE SEX, enervated and ſinking amid the luxuries and indulgencies of an Aſiatic climate, are
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:034162_0865_0FFC570B26097128"/>
elſewhere hardy and courageous, and fully adequate to all thoſe exertions requiſite to the ſupport of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their ſupine oppreſſors; and theſe well au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticated facts, are, I conceive, alone ſufficient to prove the <hi>powerful and transforming effects of education, and ſubſequent habits.</hi> But we need not take a voyage to Brittany, nor penetrate the haunts of ſavages, to prove that women are capable of ſuffering. They are the <hi>enduring ſex;</hi> and, by the irreverſible conſtitution of nature, they are ſubjected to agonies unknown to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; while I do not recollect that they are exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from any of the calamities incident to humanity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> They are <hi>equally</hi> ingenious, and fruitful in reſources. Female ingenuity will not, we apprehend, be controverted; every day furniſhes freſh proof of their invention, and their reſources are a conſequence. We ſelect, however, a corroborating inſtance, which, from its ſalutary effect, ſeems to claim a preference.</p>
                     <p>A certain ſovereign, of avaricious memory, was ſo fond of amaſſing treaſure, that he arbitrarily compelled a very large proportion of his ſubjects to labour in the mines; but while his majeſty's ingots were rapidly augmenting, the grounds remained uncultivated; fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine advanced with haſty ſtrides; and the dreary proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect every moment gathered darkneſs. No one poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed ſufficient intrepidity to remonſtrate—the deſpot's nod was fate—from his decrees there was no appeal—and the love of life, although its eligibles may be in a great meaſure diminiſhed, is generally a paramount paſſion. In this emergency, the ingenuity of the queen ſuggeſted a reſource that ſnatched the nation from the horrors of that <hi>dearth</hi> which had ſeemed ſo inevitable. She ſecretly employed an artiſt to produce an exact imitation of thoſe luxuries, in which the king moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, a variety of fiſh and fowl—bread and fruits of the moſt delicious kind, made of pure gold, were expeditiouſly completed, and diſplayed in order on the <hi>coſtly</hi> board—the table was highly decorated—and, when every thing was complete, the king, (after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been purpoſely diverted from taking his cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

refreſhment) was uſhered into the banqueting-room. His Majeſty took a ſeat—for a moment, aſtoniſhment ſuſpended even the clamours of hunger, and his mind was occupied by admiration of the imagination of the queen, and the deceptive abilities of the artiſt. The event was proportioned to the moſt ſanguine expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the lady. The mines were ſuddenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled, and the earth again produced the neceſſary ſupport.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Their fortitude and heroiſm cannot be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed. Liſten to a woman of Sparta, reduced by mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy caſualties to a ſtate of ſervitude—She was captured, and afterwards ſold as a ſlave. The queſtion was put by him on whom her very exiſtence ſeemed to depend—<hi>"What knoweſt thou?" "To be free,"</hi> was her characteriſtic reply: But the unfeeling deſpot, unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by indubitable indications of a noble mind, proceeded to impoſe his ignominious commands; to which ſhe diſpaſſionately returned, "<hi>you are unworthy of me;</hi>" and inſtantly reſigned herſelf to death. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and heroiſm was a conſpicuous trait in, and gave uncommon dignity to, the character of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ladies. Arria, the wife of Paetus, a Roman of conſular dignity, is an illuſtrious inſtance of that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent elevation, of which the female mind is ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. With perſevering firmneſs, and a tenderneſs not to be exceeded, ſhe continued unwearied in her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to procure the life of her huſband—long ſhe cheriſhed hope; but, when the pleaſing viſion fled, and the portending ſtorm was burſting over their heads: In that tremendous moment, while the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed man, trembling on the verge of diſſolution, had not the courage to point the deadly weapon—with that exquiſite delicacy, true fortitude, and <hi>faithfulneſs of affection, which is ſo highly ſexual, ſhe firſt imprinted on her own boſom the characters of death;</hi> and, animated by that ſublime conſciouſneſs becoming a being more than half celeſtial, ſhe then preſented him the pointed dagger, with this conſolatory aſſurance—"<hi>Paetus, this gives me no pain.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="201" facs="unknown:034162_0867_0FFA662BB5438368"/>
But fortitude and heroiſm are not confined to the Greek and Roman ladies; we have pledged ourſelves not to multiply examples unneceſſarily, otherwiſe a crowd of witneſſes preſenting, we could with difficulty ſuppreſs their teſtimony. Yet we find it impoſſible ſo ſpeedily to cloſe this part of our examination; and from the multitude of examples in the Iſland of Great-Britain, we produce the Lady Jane Gray, who ſeemed an exemplification of every virtue and every grace which has been attributed to the male or female character. The excellent underſtanding the received from nature was opened and improved by uniform ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. At ſixteen, her judgment had attained a high degree of maturity. She was at that age an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dept both in the Greek and Latin languages; and ſhe was able to declare that her Greek Plato was a more pleaſing entertainment to her than all thoſe enchanting pleaſures uſually ſo captivating to the unexperienced mind. Nurtured in the boſom of parental affection, and of tender friendſhip—happy in the diſtinguiſhing regards of her ſovereign, and permitted the ſublime en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of intellectual purſuits, ſhe had no ambition for the pageantry of royalty, and her advancement to the throne was an era, over which ſhe dropped the melancholy tear. We are ſenſible that in adverting to theſe traits in a character, affectingly intereſting, we do in fact anticipate other diviſions of our ſubject; but, contemplating a mind thus richly furniſhed, it is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to conſider ſeparately, endowments ſo nicely blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and reflecting on each other ſuch unuſual luſtre.</p>
                     <p>The paſſage of the Lady Jane, from the throne to the ſcaffold, was very ſhort—her impoſed queenſhip continued only ten days; yet ſhe ſeemed diſpleaſed at their duration, and ſhe received, with <hi>heroic fortitude,</hi> the meſſage of death. The lover and the huſband, whoſe vows ſhe had recently accepted, was alſo under ſentence of death; and, on the morning aſſigned for their martyrdom, he ſolicited for a parting interview; with ſolemn firmneſs ſhe refuſed his requeſt—yet her reſolution originated not in a deficiency of tenderneſs;
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:034162_0868_0FFA662DE5682048"/>
but it was nerved by an apprehenſion that her ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, thus ſtimulated, might ſurmount her fortitude. With modeſt reſignation ſhe purſued her way to the place of execution—the officers of death, bearing the body of her huſband, while the headleſs trunk yet ſtreamed with blood, met her on her paſſage—neither of them had completed their ſeventeenth year—ſhe looked—ſhe ſighed—and then, reaſſuming her compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſedateneſs, deſired her conductors to proceed—ſhe mounted the ſcaffold with an accelerated ſtep—ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the ſurrounding ſpectators—ſhe committed the care of her perſon to her woman; and, with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance deſcriptive of ſerene dignity, bowed her head to the executioner. Thus periſhed a ſpotleſs victim of deſpotiſm and of bigotry in the bloom of youth and beauty, rich in innocence, and adorned with every lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erary accompliſhment and ſexual grace. Lateſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity will lament her fate, and many hearts will join to execrate the ſanguinary meaſures which procured it. Under this head we produce but one more teſtimony.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Anna Aſkew, a young lady of great merit, and poſſeſſed alſo of a beautiful exterior, lived during the tyranny of Henry VIII. of England; a deſpot, who ſeemed to conceive the female world created on purpoſe to adminiſter to his pleaſures, or to become the victims of his cruelty and implacability. Miſs Aſkew was arraigned as a tranſgreſſor; her crime was, a denial of the <hi>real preſence in the euchariſt;</hi> and for this atrocious offence, ſhe was rigorouſly impriſoned, and ſubjected to a ſeries of barbarities that would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

unbending integrity furniſhed the pretence, and ſhe was, without further delay, put to the torture; but ſtill her fortitude receded not; and her heroic ſilence evinced her abundantly ſuperior to their unmanly cruelties. The enraged chancellor, in whoſe preſence ſhe ſuffered, tranſported with diabolic zeal, graſping with his own hands the cords, violently ſtretched the rack, and almoſt tore her body aſunder; while yet unappalled, her fortitude forſook her not, and her triumph over her barbarous tormentors was complete.</p>
                     <p>Her death-warrant was next made out, and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſentence which condemned her to the flames, as an emancipation from every evil. All her joints diſlocated by the rack, ſhe was borne to the place of execution; and there, after being bound to the ſtake, was offered her life on condition of retracting her ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed error; but ſhe conſiſtently rejected an exiſtence to be purchaſed only by the forfeiture of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of rectitude, which the virtuous ſo well know how to prize; and as the flames that were her paſſport to regions of bleſſedneſs, enkindled around her, a ſong of thankſgiving was on her lips, and her exultation evidently augmented.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They are equally brave. Bravery is not a quality which figures <hi>gracefully</hi> in the liſt of female virtues, nor are we anxious it ſhould take rank in the catalogue—far from it; we ſhould rather lament to ſee it become a characteriſtic trait.

This magnanimous female beheld the ſtreaming wounds of her expiring father, in the fatal moment in which he was ſlaughtered on the field of battle; and, inſtead of yielding to thoſe tender ſenſibilities originat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in nature, and generally aſſociated with valour—inſtead of lamenting his fate by ſighs and tears, or the wordy exclamations of clamorous ſorrow, ſhe undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſeized that ſword and ſhield now rendered uſeleſs to the venerable warrior, and, arming herſelf therewith, reanimated the diſpirited ſoldiers, led them once more to the charge; bravely oppoſed the Turks, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced a gate, were rapidly advancing; and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly avenged the death of her father, by driving them back to the ſhore, and compelling them to take refuge in their veſſels.</p>

She ſuſtained with unyielding firmneſs the attacks of a vigilant and active foe. In the frequent ſallies made by the garriſon, ſhe herſelf led on her warriors. At the head of three hundred horſe, with her own hand ſhe ſet fire to the tents and baggage of the beſiegers, thus neceſſitating them to deſiſt from the general aſſault which they were in the moment of commencing; and, although intercepted in her return to the citadel, ſhe nevertheleſs fought her way through one quarter of the French camp, and rejoined her faithful friends in triumph!</p>

whom from infancy they have watched with all a mother's tenderneſs, and whoſe rich maturity hath become the pride and conſolation of their declining life—in thoſe moments of anguiſh, their heroiſm and their fortitude are indiſputably evinced. Nor is the patriotiſm of the chief arrayed for the battle; nor his, who devotes himſelf with all a ſtateſman's integrity to the public weal, condemned to an ordeal more ſevere.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>patriotiſm</hi> of the Roman ladies, procured a ſenatorial decree that funeral orations ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced from the roſtrum in their praiſe: Repeatedly they ſaved their country. And the <hi>patriotiſm</hi> of the mother and wiſe of Coriolanus, while it ſnatched Rome from impending ruin, devoted to inevitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction the huſband and the ſon: Hence towered the temple conſecrated to feminine honour; and it muſt be confeſſed they had purchaſed this diſtinction at a very high price. The venerable Senate, too, again interpoſed; public thanks were decreed; and men were ordered, on all occaſions, to yield prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to women.</p>

Inſtances are multiplied, wherein women have bent to their purpoſes the ſtrongeſt maſculine underſtanding. Samſon, the victim of female blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhments, is not a ſingular inſtance. The example cited under the laſt article, is in point. Coriolanus rejected with unbending ſeverity ſupplicating friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, garbed in ſenatorial robes; ſucceeding deputies plead in vain—The miniſters of religion, cloathed in ſacerdotal habits, joined in ſolemn proceſſion—they crowded around the warrior, commiſſioned to advocate a ſinking people's cauſe; ſtill, however, he continued obdurate, inflexibly firm and ſteady to his plans. But Veturia and Volumnia, his wife and mother, attended by the moſt illuſtrious of the Roman ladies, appear—they ſhed torrents of tears—they embrace his knees—the hero is diſarmed—his heart is melted—his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and his reſolutions vaniſh together—and Rome is ſaved.</p>

                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> They are as energetic, and as eloquent, Women always decree with fervour: Did it depend on them, their movements would be deciſive. Their expreſſions are often as ſtrongly marked, as they are vehement; and both their plans and the execution thereof, are endowed with all the vigour that exiſting regulations will permit. Their eloquence is indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Poſſeſſing a richneſs of fancy; their words are ſufficiently copious; and education, when they are indulged with its aids, preſcribes the proper rules. Aſpaſia, of Miletus, it is well known, taught the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Socrates rhetoric and politics. And, when Rome groaned under the enormous cruelties of her ſecond Triumvirate, the three barbarians by whom ſhe was enſlaved, and who had armed themſelves for the deſtruction of her citizens, as if deſirous of ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every poſſible calamity, ſeized not only the lives, but the treaſures of the people, and equally greedy of gold as of blood, after exhauſting every other mode of plunder, turned their rapacious views on thoſe reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able matrons, who had hitherto been exempted from pecuniary exactions; an exorbitant tax was levied on every individual female, and the conſternation oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by this unheard of aſſumption, was propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the diſtreſs of which it was productive.</p>
                     <p>In this extraordinary emergency, the oppreſſed fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males earneſtly ſolicited the aid of thoſe advocates who were appointed to plead the cauſe of the injured and defenceleſs; but the orators, fearful of incurring the diſpleaſure of thoſe who had uſurped the power of life and death, refuſed to interfere; and no means of redreſs appearing, ſubmiſſion to an impoſition acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged grievous, ſeemed inevitable: It was, however, reſerved to the talents and exertions of Hortenſia to furniſh the deſired aid.</p>

For the brow of Horten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, fame prepared an immortal wreath: To the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt gratitude of her cotemporaries ſhe was entitled: Her triumph was the triumph of virtue and of talents: She enkindled even in the callous breaſts of aſſaſſins, the almoſt extinguiſhed ſparks of humanity; and ſhe ſtands on the page of hiſtory, a pattern of dauntleſs courage, and an example of genuine eloquence.</p>

                        <hi>Eighthly,</hi> They are as faithful and as perſevering in their attachments. Here countleſs witneſſes crowd on retention, and the greateſt difficulty is in chooſing judiciouſly. Repeatedly have I ſeen the faithfully attached female, firmly perſevering in that affection which was firſt implanted in the ſoil of innocence, and fondly watching with tender anxiety every ſymptom of the diſeaſed man: With patient aſſiduity ſhe hath hung over the couch, and ſought to mitigate the pangs of him, whoſe licentious conduct had brought ruin on herſelf and her unoffending children! Had circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances been reverſed, <hi>divorce</hi> would have ſucceeded—a hoſpital muſt have ſheltered the helpleſs woman; and, had ſhe received from the man ſhe had injured any trivial attention, the unmerited gratuity would have reſounded through the circle of their connexions, been dwelt on with rapture, and echoed by every tongue. But when virtue is the baſis; when acts of kindneſs cement the union, THE SEX in many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have ſet no bound to that faithful attachment which their hearts have exultingly acknowledged. Filial duty—conjugal affection—perſevering conſtancy—theſe receive in the female boſom the higheſt perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which they are, in the preſent ſtate, ſuſceptible.</p>

in hiſtory, would yet, in like ſituation, obtain many imitators; and the feelings of a daughter would prompt, for the relief of the authors of her being, the nobleſt exertions. The celebrated Mrs. Roper, eldeſt daughter of Sir Thomas Moore, continued his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate ſolace during his impriſonment: With heart-affecting anguiſh ſhe ruſhed through the guards to catch, from the illuſtrious martyr, a laſt embrace. Bending under a weight of calamity, ſhe obtained permiſſion to pay him ſepulchral honours; and, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the tyrant's power, ſhe purchaſed the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable head of the meritorious ſufferer: Yet, too noble to permit the conſequences to fall upon another, with dauntleſs courage ſhe became her own accuſer; and, loaded with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Portia, the daughter of Cato Uticenſis, and wife of Brutus, hearing of the death of her huſband, diſdained to live; and when debarred acceſs to the uſual weapons of deſtruction, made her exit by reſolutely ſwallowing burning coals of ſire!

of the fourth century; ſhe was judged qualified to ſucceed her father in that diſtinguiſhed and important office; her wiſdom was held in univerſal eſteem; and from her judgment no one thought proper to appeal: Perſons cloathed in public authority, even the firſt magiſtrates, deliberated with her on the moſt urgent and important emergencies; this unavoidably drew around her ſucceeding circles of men; yet ſhe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her intercourſe with characters of various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, without the ſhadow of an impeachment of her reputation, until baſely traduced, in a <hi>ſingle inſtance,</hi> by bigotted and intereſted calumniators.

Mary Stuart, queen of Scotland, poſſeſſing all the advantages of exterior, and every ſexual grace, aſſiduouſly cultivated her mind: Her learning was as remarkable as her beauty; ſhe could, we are informed, write and ſpeak ſix languages; her numbers enchanted the Gallic ear; and, at an early age, ſhe pronounced before the French Court a Latin oration, calculated to convince her hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that literary purſuits are proper to the Female Sex. Beauty could not plead in vain; the lovely ſpeaker exemplified, in her own character and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the truth ſhe inculcated; ſhe was, herſelf, that happy combination, the practicability of which ſhe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to impreſs; and conviction undoubtedly irradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the minds of her audience.</p>

At the age of twenty-ſix, ſhe took the degree of a Doctor of Laws, and commenced her career in this line, by public ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the doctrines of Juſtinian: At the age of thirty, her extraordinary merit raiſed her to the chair, where ſhe taught the law to an aſtoniſhing number of pupils, collected from various nations. She joined to her profound knowledge, ſexual modeſty, and every feminine accompliſhment; yet her perſonal attractions were abſorbed in the magnitude and ſplendor of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual abilities; and the charms of her exterior only commanded attention, when ſhe ceaſed to ſpeak.

At ten, ſhe was but three hours in learning to embroider. She ſtudied muſic, painting, ſculpture and engraving, and made an admirable proficiency in all thoſe arts. The Hebrew, Greek and Latin lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages were familiar to her; and ſhe made ſome prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs in the oriental tongues. She perfectly underſtood French, Engliſh and Italian, and expreſſed herſelf elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in all thoſe languages; and ſhe appropriated a portion of her time, to the acquirement of an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive acquaintance with geography, aſtronomy, philoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophy, and the other ſciences: Yet ſhe poſſeſſed ſo much feminine delicacy, and retiring modeſty, that her tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and acquirements had been conſigned to oblivion, if Vaſſius, and other amateurs of literature, had not uſhered her, in oppoſition to her wiſhes, upon the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre of the world: But when ſhe was once known, perſons of erudition, of every deſcription, correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her; and thoſe in the moſt elevated ſtations, aſſiduouſly ſought opportunities of ſeeing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with her.</p>

Lady Burleigh, Lady Bacon, Lady Ruſſell, and Mrs. Killigrew, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Sir Anthony Cook, received from their father a maſculine education; and their prodigious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was an ample compenſation for his paternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence: They were eminent for genius and virtue, and obtained an accurate knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages. The writings of the Dutcheſs of Newcaſtle were voluminous; ſhe is produced as the firſt Engliſh lady who attempted what has ſince been termed polite literature. Lady Halket was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for her erudition; ſhe was well ſkilled, both in phyſic and divinity. Lady Maſham, and Mary Aſtell, reaſoned accurately on the moſt abſtract particulars in divinity, and in metaphyſics. Lady Grace Gethin was happy in natural genius and a cultivated under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; ſhe was a woman of erudition; and we are informed that, at the age of twenty, "<hi>ſhe treated of life and morals, with the diſcernment of Socrates, and

Chudleigh, Winchelſea, Monk, Bovey, Stella, Montague—theſe all poſſeſs their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective claims. Catharine Macauley wielded ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the hiſtoric pen; nor were her exertions confined to this line—But we have already multiplied our witneſſes far beyond our original deſign; and it is proper that we apologize to our readers, for a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of that brevity which we had authorized them to expect.</p>

                     <p>WE take leave to repeat, that we are not deſirous to array THE SEX in martial habiliments; we do not wiſh to enliſt our women as ſoldiers; and we requeſt it may be remembered, that we only contend for the <hi>capability</hi> of the female mind to become poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of any attainment within the reach of <hi>maſculine exertion.</hi> We have produced our witneſſes; their dep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſitions have been heard; the cauſe is before the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; we await their verdict; and, as we entertain all poſſible veneration for the reſpectable jury, we ſhall not dare to appeal from their deciſion.</p>
                     <p>But while we do homage to the women of other times, we feel happy that nature is no leſs bountiful to the females of the preſent day. We cannot, indeed, obtain a liſt of the names that have done honour to their Sex, and to humanity, during the period now under obſervation: The luſtre of thoſe minds, ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped in a veil of mortality, is neceſſarily muffled and obſcure; but the curtain will be thrown back, and poſterity will contemplate, with admiration, their manifold perfections. Yet, in many inſtances, fame
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:034162_0884_0FFC5C46723C1798"/>
has already lifted her immortalizing trump. Madame de Genlis has added new effulgence to the literary an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of France. This lady unites, in an aſtoniſhing degree, both genius and application! May her inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable exertions be crowned with the ſucceſs they ſo richly merit—May no illiberal prejudices obſtruct the progreſs of her multiplied productions; but, borne along the ſtream of time, may they continue pleaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vehicles of inſtruction, and confer on their inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious author that celebrity to which ſhe is indiſputably entitled. France may alſo juſtly place among her liſt of illuſtrious perſonages, the luminous name of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Madame Roland compriſed, in her own ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic and capacious mind, all thoſe appropriate vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which are characterized as maſculine and femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine. She not only dignified THE SEX, but human nature in the aggregate; and her memory will be held in veneration, wherever talents, literature, patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm, and uniform heroiſm, are properly appreciated.</p>
                     <p>The Britiſh Iſle is at this moment diſtinguiſhed by a conſtellation of the firſt magnitude. Barbauld, Seward, Cowley, Inchbald, Burney, Smith, Radcliffe, Moore, Williams, Wollſtonecraft, &amp;c. &amp;c.—theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, celebrated for brilliancy of genius and literary attainments, have rendered yet more illuſtrious the Engliſh name.</p>
                     <p>Nor is America deſtitute of females, whoſe abilities and improvements give them an indiſputable claim to immortality. It is a fact, eſtabliſhed beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, that we are indebted for the diſcovery of our country, to female enterprize, deciſion, and generoſity. The great Columbus, after having in vain ſolicited the aid of Genoa, France, England, Portugal, and Spain—after having combated, for a period of eight years, with every objection that a want of knowledge could propoſe, found, at laſt, his only reſource in the pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration and magnanimity of Iſabella of Spain, who furniſhed the equipment, and raiſed the ſums neceſſary to defray the expenſes, on the ſale of her own jewels; and while we conceive an action, ſo honourable to
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:034162_0885_0FFC5C44E37D4FD8"/>
THE SEX, hath not been ſufficiently applauded, we truſt, that the equality of the female intellect to that of their brethren, who have ſo long uſurped an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly and unfounded ſuperiority, will never, in this younger world, be left without a witneſs. We cannot aſcertain the number of ingenious women, who at preſent adorn our country. In the ſhade of ſolitude they perhaps cultivate their own minds, and ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the education of their children. Our day, we know, is only dawning—But when we contemplate a Warren, a Philenia, an Antonia, a Euphelia, &amp;c. &amp;c. we gratefully acknowledge, that genius and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even in the female line, already gild, with efful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent radiance, our bleſt Aurora.</p>
                     <p>But women are calculated to ſhine in other charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters than thoſe adverted to, in the preceding Eſſays; and with proper attention to their education, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent habits, they might eaſily attain that independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for which a Wollſtonecraft hath ſo energetically contended; the term, <hi>helpleſs widow,</hi> might be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as unfrequent and inapplicable as that of <hi>help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs widower;</hi> and although we ſhould undoubtedly continue to mourn the diſſolution of wedded amity, yet we ſhould derive conſolation from the knowledge, that the infant train had ſtill a remaining prop, and that a mother could <hi>aſſiſt</hi> as well as <hi>weep</hi> over her offspring.</p>
                     <p>That women have a talent—a talent which, duly cultivated, would confer that independence, which is demonſtrably of incalculable utility, every attentive obſerver will confeſs. THE SEX ſhould be taught to depend on their own efforts, for the procurement of an eſtabliſhment in life. The chance of a matrimonial coadjutor, is no more than a probable contingency; and if they were early accuſtomed to regard this <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain</hi> event with ſuitable <hi>indifference,</hi> they would make elections with that deliberation, which would be calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to give a more rational proſpect of tranquillity. All this we have repeatedly aſſerted, and all this we do invariably believe. To neglect poliſhing a gem, or
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:034162_0886_0FFC5C43608DA610"/>
obſtinately to refuſe bringing into action a treaſure in our poſſeſſion, when we might thus accumulate a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome intereſt, is ſurely egregiouſly abſurd, and the height of folly. The <hi>united efforts of male and female</hi> might reſcue many a family from deſtruction, which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the efforts of its <hi>individual</hi> head, is now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in all the calamities attendant on a diſſipated fortune and augmenting debts. It is not poſſible to educate children in a manner which will render them <hi>too beneficial</hi> to ſociety; and the more we multiply aids to a family, the greater will be the ſecurity, that its individuals will not be thrown a burden on the public.</p>
                     <p>An inſtance of <hi>female capability,</hi> this moment occurs to memory. In the State of Maſſachuſetts, in a ſmall town, ſome miles from the metropolis, reſides a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who hath made aſtoniſhing improvements in ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculture. Her mind, in the early part of her life, was but penuriouſly cultivated, and ſhe grew up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholly uneducated: But being ſuffered, during her childhood, to rove at large among her native fields, her limbs expanded, and ſhe acquired a height of ſtature above the common ſize; her mind alſo became invigorated; and her underſtanding ſnatched ſufficient information, to produce a conſciouſneſs of the injury ſhe ſuſtained in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he want of thoſe aids, which ſhould have been furniſhed in the beginning of her years. She however applied herſelf diligently to rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edy the evil, and ſoon made great proficiency in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in arithmetic. She read every thing ſhe could procure; but the impreſſions adventitiouſly made on her infant mind ſtill obtained the aſcendency. A few rough acres conſtituted her patrimonial inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; theſe ſhe has brought into a ſtate of high cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation; their productions are every year both uſeful and ornamental; ſhe is miſtreſs of agricolation, and is at once a botaniſt and a floriſt. The moſt approved authors in the Engliſh language, on theſe ſubjects, are in her hands, and ſhe ſtudies them with induſtry and ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="221" facs="unknown:034162_0887_0FFC5C3C9C1792F8"/>
She has obtained ſuch a conſiderable knowledge in the nature of ſoils, the preciſe manure which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and their particular adaption to the various fruits of the earth, that ſhe is become the oracle of all the farmers in her vicinity; and when laying out, or appropriating their grounds, they uniformly ſubmit them to her inſpection. Her gardens are the reſort of all ſtrangers who happen to viſit her village; and ſhe is particularly remarkable for a growth of trees, from which, gentlemen, ſolicitous to enrich their fruit-gardens, or ornament their parterres, are in the habit of ſupplying themſelves; and thoſe trees are, to their ingenious cultivator, a conſiderable income. Carefully attentive to her nurſery, ſhe knows when to tranſplant, and when to prune; and ſhe perfectly underſtands the various methods of inoculating and ingrafting. In ſhort, ſhe is a complete <hi>huſbandwoman;</hi> and ſhe has, beſides, acquired a vaſt ſtock of general knowledge, while her judgment has attained ſuch a degree of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, as to juſtify the confidence of the villagers, who are accuſtomed to conſult her on every perplexing emergency.</p>
                     <p>In the conſtant uſe of exerciſe, ſhe is not corpulent; and ſhe is extremely active, and wonderfully athletic. Inſtances, almoſt incredible, are produced of her ſtrength. Indeed, it is not ſurpriſing that ſhe is the idol and ſtanding theme of the village, ſince, with all her uncommon qualifications, ſhe combines a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſpoſition not to be exceeded. Her extenſive acquaintance with herbs, contributes to render her a ſkilful and truly valuable nurſe; and the world never produced a more affectionate, attentive, or faithful woman: Yet, while ſhe feelingly ſympathizes with every invalid, ſhe is not herſelf ſubject to imaginary complaints; nor does ſhe eaſily yield to real illneſs. She has lately been indiſpoſed—and a life ſo valuable, when endangered, embodied a hoſt of fears for its ſafety: With difficulty ſhe was perſuaded to lie down upon her bed; and the young woman who attended her, and to whom ſhe had endeared herſelf by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:034162_0888_0FFC5C3B18EF3D60"/>
good offices, after ſoftly cloſing the ſhutters and door of her apartment, privately ſummoned the aid of a phyſician; and when the medical gentleman made his appearance, ſhe accompanied him to the apartment of her friend; but behold, the bird was flown! and when purſued, ſhe was found at a diſtance from her habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, directing ſome labourers, who were employed in her ſervice, and who, ſhe was fearful, were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently attentive to her previous inſtructions. The event proved ſhe had acted judiciouſly; for, braced by the freſh air, her nerves new ſtrung, aſſumed their uſual tone, her ſickneſs vaniſhed, and her native vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our returned.</p>
                     <p>Although far advanced in years, without a matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial connexion, yet, conſtantly engaged in uſeful and intereſting purſuits, ſhe manifeſts not that peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſcontent, ſo frequently attendant on <hi>old maids;</hi> ſhe realizes all that independence which is proper to humanity; and ſhe knows how to ſet a juſt value on the bleſſings ſhe enjoys.</p>
                     <p>From my treaſury of facts, I produce a ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, equally in point. I have ſeen letters, written by a lady, an inhabitant of St. Sebaſtian, (a Spaniſh emporium) that breathed the true ſpirit of commerce, and evinced the writer to poſſeſs all the integrity, punctuality and diſpatch, which are ſuch capital requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites in the mercantile career. This lady is at the head of a firm, of which herſelf and daughters make up the individuals—Her name is <hi>Birmingham.</hi> She is, I imagine, well known to the commercial part of the United States. She was left a widow in the infancy of her children, who were numerous; and ſhe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately adopted the moſt vigorous meaſures for their emolument. Being a woman of a magnanimous mind, ſhe devoted her ſons to the profeſſion of arms; and they were expeditiouſly diſpoſed of, in a way the beſt calculated to bring them acquainted with the art of war. Her daughters were educated for buſineſs; and, arriving at womanhood, they have long ſince eſtabliſhed themſelves into a capital trading-houſe, of
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:034162_0889_0FFC5C37F6D0E5E0"/>
which, as has been obſerved, their reſpectable mother is the head. She is, in the hours of buſineſs, invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be found in her compting-houſe; there ſhe takes her morning repaſt; her daughters act as clerks, (and they are adepts in their office) regularly prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the papers and letters, which paſs in order under her inſpection. She ſigns herſelf, in all accounts and letters, <hi>Widow Birmingham;</hi> and this is the addreſs by which ſhe is deſignated. I have converſed with one of our captains, who has often negociated with her the diſpoſal of large and valuable cargoes. Her conſignments, I am told, are to a great amount; and one of the principal merchants in the town of Boſton aſſerts, that he receives from no houſe in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope more ſatisfactory returns. Upright in their deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and unwearied in their application, theſe ladies poſſeſs a right to proſperity; and we truſt that their circumſtances are as eaſy, as their conduct is meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious.</p>
                     <p>"Would you, good Mr. Gleaner, ſtation us in the compting-houſe?" No, my fair country-women, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept circumſtances unavoidably pointed the way.

"The pleaſures of women muſt ariſe from their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. It is by the cradle of their children, and in viewing the ſmiles of their daughters, or the ſports of their ſons, that mothers find their happineſs. Where are the powerful emotions of nature? Where is the ſentiment, at once ſublime and pathetic, that carries every feeling to exceſs? Is it to be found in the froſty indifference, and the ſour ſeverity of ſome fathers? No—but in the warm and affectionate boſom of a <hi>mother.</hi> It is ſhe, who, by an impulſe as quick as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary, ruſhes into the flood to preſerve a boy, whoſe imprudence had betrayed him into the waves—It is ſhe, who, in the middle of a conflagration, throws herſelf acroſs the flames to ſave a ſleeping infant—It is ſhe, who, with diſhevelled locks, pale and diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, embraces with tranſport, the body of a dead child, preſſing its cold lips to her's, as if ſhe would reani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, by her tears and her careſſes, the inſenſible clay.

the moſt lively traits of devotional gratitude, paced and repaced the ſea girt ſtrand of a wealthy emporium, whither he had been carried by the hope of commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial advantage: His boſom was tranquillized by the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igibility of his then ſituation; and the ſunny beams of proſperity had invigorated all thoſe gay expectations that, ſhrinking from the clouds of adverſity, proſtrate before the ſtorms of life. A ſhip, the property of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus, had a few hours before caſt anchor in the ſtream—the ſhore reſounded the cheerful voices of the mariners, and the daſhing of the waves vibrated gratefully on his ear.</p>
                     <p>Yet the chalice of misfortune had been mixed for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus; recently he had taſted the bitter draught, and it was to the humane interpoſition of ſtrangers that he was indebted for eſcaping the neceſſity of ſwallowing the very dregs. Shipwrecked on a foreign ſhore—to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unknown, and poſſeſſing not a ſhilling of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He had at this deſolate period experienced the utmoſt energies of philanthropy, and the efforts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence had not only extricated him from that ruin which his circumſtances ſeemed inevitably to involve, but, adminiſtering liberally to his neceſſities, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him eligible accommodations and returned him in ſafety to his native country. "And oh! exclaimed Adolphus, may I never ceaſe to acknowledge the vaſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearage, by ſuccouring to the utmoſt of my power every ſon and daughter of misfortune; and when I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to extend to the hapleſs ſtranger, whoſe right is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by adverſity, a portion of my regards, may I be dead to the pleaſures of exiſtence, and may the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſwell of complacency no more expand my boſom.

Juſt at this moment, a barge, launching from the ſhore, was on the point of proceeding to the ſhip. Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus hailed the bargemen, and leaping on board, the well plied oar ſoon produced him beſide the Atalanta. Entering the ſhip, he contemplated for a moment the ſplendors of a ſuperb evening, with the additional ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a beautifully extenſive water proſpect. The moon ſhone forth in full orbed majeſty, and he was indulging a moſt delightful reverie, when his attention was ſuddenly arreſted by an agonizing ſhriek iſſuing from the cabin, the accent of which was evidently fem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inine. Inſtantly he deſcended the ſtairs, when an el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egant and intereſting woman, on whoſe features was impreſſed the frenzy of deſpair, wringing her ſnowy hands, in a tone of the deepeſt anguiſh, exclaimed, "<hi>My God, it is impoſſible! ſurely it is impoſſible</hi>—<hi>ſome vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain has baſely traduced him!</hi>" Again ſhe ſhrieked aloud, when, raiſing her eyes with a fearful kind of horror, and obſerving numbers gather about her, ſhe claſped her hands in evident terror, and her calamitous reflections for a time defeating themſelves, ſhe would have ſunk lifeleſs on the floor, had not the attentive Adolphus received her in his arms.</p>
                     <p>Under his humane direction, every neceſſary ſtep was taken for her recovery; and ſhe too ſoon opened her eyes on a world in which her peace had been cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly wrecked. During her ſuſpended animation, he had learned that the immediate cauſe of her diſtreſs proceeded from a verbal meſſage, containing much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent ingratitude, delivered to her in the name of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from whom ſhe expected protection, and who ſhe had informed by letter of her arrival. And, with the hope of implanting that confidence which he judged neceſſary for her ſituation, he informed her that he himſelf having been a ſon of ſorrow, his ſympathy was the offspring of experience; that the ſhip and cargo was his property, and that being largely in arrearage to the unfortunate, if ſhe ranked in that truly reſpectable deſcription, he was ready to diſcharge his debt to her in whatever mode might beſt correſpond with her wiſhes.</p>

Aſtoniſhment ſeemed to arreſt, in the countenance of the lady, the progreſs of grief; but aſſuming an air of dignified compoſure, ſhe replied: "You muſt be ſenſible, Sir, that your addreſs is out of the common courſe. Accept, however, my grateful thanks for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of kindneſs it contains; and be aſſured that my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes are not of a <hi>pecuniary</hi> nature; it is not in your power, Sir, to relieve me. God forbid that in a caſe of ſo delicate a nature, I ſhould ſtand in need of foreign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition. Unfortunately I have had too many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of a ſorrow which is perhaps occaſioned by a blameable ſuſceptibility. Thoſe about you can inform you that a miſunderſtanding hath taken place between my huſband and myſelf; but all will, all muſt end well. I have been wrong to be ſo much diſquieted, and that ſympathy which you mention, induced by polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will undoubtedly apologize for me, if I ſay that I have need of ſolitude to collect my ſcattered ſpirits." Adolphus, after aſſuring the beautiful unknown that if her future exigencies demanded the extricating hand of a friend, her recognition of him would confer a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obligation, drew from his pocket-his addreſs, and placing it in the hands of her woman, bowed reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and, quitting the cabin, took with him thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers whom her apparent ſufferings had drawn thith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Several days revolved, and he continued ignorant of the fate of the lady; for reflecting on the elevated ſolemnity with which ſhe replied to his proffered aid, he conceived himſelf obliged in honour to deſiſt from further inquiries. At length, however, the following letter was put into his hand:</p>

on one to whoſe very name, but for my wretched ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, I had remained a ſtranger. Yet it is fit you ſhould be furniſhed with a few leading particulars, relative to the perſon who now earneſtly ſolicits your protection. Take then, worthy Sir, in few words, the outlines of a life until within theſe two paſt years, mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by obedience, and conſequent tranquillity.</p>
                           <p>My family name is—, I was born in the capital of Scotland—my father then poſſeſſed, and ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to fill, an eligible and lucrative public employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—my mother died at a period when, huſhed in the cradle of innocence, I was inſenſible to every pain or pleaſure, not originating in my immediate wants, and her place was ſo well filled by her ſucceſſor as to leave my opening reaſon only natural regrets for this event. The attachment of my parents was apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly equal, and I was bleſt by every proper indulgence. Born in affluence, I early received every advantage of which my tender years was ſuſceptible. The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant era of ſixteen found me at a celebrated boarding ſchool, where the ill judged liberties allowed to young ladies too often lay the foundation of misfortunes that terminate not but with their mortal exiſtence. It was during my continuance at this ſeminary, that I ſaw and loved the too inſinuating Sebaſtian; his addreſs is eaſy, his figure manly, and the whole contour of his perſon ſtrikingly impreſſive. He made his advances with well diſſembled delicacy; his ardent proteſtations of inviolable love were cloathed in the habiliments of friendſhip; and when at laſt his language became more deciſive, prepared for a declaration that I wiſhed, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the avowal of his tender attachment with all thoſe demonſtrations of complacency which youthful ſincerity ſuggeſt, and which virgin modeſty heſitates not to authorize. Satisfied of the fervour of my own regard, I calculated on a mutual paſſion, and my lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er poſſeſſed my unbounded confidence. Fatal delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! Wretched eſſerveſcence of fancy—ye have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erably undone me; and, ſtrange to tell, I live to lament the folly of my too eaſy faith.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="229" facs="unknown:034162_0895_0FFC5C23A7D309B0"/>
You will obſerve, Sir, that my path was plain before me, and Sebaſtian was immediately referred to my father. But what was my aſtoniſhment when that father, ever attentive to my beſt intereſt, utterly refuſed to ſanction my choice, poſitively interdicting all future intercourſe with Sebaſtian, and making my continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at the ſeminary to depend wholly on my obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his commands. Ah, why did he truſt to the diſcretion of a giddy love-ſick girl. I betrayed his honeſt confidence; and eaſily finding opportunities of converſing with the ſeducer, the reſult of our frequent meetings was a clandeſtine marriage; but no ſooner had I become a wife, than all the daughter ruſhed on my ſoul. I fondly loved, revered, and next to adored my father; and it was the cheriſhed hope of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a reconciliation that gave me courage, in the face of a ſolemn prohibition, to commit an offence that alas! has thrown me out of his protection, and which has, I have every reaſon to fear, baniſhed me forever from his affections! Every method hath been purſued, both by Sebaſtian and myſelf, which we judged might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our pardon; but our conciliatory attempts have proved ineffectual. Prayers and expoſtulations have been in vain—my father, my beloved father continues inexorable! Since the declaration of my marriage, I have never once beheld his benign countenance. My mother, my brothers, and my ſiſters, alas! his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition extends to them alſo! He refuſes to receive my letters; and, when in the perturbation of my ſoul I ſtill preſſed them upon him, they were repeatedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unopened, and no language can deſcribe the conſequent anguiſh of my ſpirit.</p>
                           <p>During my ſupplications for a reconciliation, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and unrivalled tenderneſs of my huſband con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued unremitted; but at its cloſe I ſaw, or thought I ſaw a viſible abatement of his kindneſs! I was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, willing to place this circumſtance to a natural cauſe; and, ſolicitous to believe what was ſo intimately connected with my <hi>tranquillity,</hi> I perſuaded myſelf that he only took rank with the generality of married men.
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:034162_0896_0FFC5C1DC6E06428"/>
It was at this juncture that the decline of my health made it neceſſary I ſhould take lodgings at Bath, while buſineſs detaining Sebaſtian in London, a temporary ſeparation ſeemed unavoidable; and I ſtruggled to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that compoſure which ſhe who hath ſwerved capitally from the path of duty will find it very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to regain.</p>
                           <p>Thus was I circumſtanced, when a letter was brought me from Sebaſtian, acquainting me that he was on the point of embarking for America; that very advantageous propoſals had been made him, the emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ument of which depended on his immediate cloſing therewith, and on his collecting together every ſhilling of property he could command. He entreated me therefore to think favourably of him, and the ſtep he meditated, and to ſend him as ſpeedily as poſſible every thing of value that I could conveniently part with. He informed me that he contemplated an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in P—; and that on a ſuppoſition, my health and inclination would meet his wiſhes, he had made arrangements for my paſſage to the new world, on board the Atalanta, which ſhip was to ſail in one month after his embarkation. The letter containing this unexpected intelligence, was replete with expreſſions of unalterable attachment; and I, who entertained no doubt of my huſband's honour, never regarded their ſincerity as queſtionable. The little intereſt in my gift was cheerfully ſurrendered—my rings, my jewels of every deſcription, every thing that could be turned into ready money, were all tranſmitted to the metrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olis; and I only reſerved my watch, the value of which was enhanced by having been the property of my mother.</p>
                           <p>With a degree of alacrity, aſtoniſhing even to myſelf, I ſet about preparing to follow; and I in reality ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced a degree of ſatisfaction in the idea of quitting thoſe dear native ſhores, where I was conſidered as an alien to thoſe perſons whom I ſhall never ceaſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and for whom the ſigh of my boſom ſtill aroſe. I left England with thoſe kind of feelings natural to a

daughter and a wife thus circumſtanced: But every difficulty was lightened, by the proſpect of finding my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, at the cloſe of my voyage, under the protection of the man to whom my heart was moſt paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted. I flattered myſelf that, ſtrangers in this new world, our conſequence to each other would neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly augment; and the halcyon days of mutual love and confidence paſſed in viſion before me.</p>
                           <p>With the firſt poſſible moment after my arrival, I diſpatched a line of intelligence to Sebaſtian, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, by way of anſwer, a <hi>verbal declaration, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I could procure a reconciliation with my father, I muſt never more expect to ſee his face!!!</hi> You, Sir, witneſſed the effect of this aſtoniſhing annunciation. Yet, after the firſt ebullition of grief and ſurpriſe had a little ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, I perſuaded myſelf that it had been worded dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a moment of inſanity; and I thought it became my character to ſeek an eclairciſſement. Obliged as I was by your proffered aſſiſtance, my ſpirit was not then ſufficiently broken to ſubmit with compoſure to my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliating ſituation, and I am fearful that I received your unmerited attentions with undue haughtineſs; but that delicacy aſcribed to your character, will, I truſt, enable you to account for my feelings. From the hour of my debarkation I have aſſiduouſly ſought my huſband, but he as ſtudiouſly avoids me—we have not yet met. I have repeatedly addreſſed him by letter—I have expoſtulated, ſoothed, and entreated, but without effect—his anſwers are all in one peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſtyle—he will never again ſee me, except my father explicitly approbates our union. My father's admeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urement of the mind of this barbarouſly mercenary man, was, it appears, perfectly juſt. Repeatedly did the anxious parent aſſure me that his only object in ſeeking an alliance with me, was that fortune which he vainly imagined could not be withheld from me. Alas! alas! at this fearful moment, dreadfully do I realize the truth of this ſentiment! Sebaſtian has left this city, and is, I am informed, gone on a party of pleaſure to L—. Thither I would purſue him. Could I once more ſee

him, I think I ſhould be ſatisfied; but I have not the means of a journey, and I have unavoidably contracted debts which it is beyond my power to diſcharge. What ſhall I ſay? In what words ſhall I clothe my preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous requeſts? Poſſeſſing your addreſs, I avail myſelf of your generoſity—yet, believe me, worthy ſtranger, I would never have made this application—my laſt breath ſhould have iſſued at the cold ſhrine of poverty, ere I had thus dared, had not the tongue of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aſcribed to you <hi>the firſt of virtues</hi>—<hi>had not I learned that you are wedded to a lovely woman, who poſſeſſes all your heart.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I ſay then, do you lend me your credence? do you admit my narrative as <hi>authentic? Will you pay my debts? Will you hear me to the dwelling of her you love?</hi> L—is your native home, your ſeat of reſidence? Thither I am anxious to proceed. <hi>Will you ſeek out my poor miſguided huſband, and endeavour to reſtore him to the path of reaſon? Will you</hi> do all this? and on a ſuppoſition that my earthly father refuſes to accept the bill that my neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties once more impel me to draw on him, <hi>will you be contented to look for reimburſement to the common Parent of humanity?</hi> If you can anſwer theſe queſtions in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, follow the bearer of this tedious ſcroll, and entitle yourſelf to the everlaſting gratitude of her, who overwhelmed by affliction, reſts her laſt hope on the honour and liberality of a ſtranger.</p>
                           <p>Accept, Sir, my warmeſt wiſhes for the continuance of your felicity; and withdraw not your ſupporting countenance from the deſolate, and truly wretched</p>

                     <p>Adolphus haſtened on the fleeteſt wings of philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy—every thing the injured Henrietta had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted was exactly attended to. He ſpeedily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a letter to his lady, recounting every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; and the gentle Anna delayed not to addreſs the fair mourner in thoſe ſoothing ſtrains of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which an elegant female knows to ſelect, and which, penned by the hand of tender pity, poſſeſs an aſſuaſive influence, calculated to blunt the edge of the
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:034162_0899_0FFC5C11C9A1F140"/>
moſt impreſſive grief. She aſſured Henrietta that a more welcome gueſt could not paſs her threſhold; and ſhe urged her immediately to fly to an abode, the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of which would be enhanced by her preſence. Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus having accompliſhed the buſineſs that detained him, conducted Henrietta to L—, where ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by his amiable companion, in a manner exactly anſwerable to his wiſhes. A ſeries of delicate attentions were uniformly embodied, and no effort was wanting, which it was judged might leſſen the chagrin of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate ſtranger. Sebaſtian, however, continuing to elude her purſuit, ſhe at length became convinced of his unworthineſs; and every veſtige of eſteem being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooted from her boſom, the tender paſſion in a mind corrected by misfortunes, of courſe ſubſided, and ſhe had no remaining wiſh but that reſtoration to her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which pardon and reconciliation could alone procure.</p>
                     <p>Adolphus meditated a voyage to England, and the wiſhes of Henrietta accelerated his purpoſe. Arrived on the Albion ſhore, he procured an introduction to a confidential friend of the father of Henrietta. This friend was in the commercial line, and Adolphus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his cuſtomer. He made it the intereſt of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo neceſſary to his views, to viſit him at his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and in the courſe of a converſation contrived on purpoſe, he, as if by accident, mentioned Mr.—; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries relative to his family ſucceeded. "How many daughters has Mr.—, Sir? Is Miſs Eliza his eldeſt daughter?" "Alas! no—his eldeſt daughter is a ſource of much anxiety to her father.—Offending him by an ill-judged marriage, he was for a time inplaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble—and the poor lady hath wandered, we hardly know whither. You ſeem moved, Sir—ſurely you are not acquainted with her ſtory!—yet our laſt knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the lovely fugitive, was her taking ſhipping for America—and alas! without a protector! Your looks are expreſſive, Sir—Have you any intelligence to communicate? Have you ſeen her—heard of her? Where can ſhe be found? Does ſhe live? Is ſhe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py? Speak, Sir! for God's ſake, ſpeak."</p>

"I will, Sir, and with happineſs proportioned to your own. I left the lady at my houſe in L—; ſhe was in health, and ſhe conſtitutes the deareſt ſolace which, during my abſence, remains to the partner of my heart." This was enough—the inquirer, ruſhing from the apartment, was immediately out of ſight; and, ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the family of Henrietta, her kindred ſoon throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the welcome meſſenger of peace—father, mother, brothers, ſiſters, alternately claſped him to their boſoms—graſped his hands—poured fourth their glad oriſons to Heaven, and invoked bleſſings on the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch immeaſurable good. Now they eagerly queſtioned, and anon expreſſed the unutterable emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart, by the big tears of pity, love, and gratitude; and their deteſtation of the villain Sebaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, was only equalled by their admiration of her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane protector. Gladly would they have endowed him with the better part of their poſſeſſions; and the father of Henrietta, particularly, was unbounded in his demonſtrations of the rapt enthuſiaſm of gratitude.</p>
                     <p>Adolphus returned to America, bearing the olive branch, enriched with the paternal benediction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying letters copiouſly fraught with unreſerved love, returning confidence, and the moſt unequivocal marks of an entire reconciliation. Reiterated invitations were alſo wafted over—ſhe was conjured to bleſs once more thoſe native haunts, to take ſhelter in that pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal abode, where, from the hour of her departure, peace had been a ſtranger—and the comparatively happy Henrietta only delays her voyage to England, until ſhe can obtain from our Legiſlators a diſſolution of that contract into which ſhe ſo indiſcreetly entered, and which ſhe now ſo deeply laments.</p>

                     <p>WHEN I do not deeply commiſerate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy debtor, in whoſe boſom probity and punctuality are inmates, I ſhall be utterly loſt to every recollection of the various calamities to which my ſpecies are ſubjected. I do not ſay that the cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itor has not cauſe of complaint; he either loaned his property from motives of friendſhip, or he parted with it, indulging an expectation, that it would accumulate an intereſt which would ſtill augment his ſtores; and, if he cannot be charged with extortion, the tranſaction was undoubtedly juſtifiable: In either of theſe caſes, to deſpoil him of that which was legally his own, is a diſappointment on which he did not calculate, and which muſt be conſidered as injurious.</p>
                     <p>Yet if the creditor is in eaſy circumſtances, and the man in whom he confided is the victim of misfortunes neither to be foreſeen nor prevented; if it is notorious that he has ever been upright and open in his dealings; if he continued, to the utmoſt verge of poſſibility, punctual in his payments—What then?—Why then I declare, I regard a creditor thus connected and thus circumſtanced, as in a very enviable ſituation. To every benevolent mind, ambitious of accumulating good and proper actions, my reaſon will be obvious. He is hereby furniſhed with an opportunity of calling into exerciſe the nobleſt faculties which dignify human nature: It is at his option to embody the virtues—he
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:034162_0902_0FFC5C0D0B180AC8"/>
can pour into the wounded boſom of the ſorrow worn ſufferer, the healing balm of conſolation—he may even imitate Deity—he can forgive like that God who dealeth liberally, and upbraideth not.</p>
                     <p>Behold the oppreſſed man—he is bowed down by calamity—his heart is faſhioned by rectitude—it is the ſanctuary for every honeſt principle—but his beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed efforts have proved abortive—misfortunes have iſſued as a torrent, and they have deluged his moſt ſanguine expectations! With folded arms, contracted brow, and features, on which is imprinted the deepeſt anguiſh, he occupies his ſeat in that apartment where triumphed every refined and virtuous enjoyment, but from which, alas! the face of pleaſure ſeems now forever baniſhed! His gentle, his ſympathizing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion—but, ſtrange to tell, her power to ſoothe is no more!—"Dear ſource of domeſtic happineſs," he exclaims, "I have undone thee; thy manifold virtues but point the drawn dagger to my ſoul—every earthly bleſſing ſhould be thine—but he, in whom thou haſt placed thy unbounded confidence, hath miſerably failed thee. Ruin hath overtaken me—impriſonment awaits—and for thee and thy dear infants, where, amid this wide unpitying world, will ye find a place of ſhelter! Gracious Heaven! reflection harrows up my ſoul; and I tremble on the verge of diſtraction! God of compaſſion, vouchſafe to beſtow thy conſolations on theſe deſolate children of adverſity, and calm thoſe ſorrows which it is beyond the reach of human wiſdom to aſſuage." The afflicted fair one claſps her hands in ſpeechleſs agony—her eyes are raiſed to heaven—ſhe is bathed in tears—and her inarticulated miſeries affect beyond deſcription: The affrighted children cluſter round—they cannot develop the ſource of her ſufferings, but they behold her exquiſitely diſtreſſed—their little hearts are attuned to ſympathy, and they mingle their infantile cries. With a wild air ſhe preſſes them alternately to her boſom—ſhe pours forth the maternal benediction, and it is conceived in all the
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:034162_0903_0FFC5C0695032E50"/>
energy of ſorrow, while a more deeply agonizing ſcene can hardly be imagined!</p>
                     <p>Well, Sir, he owes you many thouſands—granted—but has he ſquandered thoſe thouſands in unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able indulgencies? Has he not been judicious in his plans; induſtrious in the proſecution of his buſineſs; and frugal in his expenditures? and is not this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly cataſtrophe produced by events wholly beyond his juriſdiction? Beſides, ſhould you take the only ſtep which can heighten his ſufferings—ſhould you arreſt and throw him into priſon—will this pay your debt? will it not rather put it wholly out of his power to make thoſe diſburſements which we acknowledge are your due?</p>
                     <p>See that door—it is more than half open; for thoſe victims of calamity are not ſolicitous to elude the purſuit of juſtice, or to hide from the ear of curioſity what they cannot conceal from themſelves. For the love of Heaven, dear good Sir, ſtep home; Borne on the wings of benevolence, you will not be long, and prepare a writing which ſhall remit the debt until the time when a more favourable turn in his affairs may enable him to diſcharge your demands; and ſuffer me to entreat, to conjure you, by that Godlike benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence which is at this moment originating in your boſom the nobleſt purpoſes, to give the heavenly ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation way—to continue to aid his future efforts—to aſſiſt in building him up; and, in addition to the divine expanſion which you will thus indulge, you may yet receive more than an equivalent for every benign exertion.</p>
                     <p>But diſcretion whiſpers that you are primarily to ſtudy your own convenience, and not imprudently place that property beyond your reach, which your own exigencies may claim. This argument has weight; and if, my dear Sir, there are not expenſes you are in the habit of allowing, from which you can, in a ſmall degree, deduct, it muſt be conſidered as unanſwerable. Suppoſe, for example, you were to leſſen the number of bumpers you ſwallow in the courſe of a day; wine,
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:034162_0915_0FFC5BD7ED50C4E0"/>
drank in ſmall quantities, operates as a cordial to the languid ſpirit—it is a noble reſtorative, poſſeſſing even medicinal powers; but a too frequent and copious uſe thereof, deſtroys its effect; and in the voluptuous embraces of familiarity its virtues expire. Is not the angel pity an inhabitant in the gentle boſom of your lady? doth not ſhe poſſeſs that charming benignity which ſhould ever ſtand conſpicuous in the female character? and are there no articles in her department which ſhe can retrench? Do you go three times a week to the theatre? go but once, and appropriate the four dollars you thus reſcue to the neceſſities of this poor bankrupt; and I dare pronounce that the entertainment you receive at the play-houſe will poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs augmented charms. In general, it is true, that the infrequency of enjoyments enhance their value, but the pleaſures of benevolence never create ſatiety. A repetition of virtuous actions becomes ſtill more productive of the moſt refined, delightful and elevating ſenſations; and the reaſon is obvious, their origin is celeſtial; they will bloom immortal in the Paradiſe of our God.</p>
                     <p>Well, then, my good Sir, under the auſpices of theſe deductions and regulations, even economy enliſts on the ſide of philanthropy.—Bleſs me! how expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiouſly you have prepared your articles of enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!—But let us not delay—the door, as I ſaid, is more than half open, and we will enter together—The paper is preſented—it is ſeized with a trembling hand—its contents are read aloud—Gracious Heaven! what an aſtoniſhing tranſition! But let me briefly ſketch its effects. A ſhock of electricity could not have been more inſtantaneous, or more general: The orient beam, ſucceeding to a night of darkneſs—No, this will not do—Reader, I have attempted too much—there are ſcenes, over which a ſkilful painter will drop the veil—Permit me to relinquiſh my deſign—and let it ſuffice to ſay, that deſpair in one glad moment is conſigned to oblivion—that the expreſſion of anguiſh is no more—that the cherub, Hope, throws on every feature its all radiant beams—and the emancipated
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:034162_0904_0FFC5C028B1251F0"/>
man has now no ſtruggles but to evince his immeaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſenſe of obligation, his conſequent gratitude, and the indefatigable zeal with which he will henceforward devote himſelf to the intereſt of his next to divine cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itor. His lovely friend more than partakes his felicity; the ſudden tide of joy ſeems well near to overwhelm her gentle ſpirit: The children cling around the knees of their common benefactor—intuitively they hail their guardian friend; and they will in future be taught to place his name next to that of Him, who is the alone proper object of religious worſhip and adoration! Are there, this ſide the elyſium of the bleſſed, enjoyments more exquiſitely delightful, more truly elevating than thoſe which are to be obtained from the contemplation of ſcenes like this? and, is it not true, that the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of him who is in the habit of producing them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proximates, upon theſe occaſions, to the Author of every good?</p>
                     <p>The cruelty of impriſoning a man for debt, after he hath yielded the laſt farthing he poſſeſſes, appears to me in a very heinous point of view. It is amazing that there ſhould be on this globe, nations who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body in their code of civil regulations, a legal right to commit this great evil! That decree which ranks a man, merely becauſe he hath been unfortunate, with the malefactor who is convicted of capital enormities, is ſurely deteſtable, and every idea of rectitude muſt revolt from its impoſitions. Liberty is too ineſtimable a bleſſing to be abridged, but in caſes which involve offences of the deepeſt dye. <hi>If the inſolvent debtor has ſecreted his property, the ground is then changed</hi>—the affair wears another face—he becomes <hi>criminal,</hi> and muſt fall into that claſs of men, whoſe degeneracy merits condign puniſhment. But if his actions are <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproachable,</hi> he is only <hi>unfortunate</hi>—he is entitled to the utmoſt tenderneſs; and I would as ſoon arreſt him becauſe he had laid in the grave the wife of his boſom, or the children with whoſe exiſtence his own ſeemed inſeparably interwoven.</p>
                     <p>Travellers into the interior parts of our country, inform us there are many tribes and nations on which
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:034162_0905_0FFC5C0108A36918"/>
we liberally beſtow the epithet <hi>ſavage</hi> and <hi>barbarous,</hi> that ſtand aſtoniſhed at the privileges we annex to wealth, and the conſideration with which it is regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>ſilver</hi> ſhould confer <hi>honour</hi> upon its <hi>poſſeſſor,</hi> ſtrikes them as a great abſurdity; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that an equal diſtribution of a commodity, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the neceſſaries of life,</hi> would be becoming ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional beings; and when they are told that a deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the glittering miſchief, frequently arreſts perſons in the bloom of life, ſeparates them from all they hold dear, and hurries them away to a dreary confinement, putting a period to thoſe exertions that they are ſtill capable of making, and that might be equally for their own emolument, and the benefit of that ſociety, of which they conſtitute a part! Liſtening to ſuch recitals, they queſtion the veracity of the narrator, and when convinced by circumſtances of the real exiſtence of this barbarous trait, in the government of thoſe who term themſelves the civilized part of mankind—they, in their turn, become accuſers; they evince the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt marks of aſtoniſhment, and horror; nor do they heſitate in charging the authors of ſuch an injurious inſtitution, with an utter dereliction of every ſentiment proper to humanity.</p>
                     <p>A thought this moment occurs to my mind—Would it not be beneficial, was it made an act of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature to appropriate public funds for the relief of the <hi>honeſt debtor?</hi> would not ſuch a benevolent proviſion be the beſt calculated to prevent fraud? and would it not ſtrikingly pourtray that true parental tenderneſs which ought to be a predominating feature in every government? Firſt, it would prevent fraud; for no perſons but thoſe who had <hi>demonſtrably</hi> yielded up their laſt farthing, ſhould be entitled to the benefit of the funds; and thus every ſufferer would <hi>become eager to deliver up the whole of his effects:</hi> and ſecondly, it would be evincive of the parental tenderneſs of government, for it would hold out to its oppreſſed children, that laſt reſource, which would prevent their ſhip-wrecked hopes from total deſtruction: And it would be well to apportion the ſums appropriated, according to the
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:034162_0906_0FFC5BF72FCAB5F0"/>
merit, previous ſituation, and loſſes of the ſufferer; if he had been embarked in enterpriſes calculated to <hi>promote the public weal—if his exertions had beautified a town or city—if he had ſunk beneath the magnitude of an undertaking too arduous for his abilities</hi>—if his education had been liberal—his habits of living, generous—his ſentiments refined, and his ideas capacious—if he had parted with a large property, without juſtly incurring the imputation of extravagance: A man thus circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced ſhould receive from the appropriated funds, according to the wiſdom of the legiſlature, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable aſſiſtance. If we are not miſinformed, the legiſlature of one of our ſiſter States, lately granted a lottery to a meritorious citizen who had been emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently unfortunate, for the purpoſe of paying thoſe juſt debts, which, through a ſeries of to him diſaſtrous years, had enormouſly accumulated, and which involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in their conſequences, many deſerving individuals. I would have purchaſed a ticket in that lottery, although I had been ſure it would have proved a blank.</p>
                     <p>I think it impoſſible to behold a deſerving man ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly precipitated from an eminence which ſeemed to be his birthright, and reduced to the neceſſity of ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with thoſe penſioners of an hour, to whom cuſtom hath rendered their ſituation tolerable, without the ſigh of regret, and the tear of commiſeration. What elegant building is that which rears its milk white front with modeſt dignity? the ſurrounding proſpects are truly pictureſque; nothing can be imagined more paradiſiacally enchanting, more truly delightful. This well planned and well executed model of architecture, riſes on an eminence which commands a handſome ſtreet; the views from the different wings of the building preſent a ſketch of both town and country; thus connecting, in idea, with its other advantages, thoſe ſocial pleaſures that conſtitute the moſt valuable enjoyments of life.</p>

                     <p>I ſcarcely know a more melancholy object than <hi>old age, combining poverty and diſeaſe!</hi> To depend, for our daily bread, on the caprices of thoſe about us, is a ſituation, at all times, and in every view, ſufficiently painful: But it muſt be peculiarly ſo, to thoſe who have been accuſtomed, in youth, to adminiſter to their own neceſſities. I ſhould regard dependence, even on my children, as a painful circumſtance.

Age has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated

a ſtate of ſecond childhood; and, perhaps, aged perſons may be ſo circumſtanced, as to ſtand in need of the utmoſt tenderneſs.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve, now, the regulations in this little commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The children are nurtured by indulgence—their wants, and even their caprices, obtain attention—their infantile prattle is enchanting—their wonderfully apt ſayings, and the ſtrength of memory they evince, are copious themes, which arreſt the ear, and monopolize almoſt the whole attention, of every viſitor—their queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are never conſidered as impertinent—they are commended for a laudable curioſity, and reſponded to with patience—At table, their appetites are conſulted—mamma reſerves every choice bit for them—and the deference they injudiciouſly receive, too often renders them tyrants in miniature. Does ſickneſs ſhow its pale face among them?—the diſtracted parents would move the univerſe in favour of the little ſufferers—with unwearied ſupplications they aſſail the ear of Heaven; and on heir reſtoration to health, joy rekindles in their boſoms.</p>
                     <p>But let us reverſe the picture. Behold the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pair!—Mark! with what heſitancy and manifeſt perturbation they make known thoſe wiſhes, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the ſmalleſt alteration in their ſituation—their moſt rational requeſts are characterized as unjuſtifiable complainings; <hi>and the utter impoſſibility of pleaſing old people,</hi> is expatiated on, with all the aggravating re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy of language. Remarks, originating in the wiſdom of years, are delineated as the tireſome lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacity of old age; and, if they attempt to retrace thoſe ſcenes, in which they paſſed the morning of their lives, the ſymptomatic garrulity is made the ſubject of petulant ridicule. Neglected, and conſequently deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, they ſeem as if of another, and inferior, claſs of beings—or if, willing to take a part in what is paſſing, they queſtion, or remark, they are either accuſed of tireſome inquiſitiveneſs, or are heard with a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous kind of ſilence.

                     <p>Reader—this is not a far-fetched or high-coloured picture. The Gleaner has witneſſed inſtances, even more aggravated than the example he produces; and while he is aware, that there are perſons, figuring as ſplendid ornaments of humanity, who have derived their higheſt enjoyments from "<hi>rocking the cradle of declining age,</hi>" he muſt, nevertheleſs, continue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the melancholy circumſtances, to which <hi>old age and dependence</hi> are too frequently ſubjected.</p>
                     <p>A ſpirit of independence has been regarded as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in the boſom of Americans.

Do not leave contingencies to anſwer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely for themſelves—cultivate habits of induſtry, and combine economy. If, in the full bloom of youth, and all the vigour of health, your abilities can no more than anſwer your exigencies, where are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources of ſickneſs, and of age?—<hi>It is proper you ſhould reflect</hi>—and it will be well to remember, that ſmall ſums, deducted from the expenſes of every day, and
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:034162_0911_0FFC5BEA2D2D6248"/>
judiciouſly laid out, may accumulate a fund, which may ſerve as the richeſt ſolace to the winter of life. Europeans charge Americans with a ridiculous, if not an unwarrantable, kind of extravagance. We are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, the accuſation is not wholly ill founded. If our information is accurate, the Pariſians, poſſeſt of property, to an amount which would almoſt ſeem incredible to an American ear, receive our firſt charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not even excepting thoſe in the diplomatic line, with abundance of civility, indeed; but their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments are as little burdened with expenſe as poſſible—they conſiſt, generally, of ſoups in their variety, and ſuch ſhowy trifles, as ſtand them in a very ſmall amount—and if the Londoner adds a pudding to his ſurloin, his gueſt muſt be of no ordinary deſcription. On the other hand, Europeans, viſiting an American metrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olis, ſtand aſtoniſhed at the laviſh profuſion every where diſplayed.

But it is not in the proviſions of the table excluſively, that we are thus remarkably profuſe.

The conſequence of American extravagance, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely that which reflection would predict. Property is continually fluctuating; and it is obſerved, that an inheritance, however ample and productive, is rarely
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:034162_0912_0FFC5BE38C9FA8B0"/>
found in the ſame family, to the third or fourth gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration. Perſons, we are informed, who are citizens either of France or Great-Britain, and who poſſeſs, in their own right, an eaſy competency, do not uſually conſider either the principal or the intereſt, as the proper reſource of health and vigour: <hi>The exigencies of the day are ſupplied by preſent induſtry;</hi> and the funds already acquired are reſerved as the ſolace of that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, during which, it is almoſt certain, they will become unequal to any arduous undertaking. Their ſons and daughters are early taught the uſeful arts of diligence and economy; they ſoon become ſenſible of the value of independence, and are elevated by the conſideration, that it is, in an important ſenſe, within their reach.</p>
                     <p>A refugee, quitting her native country, during the late contention between England and her, then, colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, obtained, after landing upon the Albion ſhore, a commodious ſituation in the city of Briſtol. She was a woman of obſervation, and, by conſequence, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and her remarks on the manners and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the people, among which ſhe was ſo unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly placed, were judicious, and worthy of that ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and penetration, which were conſpicuous traits in her character. But, among the various obſervations ſhe was from time to time induced to make, no cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance aſtoniſhed her ſo much, as the frugality and unremitted application of perſons poſſeſſing property, which, in America, would have been judged a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient foundation for the full indulgence of the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages of luxury; And among other inſtances of this deſcription, which ſhe collected, ſhe often mentioned with admiration, a young woman, enjoying, in her own right, ſeveral thouſand pounds ſterling, which were abſolutely at her own command, who, to her great ſurpriſe, earneſtly ſolicited the favour of being employed as her milliner.</p>
                     <p>Captain L—lately gratified me by a recital, for the truth of which he pledged that honour that hath never yet been forfeited. While he lay on the river
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:034162_0913_0FFC5BE206B9A630"/>
Thames, among the watermen who <hi>induſtriouſly</hi> ply on that celebrated ſtream, was a Mr. Swale, who diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed himſelf for his integrity, <hi>diligence,</hi> and punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality. He was particularly attached to my friend, taking in his movements a decided intereſt, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to avail himſelf of thoſe advantages, which youth and inexperience ſeemed to have placed within his reach. His demands were never exorbitant; and he took care to guard our young adventurer againſt thoſe frauds, to which he might probably be ſubjected from perſons leſs ſcrupulous. In ſhort, the ſervices rendered by Mr. Swale were many and important; he was ever upon the wing to execute his wiſhes, and would haſten with alacrity on meſſages of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant or trivial import. Neither the dreſs nor appearance of Mr. Swale varied eſſentially from the brethren of his order. He kept a kind of ordinary, whither the officers of thoſe ſhips, laying in his vicin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, frequently repaired, for the purpoſe of taking thoſe occaſional refreſhments that their exigencies required.</p>
                     <p>Captain L—was ſurpriſed to find Mr. Swale oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en refuſing, from thoſe to whom he profeſſed an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, any compenſation for the articles which he furniſhed; and his fears, that the man might eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally become the victim of his own liberality, induced him to preſs on him the full price for every repaſt he had taken in his ordinary. Mr. Swale was a general favourite with the American commanders, then lying on the river—there was ſomething clever about the man—and his facetious good humour, with the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alacrity with which he accommodated himſelf to their wiſhes, induced them frequently to ſolicit his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety when they met at the ordinary. It was at one of thoſe unceremonious aſſociations, that Captain L—expreſſed to a comrade his regret, that his ſhip could not proceed on her voyage, until he had received ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral hundred pounds, which would, at the expiration of a certain number of days, be due on the bills in his poſſeſſion. He obſerved, that he had fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed every other part of his buſineſs; and while
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:034162_0914_0FFC5BDBB23E7510"/>
he calculated the probable damage the detention might occaſion, he lamented the loſs of thoſe favourable gales which ſeemed to invite his departure.</p>
                     <p>"Make yourſelf eaſy, Captain," replied Mr. Swale, "the money is at your ſervice—give me the bills—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from me their value—hoiſt your ſails—and God ſend you a proſperous voyage." Captain L—eyed the waterman with a look of incredulity and ſurpriſe: He was at a loſs how to underſtand him—Was he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging that vein of humour for which he was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable? Was his benevolence ſo far intereſted, as to ſtimulate him to <hi>attempt</hi> borrowing the money? or, could he really command the ſum in queſtion? My young friend wears an honeſt countenance, and the perplexity of his mind being impreſſed on his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Mr. Swale added: "O! upon my troth, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, it is true—your waterman would advance a much larger ſum, to help an honeſt man, impatient to return to his family and friends: The money, as I told you, ſhall be ready at a minute's warning; and we will ſcorn to make any words about it."</p>
                     <p>Captain L—, divided, between admiration of the waterman's generoſity, and aſtoniſhment at his ability, contented himſelf by expreſſing, in general terms, his gratitude, and immediately went in ſearch of a perſon, who had offered to advance the money, upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration which he had deemed exorbitant: Yet, the urgency of his affairs had neceſſitated him to balance in his mind, the probable conſequences of acceptance or rejection; and he had determined to come to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion that very evening. He related to the uſurer Swale's offer, and the commercial gentleman replied: "Ah! that Swale has taken many a guinea out of my pocket; he poſſeſſes forty thouſand pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, independent of the world; and he is eternally engaged in acts of this kind, for which we dealers in money owe him little thanks." Captain L—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, accepted the generoſity of the waterman, who appeared overjoyed in an opportunity of obliging him,

                     <p>IT may be a queſtion whether the opinion that riches <hi>neceſſarily</hi> contract and indurate the heart, is the reſult of accurate inveſtigation, or whether in the firſt inſtance, haſtily adopted, it has not rather, like many other poſitions, obtained reſpectability from its anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and almoſt general reception.

in review before us, we might find reaſon to lament, in individuals of every rank, a ſimilarity of diſpoſition. Nature would probably appear equal in her diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while we were conſtrained to acknowledge that <hi>Virtue</hi> continued <hi>Virtue,</hi> even on a throne; and that, although retired to thoſe ſequeſtered haunts, where the ſplendor of opulence darted not even an oblique ray, <hi>Vice, nevertheleſs, retained its original deformity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Applied to, on a certain occaſion, by a female in diſtreſſed circumſtances, for pecuniary aſſiſtance, the ſtate of my finances at that time would not admit of my affording the ſufferer any conſiderable relief; and, although I was on eaſy terms with many perſons in affluence, whom I felt ſtrongly impelled to addreſs, yet accuſtomed to conſider <hi>riches as ſteeling the heart,</hi> I conceived that, wafted on the ſtream of pleaſure, and marking their hours only by a ſucceſſion of enjoyments, they would hardly find leiſure for a tale of ſorrow. "<hi>I adviſe you not to think of ſoliciting the great;</hi>" ſaid Cynicus, "take my word for it your ſupplications will be ineffectual; and you will beſides ſubject yourſelf to ridicule, if not to more ſerious reprehenſion." I was before heſitating, relative to the utility of an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I was conſtrained to confeſs aſſumed a very unpromiſing aſpect; and the ſentiments of Cyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus were not calculated to ſtimulate my efforts. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, however, preſſing hard on my ſupplicant, the pleadings of commiſeration were not to be reſiſted; and I boldly reſolved on an immediate appeal to the feelings of my honourable acquaintance.</p>
                     <p>It was, I recollect, a charming morning in the month of june—and the hours from nine to one were devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the proſecution of my deſign. I do not know that there is a period of my life, on which I can reflect with more rational and complete ſatisfaction. The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations conſequent on an obſervation of thoſe benign propenſities which occaſionally operate on the human intellect, on propenſities which unqueſtionably ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate from the Divine Author of every good, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurably delightful. To the parlours of the opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:034162_0918_0FFC5BCE915D57D0"/>
I found a ready admittance, nor was I excluded even from the <hi>bed ſide of the invalid.</hi> If I were at lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty to give names, and to delineate circumſtantially, I could a tale unfold, at which the lover of humanity would exult, and the heart of ſenſibility be made glad. It is with difficulty I check the ardour of my feelings—I would emblazon deeds of worth—I would preſent them to a liſtening world; and thus enkindle the glow of emulation. Yet, circumſcribed by the prohibitions of delicacy, I am only permitted to ſay, that I narrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed particulars, and was heard with reſpectful attention; that the angel pity became my advocate, and tears of commiſeration ſtreamed from many an eye; that my application was received with <hi>acknowledgments—every individual expreſſing a ſenſe of obligation for the opportunity afforded of relieving a child of ſorrow.</hi> Yes, the feelings of benevolence were benignly excited; exertions were cheerful, prompt and copious; and the exigencies of a diſtreſſed and deſolate petitioner were amply ſupplied.</p>
                     <p>I am ſenſible it would be eaſy to produce a contraſt to this ſucceſsful morning; and an inſtance of <hi>penurious opulence,</hi> this moment glides along the avenues of rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ollection. Paucius is advanced in years—it is beyond his power to expend his income—he has no child, and his accumulating infirmities muſt very ſoon lay him in the grave. Yet Paucius has never been detected in a <hi>voluntary</hi> contribution to the relief of the neceſſitous; and the annual tribute for charitable appropriations, which the regulations of ſociety extort from him, is yielded with no common pangs! Some buſineſs, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to a mortgage, <hi>the day of redemption having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired,</hi> obliged him, on a ſevere morning in January, to leave home very early. It was a critical moment—he ſtepped into his chariot without breakfaſt—and, being in haſte, he was not ſo well guarded againſt the inclem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the weather, as he would otherwiſe have been: He however arrived at the deſtined village, felicitating himſelf that he was in <hi>time to put the patrimony of a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male orphan beyond her reach;</hi> and, having thus <hi>pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly finiſhed the affair,</hi> he reſolved to return home by a
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:034162_0919_0FFC5BCD0B7A1C40"/>
ſhorter road. But, mark the folly of human wiſdom—John, unacquainted with the new route, loſt his way; and keeping his maſter abroad a full hour beyond his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, our <hi>poor hero</hi> was well nigh periſhing with cold and hunger. Conſcience, that faithful vicegerent, ever opportune in its admonitions, forcibly impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on his mind the diſtreſſes of thoſe children of penury who were doomed, with each revolving day, to reiterate ſufferings that he now found almoſt inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable. What wonders are wrought by ſympathy! In a tremulous voice he addreſſed his ſervant:</p>
                     <p>"<hi>John, it is a bitter day—a bitter day, John;</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when I get home, that I ſend poor James's wife and children a little fuel; and, do you hear, I will add ſomething for a breakfaſt too! <hi>Heaven help us; we ſhall not live here always!</hi> I ſay, John, you will be ſure to remember!" John ſtared, doubted, and replied, "<hi>Yes, Sir, I will be ſure to remember;</hi>" and, laſhing his horſes, he proceeded with more than uſual rapidity, until he produced his maſter at the gate of his own dwelling. Paucius entered—the armed chair, the blazing hearth, the ſmoaking kettle, and well ſpread table, awaited his coming—he fed luxuriouſly. John, too, made his breakfaſt, and, bowing moſt ſubmiſſively, informed his maſter that he was ready to convey his bounty to the family of James. "Stop, John—ſtop, John," cried Paucius, "we will defer what we were ſpeaking of—It is no matter now, child, <hi>the weather is quite moderate to what it was, and I dare ſay the wind will ſoon be ſoutherly.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>No, I do not affirm that benevolence predominates in every inſtance. Would to God that I could thus pronounce. I only contend that it is found <hi>indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately</hi> with rich and poor; and that it is neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred nor diminiſhed by wealth.</p>
                     <p>Two days ſince, as I was chatting with Marcella, in a little ſanctuary where ſhe receives her ſupplicants, a female aſſiſtant introduced a ſorrow-worn veteran; he bowed low to Marcella; the lines of his expreſſive countenance were affectingly marked; and while he
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:034162_0920_0FFC5BC54EB30408"/>
addreſſed her, (whoſe patronage he ſolicited) the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the ſoldier, ſtill ſtrikingly viſible, was ſtrongly contraſted by a deep ſenſe of humiliation. "I am a poor man, Madam—<hi>I was engaged in defending the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties of America—I loſt my right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> by a cannon-ball at the battle of Bunker Hill</hi>—I have a ſick wife, and a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſuffering children—my health is gone—I am old, Madam—there is a cold winter coming on; and I am a petitioner to perſons of ability for the means of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing." What an appeal to the feelings of an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can! But Marcella is governed by reaſon; ſhe does not indiſcriminately laviſh the bounty of Heaven; ſhe made the proper inquiries; her chariot was ordered out; on that very afternoon ſhe viſited the family of the ſoldier; his report was juſt; and both he, and his, are entered among thoſe who are entitled to her bounty.</p>
                     <p>I repeat, it is pleaſant to record inſtances of benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and, on this ſubject, thought produces thought, while many a little anecdote preſſes on my memory. An intereſting female, long ſince numbered with the dead, now meets my view. Her figure is ſtill before me—tall, thin, and emaciated almoſt to a ſkeleton—poverty, loſs of friends, and waſting ſickneſs, had done more toward furrowing her check, than the gently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denting hand of time. She was a widow, and her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were all helpleſs; her manners were ſimple and unadorned; ſhe was altogether void of affectation; and I believe ſhe could not have fabricated an untruth, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe might thus have ſucceeded to much wealth. It did not ſeem her aim to move the paſſions: She only obſerved, while holding in her trembling hand a ſmall parcel of powdered maize—(and ſhe delivered herſelf in a tone of uncommon humility and reſignation) "<hi>I have worked diligently during this long day, and this is all I have gotten.</hi>" There was ſomething in her countenance which pointed her words; and a languid beam, eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from her expreſſive eye, forcibly made its appeal to the heart. It happened that I was, at that moment, ſeated in the bow window in the parlour of Amanda,
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:034162_0921_0FFC5BC227840EF0"/>
while that lovely woman, ſtanding in the door, was giving ſome directions to her gardener. The pity mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing female had placed one foot on the lower ſtone of a flight of ſteps which led to the houſe, when ſhe uttered the before cited ſentence—"<hi>I have worked diligently dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this long day, and this is all (holding up the maize) that I have gotten.</hi>" "Step in, honeſt friend," ſaid Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, (and Heaven bleſs you, involuntarily exclaimed my heart) "you ſeem not well able to labour; accept this glaſs of wine, it will do you good."</p>
                     <p>The poor woman waited not for entreaty; with an air of genuine gratitude ſhe ſwallowed the draught. "Thank you, Madam; your wine is a cordial to which I have not of late been uſed." "Take a ſeat," cried Amanda, "<hi>I wiſh to converſe with you.</hi>" The patient ſufferer raiſed her eyes with an expreſſion of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and, glancing on her time-worn veſtments the glow of ſenſibility, which inſtantly pervaded her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſeemed to ſay, "Alas! alas! I dare not avail myſelf of your condeſcenſion." Amanda could read the countenance—"<hi>No matter,</hi>" ſhe rejoined, "I do not accept your apology; your garments are vouchers of your induſtry—I wiſh to know if you have any children?"—"Yes, indeed, Madam, I have no leſs than <hi>ſix</hi> children, and they are all young: We did bravely as long as Robert lived and was able to labour; but he fell ſick and died, and all that we had was not more than ſufficient to lay him in the ground; yet, after a while, we did well again, until I caught a fever which left me very low, but I am now getting better; my children, I bleſs God, are all well; and I would not part with one of them, if I might gain the riches of the world; this meal will once more ſatisfy their hunger: and, after all, it might have been worſe—He that made us, will, I doubt not, provide for us; and we ſhall hereafter meet Robert again in a better world." Her apparent tranquillity and <hi>genuine piety</hi> was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affecting. Amanda took out her purſe—She conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her benefaction her own liberal heart; while the indigent ſufferer, burſting into tears, attempted in
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:034162_0922_0FFC5BC0A35FC170"/>
vain to give utterance to her feelings. Amanda con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to watch over this daughter of ſorrow—ſhe viſited her at her cottage—ſhe contributed largely to her ſupport—her conſolatory ſoothings mitigated the pangs of diſſolving nature, and ſhe is ſtill the friend of her children.</p>
                     <p>Is it poſſible that the utmoſt malice of fortune can involve Amanda in a ſituation which will deprive her of the rapturous glow of ſelf-complacency, while ſhe reflects on this tranſaction? But the life of Amanda hath exhibited an unbroken ſeries of well-judged char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities.</p>
                     <p>I turn over another leaf, and a new ſcene preſents: A debtor, once immured within the walls of a priſon, now hails the incalculable bleſſings of light and liberty. He made application, by letter, to the teacher of a religious ſociety, ſupplicating for ſome <hi>ſmall pecuniary aſſiſtance during his captivity.</hi> It was on a Sabbath Day, juſt when the man of God was aſcending the ſacred deſk, that the addreſs was put into his hands; and, adapting his diſcourſe to the ſituation of the priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, he introduced and pathetically expatiated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Every word he uttered was pointed to the hearts of his hearers; and, glowing with benevolence, a number of thoſe, whoſe abilities correſponded with the liberality of their ſentiments, aſſembled in the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where they cheerfully made up a ſum more than ſufficient to procure the enlargement of the unhappy ſolicitor. The deputed committee repaired expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly to the priſon, the money was depoſited, and the overplus preſented to the captive, who, thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly liberated from a comfortleſs confinement, was ſuddenly reſtored to a beloved family, which had been nearly overwhelmed by deſpair. The whole of this buſineſs was planned and accompliſhed within three revolving hours; it ſeems to have been conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the true ſpirit of Chriſtianity, and is highly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of imitation.</p>
                     <p>Eugenio was a principal in the affair; but to Eugenio acts of kindneſs are familiar; I rejoice that he takes rank in the circle of my religious friends;

he makes it a rule to recompenſe injuries, as often as it is in his power, by a pecuniary benefaction. A perſon, not long ſince, who was a ſtranger to his uncommon virtues, entirely miſconceived an intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſaction, and became in conſequence his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enemy. It was in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ain that Eugenio aſſayed to juſtify himſelf; his foe was rude, vehement, and highly imprudent, and he loſt no opportunity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing againſt him. Eugenio aſſured him that he would embrace the firſt occaſion of ſeeking revenge; and he adviſed him, therefore, to be more ſparing of his invectives. Thus, for ſome time, they proceeded; the aggreſſor adding to, and aggravating his offences, and the aggrieved as conſtantly avowing his vindictive purpoſes. Misfortunes at length overtook the angry man; "<hi>woes do indeed too often cluſter;</hi>" he was ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of the means of living, and confined a cloſe priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er within the <hi>bare walls</hi> of a little tenement, which alone remained to him.</p>

                        <hi>Eugenio's hour of retribution was at length arrived;</hi> he immediately took in his affairs an active part; he approached him with that kind of reſpect, which true benevolence knows to pay to the children of adverſity; he liberally adminiſtered to his neceſſities, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed largely to his re-eſtabliſhment. The firſt viſit Eugenio paid to the dejected and deeply humbled man was inexpreſſibly affecting; his reſentments were all proſtrated, malice was diſarmed, admiration triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—and as he folded his exalted benefactor to his boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om, tears of unfeigned contrition bedewed his cheeks.—How noble was the revenge of Eugenio.</p>

                           <p>I CONFESS myſelf a convert to the opinion I laſt evening pertinaciouſly combated—Tranquillity of mind is not <hi>neceſſarily</hi> either conferred or deſtroyed by <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal circumſtances.</hi> Mrs. Hamilton, with beautiful mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty,
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:034162_0924_0FFC5BBD95EABBA8"/>
advocated this ſentiment; and although you continued ſilent, your approbation of your daughter's arguments was ſtrongly expreſſed in your countenance.</p>
                           <p>My morning's ramble has produced a conviction that I haſten to acknowledge; for I am anxious to ſupport an hypotheſis, which I now conceive ſtamped with truth and reaſon. The ſtorm having ſubſided, the keen ſeverity of the air, operating as a bracer, gave a very high tone to my ſpirits, and I determined to look in on a number of my connexions. I ſhall not aim at giving you a regular detail of my viſits—two only are to my preſent purpoſe.</p>
                           <p>The firſt was made to an old gentleman, who for the greater part of his life has enjoyed every thing which competence can beſtow; but reduced by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of misfortunes to penury, after having numbered more than threeſcore and ten years, he is now pennyleſs! he has taken ſhelter in a ſingle apartment ſuited to his circumſtances; and I found him alone, hovering over the remains of a coal fire, but ill calculated for a tenement much out of repair, and a ſeaſon ſo truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clement. I looked around, no veſtige of ſuſtenance of any deſcription appeared; I ſuſpected he was wholly deſtitute of the neceſſaries of life; and although I felt myſelf incapable of uttering a ſyllable, my diſtreſs was deeply marked upon my features; he read my concern, and laying his ſpread hand upon his boſom, with a ſmile of ineffable complacency, he gratefully ſaid—</p>
                           <p>"Ah my friend, you are miſtaken; it is true, for thoſe three days and nights during which the ſtorm hath continued, I have not ſeen a human face; it is true, that my pitcher of water, and a ſmall portion of bread, the laſt of which I have juſt ſwallowed, hath been my only ſuſtenance; but never have I paſſed three more happy days. Stretched on that little bed, or traverſing up and down this lonely receſs, <hi>I have enjoyed ſweet communion with my Maker; the bliſs of heaven is begun in my boſom; I have, Sir, no regrets, no apprehenſions, no impatience; I am all bleſſed hope, rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous anticipation, and calm reſignation.</hi>"</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="259" facs="unknown:034162_0925_0FFC5BBC0FDE31E0"/>
I was beyond meaſure aſtoniſhed; and, ſolicitous ſtill to detain the ſaint, who ſeemed on the wing to depart, I inſtantly quitted his abode; and, entering ſhe manſion of a ſon of affluence, the blazing hearth triumphed over the rigours of the ſeaſon. Nature, in a variety of her moſt beautiful productions, bloomed around; the birds warbled enchantingly in their gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed encloſures, and the genial month of June ſeemed ſuddenly reſtored.</p>
                           <p>"<hi>Where is your maſter?" "He is very ill, Sir.</hi>" I ſighed from a double motive; but I was admitted, on ſending up my name. I found my opulent friend deeply ſuffering from indiſpoſition of body, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible inquietude of mind; ſurely, thought I, Mrs. Hamilton is right. His diſeaſe was the eryſipelas. "I am ſorry, Sir, to find you ſo much indiſpoſed." "Oh faith, I ſhall never love the name of a ſaint again as long as I live, this ſame Saint Anthony has uſed me ſo ſcurvily." "It is a pity indeed you are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, you have quite an <hi>artificial</hi> ſummer there." "Yes, faith; but many honeſt people in this town feel it to be a very <hi>natural</hi> winter for all that." "True, Sir; and I have this moment witneſſed a ſcene which corroborates your aſſertion."</p>
                           <p>I then gave in my little narrative; my affluent friend was benevolent and liberal; the diſorders of his mind and body ſeemed to ſuſpend their progreſs, and he eagerly replied, "I remember this ſame old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lent me, when I was a boy, fourteen penſe; now I do not believe I ever paid him that little ſum; pleaſe to open that draw, take them crowns, and beg his accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; <hi>they may anſwer both principal and intereſt.</hi>" He inſtantly rung the bell—Thomas appeared, who was commiſſioned immediately to convey to Mr.—a variety of neceſſary articles, to add thereto <hi>a bottle of that old ſpirit, reſerved for ſpecial occaſions;</hi> and he was directed to let no day paſs without bearing to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable man a portion of the choiceſt viands which his table afforded.</p>

Our philanthropic invalid ſeemed now in poſſeſſion of felicity, ſimilar to that which had become ſtationary in the boſom of the old gentleman; and I ſaid, ſoftly, ſurely tranquillity is only to be found with <hi>virtuous and proper actions.</hi> I feel complete ſatisfaction in thus penning my renunciation of error; and I have, dear Sir, the honour to be your moſt obedient, very humble ſervant,</p>

                     <p>HARDLY a day paſſes that does not furniſh ſome new inſtance of the paucity of national attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our country. We regret much the frequent occaſions which impel us to reiterate expreſſions of concern, on account of an evil ſo truly alarming. The real patriot muſt neceſſarily lament the preſent aſpect of affairs. French men and meaſures—Engliſh men and meaſures. Theſe do in fact divide the majority of the people; while thoſe who rally round the ſtandard of America are reduced to a very inconſiderable party.</p>
                     <p>We are far removed from the elder world; the wide Atlantic is our barrier. Perſons of information affirm, that we poſſeſs within ourſelves the ſources of independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and it is certainly true, that the interior of our country, reduced to a ſtate of cultivation, would become amply productive, largely ſupplying every <hi>eſſential ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of life.</hi> Neceſſity is pronounced the mother of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention—Improvement follows; and thoſe elegancies, or ſuperfluities, to which we are attached, would, by a natural proceſs, become the growth of America. Why then do we not <hi>radically throw off every foreign yoke</hi>—aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:034162_0927_0FFC5BB22ABAF318"/>
ourſelves, and no longer delay to fill our rank as free, ſovereign, and independent States?</p>
                     <p>While I am writing, a circle of ladies in the next room are diſcuſſing this very ſubject, and a reſpectable female, in an elevated tone of voice, declares, ſhe had rather take the faſhion of her garments from an American preſidentreſs, than from any princeſs in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. We wiſh this idea was adopted, from the State of New-Hampſhire, to thoſe far diſtant and extenſive banks, whoſe verdant borders are waſhed by the waters of the Ohio; and that American habiliments, politics, and ſentiments of every deſcription, might hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward receive an American ſtamp.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps our deficiency in national partiality is in nothing more apparent than in the little taſte we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover for American literature. Indigenous produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are received with cold neglect, if not contempt, or they are condemned to an ordeal, the ſeverity of which is ſufficient to terrify the moſt daring adventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Mortifying indifference, or invidious criticiſm—theſe, in their reſpective operations, chill the opening bud, or blaſt its expanſive leaves, and the apathy with which we regard the toils of intellect, is truly aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. An original genius hath produced a ſentiment of the following nature: <hi>If the firſt rate abilities, cloathed in the habiliments of mortality, were paſſing through the ſtreets of our metropolis, they would be elbowed by the crowd, knocked down by a truckman, or rode over by a hackney coach.</hi> And we add—better ſo, than if they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the lingering tortures of the rack, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to ſuffer death under the axe of a mangling and barbarous executioner.</p>
                     <p>We do not ſay that the office of a <hi>candid critic</hi> is not beneficial, and even <hi>eſſential:</hi> But when an author, or his productions, are to be diſſected, in the name of every principle of humanity let a <hi>man of feeling preſide</hi>—let the operation be conducted by an artiſt, who, poſſeſſing the abilities to diſcriminate, will be governed by the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of decency. An informed, judicious, and well diſpoſed critic, will not wholly reject the influence of
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:034162_0928_0FFC5BAEB32790D8"/>
ſympathy; and his feelings will induce him, when call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into view a glaring abſurdity, to produce, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſome pleaſing ſelection, which may ſoothe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom he is thus neceſſitated to lacerate. When a work is to be analyzed, if the plot is deficient in conception, and in adjuſtment—if the ideas are extravagant, the events tragical, and the cataſtrophe improbable—the critic, if he is not a <hi>uſurper,</hi> if he is legally inveſted with the robes of office, will, however, find ſomething to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire in the ſtyle; and if it abounds with juſt ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and claſſical alluſions, he will produce them, not only with marks of decided approbation, but with triumph.</p>
                     <p>The ſtage is undoubtedly a very powerful engine in forming the opinions and manners of a people. Is it not then of importance to ſupply the American ſtage with American ſcenes? I am aware that very few pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions in this line have appeared, and I think the reaſon is obvious. Writers, eſpecially dramatic wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are not properly encouraged. Applauſe, that powerful ſpring of action, (if we except the ebullitions of the moment) is withheld, or ſparingly adminiſtered. No incentives are furniſhed, and indignant genius, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of its own reſources, retires to the intellectual banquet, diſdaining to ſpread the feaſt for malevolence and ingratitude.</p>
                     <p>If productions, <hi>confeſſedly indifferent,</hi> were, from the aſcendency of local preferences, <hi>endured in their turn, and received with manifeſt partiality,</hi> it would, perhaps, ſtimulate to more poliſhed efforts, and the Columbian Drama might at length boaſt the moſt finiſhed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions. But ſo far are we from evincing this predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection that even performances, decidedly meritorious, are almoſt forgotten. Tyler's plays are ſtrangely neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; and the finiſhed ſcenes of the correct and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Mrs. Warren, have never yet paſſed in review be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an American audience. Was the American taſte decidedly in favour of native worth, the ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of the Drama would find it for their intereſt to cheriſh indigenous abilities, and the influence of
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:034162_0929_0FFC5BAB8E754370"/>
patronage would invigorate and rear to maturity the now drooping plant.</p>
                     <p>To the celebrity of Mrs. Warren, it is beyond the power of the Gleaner to add: Yet, accuſtoming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to join iſſue with thoſe who yield the palm to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, he is conſtrained to ſay, that her excellent trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies abound with the pathetic, the beautiful, and the ſublime, and that they apparently poſſeſs ſufficient ſcenic merit and variety of ſituation to beſtow thoſe <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial advantages</hi> which are neceſſary to inſure their <hi>ſtage effect.</hi> Camps, palaces, cities—a view of the orb of day, juſt emerging from the ſhades of night—aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled ſenators—citizens paſſing up and down—a proceſſion of prieſts, ſenators, and nobles, addreſſing, in the attitude of ſupplication, a Vandal tyrant—gardens, grottos—a wilderneſs, an alcove—ſhouts of victory—a priſon, a battle—repeated acts of ſuicide. A ſucceſſion of theſe objects, would, it is preſumed, completely gratify the wiſhes, even of the moſt viſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary audience; and we ſhould aſſuredly attend with heightened and inexpreſſible pleaſure to that energet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic, beautiful, and ſoul affecting actreſs, Mrs. S. Powell, while in the characters of Edoxia, or Eudocia in the Sack of Rome, and of Donna Louiſa in the Ladies of Caſtile, ſhe delivered ſentiments truly intereſting, highly wrought, and tenderly pathetic: We have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in imagination liſtened to the language of Louiſa, from our favourite performer, and moſt admirably has ſhe pointed every ſentence.</p>
                     <p>We conceive that Mrs. Warren, while delineating Donna Maria, traced in her own ſtrong and lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous intellect the animated original which ſhe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, making up a judgment from information, which we preſume accurate, we have not heſitated to pronounce our celebrated countrywoman the <hi>Roland</hi> of America. The addreſs of Donna Maria to Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa, in page 119, is truly beautiful. The character of Gaudentius in the Sack of Rome is finely conceived, ſtrongly intereſting, and well ſupported; his reflections on diſcovering his murdered father, are natural and
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:034162_0930_0FFC5BA68384C1C0"/>
highly finiſhed; and it is impoſſible to read without a degree of penſive ſolemnity his ſoliloquy in the grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Maximus mourning his Aredelia dead, muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the ſympathetic guſh; and while the ſtory of the empreſs is replete with inſtruction, her accumulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed woes pierce the boſom of ſenſibility. Don Juan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Ladies of Caſtile, exhibits virtues which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him the kindred ſpirit of his Maria; and his native independence, his valour and his magnanimity are uniformly exemplified. The virtues of Conde Haro we ſpontaneouſly revere; and we liſten, with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar ſatisfaction, to ſentiments reſulting from benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and a juſt idea of the rights of man, as they are delivered by the adverſe chief, while the woes of Don Francis and Donna Louiſa excite our tendereſt feelings.</p>
                     <p>Contemplating theſe ſpecimens of our drama, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly excellent, a very natural inference preſents—If compoſitions of this deſcription find no place on the American ſtage, what can the more humble ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer expect? Are not the preſent arrangements highly impolitic? Is it not probable that talents, now dormant, might by proper encouragement be called into action? Is it not poſſible that paths, yet untrod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the regions of nature and of fancy, remain to be explored? and that under the foſtering ſmiles of a liberal and enlightened public, Columbian Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeares may yet elevate and adorn humanity?</p>
                     <p>The efforts of one of the moſt celebrated dramatic writers of the preſent century are ſaid to have origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in accident. If our information is correct, Mrs. Cowley was both a wife and mother before ſhe had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted even a paragraph for a magazine or newſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; her pen, appropriated to the claims of kindred or friendſhip, had produced only private letters, and to the toils of genius ſhe was a ſtranger. But being preſent at the theatre, during the repreſentation of a very indifferent play, which from caprice or partiality was, however, received with uncommon marks of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, ſhe was forcibly ſtruck with the inſignificancy
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:034162_0931_0FFC5BA4FA6186B0"/>
of many of the dialogues; and, conceiving that a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity of talents, with the requiſite application, would be fully adequate to ſimilar productions, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from the play-houſe with an irreſiſtible deſire to enter a career, at once lucrative and honorary.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Cowley was an early riſer; and ſhe paſſed the hours redeemed from the pillow, in the nurſery with her children, who were under ſuch regulations, as to admit of her purſuing, with pleaſure and advantage, her needle, her book, or her pen. It was on the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately ſucceeding the evening ſhe paſſed at the play-houſe, that, quitting the nurſery for the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſting parlour, ſhe preſented her huſband with the two firſt ſcenes in the firſt act of her comedy, called The Runaway. Mr. Cowley was moſt agreeably ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, and not only gave his ſanction to her enterpriſe, but warmly urged the proſecution of her plan. The play was accordingly finiſhed, and entruſted to a friend who was commiſſioned to encloſe it to Mr. Garrick, then manager of Drury Lane Theatre, as the production of a lady. A period was fixed for Mr. Garrick's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion on the merit of the piece, and its eligibility for the ſtage; at the expiration of which period, the friend of Mrs. Cowley waited on the manager, requeſting his candid opinion. The ſentiments of Mr. Garrick were inſtantly moſt flatteringly developed, not by an anſwer in form, but by a number of interrogations, worded in his accuſtomed energetic manner.</p>
                     <p>"For God's ſake, where has that lady lived? where is ſhe now? who is ſhe? cannot I ſee her?" &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Mrs. Cowley was ſoon introduced to Mr. Garrick—their firſt meeting was in a beautifully romantic tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which he had reared to the honour of Shakeſpear; and they exchanged ſome brilliant compliments, which received point from their alluſion to the <hi>bard of Avon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mrs. Cowley's play was brought forward with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſible advantage—the road to wealth and fame was thrown open to its fair Authoreſs; and we are told that no year has ſince revolved on which ſhe has
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:034162_0932_0FFC5BA3733ABF00"/>
not produced one, or more, highly finiſhed drama. Such are the fruits of judicious applauſe.</p>
                     <p>The Comedy of the Runaway was the laſt play that Mr. Garrick uſhered to public notice.</p>

                           <p>THE preſent prevalent rage for every thing theatri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, may render the ſubſtance of the following little an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecdote, relative to a celebrated performer, acceptable to your readers; and if your ſentiments correſpond with this idea, you will give it a page in your miſcellany.</p>
                           <p>Certain aſſemblies, <hi>y'clepped ſpouting clubs,</hi> in the city of London, have frequently been ſanctioned by the preſence of many of the nobility, among whom the Dutcheſs of—was in the habit of amuſing herſelf, by obſerving, in thoſe nurſeries of the drama, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious abilities of young perſons, who, animated by a patronage ſo reſpectable, exhibited with every poſſible advantage. It happened on one of thoſe occaſions, that the Dutcheſs ſaw and diſtinguiſhed Mr. Holland; and ſhe immediately marked him down as a future or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the Britiſh ſtage. Holland was a young man, well connected, and of decent life and manners; nature had been liberal to him, and he was by no means deſtitute of the aids of education. The ſtage had long poſſeſſed his warmeſt wiſhes; but the great point was, to make his <hi>debut</hi> under an auſpicious pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronage; and the Dutcheſs, informed of his views, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conceived the reſolution of recommending him to Garrick; ſhe had often conferred on this cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated dramatic performer <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> marks of her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; and it did not conſiſt with his intereſt to negative a youth, for whom her Grace had avowed a predilection. But if we may credit report, Garrick <hi>did not always lend his countenance to merit;</hi> it is certain he was oppoſed to Holland's advancement; and, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining intelligence of an introductory letter to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:034162_0933_0FFC5A81ED8876B0"/>
into his own hand, he determined never to be at home to the bearer. Holland repeatedly aſſailed his door, but the <hi>great man</hi> was always denied, and the youth deſpaired of gaining admittance in his own character.</p>
                           <p>He was not, however, diſcouraged; and his ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity helping him to an expedient, he obtained, at the price of half a guinea, the habit, baſket and tally of the lad who ſerved the family of Garrick with hot rolls; when, preſenting himſelf before the door of him whom he regarded as the arbiter of his future deſtiny, he informed the ſervant in waiting, that his maſter having taken a new apprentice, it was neceſſary old arrearages ſhould be paid off; and that he had accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly given him a ſmall bill, which he had directed him to deliver to Mr. Garrick. Garrick, ever atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to thoſe kind of claims, admitted the baker's lad without difficulty; and, ſeated in his elbow chair, in a morning gown of <hi>crimſon</hi> damaſk, he received with abundance of ſtate the folded paper, which prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to his great ſurpriſe, the introductory letter of the Dutcheſs, the redoubtable hero of the ſock and buſkin, caught in the toils, ſternly queſtioned, "Pray, young man, was there no way of preſenting this letter but in diſguiſe?"</p>
                           <p>"None that occurred to me, Sir; I have repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waited on you without ſucceſs, and I have at length embraced the expedient of ſerving your Honor with bread."</p>
                           <p>"Well, it muſt be confeſſed you have a fruitful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and having thus ingeniouſly made your <hi>entree,</hi> I preſume you imagine yourſelf fit for any thing."</p>
                           <p>"At preſent, Sir, <hi>for nothing but ſerving your Honor with bread.</hi>"</p>
                           <p>"Upon my word, you are wonderfully ready; but we wiſh for a ſpecimen of your theatrical abilities—begin if you pleaſe." Holland, throwing himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a commanding attitude, immediately with great pathos and propriety delivered a pathetic piece, appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and ſtriking; and the <hi>hauteur</hi> of Garrick was for a

moment ſuſpended; but, determined not to be pleaſed, he threw into his countenance a freezing quantum of frigidity, and ſuperciliouſly ſaid, "Mighty apt, and ſtudied no doubt for the occaſion; but you will pleaſe to favour us with an exhibition of your <hi>comic</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; you muſt be <hi>great</hi> in every way."</p>
                           <p>"Alas! Sir, I have at this moment no <hi>comic</hi> ideas!"</p>
                           <p>"But you muſt learn to aſſume; <hi>you are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence actor, you know.</hi>" The youth, flinging from his hand the tally, which he had held until that inſtant, tripped lightly over the floor, and, ſelecting from one of Mr. Garrick's beſt parts a favourite paſſage, he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly became prime miniſter of frolick; his attitude was that of humour—mirth revell'd on his cheek—Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia moulded every feature, laughed in his eye, and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his tongue; and even the riſibles of Garrick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his aſtoniſhing powers; but recollecting himſelf, and aſſuming great ſolemnity, he gravely obſerved: "Let me tell you, young man, there is a wide differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between reciting here, in a private apartment, and in appearing on a Britiſh ſtage, before the moſt auguſt audience in the world."</p>
                           <p>"Pardon me, Sir, I conceive that I am now before the <hi>moſt auguſt audience in the world.</hi>"</p>
                           <p>"Yes, yes, young gentleman, this compliment may be well turned; but permit me to remind you, the Britiſh audience is made up of the moſt reſpectable characters, of perſons poſſeſſed of power and ability to decide irrevocably your fate; and on the drawing up of the curtain, you are immediately in the preſence of thouſands, who will conceive themſelves veſted with full authority to pronounce your immediate annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! What think you will be your feelings at ſuch a moment! Can you ſtand an ordeal ſo ſevere?"</p>
                           <p>"Excuſe me, Sir, I humbly conceive I have as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent a ſtock of <hi>aſſurance</hi> as your Honor, or any other man in exiſtence." "By Jove," returned Garrick, "<hi>I believe it.</hi>" And, ſtrange as it may ſeem, this laſt ſtroke captivating the manager, Holland was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

                              <salute>SIR,</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>JUST returned from viſiting my friend Leonora, I ſit myſelf down to ſketch for your Miſcellany, an account of this my ſecond excurſion; and I do aſſure you, I feel, while thus employed, that ſort of ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which a well-diſpoſed woman will always experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when ſhe can, without doing violence to her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, expatiate upon the ſocial pleaſures of exiſtence.</p>
                           <p>But, firſt, it may be proper that I attempt giving you an idea of the character of my friend. Although ſhe was ſome years my elder, ſhe continued at the boarding-ſchool at which I was placed, during the whole term appropriated to my inſtruction; and, next to the dear woman to whom I am indebted for the vital glow of animation, ſhe contributed moſt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>ſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and to inform my opening mind; ſhe cultivated my taſte; and, originating in my boſom ſentiments of
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:034162_0936_0FFC5A7269D9DE00"/>
propriety, ſhe taught me to eſteem only thoſe enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were ſanctioned by reaſon. Nature had thrown into my compoſition a vein of ſatire, which I often reprehenſibly indulged; but Leonora beſtowed upon my manners the prepoſſeſſing poliſh of benignity.</p>
                           <p>She is a model of true politeneſs; and, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the preciſe point of good-breeding,</hi> while ſhe is ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to accommodate herſelf to all thoſe circles which ſhe graces by her preſence, ſhe is careful not to <hi>oppreſs by her civilities.</hi> Her deportment is uniformly a ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exemplification of <hi>lady-like dignity;</hi> and I have a thouſand times witneſſed the ineffable ſweetneſs of her temper. She has been at once the guide and compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of ſome of the happieſt moments of my life; and the tears which I ſhed at her departure from A—, as they were impelled by ſelfiſh conſiderations, ſo they will be reiterated as often as the importance of unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing events, enforce the neceſſity of the preſence of my ſweet and amiable monitreſs.</p>
                           <p>The ſtriking exterior and rare accompliſhments of Leonora, produced correſponding effects; and, after that mature deliberation which the magnitude of her ſubject required, ſhe elected from her train of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, as the companion of her future life, a young gentleman, who, born and educated in Philadelphia, poſſeſſes a handſome property in that city. His patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial inheritance was conſiderable; and his induſtry and frugality have made large additions thereto. The marriage of Leonora has been moſt happy; it has connected the higheſt felicity of which wedlock is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible, while every pleaſure has been enhanced by a lovely train of ſons and daughters, who, the probabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity is, will one day conſtitute the faireſt ornaments of ſociety.</p>
                           <p>Neither Leonora, nor her Evander, have any predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection for the diſſipation, in which a city life almoſt neceſſarily engages perſons of fortune; and Evander, cheerfully quitting a metropolis, where his anceſtors had figured with much reſpectability, and where he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had ſnatched a thouſand juvenile pleaſures, has
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:034162_0937_0FFC5A6C8275D260"/>
retired with his little family to an elegant receſs, upon the ſkirts of a broad and extenſive river. Here, ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering himſelf to thoſe enjoyments, to which his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple income entitles him, his hours revolve, marked by r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>tional and refined tranquillity. Having never ſeen Leonora from the time of her departure from A—, I was repeatedly ſummoned to her abode; and her retreat from the gariſh and tumultuous ſcenes of the buſy town, added new ardour to my wiſhes once more to embrace her.</p>
                           <p>But a journey of ſome hundreds of miles was to be taken; and having no other means of making my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion, than in the ſeveral ſtage-coaches, where I had recently endured much vexation, places for my brother and myſelf were again ſecured; and, departing from the capital at peep of day, buſineſs ſtill repoſing on the lap of ſilence, as we rattled through the ſtreets, we encountered not a ſingle human being; the ſhops were as faſt cloſed as in the dead of night; and the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the buildings, on either hand, ſeemed deſcriptive of the continued ſlumbers which the inhabitants ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged. Thus paſſing on, we were at full liberty to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, without interruption, that magnificent ſcene, with which nature, with every returning morn, preſents the amateurs of her arrangements. I have very ſeldom beheld the auguſt luminary of day ſo reſplendent; an uncommon degree of tranquillity pervaded my boſom; my health was perfect; and the tone of my mind ſuch as rendered it highly ſuſceptible of all thoſe pleaſures, deducible from a view of the ſublime and beautiful.</p>
                           <p>For the information of thoſe perſons who have not witneſſed the progreſs of the morning, from the firſt appearance of the dawn, to the moment when the plaſtic parent of day, <hi>apparently</hi> emerging from the ſkirts of the horizon, burſts in all its ſplendors upon the dazzled eye, I aſſay to ſketch the gradual devel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opment, which forcibly arreſted our attention.</p>
                           <p>The death-like ſtillneſs, immediately preceding the opening dawn, ſtrikingly contraſts the animated pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then preſſing upon the threſhold of obſervation;
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:034162_0938_0FFC5A69BB0B2878"/>
and we began our journey at that preciſe inſtant, when the intenſe darkneſs which enrobes the dreary night, drawing aſide its intercepting veil, gave place to the mild light of the crepuſcle, which, progreſſing from the horizon, whitened the whole face of that lucid curtain, that ſo beneficially ſhades the ſurrounding heavens. Every ſucceeding moment ſeemed to change the aſpect of things; for the cheering influence of that circle, which had beſtowed upon the azure firmament its ſilver hue, advancing from the eaſt, and embracing the wide-extended concave of the ſkies, all thoſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous objects that we had ſcarcely perceived, throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rapidly upon the eye—the new-born day commenced its progreſs, and the Aurora ſucceeded the crepuſcle—the gentle zephyrs were abroad—they ſeemed to diſperſe the gloomy vapours of the night—the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed atmoſphere became more pure—the verdant earth aſſumed its moſt beautiful tints—and the breath of morn was perfumed by a variety of ſweets. We aſcended a rural eminence, which commanded a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing view of the thrifty hamlet, and the air reſounded with the matin calls of the village chanticleer, while birds, of various notes and plumage, warbled upon the neighbouring branches.</p>
                           <p>Buſineſs reſumed its induſtrious career—the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, attended by the invigorated ſteed, harneſſed for uſe, appeared upon the plain—travellers thronged the road—and workmen, accoutred for the day, haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to their reſpective occupations.</p>
                           <p>Mean time, the broad horizon aſſumed celeſtial dies—the brightening crimſon ſtreaked the blue vault of heaven—paſſing clouds were tinged with the moſt vivid hues—the Aurora momently increaſed; and, advertiſed by this beautiful harbinger, we eagerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the aſcenſion to which it pointed, and nature at length preſented us with the moſt tranſcendent of her works. The orb of day magnificently uproſe; it burſt upon us in all its radiance; and, as we eyed its majeſtic progreſs, we fully acquitted thoſe ſages, who, unimpreſſed by the truths of revelation, proſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:034162_0939_0FFC5A66B8A67100"/>
at the approach of this auguſt "<hi>parent of ſeaſons</hi>" and "<hi>king of day.</hi>" The ſplendors of a <hi>riſing</hi> ſun aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the moſt benign aſpect—we bleſt the genial orb, and marked with gratitude its progreſs.</p>
                           <p>It happened that a beautiful little girl, on her way to a rural academy, who had never before beheld the morning footſteps of the orb of day, was ſeated in our vehicle. Her extacies and her aſtoniſhment were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable. Never ſhall I forget her ingenious attempts to give language to her ſenſations—Perhaps it was the firſt moment ſhe had ever diſcovered a want of words. With the endearing ardour of youth, ſhe aſſured her papa, who accompanied her, that ſhe would never again forego an opportunity of beholding a ſcene, which ſurpaſſed every thing that had before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged her attention; and if her reſolution and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance are equal to her ſweet enthuſiaſm, and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuſceptibility, I predict that, purſuing her ſtudies with uncommon avidity, ſhe will become a highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed woman. Her enchanting expreſſions and youthful wonder, I am free to own, augmented to me the felicity of the morning; and I embrace this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of reiterating my acknowledgments of grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude, to this lovely candidate for future excellence.</p>
                           <p>Fortunately for me, (that this jaunt might in every thing exhibit a perfect contraſt to my journey of vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious memory) our party conſiſted only of this charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing child, her father, my brother, and myſelf; ſo that I had an abſolute command of the ſpacious vehicle, in which we were thus adventitiouſly and pleaſingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: Of the front and back ſeats I was alternately an occupant; for both Miſs and her papa, while they too well <hi>practiſed the art of pleaſing,</hi> to overpower me by the dictatorial and oppreſſive repetition of <hi>
                                 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                                 </gap>,</hi> would, nevertheleſs, upon the ſlighteſt indication of my wiſhes, have placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in any corner of the vehicle which might have ſuited my convenience. Thus charmingly we came on, enjoying delightfully the pictureſque views, which luxuriant nature, in our progreſs over a prodigious
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:034162_0940_0FFC5A65299E53D0"/>
fine extent of country, every where diſplayed before us. We breakfaſted in a little tenement, that ſeemed fitted up by the hand of neatneſs; and, bringing with us the ſauce of appetite, the healthful viands which were prepared for our refreſhment, ſeemed to poſſeſs a new and uncommon flavour.</p>
                           <p>So paſſed the firſt day of our journey—and the ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arating from our aſſociates in the evening, who then reached the ſeminary, occaſioned our firſt regret. The ſecond day, however, proved equally propitious; the ſtage was not crowded; nor were we overburdened by <hi>ill-judged civilities.</hi> One old gentleman, led by an obſervation of a fellow-traveller, made many philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical remarks upon the journey of life. He ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſaid, that mankind, conſidered as the work of an all-wiſe Architect, muſt have been created with an <hi>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate view;</hi> and that, as the auguſt Creator was gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally acknowledged to unite wiſdom and power, and to be omnipotently and benignly good, the purpoſe of creation muſt primarily <hi>have been, the final felicity of the creature, who was formed preciſely according to the plan of a ſovereign, ſelf-exiſtent, and independent Being:</hi> Nor (he added) did it appear, that the children of men were <hi>endowed with any faculty, which conferred a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of counteracting the original deſigns of Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> "I ſay, then," continued our chriſtianized reaſoner, "<hi>that our being's end and aim is happineſs:</hi>" We are, in the preſent ſcene, ſtruggling for a better ſtate of exiſtence. Had we not taſted what we reckon evil, we ſhould not have known how, properly, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate the good; and the hour cannot be far diſtant, when, being "<hi>born again, we ſhall ſee the kingdom of heaven,</hi>" and become the ſubjects of that happy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, <hi>which leaves no "pauſe of bliſs.</hi>" For the departure of my friends, therefore, I ſhed no tears—when they enter this life, it is then they are but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryoes—they paſs through the dark valley—and <hi>the moment of their exit from this, is their birth into the celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial world.</hi> Hence, upon every ſuch event, which comes under my knowledge, I forget not to ſhall, by
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:034162_0941_0FFC5A5D448EFA18"/>
a ſong of triumph, the liberated ſpirit; <hi>and I am confident, that my gratulations contribute to enhance the felicity of the new-born celeſtial.</hi>" Yes, the old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was perhaps whimſical; but we were amuſed, and paſſed the day in his ſociety very pleaſingly: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, we continued remarkably happy in our aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, until the evening of the ſixth day, when, with the ſetting ſun, we reached the Receſs of Amity.</p>
                           <p>To do juſtice to the manner of my reception at the paradiſaical villa of Evander, is beyond the power of language. Leonora, whom I ſo immeaſurably love and honour, attended by Evander, and accompanied by her ſons and daughters, (a beautifully intereſting group) met me at the outermoſt gate of the <hi>receſs;</hi> and I ſaw, at one glance, that her native elegance and urbanity had become the inheritance of her children. As they conducted me to their manſion, the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate expreſſions ſpontaneouſly burſt from their lips, and I was welcomed with thoſe demonſtrations of joy, which were highly worthy our long continued amity. Evander is informed, ſentimental, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he is rich in mental reſources; he is well calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for the pleaſures of a ſequeſtered life; and the ſerenity of his ſoul impreſſes upon his fine countenance ſtrong indications of that "<hi>peace of mind, which good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs boſoms over.</hi>"</p>
                           <p>The manſion of Evander is emboſomed by tall trees, which throw around its avenues a venerable ſhade, and, penetrating the time-formed encloſure, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a gentle acclivity the well-built tenement preſents its ſnow-white front. It is entered by a gravel-walk, incloſed on either ſide by a neat railing, and bordered by a rich growth of various and beautiful flowers. The verdant plats, too, on the right and left, are charming additions: Indeed, every thing is highly rural; and the moſt pleaſing expectation takes poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the mind. The houſe is ſpacious, and ſeems to unite the ideas of ſimplicity and opulence: The out-houſes are judiciouſly diſpoſed, and admirably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious. I have ſaid, that the eſtate of Evander, is
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:034162_0942_0FFC5A5BBAA7D6B0"/>
waſhed by a copious and fertilizing river, and its wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing courſe, forming a number of indented points, moſt pleaſingly diverſifies the view, and produces a truly enchanting effect.</p>
                           <p>The tract of land in the poſſeſſion of Evander, is a location, compriſing many hundred acres; it is a patrimonial inheritance, and in a high ſtate of cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it poſſeſſes great fertility of ſoil, and ſalubrity of climate. Many weeks paſſed before I had meaſured it with the ſteps of an inveſtigator; for I was not <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated</hi> over the grounds, at the <hi>pleaſure of the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etor, but cheerfully attended when I propoſed a walk.</hi> The lands, as I ſaid, are rich, and abundantly productive; and the air, highly impregnated with ſweet fern, and other fragrant odours, breathes an aromatic gale, while we gratefully quaff its ſalutary properties. Woods and lawns, hills and dales, meandering ſtreams, and trees, of various growth and fruit, alternately arreſt the eye. The maple tree, among the reſt, (the ſaccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine quality of which promiſes to become a new ſource of independence to this continent) yields to the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants of the receſs, its richeſt ſweets. Nothing can be imagined more highly pictureſque, than many of the views upon this fine and well improved eſtate. The uniformity of the verdant plains is not ſufficiently extenſive to offend; gentle aſcents are thrown over the grounds; theſe are adorned by the richeſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and variegated by tall trees, which, ſpreading their ample foliage, lift their green heads, delightfully finiſhing the ſcene. The groves and viſtas upon the eſtate of Evander, may be conſidered as ample and commodious aviaries, where the birds melodiouſly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and no luckleſs hand, armed for their deſtruction, dares to moleſt their operations.</p>
                           <p>There is, in agricultural life, a degree of independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that at once ennobles and tranquillizes the ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it; it beſtows that ſecurity, which is very conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial with the feelings of humanity. Thomſon ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly deſcribes the felicities of rural retirement; and Evander is, in fact, the ſentimental recluſe delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eated

by the poet. Order and propriety preſide in his family; his Leonora is ever rationally indulgent; and her abode is the reſidence of harmony.</p>
                           <p>A retired apartment in the receſs is conſecrated to devotional exerciſes; it is their little chapel; and thither, with each returning morning, and ſucceeding evening, the individuals of this happy family collect, to do homage to that Supreme Being, whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider as their Creator, Redeemer, and Preſerver, whom they are taught to regard as a Univerſal Father, and from whoſe benevolent arrangements they confidently look for a ſtate of the higheſt ultimate felicity. To their morning oriſons ſucceed the employments of the day, and they occupy their appropriated hours.</p>
                           <p>It is the great buſineſs of Evander and Leonora, to render their children good and happy: They are themſelves their preceptors; and their abilities are fully adequate to this important avocation. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals of the intereſting little group, without an exception, evince an inſatiable thirſt for knowledge; and, as each valuable propenſity is excited and drawn forth by their admirable parents, it will readily be conceived, that their education advances with propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable celerity. They are already entered ſtudents of nature; and, anticipating a few years, by the help of imagination, I liſten to their inveſtigations, deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both information and pleaſure, while they trace the flowers which they collect in their woodland walks, to their reſpective claſſes, orders, and ſpecies. Their proficiency in muſic and drawing, their time of life conſidered, is prodigious. They can already ſketch a reſemblance of the landſcape which pleaſes them; and never ſhall I forget the ſweet magic of their voic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, whether they perform a <hi>ſolo,</hi> or join in full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert: Yet, although their abilities in this way are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, they are <hi>not ſolicitous</hi> to charm you, whether you will or not; and a degree of retiring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance is ſufficiently manifeſt.</p>
                           <p>The buſtle of parade, and all thoſe ceremonies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent on an oſtentatious diſplay of opulence, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

unknown at the Receſs. Genuine hoſpitality aſſumes its moſt captivating garb, and <hi>real enjoyments</hi> are obtained. Unembarraſſed by ill-judged importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, gueſts are permitted to make their own elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while, with flattering alacrity, every individual is on the wing to gratify their wiſhes; and juſtice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels the acknowledgment, that I have never paſſed days more rationally ſerene than at this ſentimental retreat. Tumult and diſorder, of every deſcription, are baniſhed thence—buſineſs and pleaſure are alike regularly arranged—the bill of fare for every day is ſtated—the ſeveral diviſions of the week preſent their appropriate covers—and if the unexpected arrival of company (which, in this family, is always a pleaſing, circumſtance) neceſſitates an augmentation of their number, the requiſite ſteps are taken without confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or the obſervation of the traveller.</p>
                           <p>Evander and Leonora are the common benefactors of their neceſſitous neighbours. The anſwer of a peaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to a ſtranger, inquiring who inhabited the elegant manſion of Evander, will give an idea of the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments entertained of them by the humble tenants of the ſoil.</p>

                     <p>I DO not know when I have ſeen a more charming evening than the laſt—the ſtars ſhone with unuſual brilliancy; and the moon, in full orbed majeſty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the ſcene her higheſt finiſhing. Standing in my door, I was induced, by the delightfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive ſerenity that every where prevailed, to indulge in a contemplative ramble, which I cloſed by a peep upon Margaretta, ſhortening the diſtance, by turning my ſteps to a winding path-way acroſs the meadows, that we have faſhioned for the convenience of ſeeing each other, with that facility which our unalterable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment demands. I found that lovely woman oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in a manner truly congenial with her feelings, and completely worthy her character. She had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed her afternoon in preparing letters, which ſhe propoſes to diſpatch to the ſeveral emporiums in the Union, that they may be on their way to Europe and the Weſt-Indies, for the purpoſe of relieving a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late female, whom Providence has thrown under her protection.</p>
                     <p>On entering the parlour of my daughter, I beheld her ſeated on a ſofa with an intereſting ſtranger, who was clad in deep mourning. Margaretta was endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring, in ſtrains of ſoft commiſeration, to ſoothe and tranquillize the perturbed ſpirits of the fair afflicted, while the mingling ſenſations of grief, joy, gratitude, and admiration, apparently ſtruggling in the boſom of the ſtranger, proving too powerful for a frame that had encountered ſevere and repeated ſhocks of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, ſhe was on the point of fainting, when Mrs. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilton, ringing for her woman, aſſiſted in conducting her to an apartment, previouſly appropriated, to her
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:034162_0946_0FFC5A4E9F8ADFF8"/>
accommodation. Wrapping my arms about me, I waited in ſilent aſtoniſhment for an eclairciſſement, which I doubted not would confer additional ſplendor on the character of my daughter. She ſoon returned, with the deſired explanation on her lips; and while ſhe recounted the ſubſtance of the following ſorrow-marked narrative, her fine eyes were lighted up with an expreſſion, which even ſurpaſſed their native luſtre—the fervour of benevolence communicated to her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting countenance a dazzling radiance—ſhe ſeemed all ſoul—and the moſt ſyſtematic ſtoic muſt have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced her irreſiſtibly lovely.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Hamilton has thrown acroſs an extenſive piece of ground, a gravel-walk, which he has taken much pains to level and beautify: Every day the gardener is employed in cleaning, ſmoothing and poliſhing its ſurface; and, in point of order, it is not inferior to any of our public walks. It is contraſted, on either hand, by enamelled lawns, cloathed with delightful verdure; and it is bordered by tall trees, whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twining branches form a gratefully capacious ſhade. At the bottom of this charming viſta, a glaſſy ſtream winds its meandering courſe; and its pleaſing mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs produce a romantic effect. It is ſeparated from the grounds by a white Chineſe railing, and terminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a gentle acclivity, the ſummit of which is crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with trees of various growth. This walk, which is properly the Village Mall, is entered by arched gates, and it is furniſhed with convenient ſeats. Free egreſs and regreſs is allowed to the decent villager; and, as the curioſity of the travelling ſtranger fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently draws him thither, during the ſpring, ſummer, and autumn months, a ſervant is ſtationed in the Mall, who tenders cool lemonade, wine, milk, and a variety of fruits, and other light refreſhments, which are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared, and which, to the way-worn paſſenger, are often highly acceptable.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Hamilton appropriates a ſtated period in ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery fine day to this enchanting walk; ſhe is generally accompanied by her children; and thoſe among her
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:034162_0947_0FFC5A4A9AC8BC38"/>
humble or neceſſitous friends, who have any petition to prefer, frequently meet her there. The morning of yeſterday, being remarkably mild, ſhe entered the promenade at an earlier hour than uſual. William, who is a ſentimentaliſt from the cradle, tripped by her ſide. She led the little Margaretta by the hand. Mary-Auguſta was borne in the arms of a roſy cheeked Hebe, who particularly ſuperintends the gambols of the children; and the tenderly intereſted parent, thus preſiding the guardian of innocence, ſeemed to move a being of a ſuperior order, while that complacency, which is the offspring of uniform goodneſs, manifeſtly irradiated every feature. She had not advanced many paces, when her attention was arreſted by a female, clad in the habiliments of ſorrow, who, kneeling before one of the ſeats, was apparently offering up her ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the common Parent of the univerſe. Her geſtures were deſcriptive of extreme anguiſh of ſpirit; and they were ſufficiently expreſſive to intereſt the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt commiſeration.</p>
                     <p>Margaretta, directing the children to paſs on, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the ſuffering ſtranger with that kind of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious deference, and reſpectful veneration, with which thoſe, who enjoy the ſunny beams of proſperity, ſhould uniformly regard the ſons and daughters of misfortune. Far from interrupting the rites of devotion, ſhe ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly raiſed her hands and eyes to heaven, by a ſilent ejaculation calling down from thence, that ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ediction which might inveſt the proſtrate mourner with returning peace. It was in this moment of affecting ſympathy, that the truly intereſting ſupplicant, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, with heart piercing ſighs, her kneeling poſture, turned ſuddenly round, and beholding Margaretta in the pious attitude of petitioning the Omnipotent Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, a crimſon hue ſuffuſed her grief-worn counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which was immediately ſucceeded by a death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like paleneſs.</p>
                     <p>Margaretta reſpectfully ſeated the trembling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and placing herſelf beſide her, addreſſed her in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> language of conſolation. The ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:034162_0948_0FFC5A47A0F47E30"/>
after gazing with fixed aſtoniſhment, at length in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted—"Ah! Madam, I cannot be miſtaken—your figure, your features, and, above all, your peace-ſpeaking and highly ſoothing accents, all combine to announce you: The world cannot have produced ſuch another. You are, you muſt be, Mrs. Hamilton! Two miles from B—, I was told, the angel reſided; and, impelled by neceſſity, I have meaſured my weary ſteps to this abode. Speak, dear lady—Are you not, indeed, that Margaretta Hamilton, who is ſo well known to the family of the unfortunate?" "My name is Margaretta Hamilton, Madam," replied my daughter, "but I cannot but wonder, by what chance it is rendered familiar to you!" "Excellent lady!" rejoined the ſtranger, "the trump of fame is liſted on high; and it faileth not to proclaim thoſe meritorious votaries of virtue, whoſe deeds of worth, regiſtered in immortal annals, confer an elevation, <hi>which will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, when every earth-born pleaſure may be engulphed in oblivion!</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Margaretta, bowing, obſerved that, to whatever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident ſhe might owe the preſent addreſs, ſhe ſhould certainly feel it incumbent upon her, to call into action every effort, which might contribute to the relief of a perſon, apparently ſo deep a ſufferer, and that ſhe only waited to learn her wiſhes, in order to engage in the moſt prompt execution thereof. The ſtranger, now claſping her hands, with a wild air exclaimed: "Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of benevolence! my ſpirit proſtrates before thee!—Yes, Madam, my name is Wretchedneſs! Fortune, family, huſband, children—theſe are all buried beneath the waves of calamity! That little parcel," pointing to an enfolded handkerchief ſhe had thrown on an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining ſeat, "contains my whole of worldly prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty! I ſlept laſt night in an apartment, which is no longer mine; and I have not, now, where to lay my head!"</p>
                     <p>Previous to this exclamation, the children had join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their mother; and little William, in the true ſpirit of infantile philanthropy, catching the falling hand
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:034162_0949_0FFC5A44879D8A08"/>
of the pity-moving ſtranger, ſobbed out: "You ſhall go home with mamma, Madam—papa will love you, too—and you ſhall ſit in my chair—and when night comes again, and you are tired, you ſhall lay down on little William's bed, and we will ſleep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether—Shall we not, mamma?"</p>
                     <p>The children of Margaretta, accuſtomed to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſucceſſion of ſtrangers, never ſhrink from a new face; and the charming ſenſibility, which the little fellow ſo properly evinced, communicated to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of his mother, thoſe rapt ſenſations that diſdain the garb of language. The fair unfortunate dropt upon his lovely face the tear of ſilent admiration; and Margaretta, after claſping him to her heart, and enriching him with her maternal benediction, diſmiſſed him and his ſiſters, bidding them expect a continuation of their walk at the cloſe of day—when, turning to the weeping mourner, ſhe thus addreſſed her: "And now, Madam, you may, without interruption, pour into my ear the tale of woe, which my foreboding heart aſſures me, the catalogue of your ſufferings will unfold."</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>"Uniform benignity," replied the fair unknown, will never conſider the child of ſorrow as an intrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and, to the patient hearing of benevolence, the preſſure of calamity is a ſufficient paſſport. I have ſought you, Madam, on purpoſe to lay before you my ſituation, to ſupplicate your advice and aſſiſtance; and, the better to entitle myſelf thereto, I will briefly narrate the moſt eſſential circumſtances of my life. I have, I bleſs God, no ſcenes of guilt to unfold, although I have ſometimes thought that, too much elated by proſperity, the arrogance of my elevation may have placed in my hands the chalice of affliction.</p>
                        <p>I was born in Belfaſt, in Ireland. My father is, or <hi>was,</hi> a diſtiller of ſome eminence; and his induſtry and frugality placed his family in a ſituation, which, without doing any great violence to language, may be termed affluent. I had the misfortune to loſe my mother while young; and the indulgence to which ſhe had accuſtomed me, rendered that cold reſerve, and
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:034162_0950_0FFC5A4305CAF0D0"/>
thoſe reſtraints that were perhaps neceſſary, and to which I was almoſt immediately ſubjected, painfully irkſome. Girls naturally ſhrink from the control of a ſtep-mother; and, although I have known many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy women, who have meritoriouſly diſcharged the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous duties of that department, yet the odium, too generally affixed to the character, is not eſſentially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed. For me, I gladly availed myſelf of the goodneſs of my father, who placed a boarding-ſchool education in my option; and I was entruſted to the care of two reſpectable maiden ladies, who had long been in the habit of inſtructing young girls.</p>
                        <p>In this ſeminary, while no genteel accompliſhment was neglected, the pupils were required to prepare for themſelves every article of their apparel: Our judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preceptreſſes obſerving that, if the contingencies of life reduced us to the neceſſity of calling into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any extraordinary exertions, reſources would thus be multiplied, and that, even on the ſuppoſition, we were adopted into the family of proſperity, uſeful knowledge would never impede our advancement. Often have I bleſſed the provident care of theſe ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable women: The habits of economy and induſtry, to which they accuſtomed me, at all times beneficial, have lately proved my only ſupport.</p>
                        <p>At fourteen, I returned to the abode of my father, where I continued until I had completed my ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year; at which period my ſiſter wedded Mr. James L—r, a portrait painter, of conſiderable abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who poſſeſſed a plantation in St. Chriſtopher's, to which iſland ſhe agreed to accompany him. My two brothers, and two of my maternal uncles, having long meditated a ſettlement in America, embraced this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of putting their plan in execution; and I could not reſiſt the inducement which ſo fair an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion furniſhed, of reputably freeing myſelf from the juriſdiction of an aſſuming and petulant woman. I petitioned my beloved father, for leave to accompany the individuals of our family, who were about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; and ſuch was the mildneſs of his diſpoſition,
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:034162_0951_0FFC5A3BF06CD1F0"/>
that it was with difficulty he ever put a negative on the wiſhes of his children: Yet he affectionately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, until, on my aſſuring him, that after viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the new world I would again return to his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, he condeſcended to withdraw his objections, and beſtowed upon me a benediction, which was as the richeſt treaſure to my ſoul.</p>
                        <p>We left Ireland immediately on the cloſe of that war, which emancipated the United States from the domination of Great-Britain, and after a propitious paſſage, we landed in Maryland. Here our family ſeparated. My ſiſter accompanied her huſband to St. Chriſtopher's. One of my uncles, attended by my youngeſt brother, accepted an advantageous offer of viſiting Portugal, where, it is probable, they are now doing buſineſs; and my other uncle, diſſatisfied with his ſituation, departed from us with an avowed inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of purchaſing an inheritance in the Northern States. My eldeſt brother took a houſe in Maryland, the ſuperintendence of which he committed to me; and our days paſſed on in tolerable tranquillity. My brother contracted an acquaintance with ſeveral gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in Pennſylvania; and, viſiting Philadelphia, we paſſed ſome happy days in that metropolis.</p>
                        <p>It was on our return to Maryland, that I firſt ſaw Doctor M—, a young man, who appeared to me poſſeſſed of every virtue. His extraction was French; but he ſpoke Engliſh with facility. He had ſtudied phyſic with Doctor—of Philadelphia; and he was then commencing the career of life, under the auſpices of a good underſtanding, much information, ſome property, and great benevolence of heart. His atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to me were marked by the tendereſt aſſiduities, and my prepoſſeſſion in his favour augmented with every paſting moment. Dear object of my ſoul's beſt affection! how is it that I endure a world, from which, alas! thou art forever flown?—But peace, my burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart—yet a little while, and I ſhall forget to weep—I ſhall rejoin, in regions of bleſſedneſs, him, to whom my early vows were ſo rapturouſly devoted!</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="286" facs="unknown:034162_0952_0FFC5A3A3B859068"/>
Doctor M—, Madam, ſolicited my hand in marriage; and my brother, availing himſelf of the authority delegated to him by my father, conferred upon our mutual attachment the fulleſt ſanction. My lover poſſeſſed grounds in Cape Francois. It was his determination to enter into buſineſs at the Cape; and my brother had long contemplated a removal thither. We were ſoon eſtabliſhed at Cape Francois; and our nuptials were not long delayed; after which, my brother, urged by motives of intereſt, once more changed his reſidence for a ſituation in St. Vincent's.</p>
                        <p>Yet, although our family party was thus ſtrangely diſperſed, my huſband continued the aſſiduities of the lover. My father had written to us; and, beſtowing upon our union the moſt unequivocal approbation, he enriched us with his paternal bleſſing, and I eſteemed myſelf the happieſt of women. Doctor M—, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in his profeſſion, was ſucceſsful beyond our moſt ſanguine hopes: The birth of children crowned our wiſhes; and three promiſing girls ſeemed to complete, for me, my ſum of joy. My ſiſter L—r was not ſo happy as to become a mother; and with much reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance I yielded, to her frequent importunities, my firſt pledge of love. I parted with my dear Amelia with floods of tears; and ſhe accompanied her uncle L—r to the Iſland of St. Chriſtopher's. Alas! theſe eyes have never ſince beheld her; and I am ignorant if either ſhe or my ſiſter are yet in exiſtence! Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately on her departure, the troubles in the Weſt-India iſlands commenced. A friend, driven from her hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation, ſought and obtained ſhelter with us. She had not been many days our inmate, when ſhe was ſeized with the ſmall-pox. Neither myſelf, nor my children, had ever paſſed through that fatal diſorder—ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion was communicated—I was brought to the verge of the grave—and my babes—my darling babes—became the victims of the deſpoiler! Yet, I bleſs thee, O my Redeemer! on their behalf; for, ſheltered in the boſom of their God, they thus eſcaped the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtrous fate, for which their hapleſs parents were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved!
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:034162_0953_0FFC5A38B9B4C420"/>
I mourned over the early graves of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; but my dear, my affectionate huſband was continued to me; and, although the ſmall-pox had made ſhocking ravages in my face, his tenderneſs was in no ſort diminiſhed, and his delicate attentions were, if poſſible, more marked, more uniform than before. Generous lover! friend! huſband!—But, great and good God! he is now numbered with the dead! while I, comfortleſs and forlorn, can only recount the ſtory of my woes, and wiſh, in vain, for that parting ſigh, which is to waft me from this ſcene of wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs!</p>
                        <p>Forgive me, Madam—I will reſume my narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Months rolled on; and when, uſhering into being my fourth infant, I became the mother of a lovely boy, joy once more reviſited my lacerated bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom—but tranſient and momentary was the gleam. Upon the very evening on which my little cherub had completed his third week, after folding him to my throbbing heart, I committed him to the care of his nurſe—ſhe conveyed him to his apartment—and I ſaw him no more! Doubtleſs, he periſhed in the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral wreck! It was midnight, when the blacks ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on us—every thing was rifled—My huſband, my adored huſband, was murdered in attempting to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me!—and the ſword was pointed at my boſom alſo! At ſuch a criſis, it is aſtoniſhing that I recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized the very man whom I had employed as my hair-dreſſer, and whom I had repeatedly reſcued from ſuffering. Coward nature, appalled at the fearful car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, mechanically exclaimed—Is it poſſible? Am I to receive the ſtroke of death from him, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to me for unnumbered acts of kindneſs? The barbarian was ſtruck with a ſentiment of remorſe—he manifeſted a deſire to ſave me—and while he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed to lift me over the dead body of my murdered lord, I fainted in his arms.</p>
                        <p>Of events immediately ſucceeding I am ignorant. My firſt recollection, after this tremendous moment, places me on the wide ocean—in the cabin of a veſſel
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:034162_0954_0FFC5A3025AF4338"/>
—ſtretched on the captain's matraſs, who had hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely yielded it to my neceſſities—and ſurrounded by ſtrangers of both ſexes, who, like me, had eſcaped the dagger of the aſſaſſin. How I came on board, I could never exactly learn. The probability is, that the black man ſo far intereſted himſelf for my ſafety, as to ſee me conveyed out of the iſland; and it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, that although I was only arrayed in the <hi>robe de chambre</hi> in which I ſlept, my watch, bracelets, neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and rings, were found upon me: But ah! Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, at that ſoul-torturing period, what was the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of my ſpirit! Stripped in one calamitous night—But why attempt to delineate?—my ſorrows do indeed ſurpaſs the power of deſcription! From the paſſengers and the ſhip's company, I am induced to believe, I received every poſſible attention: But my reaſon ſuſpending its operations, I was landed in Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, in Virginia, in a ſtate of inſanity!</p>
                        <p>For five months after my arrival in America, I continued without the ſmalleſt recollection of my former ſelf. My alienation of mind was, as I am told, of the moſt heart-affecting kind; and my lamentations were only interrupted by that laugh of frenzy, which is deeply fraught with woe, and which ſtrongly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts the feelings of humanity. No lucid interval pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and I was pronounced a confirmed maniac. Youth, however, and a good conſtitution, at length ſurmounted my malady, and I was gradually reſtored to a recollection of that extremity of wretchedneſs which I had endured. It was at this period, that I deliberately meditated putting an end to a mode of exiſtence, which had become truly burdenſome; and it is to be imputed to the benevolent exertions of a Mrs. THOMPSON of Alexandria, that I ſunk not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the weight of woes, which had ſo fearfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated for my deſtruction. The extricating hand of this lady was benignly extended; ſhe poured into my wounded mind the oil and wine of conſolation; ſhe new pointed my hopes, and taught me to obſerve an opening heaven, and a commiſerating God; nor
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:034162_0955_0FFC5A2EA1CCD500"/>
were her well-judged efforts to ſoothe and tranquillize my boſom, altogether ineffectual.</p>
                        <p>I recollected, in the firſt moment of calm reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having heard in the Weſt-Indies, that my uncle had purchaſed an eſtate in B—; and poſſeſſing an invincible deſire to throw myſelf into the protection of ſome one of my family, (the individuals of which, muſt, to this hour, imagine I ſuffered death in Cape Francois) I formed the reſolution of immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to my uncle; and parting with thoſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiges of my former ſplendor, which had been almoſt miraculouſly ſaved from the wreck of my fortune, with the money ariſing from the ſale, I equipt myſelf for the commencement of a journey, which my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the geography of the country induced me to imagine, a day or two would terminate. It proved, however, to a deſolate and forlorn ſtranger, a tedious period, the glooms of which were only illumined by the hope of ſoon finding myſelf in the arms of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate relative. Detained in New-Haven by ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I am largely indebted to a Mrs. BROWN, who lets lodgings in that city, and whoſe diſintereſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence is beyond all praiſe. What ſhall I ſay, Madam? I came on to B—. My little money (for my jewels were diſpoſed of, much below their value) was exhauſted. No tender friend remained to receive me. My uncle had never been heard of at B—. I was pennyleſs, and a ſtranger! For ſome fearful days my efforts became proſtrate! Deſpair, with haſty ſtrides, was advancing in my boſom; yet hope ſtill ſtruggled there; and, ſtrange to tell, I ſtill continued in exiſtence!</p>
                        <p>The Hibernian Society intereſted itſelf in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and from them, and from the Free Maſons, I received ſmall gratuities: But my mind, not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accommodated to its ſituation, ſhrunk from the idea of leſſening the fund reſerved for diſtreſſed indigence; and, moreover, a continuance of theſe benefits was as little to be calculated upon, as endured. My applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the French and Engliſh reſidents in B—was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual;
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:034162_0956_0FFC5A2D1AD24D70"/>
they declared it was beyond their power to relieve me. I had hoped, through their interpoſition, to return to Ireland, where I am entitled to an eſtate, independent of my father, deviſed to me by my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother; and my patrimonial inheritance I have ſtill to receive. Could I reach Ireland, my pecuniary wants would know an end; but this I have not the means of doing. I have attempted to write; but, deſolate as I am, I have no means of conveying my lamentable epiſtles. I have endeavoured to obtain ſupport by my needle, and I have, in a meaſure, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; but ill health impedes my efforts. To your character, Madam, I am no ſtranger. Some propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſpirit ſeemed to whiſper me, that from you I ſhould meet commiſeration and relief. From your name, from your virtues, my laſt hope receives its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal glow; and towards Hamilton-Place, as my only reſource, my feet have involuntarily bent their way.</p>

                     <p>Such was the <hi>purport</hi> of the diſtreſſed lady's affecting narrative. I have ſcrupulouſly preſerved its leading features. Suſceptible readers will find no difficulty in ſupplying thoſe frequent breaks and pauſes, which nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally occurred during a recital, that was delivered in a manner ſo unaffected and artleſs, as to leave on the mind of Margaretta no doubt of its authenticity. They will alſo imagine thoſe nameleſs ſympathies, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally darted from the benign countenance of my daughter, and which, fraught with aſſuaging energy, expreſſed abundantly mere, than is in the power of words to utter.</p>
                     <p>With grace inimitable, and a manner all her own, ſhe aſſured the ſorrow-pierced ſtranger of her <hi>ability</hi> and her <hi>readineſs</hi> to aſſiſt her: Nor will thoſe, who have traced the liberal virtues of Mrs. Hamilton through the pages of the Gleaner, conſider as prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lematical the generous warmth with which ſhe will ſupply the preſent exigencies, and conſult the future emolument, of this extraordinary proficient in the ſchool of affliction; and it is indeed certain, that when, with becoming reſpect, and all the ardour of munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

hoſpitality, ſhe led, to her happy manſion, the daughter of misfortune, ſhe devoutly bleſſed a pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God, who had thus placed within her reach, the <hi>power</hi> of ameliorating thoſe ills which had made ſuch large inroads on a mind ſo deeply ſtricken: And both Edward and Margaretta are, at this moment, buſily employed in concerting meaſures, by which they may gently ſlope, for the afflicted ſufferer, what yet remains of life.</p>

                     <p>THE mazy dance, the feſtive ſong, the table lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally ſpread, the well filled bowl, and ſparkling glaſs—theſe are all in the gift of Hoſpitality: Nay, more, FRIENDSHIP reſideth in her haunts, and VIRTUE loveth to dwell in her preſence: The ſocial pleaſures weave a chaplet for her brow; and ſhe may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the parent of communicative urbanity. Pleaſant is the feaſt which ſhe ſpreadeth for the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. She looketh with peculiar benignity upon him, who, wandering far diſtant from his native abode, hath been urged forward, either by motives of curioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, amuſement, or profit; and the exhauſted travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, having repoſed on the bed of down, ariſeth from the ſlumbers of the night, to echo the panegyric which hath been reſounded by a thouſand tongues.</p>
                     <p>The State of Virginia, we are informed, is claſſed high in the records of Hoſpitality. Its extenſive boundaries contain many towns and hamlets; and the commodious villas are ſcattered up and down at eaſy
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:034162_0958_0FFC5A23DEE77408"/>
diſtances. To the feet of the traveller theſe villas are well known—they are the manſions of Hoſpitality. Often have we attended, with ſuperior pleaſure, to our very amiable friend, Mrs. J—of Philadelphia, while ſhe hath dilated on the Hoſpitality of the Virginians. The boſom of this lady is the ſeat of the virtues; and it is her's to expatiate, with enchanting energy, on the deed of worth. She is a beautiful and a lovely wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and her features, animated by ſenſibility, are irreſiſtibly captivating. She is in poſſeſſion of afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but gold, in a ſcattered and thinly inhabited country, will not always purchaſe thoſe requiſites, which are ſo eſſential to the traveller, worn down by fatigue, and exhauſted in the want of refreſhment.</p>
                     <p>Mrs J—accompanied her huſband on a tour of buſineſs, through the State of Virginia; and her tongue will never be tired of eulogizing thoſe hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble republicans. Born and educated in the regular city of Philadelphia, where previous knowledge, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of introduction, or many weeks probationary reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, muſt authorize the claim of attention, the frank civilities, and prompt Hoſpitality of the Virginians, added to their intrinſic worth the powerful charm of novelty.</p>
                     <p>Virginian Hoſpitality hath ſuperſeded the neceſſity of houſes of public entertainment. The occupation of an inn-keeper is, in that State, very unprofitable. A public houſe is, therefore, rarely to be met with, and they are generally of the loweſt claſs. Our Philadelphians do not ſeem to have been perfectly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized of this circumſtance, or, if they were, it had not been in their power to provide againſt its incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience. They entered the State of Virginia, unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with letters of introduction; and their firſt day's progreſs was lengthened, tedious, and deſtitute of thoſe refreſhments, which their neceſſities urgently demanded. Night rapidly advanced—already her ebon veil obſcured the light of heaven—they were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of their route, and entire ſtrangers in that part of the country—A foot paſſenger approached—

"Friend, can you direct us to a tolerable inn, where we may paſs the night?"</p>
                     <p>"<hi>An inn!</hi> Lord bleſs us! <hi>we have no good inns—not we.</hi> Some twenty miles from hence, they ſay there is a ſign-poſt; but, <hi>Meaſter,</hi> the like of you never troubles themſelves about that there; <hi>for theſe all goes to</hi> COLONEL CHICHISTER's, [we do not omit or tranſpoſe a ſingle letter of his name] which is main glad to ſee <hi>um,</hi> and makes <hi>um</hi> right down welcome. COLONEL CHICHISTER lives in the <hi>huge</hi> houſe, hard by; and I <hi>thinks as how,</hi> you cannot do better, than to go right to <hi>un, Meaſter.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"What do you ſay, my dear?"</p>
                     <p>"<hi>Say! why, it is impoſſible we can think of intruding ourſelves upon ſtrangers.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"Nay, my dear, there is no other alternative: We muſt either ſleep in the open air, or put the Hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of COLONEL CHICHISTER to the teſt. Coachman, drive on—Stop—this is the manſion—go in—make my compliments to COLONEL CHICHISTER—let him know I am a citizen of Philadelphia, and that, as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted traveller, I aſk an aſylum for the night."</p>
                     <p>The Colonel was almoſt immediately at the coach door—bleſt Hoſpitality was ſeated on his brow—Mr. and Mrs. J—were uſhered into his dwelling—the lady of the manſion was exactly ſuited to her ſituation—not the ſhadow of reſtraint exiſted—urbanity was in full exerciſe—affability preſided—every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance evinced that the occurrence of the evening was not a <hi>novel event</hi>—and our travellers ſeemed as if reit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erating thoſe ſocial pleaſures, which they had ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently indulged in the boſom of the deareſt of their friends. Plenty and elegance combined to ſpread the feaſt. Their lodging was prepared by taſte and neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and their reſt was balmy and reſtorative. COLONEL CHICHISTER urged their abode with him, during many revolving days; and, conſtantly engaged in the exerciſe of the moſt liberal and extenſive Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality, he ſeemed unconſcious of any extraordinary
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:034162_0960_0FFA661ABA43E4C0"/>
exertion. We produce COLONEL CHICHISTER as a ſpecimen of Virginian Hoſpitality. Similar acts of kindneſs rendered the tour of the Philadelphians truly delightful; and their moſt grateful recollection hov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers round thoſe abodes of urbanity.</p>
                     <p>Surely, every propenſity, calculated to give energy to an attachment which ought to pervade the boſoms of individuals who date their origin from the ſame progenitors, ſhould be ſedulouſly cultivated; a mutual exchange of good offices ſhould deſignate humanity, and the powerful operations of ſympathy enzone the great family of man. Such an ameliorating arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would largely contribute toward leſſening the evils attendant on that depravity, which has ſo fatally contaminated our common nature, and we ſhould not be reduced to the neceſſity of lamenting the prevalence of invidious reſerve, envy and rancour.</p>
                     <p>The philanthropiſt will view, with painful regret, the diſaffection which, in many parts of America, ſo pointedly ſubſiſts between the natives of the town and country. Habits, cuſtoms, manner of pronunciation, &amp;c. &amp;c.—theſe are made ſufficiently conſequential to erect barriers, that look with a very unfriendly aſpect on the mutual good underſtanding we would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend; and all the malevolence of wit is too often in exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>YES—it is true, WE HAVE ENTERED A VERY COPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUS FIELD; and, had our attention been turned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, at an earlier period, from a ſoil ſo abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive, we ſhould have GLEANED <hi>very largely:</hi>—But being, in imitation of our ſuperiors, <hi>about to reſign the cares of office,</hi> and take, perhaps, a long farewel of our readers, we are conſtrained, by that civility which we are ſeeking to inculcate, to give place to a number of claimants, whoſe names have long ſtood foremoſt in our catalogue of correſpondents.</p>

out, thought proper to give his orders in ſome of his high-flown gibberiſh. "<hi>Extinguiſh that nocturnal lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary,</hi>" ſaid he. "<hi>Oy, oy,</hi>" ſaid the honeſt tars—and to work they went upon the ropes, conceiving, to be ſure, that the ſhip's tackling had received ſome new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangled name. "<hi>Extinguiſh that nocturnal luminary, I ſay,</hi>" repeated the captain. "<hi>All's gone,</hi>" replied the mariners, ſtill letting go the clew-lines, bunt-lines, &amp;c.—and ſtill the candle continued burning. A third time the orders were vociferated to as little purpoſe, when the captain, in a bitter paſſion, entered his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to the mate, who juſt then mounted the deck, ſtorming violently on account of the inſult he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.

                              <salute>MR. GLEANER,</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>IT is matter of wonder, that you, who profeſs ſuch an attachment to your country, ſhould, in your chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the progreſs of uneducated genius, have quite forgotten to enumerate a number of your countrymen, whoſe pretenſions in this line are indiſputable.</p>
                           <p>Mr. W—, one of the moſt celebrated painters now flouriſhing in Europe, is the firſt upon this liſt. His father, an honeſt Quaker in Pennſylvania, had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the occupation of a cooper, by which he had obtained a frugal ſupport for his family. His inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to confine his ſon Benjamin to the adze; and the education which he gave him was ſuited to this view: But the perſeverance of genius being generally
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:034162_0965_0FFC5A14B726E968"/>
indefatigable, young Benjamin's chalk-ſtrokes were oftener obſerved to ſketch the <hi>human face divine,</hi> than to trace profeſſional circles; and he performed ſuch exploits, as excited the admiration of the whole village where he reſided.</p>
                           <p>Theſe manifeſtations gave his father much concern, and he ſeriouſly remonſtrated againſt them: "Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, I charge thee to deſiſt. I tell thee, Benjamin, thou art in the road to ruin; and if thou continueſt therein, <hi>verily, verily, thou wilt be a vagabond. I muſt ſmite thee, Benjamin, if thou doſt not leave theſe profane fooleries, and apply thyſelf to thy buſineſs.</hi>"</p>
                           <p>Benjamin endeavoured to ſubmit to authority; but the fire of genius was not to be controlled; and a neighbour opening a public houſe, he undertook, on condition that he would provide the materials, and keep his ſecret, to paint him a ſign. His leiſure hours ſoon performed his promiſe; and it was exhibited with great triumph. In a country village, an event of this kind is prodigious; and the villagers collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not to criticiſe, but to wonder, and to applaud: Among the reſt, the father of Benjamin preſented himſelf—</p>
                           <p>"And pray, friend, where didſt thou pick up this famous piece of buſineſs?"</p>
                           <p>"If I dared to tell you, Sir—<hi>if I was ſure it would not diſpleaſe you</hi>—"</p>
                           <p>"<hi>Nay, nay, friend—Pray, why ſhouldſt thou think it would vex me?</hi> Verily, thou haſt excited my wonder; and I muſt entreat thee to explain thy meaning."</p>
                           <p>"<hi>But thou wilt be angry with Benjamin.</hi>"</p>
                           <p>This was enough—the ſecret was out. The old gentleman was greatly aſtoniſhed; and, rationally concluding, that it was in vain to ſtruggle any longer againſt the unequivocal deciſion of nature, he adviſed Benjamin to depart for the great city, Philadelphia, and there ſet up the buſineſs of ſign-painting. The lad, not waiting for a repetition of this advice, took a haſty leave of his native village; and, proceeding to Philadelphia, his uncommon merit drew upon him
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:034162_0966_0FFC6219CEA6B3B0"/>
general attention. His ſucceſs exceeded his moſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine expectations; and he ſpeedily embarked, with ſtrong recommendatory letters, for England, where the rapid progreſs which he has made, is well known to all thoſe who have the ſmalleſt acquaintance with the hiſtory of the fine arts.</p>
                           <p>You are, Mr. Gleaner, adviſed to collect carefully, every inſtance of indigenous talents which falls in your way; and, as correſponding ſecretary to the fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, embodied for the purpoſe of promoting emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I promiſe you all the aſſiſtance which we can command.</p>

                           <p>YES, FRIEND; <hi>the Saviour of ſinners</hi> hath fully reconciled me to this appellation, and human nature again ſtands forth, inveſted with unalienable claims to my affection.

                           <p>Bleſſed was the night which led thee, my friend, to my <hi>then</hi> dreary abode; I would ſay, as for that night, let it be curtained by a veil of lucid azure; over its

annual round may the ſtars of heaven glitter with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual luſtre, and may it riſe on my memory, the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did epoch of my emancipation from tenfold darkneſs. The volume, which your ſecond viſit beſtowed upon me—alas! why was I ſo long a ſtranger to that vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ume?—it is a treaſure beyond all price. The beautiful ſimplicity of its language, and rich variety of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agery—theſe, while they embelliſh, are, however, to be regarded as the moſt inconſiderable part of its worth. How ſublime is its ſyſtem of ethics! and how <hi>noble the forgiveneſs of injuries which it inculcates!</hi> Juſtly is it called the book of God; for to it is communicated the powers of <hi>reſtoration.</hi> Before its refulgent blaze my malignant paſſions proſtrate, my reſentments are all ſubdued, and I am again alive to that divine philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy, which enkindles in my boſom the beſt feelings of the heart.</p>
                           <p>What a conſiſtent whole does this ſacred book pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent! It diſplays the Omnipotent Creator, as ruling the univerſe according to his righteous pleaſure; as calling into exiſtence a nature, formed by his omnific word, and purſuing a path which his <hi>wiſdom foreknew.</hi> It exhibits this nature under a cloud, and ſubjected, <hi>for reaſons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                                 </gap>ſt known to paternal Deity,</hi> to a variety of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. It points to that auſpicious era, when our nature, emerging from the thick darkneſs by which it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped, ſhone forth in primeval ſplendor. It diſplays before my aſtoniſhed view, <hi>God the Creator becoming God the Redeemer;</hi> and, hurrying me rapidly along through numerous intervening events, it unveils to my enrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured perception, the final conſummation of that auguſt plan, the influence of which pervadeth every diviſion of time. It exhibits the period, when crimes in their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety ſhall be blotted from the univerſe; <hi>when what we have characterized as evil, ſhall ſerve to point and enhance the ſucceeding good;</hi> when rectitude ſhall be enthroned in every boſom, innocence triumphant, and peace eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed throughout the wide dominions of the great Source of being. Yea, it ſhows me the ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of men, of <hi>every deſcription,</hi> (even thoſe <hi>tranſgreſſors,
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:034162_0968_0FFC621565B16A00"/>

                           <p>And what am I, who preſume to cheriſh <hi>implacable indignation</hi> againſt thoſe beings, for whom Emanuel ſhed his blood? I ſhudder at myſelf! Hath the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy woman, who has coſt me ſo dear, ſinned beyond forgiveneſs? What though <hi>ſhe is loſt</hi> to virtue—Did not the God who formed her, bow the heavens and come down, to ſeek and <hi>ſave that which was loſt?</hi> and is ſhe not the purchaſe of a ſuffering Redeemer?</p>
                           <p>Yes, I will return to the world—Adieu, ye ſequeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered haunts; ye have witneſſed thoſe bliſsful illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which render the vaſt globe a paradiſe. The wandering, the loſt Meſſalina, ſhall receive from my hand the book of God; poſſibly, it may produce im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate reformation; but if not, ſhe will one day be ſeparated from that evil ſpirit, and thoſe contaminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propenſities, which precipitate her into ſuch atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious offences.

                           <p>GOOD minds are repreſented as viewing, with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign complacency, the man, who, renouncing his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of principle, or of practice, enters with firmneſs the path of rectitude; and, under a perſuaſion of the truth of this ſentiment, I preſume to addreſs you, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging a hope, that, not having beſtowed a final malediction on that Alphonſo, with whom you were ſo righteouſly offended, you will countenance the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements which he is about to form, and permit him to rank among thoſe whom you direct by your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and ſanction by your approbation.</p>
                           <p>But, that I may, in ſome meaſure, authorize my claim to your attention, I take leave to obſerve, that the lovely woman whoſe wrongs excited your indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is now <hi>perfectly reſtored to reaſon;</hi> and, that ſhe may exemplify every benign attribute of divinity, ſhe hath extended unto the man who hath ſo deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured her, <hi>free</hi> and unreſerved forgiveneſs. Her ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable parent, too, lending a condeſcending ear to my ſupplications, beſtows on my ardent vows her maternal benediction; and, for myſelf, when I ſay, that my ſum of happineſs exceeds the anguiſh by which it was preceded, I cannot give it a higher colouring. As it is to you, Sir, that I am principally indebted for both, I conſider it incumbent on me to preſent you with a brief narration of facts, which may, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, palliate errors, otherwiſe enormous.</p>
                           <p>My father, departing this life, while I was yet an infant, I was left wholly under the care of my mother; and, as ſhe had no other child, ſhe <hi>literally</hi> devoted the remainder of her life to her ſon—ſhe conſulted me in
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:034162_0970_0FFC6210A66A9840"/>
every thing; and ſhe carried her blameable indulgence to a moſt extravagant height. All perſons who have made the early part of exiſtence, in any ſort, their ſtudy, muſt have obſerved the marked attachment which children uniformly diſcover to novelty. This propenſity in me was gratified in every poſſible way; my diet, my apartment, and even my preceptors, were changed agreeably to the infantile caprice of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and thus a kind of artificial inconſtancy was grafted upon a wayward humour, which ſhould have been corrected; and I was rendered <hi>habitually irreſolute.</hi> Had I not been fond of my book, I ſhould have reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manhood deſtitute of information; but nature, in many particulars, ſtruggled againſt the ill-judged ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of my mother, who was, in every other inſtance, the beſt and moſt rational of women. Her demiſe happened ſoon after I had reached maturity; and the indeciſion of diſpoſition, which had been ſo erroneouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cultivated, was in nothing more manifeſt, than in the fluctuation of my mind, reſpecting my matrimonial election. A ſucceſſion of amiable females alternately triumphed in my boſom, until Lavinia, diſpoſſeſſing every other object, became the ſovereign lady of my affections.</p>
                           <p>From a perſon ſo completely calculated to inſpire love and perfect eſteem, it could ſcarcely be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my heart could ever wander; yet, my uncertainty, in this reſpect, ſuſpended a declaration which, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, the ardour of my attachment ſpontaneouſly dictated. I had not, as was ſuppoſed, formed a plan to deſtroy the peace of my beloved Lavinia; and the truth is, that, although I entertained a hope of being able to incline her, by my continued aſſiduities, to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize my pretenſions, yet, ſuch was the conſummate prudence of her conduct, that, while I was permitted to view her as my <hi>tender friend,</hi> I never once conceived, that an avowal of my love was <hi>neceſſary to her tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus was I circumſtanced, when the verſatility of my humour once more gained the aſcendency; and I
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:034162_0971_0FFC620E75975C40"/>
coolly relinquiſhed a purſuit, in which I had ſo warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged. My attachment to Monimia was ſhort-lived; every interview convinced me of her inferiority to the accompliſhed woman I had abandoned; ſhe was by nature a coquette; and the <hi>hauteur</hi> of her tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was inſufferable. Abſence from Lavinia, evinced the durability of her power, and I would inſtantly have ſought her preſence, had I not believed that my coldneſs and neglect, had given a fatal ſtab to that predilection with which I flattered myſelf ſhe once honoured me.</p>
                           <p>A fixed melancholy took poſſeſſion of my mind; it became a matter of indifference to me in what part of the globe I wandered; and, urged by a hope of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating the glooms in which I was enveloped, I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the opportunity of embarking with a friend, for the purpoſe of making the tour of Europe. I had been abſent near two years, when, meeting in France with our fair countrywoman, Madam B—, whoſe elegant <hi>Ruelle</hi> is the reſort of every American who forms the leaſt pretenſion to taſte; Columbian litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture very naturally made a part of our converſation. Madam B—put into my hands a manuſcript which ſhe ſaid was to make one of a number of eſſays, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for publication; and, adding, that ſhe had but recently received it from the Author, with whom ſhe regularly correſponded, ſhe gave me permiſſion to put it into my pocket for the amuſement of a leiſure hour.</p>
                           <p>Retiring to my lodgings, I unfolded the manuſcript; but no tongue can deſcribe my aſtoniſhment, when I traced, in the character of Lavinia, the angel whom I conceived I had forever loſt—when, in the delineation of Alphonſo, I read the ſtory of my own highly rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rehenſible conduct! It is true, I was not conſcious of a <hi>deſign ſo atrocious</hi> as was imputed to me; and yet, as I contemplated the diſaſtrous event of that amity which had promiſed ſo fair, the anguiſh of my ſpirit was inexpreſſible.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="306" facs="unknown:034162_0972_0FFC620C1CD27AA0"/>
The ardour of my attachment to my lovely friend, was rather augmented than diminiſhed. Time and obſervation had confirmed my ſentiments of her <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable merit;</hi> and her image was indelibly impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on my mind.</p>
                           <p>With the firſt opportunity, I returned to my native country. Inſtantly I ſought, and proſtrated myſelf before the mother of Lavinia. She heard, believed, and pitied. I ſaw, frequently I ſaw, my ſoul's treaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure: But, great and good God! how changed! On me ſhe beſtowed not the ſmalleſt attention; and my miſery was complete.</p>
                           <p>A bleſſed expedient, however, at length occurred to me; and, placing myſelf near her, during one of thoſe fanciful and ſoul-piercing dialogues, which you ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically repreſent the dear unfortunate as holding with me, I reſponded to her remarks, preciſely in the manner ſhe had the day before dictated for me. An expreſſion of extreme aſtoniſhment immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded her countenance; and, burſting into a laugh of frenzy, (no words can give an idea of the poignant anguiſh of which that laugh was deſcriptive) ſhe turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed haſtily round, and, beholding the viſion which had ſo long floated only in the region of fancy, with fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arms, and a ſtatue like appearance, ſubſtantiated before her—recollection at that moment glimmered ſaintly on the diſk of reaſon; and, uttering a heart-piercing ſhriek, ſhe fell ſenſeleſs into my arms. It was with difficulty ſhe was reſtored to life—a burſt of tears ſucceeded—the firſt ſhe had ſhed for many months—we bleſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>The hour which is to complete my felicity, is not far diſtant; and I have to entreat you, Sir, in the name of my venerable parent, in that of my beloved Lavinia, and of my own, that you would act as the

                           </p>
                           <p>A few of the arguments made uſe of, in defence of the latter, as the moſt novel ſentiment, I ſhall ſketch for your information. A favourite line from a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite poet, was exultingly introduced: "<hi>From ſeeming
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:034162_0977_0FFC6200A9F0DCB8"/>
evil ſtill educing good</hi>"—and the participle <hi>ſeeming</hi> was emphaſized with great energy. The advocates of this opinion deciſively ſaid, that every thing was now in the <hi>beſt poſſible ſituation;</hi> and this they inferred, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the wiſdom of the great Diſpoſer of events, but alſo from the manifeſt inquietude produced by any ſudden change. The cobler, unexpectedly receiving a purſe of gold, ſuſpended his morning and evening ſong; care became an inmate in that boſom, once the ſeat of tranquillity; nor was his mirth reſtored, until the glittering miſchief was reclaimed by its proper owner. It was aſked, How could that be character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized <hi>evil,</hi> which, it was acknowledged, could not be more eligibly diſpoſed? Perſons, it was ſaid, <hi>appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently</hi> miſerable, are not, in <hi>fact,</hi> ſo: Aſk the man who cannot command a ſhilling, at what price he eſtimates his <hi>limbs,</hi> his <hi>ſenſes,</hi> his <hi>reaſon,</hi> his <hi>proſpect of future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs;</hi> and, if he underſtands how to appreciate theſe bleſſings, properly, he will be found to poſſeſs immenſe riches. Sickneſs, loſs of friends, and even death it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—Are theſe to be conſidered as <hi>evils?</hi> Certainly, that is not, <hi>ſtrictly ſpeaking, an evil, which is abſolutely neceſſary to the completion of our felicity</hi>—it is, at moſt, but a <hi>ſeeming evil.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>"How often," ſaid an old gentleman, "does a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary pang produce the moſt exquiſite enjoyment. I remember, when I was a young man, I had a broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whom I, at that time, loved beyond any other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being. My brother made a voyage to the Eaſt-Indies; and, after the tedious term of two years had elapſed, the ſhip, on board of which he embarked, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in ſight. Eager to embrace him, I jumped into a boat, which was juſt puſhing from the quay: We had not proceeded far, when we obſerved the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours hoiſted <hi>half maſt high!</hi> and the captain and the mate, ſtanding in full view upon the deck, we had poſitive aſſurance of <hi>their</hi> ſafety. I knew it was not cuſtomary to diſplay colours after that ſort, except on the death of one of thoſe officers, or of the ſupercargo,
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:034162_0978_0FFC61FE5C23F2F0"/>
which department was filled by my brother. The melancholy concluſion, therefore, forced itſelf upon me—he was undoubtedly no more—and the anguiſh of my ſpirit is not to be deſcribed. It happened, at that moment, that my brother, expecting to find me among the paſſengers in the boat, had placed a tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope in a direction, which brought even the features of my face under his immediate inſpection; and, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſudden alteration in my countenance, his ſympathetic feelings explained the cauſe, when, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting inſtantly a ſituation which ſo effectually concealed him, he came forward to the ſide of the veſſel, and, bowing moſt gracefully, laid one hand on his heart, extending the other in a manner inimitably expreſſive.—God knows, his figure ſeems, at this moment, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to my view; and I ſhall never forget the exquiſite tranſports I then experienced: Nor, <hi>ſince it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of ſo much eventual happineſs, can I regard, as an evil,</hi> that affection for a common ſailor, which induced his comrades to announce his death, in a manner that was an acknowledged departure from the rule, uſually obſerved on theſe occaſions."</p>
                           <p>You, Mr. Gleaner, will, I apprehend, pronounce this, ſtrange <hi>ſophiſtical reaſoning.</hi> We certainly ought to be very cautious, how we embrace ſuch ſubtilties: But I will not foreſtall judgment. An appeal to you was generally approved, and concluded on. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is before you; and we expect your anſwer with impatience.</p>

                     <p>BUT, gentle reader, in the moment when throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide the veil, I appear before thee in <hi>propria perſona,</hi> acknowledging myſelf to be that identical <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> whom poſſibly thou mayeſt recollect, as fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome pages in the Boſton, and afterwards in the Maſſachuſetts Magazine—In the moment, I ſay, when thou art recognizing, <hi>in thy friend the Gleaner, this ſaid Conſtantia,</hi> it may be proper to render unto thee a reaſon, why I have endeavoured to paſs myſelf upon thee in the maſculine character; and as I now take leave of every <hi>unneceſſary</hi> diſguiſe, it is my determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be very explicit.</p>
                     <p>Obſerving, in a variety of inſtances, the indifference, not to ſay contempt, with which female productions are regarded, and ſeeking to arreſt attention, at leaſt for a time, I was thus furniſhed with a very powerful motive for an aſſumption, which I flattered myſelf would prove favourable to my aſpiring wiſhes. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate, on this occaſion, the <hi>ſignificant ſhrug</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive ſmile of the <hi>pedantic petit-maitres;</hi> Eſop's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the <hi>Aſs in the Lion's ſkin,</hi> will be triumphantly revived; and it will be affirmed, that the <hi>effeminacy</hi> and <hi>tinſel glitter</hi> of my ſtyle could not fail of <hi>betraying</hi> me at every ſentence which I uttered. But, having paſſed the rubicon, it is neceſſary that I poſſeſs ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient firmneſs to remain undiſmayed by the attacks of
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:034162_0980_0FFC61FA271F4240"/>
the ill diſpoſed critic. My ingenuity did not furniſh me with any expedient, ſo well calculated for conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the envelopment in which I enwrapped my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and having conceived, that in my borrowed character I ſhould become abundantly more uſeful, I felt aſſured that this conſideration was in reality ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to juſtify the meaſure.</p>
                     <p>Another ſtrong inducement to the aſſumption and continuance of my diſguiſe, was the opportunity it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me of making myſelf miſtreſs of the unbiaſſed ſentiments of my aſſociates. A few perſons were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſureably partial to my eſſays; and, as it generally happens, thoſe were the individuals with whom alone I was <hi>intimately</hi> converſant. I had the good fortune to elude the penetration of my beſt friend, and he read in my preſence my firſt Eſſay, entitled the Glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, without the ſhadow of a ſuſpicion of its author. Thus I went on; nor was it until my thirty-third num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which contains the ſtory of Eliza, that the perſon, to whom I am principally accountable for my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, declared his conviction that I was the real author of the Gleaner. <hi>The fact,</hi> from which the little narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Eliza originated, I received from my huſband; I might have predicted the conſequence—I was of courſe detected.</p>
                     <p>But I had yet a further reaſon for concealment; I was ambitious of being conſidered <hi>independent as a writer;</hi> if I poſſeſſed any merit, I was ſolicitous it ſhould remain undiminiſhed, nor did I harbour a wiſh that my errors ſhould be imputed to another; and I imagined I could effectually accompliſh my views in this particular, by ſuffering my connexions of every deſcription to remain in total ignorance of my plans; nor in I conceive myſelf culpable in thus acting, ſince I was not ſeeking to wound the feelings of any human being, and it was hardly poſſible I could <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> diſhonour thoſe affectionate friends, to whom my heart has ever acknowledged the moſt ardent and grateful attachment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="315" facs="unknown:034162_0981_0FFC61F8A39D5710"/>
                        <hi>Roſſeau</hi> has ſaid, that although a female may <hi>oſtenſibly</hi> wield the pen, yet it is certain ſome man of letters ſits behind the curtain to guide its movements; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating this aſſertion, I imagined that if thoſe of the <hi>literati,</hi> to whoſe aid either friendſhip or affinity might entitle me, were not ſo far of my council as even to be informed of my deſigns, they would at leaſt be exempted from thoſe cenſures which my folly or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption might involve.</p>
                     <p>A celebrated writer of the preſent century obſerves, that "a <hi>woman</hi> ought never to ſuffer a <hi>man</hi> to add a <hi>ſingle word</hi> to her writings; if ſhe does, the man ſhe conſults, let him be who he may, will always paſs for the original inventor, while ſhe will be accuſed of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her name to the works of others;" and ſurely the feelings of rectitude muſt revolt even at a ſuſpicion of this kind.</p>
                     <p>Thus much I have thought proper to ſay, by way of reſponding to ſome invidious remarks, which my <hi>manner</hi> of conducting the foregoing papers, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their maſculine character, have occaſioned.</p>
                     <p>The reader is already apprized, that the numbers which conſtitute the firſt volume of the Gleaner were uſhered into the world in that very reſpectable miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, the Maſſachuſetts Magazine; and my original deſign was to continue them in that publication. My ſecret was now generally known, but I had no reaſon to be diſſatisfied with the reception given to my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attempts, and I had many pages prepared for the preſs. It has frequently been aſked, both in public and private, "why the Gleaner was diſcontinued?" The very reſpectable and learned gentleman, whoſe love of literature induced him, on the reſuſcitation of the Magazine, in the ſpring of 1795, to become its editor, complained, and with reaſon, of the paucity of original productions, which immediately ſucceeded the arduous engagement into which he had entered: yet, for myſelf, largely indebted to the candour of the new editor, I am free to own, that if any conſideration
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:034162_0982_0FFC61F5D31F1888"/>
could have induced me to continue a writer in that publication, my perfect confidence in the ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to whoſe reviſion my ſketches would have been ſubmitted, muſt have furniſhed the motive. But dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuſpenſion of the miſcellany ſo often adverted to, a <hi>ſerious accuſation was preferred againſt me,</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of which, in my own apprehenſion, effectually barred my appearance in its pages.</p>
                     <p>I have pledged myſelf to a public, which I do moſt ſincerely venerate, to render a reaſon, "<hi>why</hi> the Glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was not continued in the Magazine;" and although I might content myſelf with obſerving, that its irreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularity, and the uncertainty of its duration, together with the years which muſt have elapſed, ere the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of my plan could have been exhibited, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely adverſe to my views; yet, agreeably to my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, I had arranged a circumſtantial detail, which developed the <hi>real cauſe</hi> that hath produced me, in my <hi>individual character,</hi> a candidate for the indulgence of my readers; <hi>my deſign,</hi> however, is ſuperſeded; a few ſincere friends, whoſe diſintereſted attachment cannot be conſidered as problematical, and from whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reaſon heſitated to appeal, warmly remonſtrating againſt it, rendered it incumbent upon me to deliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate—deliberation produced conviction—and, certain that a recurrence to facts, which were productive of much infelicity, can anſwer no valuable purpoſe, I gladly conſign the promiſed narrative to oblivion; and if a recollection of my propoſals for this publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould procure an impeachment of my veracity, I truſt, when it is known, that my original intention has been relinquiſhed from the fear of agita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>g the feelings of malevolence, the pleadings of candour will procure my abſolution.</p>
                     <p>If the manner in which my dramatic eſſays are introduced, ſhould require an apology, it may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to obſerve that it was requiſite to the uniformity of my plan; and I have preſumed that as it was my wiſh to promote, by thoſe productions, the intereſts of
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:034162_0983_0FFC61F390392ED8"/>
rectitude, they will not, in this <hi>enlightened age,</hi> give offence even to the moſt <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>delicate</hi> mind; their hiſtory may, in ſome future period, amuſe the curious; and for the preſent, it only remains to ſay, that, as I conſtructed them without a coadjutor, it is but juſtice their errors, of every deſcription, ſhould reſt entirely upon my own head.</p>
                     <p>Nor are the numerous faults with which theſe volumes may abound, to be imputed to any other individual. In this arduous enterpriſe, however daring, I have ſtood alone. To the toil of writing letters to myſelf, I have been condemned; and to this cauſe the candid will impute that want of variety of which they have doubtleſs complained. The aberra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unaſſiſted fancy, however unwearied the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual reſearch, does not always anſwer the wiſhes of its proprietor; and, although the infrequency of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal views may be lamented, it muſt, nevertheleſs, be ſubmitted to.</p>
                     <p>My ſketches have <hi>ſeldom</hi> been drawn from <hi>living characters;</hi> but I will confeſs I have experienced ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior pleaſure in once more embodying thoſe virtues that I have ſeen exemplified by perſons who have bid adieu to thoſe ſcenes which they have heretofore illumined by their preſence; and imagination has delighted to produce them again in that radiant career in which it was their great buſineſs to ſoothe and to bleſs the FAMILY OF MAN.</p>
                     <p>To my very reſpectable and numerous Patrons and Patroneſſes, I am largely indebted. It would be my pride to enhance their pleaſures. Could I, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The moſt ardent wiſhes for their happineſs are wafted warm from
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:034162_0984_0FFC61F040570940"/>
my heart. May the good they communicate be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned a thouſand fold into their own boſoms—and may they, when encompaſſed about by thoſe misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to which humanity is incident, reflect <hi>rationally</hi> on the <hi>brevity</hi> of the preſent ſcene, and upon the incal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culable bliſs which awaits them in the regions of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</p>
                     <p>Such are, and ſuch will continue to be the fervent aſpirations of</p>
