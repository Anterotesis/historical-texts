            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere had been no occaſion for calling you at this time, if the laſt Aſſembly had anſwered the good ends I propoſed to my ſelf for the Kings Service, and that of the Province. But having ſate a whole Moneth and done no buſineſs, I thought it adviſeable to Diſſolve them; and the rather, becauſe there were great Heats and Diviſions among them, which I found Impracticable for me to compoſe and put an end to.</p>
            <p>You need not be told to what a degree Faction and Sedition have taken Root in this Town, 'tis a thing ſo generally known. And there has been the utmoſt Induſtry us'd by ſome ill Men to ſpread the Infection all over the Province, and to alienate the Affections of the People by falſe Suggeſtions and Notions of their Independance from the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and that 'tis a Violence and Wrong done 'em that <hi>England</hi> ſhould put a Limitation on their Trade. How extravagant and wild is this Notion; does not <hi>England</hi> put a Reſtriction on its own Trade, in ſome Caſes? And as for <hi>Pyracy,</hi> which ſome People are ſo fond of here, 'tis held in ſuch Abomination as not to be known or practis'd there. People muſt not be ſo deceived, this Province is ſubject to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and 'tis its greateſt Glory and Happineſs that it is ſo. For by that means the People are entituled to the Protection of the Crown, and are under the beſt Conſtitution of Laws, and that in fellowſhip with the beſt and braveſt People in the World, the People of <hi>ENGLAND</hi>; and they muſt be obedient to <hi>Engliſh Laws,</hi> 'tis their Duty and Intereſt ſo to be. And the Angry Men of <hi>New-York</hi> muſt not expect from me that Connivance at their ill Practices that they were accuſtomed to ſome years before my coming to the Government: The Oath of a Governour, the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000888_0002_0FAC96F0204EE790"/>
Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and the King's Inſtructions which are made to ſquare with the Laws, are ſacred Ties and Obligations with me.</p>
            <p>I have obſerv'd great Marks of Irreligion and Immorality in this place, and I take it to proceed from a long Habit of breaking the Laws, which has introduced Liſcentious and Diſſolute Living: And nothing can rectifie and reform our Lives and Manners but Religion. <hi>Religion</hi> is of that admirable frame and temper, it inflames us with a true Devotion to our great Maker, which is our moſt reaſonable Service. Then it fits us for all the ends of Civil Society, by uniting our Minds, Affections and Intereſts; it makes us good Men: And good Men will of courſe be good Friends, good Neighbours, good Subjects; and good Patriots, that is, Lovers of their Country, and obedient to its Laws.</p>
            <p>Now that I have ſtated to you the unhappy Circumſtances we are in by the contrivance of ill Men, <hi>I</hi> ſhall proceed to recommend to your Thoughts a few things which are neceſſary for the Support and Peace of the Government, and will be a manifeſtation of your Duty and Affection to the KING.</p>
            <p>I therefore Propoſe to you, Gentlemen of the Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, the Continuance of the preſent Revenue (which will otherwiſe ſhortly expire) for what Number of Years you ſhall think fit. I found the Government very conſiderably indebted when I came to it, and it cannot be expected that Debt ſhould be much leſſen'd in ſo ſhort a time as I have been here: And I could wiſh you would put the Government on a clear foot, by finding a way to discharge that Debt The Publick Accounts I have order'd to be prepar'd for you, with an eſtimate of the Debts of the Government. I promiſe you I will be as good a Husband of your Money as 'tis poſſible for me to be: and when 'tis either miſ-apply'd or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannag'd by my means, I ſhall not take it amiſs if you put me in mind of m<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> want of Care therein. To induce you to the continuance of the Revenue to the Crown, I cannot ſet before your Eyes a better Example than that of the great and glorious People of <hi>England,</hi> who out of a ſence of the ineſtimable Advantages they were reſtor'd to by the King, freely, and without the leaſt murmuring, ſupported him in a long and expenſive War, well knowing he bravely fought for the Liberties of all the Chriſtian World, and that they had as great a ſhare as any others in that Quarrel; wherein alſo his Majeſty often ventur'd his Royal Perſon with the meaneſt Souldier in his Armies. Beſides the KING conſidering this Province as a Barrier between the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Canada,</hi> and his other Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and therefore moſt expos'd, was pleas'd to take a peculiar Care of you, having been at great Expence this laſt War, in paying for four Hundred Men, and maintaining a Man of War for your Defence, and conſtantly ſupplying you with Stores of War. Theſe are ſuch Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations as I hope you will not only remember in the manner I have now recommended, but alſo with your earneſt Prayers to God for his Majeſties long Life and proſperous Reign over you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:000888_0003_0FAC96F0E2BF37C8"/>The next thing I recommend to you, is the Reconciling of People and Parties, which will be a glorious Work and will, I doubt not, be easily accompliſh'd by your prudent Care. You all know the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> they make in private Families and Friendſhips: and next to a Civil War, 'tis the moſt Unhappy ſtate and Condition a Country can be in. I will heartily joyn with you in ſuch Methods as ſhall be thought adviſeable for the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a thorow Reconciliation of Parties. And that you may induce others to be peaceably and charitably minded, I earneſtly recommend to you, Gentlemen Repreſentatives, that you mannage your Debates and Proceedings in your Houſe with that Calmneſs and Moderation that becomes the Prudence of Men, that are under ſuch a Truſt from their Country. The preſent Conjuncture requires it at your hands; The King will thank you, the World will applaud you for it, and God will bleſs and proſper you and your Affairs.</p>
            <p>I muſt acquaint you with the Circumſtances of our five Nations of <hi>Indians,</hi> with whom I had a Conference this laſt Summer at <hi>Albany</hi> and then fix't their Friendſhip and Fidelity to the Crown by extraordinary Preſents and kind Usage; and they parted with me in all the good Humor imaginable. But I am lately adviſed they are grown very uneaſie and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied at the <hi>French</hi> Governour of <hi>Canada's</hi> detaining ſome of their Friends prisoners, notwithſtanding the late Treaty of Peace, which is a very unfair Practice in that Governour. You ſhall have all the Memorials and Proceedings with our Indians laid before you, that you may adviſe me what meaſures to take for preſerving them firm to the Intereſt of the Crown and this Province, which is a thing of very great conſequence, and deſerves as much as any thing whatſoever to be the ſubject of your Thoughts and Determination</p>
            <p>I am ordered by the Kings Inſtructions to prepare and offer you two or three Bills for your paſſing, which will be for the Service of the Province And ſuch other Bills as you ſhall judge proper to offer me for ſecuring your Liberties, and advancing your Trade, I promiſe you my aſſent to their paſſing into Laws, provided they be not Repugnant to the Laws and Intereſt of <hi>England.</hi>
