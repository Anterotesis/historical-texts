            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Son of God, the Second Perſon in the ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Trinity, having aſſumed the human nature, into a perſonal union with the divine; he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and became obedient unto death, even the accurſed death of the croſs: who having thereby ſatisfied the divine law, for thoſe for whom he was delivered unto death; was therefore raiſed again for their juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and exalted unto, and ſeated down at the right-hand of the throne of the majeſty on high; endowed with all power and authority to execute the various purpoſes of his coming and kingdom, to the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing praiſe of his grace. "Exalted," as ſaid in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding verſe, "by the mighty power of God, far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all principality and power, and might, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come." "Who," as ſaid in the words of our text, "hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to his church, which is his body; the fullneſs of him that filleth all in all." All things whether in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or on earth, are ſubjected to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, put under him, to be ruled and governed by him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til brought into entire ſubjection to the great ends and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011692_0003_0F87EBF8DD6FFAF0"/>deſigns of his kingdom: "For he muſt reign till he hath put all things under his feet." 1 Cor. 15.25.</p>
            <p>But then, at the right-hand of the Father, it is in a ſpecial manner given to Chriſt Jeſus, to be the head over all things to the church: even the head of all life, influence and direction, to that people which are to be gathered under him as their head, collected together in him, as his body, to be animated and quickened by him, and to be filled with all his glorious fullneſs.— In further ſpeaking to which, I purpoſe to conſider, and ſhew,</p>
            <p>The import of Chriſt's being the head of his body, the church. The nature of that body; of what ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it is made up: and how to be ruled and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to the order and diſcipline thereof.—But,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Of the import of Chriſt's being the head of his body, the church. And as he is the head, he has in all things the pre-eminence. Is the author and finiſher of the faith. The purchaſer, and giver of all ſpiritual, heavenly and everlaſting mercies and bleſſings. The great fountain of light and life. The great Prophet ſent of God, to reveal the will of the Father. The great High-Prieſt, entered into the holy of holies, there to appear in the preſence of God for his people. But that which I have now, more particularly in view, to be inſiſted upon is, That Chriſt's being the Head of his Body, the Church, implies, that he is the ſovereign Lord and ſole King thereof. According to that of the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 2.6. "Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Zion." Compared with John 1.49. "Thou art the Son of God, the King of Iſrael." And John 12.13. "Hoſannah, bleſſed is the King of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, that cometh in the name of the Lord." And ver. 15. "Fear not, daughter of Sion, behold thy King cometh, ſitting on an aſſes colt."</p>
            <p>And that Chriſt is King, implies, that he is ſole law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver to his Body, the Church; as ſaid by the prophet
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011692_0004_0F87EBF99D71DB68"/>Iſaiah, "The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, the Lord is our king, he will ſave us." And as king on the holy hill of Zion. Chriſt's Church is his kingdom, in and over which he rules and reigns. And ſo his kingdom is not of a worldly, but entirely of a ſpiritual nature. And conſequently a kingdom entirely diſtinct, from the civil kingdom of this world. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interfering with, nor dependent upon them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the anſwer, which Chriſt himſelf gave to Pilate; enquiring of him, whether he was the king of the Jews. "My kingdom is not of this world, if my kingdom were of this world then would my ſervants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence."</p>
            <p>The civil powers that be, are ordained of God, to maintain peace and good order in the commonwealth: to be a terror to evil-doers, &amp; a praiſe &amp; encouragement to them that do well. But theſe civil kingdoms are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a worldly nature; their weapons are carnal, their puniſhments are corporal and ſecular; and all their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, emoluments and advantages are temporals. In regard to which civil kind of matters, Chriſt ſaid, "Who made me a judge or divider over you." Luke 12.14. For the kingdom of Chriſt, is entirely of a ſpiritual nature: reſpecting the conſcience, and things ſpiritual and eternal. The laws, weapons, and defence, the penalties, benefits and bleſſings of which, are all of a ſpiritual nature. Agreeable to that of St. Paul, 2 Cor. 9.4. "For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty thro' God, to the pulling down ſtrong holds." No compulſions, motives and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments therefore, of a ſecular nature, have any thing to do in the kingdom of Chriſt; whoſe ſole right it is, as king in Zion, to ordain and appoint, laws, ſtatutes and ordinances, for the regulation, government and order of his houſe and kingdom. And who accordingly has, ſet forth in his goſpel, either by precept or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, all the laws and rules which he ſaw needful and fit
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011692_0005_0F87EBFA5D71EEF0"/>to appoint, for the regulation and government of his church. And nothing can be binding upon, or be a ſafe rule unto, the conſciences of Chriſt's ſubjects, but theſe injunctions only, which are plainly ſtamped with his authority. The Lord Jeſus did indeed commiſſion his apoſtles to give orders and directions about the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his churches; who proved their authority from Chriſt, to do ſo, by the many wonderful works, which they wro't in his name. But no other ſet of men, can have any claim to ſuch authority, till they can produce the ſame evidence for it, that the apoſtles did. It is ſaid indeed, in the 34th article of the Church of England, "That every particular or national church hath authority, to ordain, change and aboliſh ceremonies, or rights of the church, ordained only of man's authority." And well would it be indeed, to aboliſh all ſuch rights, ordained only by men's authority. But to ordain ſuch, to be binding upon the conſciences of men, cannot be done, without infringing upon the royal prerogative of Chriſt, as ſole king and lawgiver in his church. And it is equally inconſiſtent, to introduce any civil laws, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wholeſom in the commonwealth, as a rule of judgment, in matters pertaining to the conſcience, in the church of Chriſt. As that, would be a reflection upon the kingly office of Chriſt, as tho' he had not given laws himſelf, ſufficient for the due regulation and government of his church and kingdom, or as tho' his laws, might be diſpenſed with at pleaſure, by his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Such muſt needs be juſtly obnoxious, to that, his righteous rebuke. Luke 6.46. "Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay." Such as would own Chriſt Jeſus, for their Lord, muſt ſubject their conſciences, in all reſpects, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, entirely to his authority in his word.—But,</p>
            <p n="2">II. Of the nature of this body of Chriſt, the church, as to the ſubjects of which it doth conſiſt. And by the church is meant in the goſpel, in a more general ſenſe,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011692_0006_0F87EBFB1D70AEA0"/>all the true members of Chriſt, even the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of true believers, or all the elect of God, of what nation ſoever, from the beginning to the end of the world. All which make up, but one myſtical body, of which Chriſt is the Head. This is plainly meant, by the church in our text. As alſo in Col. 1.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. "And he is the Head of the Body, the Church, who is the beginning, the firſt born from the dead, that in all things he might have the pre-eminence." In this ſenſe, the church here in this world, is one body with that perfected in glory; according to that, Heb. 12.22, 23. "But ye are come unto Mount-Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and to an innumerable company of angels: to the general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born which are written in heaven." All true believers in Jeſus Chriſt, belong to, and are the ſubjects of this one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal church and kingdom of Chriſt; begun here in time and perfected in glory. "That he might preſent it to himſelf, a glorious church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy &amp; without blemiſh." Ep. 5.27. Theſe, the ſubjects of Chriſt's kingdom, in this general ſenſe, are not all joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any one viſible congregation here in this world. But in order to accompliſh his gracious purpoſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his church univerſal, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has ordained and appointed, that ſuch as profeſs to receive him as their Lord and Saviour, be joined together, in particular worſhipping congregations. To be each, as one viſible body; unitedly calling upon his Name, hearing his word, and partaking of his ordinances, and walking together as brethren, in that order and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which he hath appointed in his houſe. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the apoſtles, under the direction of Chriſt their Lord, did gather, ſet up and eſtabliſh, the firſt particular church at Jeruſalem; where the goſpel began to be preached, from whence the ſound thereof was to go forth into all the world: and other
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011692_0007_0F87EBFBDD6F4B28"/>particular churches be gathered and ſet up, after the pattern of that firſt church at Jeruſalem. Which church, according to the apoſtolic account, plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, to have been made up of ſuch, for the members thereof, as profeſſed to believe in, and receive the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic doctrine, concerning Jeſus Chriſt. Acts 2.41, &amp;c. "Then they that gladly received his word were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the ſame day, there were added unto them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three thouſand ſouls. And they continued ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers. And the Lord ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved." To that particular church at Jeruſalem were daily additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made, of ſuch as received the apoſtolic doctrine &amp; were baptiſed with the goſpel baptiſm; joined together to hold fellowſhip in that doctrine, and in the breaking of bread, in the Lord's-ſupper, and in prayers. And together with theſe, it ſeems were joined their infant ſeed, made members together with them of the ſame viſible body; and ſo alſo partakers of baptiſm the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating ſeal. As to theſe ſame perſons, St. Peter ſaid juſt before, "For the promiſe is to you, and to your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren." Theſe, made not many, but one worſhipping aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. "They were all with one accord in Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's porch." Acts 5.12. It was not, it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, the apoſtles and elders, that were denominated the church; but more eſpecially the brethren, even in diſtinction from the apoſtles and elders; as appears from Acts 15.4. "They, (Paul and Barnabas) were received of the <hi>church,</hi> &amp; of the <hi>apoſtles</hi> &amp; <hi>elders;"</hi> &amp; v. 22. Then pleaſed it the <hi>apoſtles</hi> and <hi>elders,</hi> with the whole <hi>church,</hi> to ſend choſen men," &amp;c. The <hi>brethren</hi> are here denominated the <hi>church;</hi> which appears to have had elders over them; beſides the apoſtles, as officers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with a ſpecial and extraordinary commiſſion, extending even to the ends of the earth. And from the Acts of the apoſtles, it appears, that after the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011692_0008_0F87EBFC9D715A80"/>of the firſt church at Jeruſalem, they actually ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered churches every where in every place, where a ſufficient number appeared to profeſs the goſpel faith, ordaining elders over every ſuch particular church. For, upon the perſecution that aroſe about Stephen, many were ſcatered abroad. And ſome of them going to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, "the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord; of whom a church was formed there, called the church at Antioch; to which Paul and Barnabas preached for a time. Act. 11.19. &amp;c. And from which alſo Paul and Barnabas were by the command of the Holy Ghoſt, ſent forth to preach the goſpel among the Gentiles. Act. 13.1. &amp;c. Who accordingly went forth and preached; and returning again thro' thoſe places where their preaching had been ſucceſsful, 'they confirmed the ſouls of the diſciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith; and when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with faſting, they commended them to the Lord on whom they believed.' Act. 14.21. &amp;c. Thus having gathered and ſet up particular churches in divers places, and completed their church ſtate, by ordaining elders over them, they commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not to any ſuperintending judicature, but to the Lord, on whom they believed. And thus every particular congregation, joined together to attend goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel worſhip and ordinances in one place, is in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel called a church. And where there are numbers of ſuch, of any province or kingdom, collectively ſpoken of, they are called churches. Thus we read of the church at Jeruſalem, of the church at Antioch, at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, &amp;c. meaning one particular worſhiping congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But of the churches of Judah, of Aſia, &amp;c. mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeveral particular congregations, which were in thoſe provinces. And neither is there any inſtance to be found in the new-teſtament, of the various par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular churches, thro' a whole province or kingdom,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011692_0009_0F87EBFD5D6D4F58"/>being collectively called the church of ſuch a country; ſuch as the church of Rome, the church of England, and the church of Scotland, &amp;c. meaning a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of particular aſſemblies, ſome how joined together, ſo as to be but one church. And ſo alſo, it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that there were any biſhops in the apoſtolic churches, that had the overſight of a number of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular churches; nor indeed any biſhop at all, but ſuch only, as were elders in ſome particular church. Agreeable to that, Acts 20.17. "And from Miletus, he (St. Paul) ſent to Epheſus and called the elders of the church;" compared with ver. 28th. "Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto yourſelves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers, to feed the church of God." Overſeers, that is, epiſcopous, the very word in the original, univerſally uſed in the new-teſtament for biſhops. Inſtead of one biſhop, over ſeveral particular churches, there were ſeveral elders over that one particular church at Epheſus. And all thoſe elders were overſeers; epiſcopous, the true ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture biſhops, and ſuch are all goſpel elders.</p>
            <p>And, III. To the brethren of ſuch particular church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, with their own elder or elders over them, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of all church diſcipline belongs. To ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar churches, Chriſt has committed all that authority, which he hath given in the new-teſtament, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, ſtanding diſcipline of his houſe; to admit their own members, to receive complaints, to hear, try, judge, and deal with offenders; to reſtore the penitent, or to reject and caſt off incorrigible offenders; as point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, Mat. 18.15, &amp;c. "Moreover, if thy brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and him alone; if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes every word may be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And if he neglect to hear them, tell it unto the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011692_0010_0F87EBFE1D6FCC10"/>church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. Verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven; and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven." This is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral commiſſion, and moſt explicit direction, given by Chriſt, for the exerciſe of diſcipline in his houſe; which is plainly given as to a particular church, and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble therefore to every ſuch church. And what is here ſaid, in this particular verſe, is abundantly illuſtrated, ratified, and confirmed, by the various declarations here and there ſet forth in the new-teſtament relative to this matter. More particularly: From the elders of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular churches, being ſtiled rulers; as in 1 Tim. 5.17. "Let the elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour." And, Heb. 13.7. "Remember them that have the rule over you, who have ſpoken unto you the word of God." And, ver. 17. "Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſouls, as they that muſt give account." Thus every elder, is by office, a ruler over the particular church of which he is elder. Beſides whom, we read of no other ſtanding rulers in the church of Chriſt. And yet, neither are they ſet to rule as lords over God's heritage; but as enſamples to the flock. 1 Pet. 5.3. And conſequently to rule with the joint concurrence of their reſpective churches. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly particular directions are given, expreſsly to the brethren, about this matter. Rom. 16.17. "Now I beſeech you brethren, mark them which cauſe diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and offences, contrary to the doctrines which ye have learned, and avoid them." And 2 Theſ. 3.6. "Now we command you brethren, in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye withdraw yourſelves from every brother that walketh diſorderly." Thus the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are called to mark, judge of, and avoid thoſe that walk diſorderly, and cauſe offences, contrary to the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011692_0011_0F87EBFEDD6BB148"/>apoſtolic doctrine. Agreeable to that, 1 Cor. 5.11. "But now I have written unto you not to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, if any man that is called a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with ſuch an one no not to eat."</p>
            <p>And thus the church of Chriſt at Corinth, acting by the apoſtles direction, as a particular church, did put away from among themſelves, the inceſtuous perſon; and after his repentance reſtored him again. 1 Cor. 5.13. "Put away from among you that wicked perſon." And, 2 Cor. 2.6, and 8. "Sufficient to ſuch a man is the puniſhment which was inflicted of many. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſeech you, that ye would confirm your love towards him." Thus even St. Paul himſelf did not attempt authoritatively to reſtore him, whom the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian church had put away from among them; and that not even after he had manifeſted repentance. "But beſeeches them to confirm their love to him." And if not St. Paul, who then among men, may in ſuch caſes, claim juridical authority over particular churches? Thus it is abundantly manifeſt, that the whole autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given by Jeſus Chriſt, for the government, order, and diſcipline of his houſe, is given to individual churches, to be veſted in them, and to be exerciſed by them. And where Chriſt himſelf has placed this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, there it muſt abide; and cannot be given up by particular churches into any other hands, without betraying the truſt which the Lord has committed unto them. Nor can any wreſt it out of their hands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out treſpaſſing upon the royal prerogative of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who muſt reign till all his enemies are put under his feet.</p>
            <p>It is doubtleſs conſiſtent with the goſpel, for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar churches in different caſes, to aſk adviſory counſel of neighbouring elders and churches. "As in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of counſellors there is ſafety." Prov. 11.14. And requiſite alſo that elders be ordained by a preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011692_0012_0F87EBFF9D704910"/>of elders. 1 Tim. 4.14. "Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by propheſy, with the laying on of the hands of the preſbytery." Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with 2 Tim. 2.2. "And the things which thou haſt heard of me among many witneſſes, the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thou to faithful men, who ſhall be able to teach others alſo." But all abſolute juridical ſuperiority of any one man, or of any number of men, over ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular churches, is plainly forbidden. Mat, 20.25. "But Jeſus called them unto him, (his diſciples, moved with indignation one at another, about which ſhould be the greateſt) and ſaid, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exerciſe dominion over them; and they that are great exerciſe authority upon them. But it ſhall not be ſo among you; but whoſoever will be great among you, let him be your miniſter. And whoſoever will be chief among you, let him be your ſervant." Compared with Mat. 23.8. "But be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your maſter, even Chriſt, and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father upon the earth; for one is your father which is in heaven. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ye called maſter; for one is your maſter, even Chriſt. But he that is greateſt among you ſhall be your ſervant." So that juridical authority, over individual churches, cannot be exerciſed, by any one or more, without direct infringement upon the laws of the great Head and King of the church, who will not give his glory to another. <note n="*" place="bottom">There can be no juſt pretence, to ſo much as the plauſible ſhadow of one inſtance in the new-teſtament, of an eccleſiaſtical conſiſtory, ſynod, or council, for the countenance and ſupport of thoſe of a modern form, excepting that in the 15th chapter of the Acts, about the circumciſion of the Gentiles. A queſtion which Paul and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas were ſent upon, from Antioch, to the apoſtles and elders at Jeruſalem: v. 1.2. "And they were received of the church, and of the apoſtles and elders." v. 4. "For the apoſtles and elders came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to conſider of this matter." v. 6. "Then pleaſed it the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and elders, with the whole church, to ſend choſen men of their own company to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas," (v. 22.) with this reſult, "For it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than theſe neceſſary things; that ye abſtain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things ſtrangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourſelves ye ſhall do well." v. 28, 29.
<p>In all which there is no appearance of a ſynodical council; but only a meeting of the apoſtles and elders that were at Jeruſalem, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that whole church. For Paul and Barnabas were only meſſengers propoſing the queſtion. And to whom could the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of ſuch a queſtion of conſcience belong, but to the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, who being divinely inſpired, could with propriety ſay, "It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good to the holy Ghoſt, and to us." Tho' they were pleaſed to take the concurrence of the elders, with the whole church at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</p>
                  <p>But how utterly vain the pretence of uninſpired men, to any ſuch kind of authority, to ſet forth injunctions, binding upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?</p>

And if now we ſhould take a view of ſome of the various forms of church government, eſtabliſhed among profeſſing chriſtians; you may perhaps be better able to judge for yourſelves, whether there be not in many reſpects, a very ſad deviation from the laws of Chriſt. And to begin neareſt home. In thoſe that are called the conſociated churches, the manner of diſciplining offenders, is allowed to begin with, and to be proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in by, particular churches, even unto excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, agreeable to the ſcriptures. But then inſtead of the matters reſting there, where the ſcriptures plainly reſt it; the excommunicated perſon may apply to the conſociation; who, if they ſee cauſe, may hear the caſe, and order the church to receive ſuch excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated perſon again to their communion, and that on pain of ſcandalous contempt, however unanimouſly the church might be agreed as to the evidence of his guilt. And inſtances of ſuch a kind there actually have been. Beſides, ſuch councils called to act conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionally, do act not adviſorily, but juridically, giving a deciſive judgment to be abſolutely binding upon the church, and all the parties concerned; which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive to be really aſide from, and even contrary to, the laws of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:011692_0014_0F87EC011D6A6928"/>
As to the churches called preſbyterian, or of the church of Scotland: according to that conſtitution, the common brethren of the church have little to do in matters of church diſcipline. Their miniſters, with their ruling elders, make a ſort of juridical board, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom lies the firſt hearing of all matters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſcipline; from whom appeals lie to their preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries; as alſo from the preſbyteries to provincial ſynods; and from thence to the general aſſembly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of delegates from all the preſbyteries or ſynods in the nation. In whom lies the final deciſion of all eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical differences. So far, according to that conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is deciſive authority removed from particular churches. In the conſociated churches it is removed; but as it were one ſtep, up to a conſociated council. But in the church of Scotland, it is removed by various riſing degrees, up to a general aſſembly of eccleſiaſtical delegates.</p>
            <p>And ſo alſo, according to the conſtitution of the church of England, the common brethren of particular churches have nothing at all to do in matters of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; nor even the miniſters of particular churches, farther than ſpecified in the rubrick, under the order for the adminiſtration of the Lord's-ſupper. "That the curate having knowledge of any of the communicants, that they are notorious evil-doers, ſhall advertiſe ſuch, that in any wiſe they preſume not to come to the Lord's table, until they have openly declared themſelves truly to have repented," &amp;c. "Provided, that every miniſter ſo repelling any, ſhall be obliged to give an account of the ſame to the ordinary, within fourteen days after, at the fartheſt." Here the brethren have no hand in this diſcipline. The curate alone repels offenders; which yet, he is allowed to do, but only for fourteen days; within which time, he is obliged to give an account thereof to the ordinary, that is, to the biſhop or arch deacon. "And the ordinary," as ſaid in the rubrick,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011692_0015_0F87EC01DD6A2E90"/>"ſhall proceed againſt the offending perſon, according to the canon." By which canon is not doubtleſs meant the law of Chriſt. But the canon law of the church of England, taken chiefly, if not intirely, from the canon law of the church of Rome. But ſtill, the arch biſhop's court is ſuperior to that of the ordinary's; even as in the church of Rome, the pope in his conclave of cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, is ſupreme over all other eccleſiaſtical judicatures. And whether ſuch methods of church diſcipline be not manifeſtly contrary to the laws of Jeſus Chriſt, I freely ſubmit to you my hearers to judge for yourſelves.</p>
            <p>One ſpecial reaſon of ſuch national kind of hierarchies, or national forms of church government, ſeems to be taken from a ſuppoſition, that the Jewiſh church and kingdom was deſigned to be a ſort of pattern for nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal churches under the goſpel. The kings of Iſrael were ſupreme in all matters both civil and eccleſiaſtical. And in that church there was one high prieſt, chief over numbers of prieſts of a lower order; all which were ſuperior to the Levites appointed to lower kinds of ſervices.</p>
            <p>In imitation of which, the church of Rome hath one high prieſt, ſet up in the pope's office, to be ſupreme over all eccleſiaſtical dignities, with a multiplied grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of prieſtly orders under him. And ſo alſo in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the kings of Iſrael, the kings of Great-Britain are deemed by the church of England, the ſupreme head thereof; and their eccleſiaſtical hierarchy aimed to be modeled, in ſome meaſure, after that of the Jewiſh church. As indeed the very notion of all national, religious eſtabliſhments, ſeems to be derived very much from the ſame ſource, the national eſtabliſhment of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the Jewiſh kingdom of old. All which pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of imitation, derived from the Jewiſh to the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church, appear to be quite groundleſs. If it be conſidered, that the Jewiſh ſtate was a type and ſhadow of ſpiritual and heav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ly things in and by the promiſed
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011692_0016_0F87EC029D740618"/>Meſſiah; that their kings were typical of Chriſt in his kingly office; their high prieſts typical of the high prieſthood of Chriſt; as all their various offerings were, of the great ſacrifice which Chriſt offered of himſelf; and even as the earthly was a type of the heavenly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan. All which, being types and ſhadows of Chriſt and heavenly things, were therefore aboliſhed and done away by the coming of Chriſt, the ſubſtance, as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſet forth in the epiſtle to the Hebrews.</p>
            <p>Or ſhould it be thought a wiſe device, to have men of learning and ſuperior abilities ſelected to be judges in eccleſiaſtical matters: What device then could be wiſer, than to have the moſt learned in a nation, ſuch as biſhops and arch-biſhops are ſuppoſed to be, for judges in ſuch matters? But how much more wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wiſe then ſtill, is the Romiſh device, of ſetting up the very wiſeſt of all, endowed with a ſpirit of infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to be ſupreme judge over all? But the truth is, human policy has no right to deviſe any thing at all about church government, different from what the great Head of the church hath appointed. Authority to exerciſe diſcipline muſt reſt in the hands of thoſe to whom Chriſt himſelf has committed it, even in every particular church. In regard to which, it concerns the churches to ſee to it, that they ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt has made them free. In civil mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, men are commonly wont to account the privilege of being judged by a jury of equals, eſſential to their liberty. And ſo in eccleſiaſtical matters, the privilege of judging and being judged as equals in a particular church, is juſtly to be eſteemed eſſential to goſpel li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, in regard to the diſcipline of Chriſt's church and kingdom. Reſpecting which, as exerciſed by indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual churches, is that, Mat. 18.18. "Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven; and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven:" That is, be approved
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011692_0017_0F87EC035D660810"/>of, ratified, and confirmed by Chriſt the Head. Which diſcipline is to be proceeded in with a ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and readineſs to forgive, in a ſenſe of our own need of forgiveneſs. Mat. 18.5, 6. "Whoſo ſhall receive one ſuch little child in my name, receiveth me; but whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depths of the ſea." Compared with ver. 35. "So likewiſe ſhall my heavenly Father do alſo unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their treſpaſſes." So that where due regard is had to the laws of Chriſt, there will be no tyrannical lording of it over any. But while there is a forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to forgive the penitent, there will be a ſteady and unſhaken fortitude to reject obſtinate offenders.</p>
            <p>Some of the ſpecial ends deſigned by ſuch diſcipline, is the good of offenders, the maintenance of brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love, the honour of Chriſt, and that his church may enjoy his promiſed preſence with them. One ſpecial end deſigned, is the good of offenders, that they may be convicted, humbled, and reclaimed; "That the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus." 1 Cor. 5.5. Offenders therefore are to be diſciplined, even in regard to their own good.</p>
            <p>Another end thereby deſigned, is to maintain that brotherly love which the goſpel requires. Chriſtian brethren are enjoined, "above all things, to have fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent charity among themſelves." 1 Pet. 4.8. But there can be no grounds for ſuch fervent charity, farther than they appear to one another, to be truly conformed to Chriſt. Such therefore as conduct inconſiſtent with the chriſtian character, muſt either be reclaimed or be caſt out; that ſuch as do partake together as brethren, in the ſpiritual ordinances of Chriſt's houſe, may have fervent charity among themſelves. So that it is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſiſtent with that brotherly love, which the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011692_0018_0F87EC041D668128"/>requires, to hold communion with an offending brother, without taking goſpel meaſures to reclaim him. Which diſcipline, is alſo for the honor of Chriſt, of his church and name in the world. For by this, ſaid Jeſus, "ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples if ye have love one to another." John 13.35. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect therefore to ſuch as do not appear, to be fit objects of this peculiar love, but unworthy to rank with Chriſt's members; it is ſaid, "Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for even Chriſt our paſſover is ſacrificed for us." 1 Cor. 5.7. "For we being many are one bread, and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread." 1 Cor. 10.17. And it muſt ſurely be vilely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoring to Chriſt the head, for his body, the church, to admit openly profane members, to partake with them of that one bread, as members together of his one body. And ſo alſo to maintain the diſcipline of Chriſt's houſe according to his appointment, is requiſite to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his promiſed preſence and bleſſing. As Chriſt's promiſed preſence with his church, is to be expected, only while they walk in his ways, keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and attend the orders of his houſe. "For if ye love me, keep my commandments," ſaid Jeſus, "and I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother comforter, that he may abide with you forever. He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt my ſelf unto him." John 14.15, &amp;c. "For, if ye keep my commandments, ye ſhall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love." John 15.10. Which has reſpect to all Chriſt's commandments, even to ſuch as regard the order and diſcipline of his houſe, as well as to others. Therefore without the due obſervation thereof, his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial preſence and bleſſing, is not to be expected. But
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011692_0019_0F87EC04DD694818"/>rather the woes which he hath denounced againſt ſuch as ſwerve from the faith and order of his houſe. As he ſaid, "Remember therefore how thou haſt received and heard, and hold faſt and repent; if therefore thou ſhall not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou ſhall not know <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> hour I will come upon thee." Rev. 3.3.</p>
            <p>Hence then may be infered,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is a matter of great importance, that churches take earneſt heed, to attend to, and obſerve, that order and diſcipline in Chriſt's houſe, which he himſelf hath ordained and pointed out in his word. The peculiar characteriſtic of churches, originates ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much from this their manner and form of diſcipline. And as Chriſt ſaid to certain Jews, profeſſing to believe in him, "If ye continue in my word, then are ye my diſciples indeed." John 8.31. i. e. If we walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my word, then will ye appear to be my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in truth. So doubtleſs may it with juſt propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety be ſaid of churches profeſſing the faith of Chriſt. If they attend to, and obſerve the orders which he hath appointed in his houſe, then do they appear to be his churches in truth. Not but that, as in particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, there may be many imperfections, conſiſtent with their being true diſciples of Chriſt; ſo there may doubtleſs be much imperfection in the order of church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, conſiſtent with their being true churches of Chriſt. And altho' to draw a line preciſely betwixt ſuch as may, and ſuch as cannot be true churches of Chriſt, may not belong to fallible men to attempt; yet every one have a right to judge for themſelves about theſe matters; and all had need to be fully perſuaded in their own minds, as to their own practice, ſo far as to conſort and walk together with ſuch churches, as appear to them on the whole, moſt nearly conformable to the faith and order of the goſpel. And yet ſtill it is an undoubted truth, that churches profeſſing the chriſtian faith, do ſo far only appear to be the true churches of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011692_0020_0F87EC059D63C9D8"/>Chriſt, as they appear to walk after the order which he hath preſcribed in his word. Therefore it highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns every church, as they would approve themſelves a true church of Chriſt, to ſee to it that they attend to the mind and will of Chriſt, revealed in his word, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the order and diſcipline of his houſe, and that they cordially embrace, and ſtedfaſtly adhere thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; even in this reſpect, as well as in every other, cheerfully bearing the croſs after Chriſt, that living to him as their ſovereign Lord and King, they may reign with him in the kingdom of his glory.—And hence then,</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Be exhorted my brethren, to ſee to it with ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt care and diligence, that ye walk together in the true faith and order of the goſpel. That ye ſubmit yourſelves to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as ſole king and lawgiver in Sion. That you attend to his will, ſet forth in his word, as the only rule of faith and practice; admitting no other rule in matters pertaining to the conſcience, but ſubmiting yourſelves intirely to the authority of Chriſt in his word; that abiding ſtedfaſtly therein, you may appear to be a true church of Chriſt indeed. And take earneſt heed to yourſelves perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, to conduct every one in particular, as becomes the members of Chriſt's body, holy in all manner of life and converſation, even as he that hath called you is holy; carefully ſhuning all the evil ways of this wicked world, even all covetous and injurious practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; all bitter and envious paſſions, all defaming, rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and backbiting; all intemperate and unclean in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies, and all lewd and profane company, and all vile and filthy converſation. Be on your guard againſt the ſin that moſt eaſily beſets you. And ſtrive earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after growth and increaſe in every chriſtian grace and vertue. That ye may approve yourſelves to be the diſciples of Chriſt in truth. And recommend your ſelves to the fervent charity of your chriſtian brethren.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011692_0021_0F87EC065D65B220"/>And ſee to it, that you act the part of true diſciples of Chriſt towards others. That you watch over your children, whom you have brought with you and given up to the Lord. That you faithfully train them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, counſelling, warning and reproving them; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trained up in the way in which they ſhould go, they may not depart from it.</p>
            <p>And take heed alſo as chriſtian brethren, to watch over exhort and admoniſh one another. Suffer not ſin upon thy brother, but if he ſin, rebuke him. "Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, ſaid the apoſtle, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are ſpiritual reſtore ſuch an one in the ſpirit of meekneſs, conſidering thyſelf leſt thou alſo be tempted. Bear ye one another's burdens and ſo fulfil the law of Chriſt. And be ye kind one to another, and tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you." But from incorrigible offenders, be careful to withdraw yourſelves, and to put them away from among you. That you may appear to be, as becomes the body of Chriſt, knit together in love, and filled with all his fullneſs, to the everlaſting praiſe of his glorious grace.</p>
