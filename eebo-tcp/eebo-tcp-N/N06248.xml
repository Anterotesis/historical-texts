            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1756</label> I HAVE received an Account from Sir <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> ſent me by Sir <hi>Charles Hardy,</hi> Governor of <hi>New-York,</hi> that, immediately after the Council held at <hi>Fort Johnſon,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties were diſpatched by the <hi>Six Nations</hi> to <hi>Atſaningo,</hi> and that they convened the <hi>Delawares, Shawaneſe,</hi> and other <hi>Indians,</hi> from the ſeveral Towns on the <hi>Saſquehannah,</hi> to the Number of Three Hundred, to whom they delivered Meſſages from that Council, blaming them for taking up the Hatchet againſt their Brethren the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to lay it down immediately; and that they had hearkened to this Meſſage, and agreed to ſtrike no more.—What I tell you is in this Letter. [<hi>Here the Governor gave Mr.</hi> Welſer <hi>Sir</hi> Charles Hardy's <hi>Letter of the 16th of</hi> April, <hi>to interpret to them. And when he had made them underſtand what Sir</hi> Charles Hardy <hi>had wrote, the Governor took a Belt in his Hand, and proceeded.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think it neceſſary that the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Wioming,</hi> as well Enemies as Friends, ſhould know, that Sir <hi>Charles Hardy</hi> has ſent this Account to me from Sir <hi>William Johnſon</hi>; and as two of you are of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and one a <hi>Delaware,</hi> I think it proper that you ſhould undertake to notify this to them; and at the ſame Time to let them know, as from yourſelves, that if they are ſincerely diſpoſed to Peace, and will deliver up the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners to the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and hearken to their Advice in laying down the Hatchet, and abide by ſuch Terms as ſhall be agreed on, you can venture to aſſure them, that tho' much Blood has been ſpilt, and that the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in Reſentment of this, are well prepared to avenge themſelves, yet they have ſo great Regard for the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> that it will be in their Power to perſwade the <hi>Engliſh</hi> not to proſecute the War, but to accept fair, juſt and honourable Terms; and I provide you with this Belt, to deliver it to them with ſuch a Speech.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſpeak my own ſincere Inclinations, when I ſay I am for Peace; and not only my own, but the Sentiments of others, and particularly the earneſt Deſire of a Number of People, who are the Deſcendants of thoſe that came over with the firſt Proprietor; all thoſe are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely deſirous to interpoſe with the Government, to receive the Submiſſion of the <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares,</hi> and to overlook what is paſt, and eſtabliſh for the future a firm and laſting Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Peace and Affection between us, and have repeatedly applied to me for this Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As many Stories have been told to the <hi>Indians</hi> to our Prejudice, I deſire you will unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them; and particularly I do charge <hi>William Locquies</hi> to acquaint the <hi>Delawares,</hi> that thoſe of their Tribe who live among us, have not had any Miſchief done them, but are treated with our uſual Kindneſs, and are at Liberty, and live in Peace and Plenty among us.—I charge you <hi>William Locquies,</hi> to declare the Truth to the <hi>Indians,</hi> and to aſſure <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007923_0003_102E0222438AD470"/>them that they have been impoſed on; and relate the Care that has been taken, as well by the Government of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> as this, of all the <hi>Indians</hi> who have ſtaid with us, and that they enjoy our Protection, and live as happily as ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A String.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Paxinoſa,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> and other <hi>Indians,</hi> have not broke Faith with us, but endeavoured to diſſuade the <hi>Delawares</hi> from ſtriking us.—When they could not ſucceed, they ſeparated from them, and now live together in ſome Place near <hi>Wioming</hi>; I would have you go to them, and let them likewiſe know this Account from Sir <hi>William Johſon,</hi> and aſſure them from me, that if they are inclined to come within the Inhabitants, you have my Orders to conduct them; or if they do not incline to come now, but at any other Time, they will, on ſending me a Meſſage, be provided with a ſafe Conduct, and meet with an hearty Welcome.—Let them know that <hi>Scarroyady</hi> related to me what had paſied between him and them; and that <hi>Aroas</hi> and <hi>David</hi> have likewiſe made me acquainted with what was ſaid by them when they were laſt at <hi>Wioming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Governor gave them a String to give to</hi> Paxinoſa.</p>
               <p>Newcaſtle, Jagrea, <hi>and</hi> William Locquies, <hi>returned the Governor an Anſwer,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>That the Meſſages were very good, and what they approved mightily, and would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Journey, and deliver them faithfully; but then they muſt deſire the Governor would make their Apology to Colonel <hi>Clapham,</hi> and tell him, that nothing but the Governor's Commands would have induced them to delay their coming to him.</p>
               <p>The Governor promiſed he would; and then told them, that Mr. <hi>Spangenberg</hi> was deſired to be preſent, having ſome <hi>Delaware Indians</hi> under his Care, that he might hear what was delivered to them.—He deſired they would go by Way of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and take with them one or more of the <hi>Indians</hi> there, and that Mr. <hi>Spangenberg</hi> would prepare thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> for their Viſit, and perſwade ſome of them to accompany them to <hi>Wioming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Meſſengers returned, and on the 31ſt of <hi>May,</hi> 1756, made the following Report, <hi>viz. That on their Arrival at</hi> Wioming, <hi>they found the</hi> Indians <hi>had left the Town, and gone up the River; they therefore proceeded to</hi> Teaogon, <hi>where they met with a great Number of</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, <hi>and informed them they had brought a Meſſage from the Governor of</hi> Pennſylvania, <hi>and deſired a Meeting of all their People in that Town and near it; which being obtained in two Days, they then delivered their Meſſage.—After which,</hi> Paxinoſa, <hi>as Speaker of their Council, returned the following Anſwer,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren, The Governor, and People of</hi> Pennſylvania,</p>
               <p>THE dark Clouds overſpread our Country ſo ſuddenly, that we have been all at once ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and that dark Cloud got in between us; and as it has pleaſed the moſt High to diſpel it a little, ſo that we can juſt ſee one another again, our Eyes are now running with Tears, becauſe of the melancholy Sight of ſeeing our Country covered with our own Blood (we mean yours and ours.)

               </p>
               <p>There is a great Number of our People among you, and in a Manner confined; we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you will ſet them at Liberty, or rather give them a ſafe Conduct to <hi>Wioming,</hi> where we intend to ſettle as on your Fire Side; there we will jointly with you kindle a Council-Fire, which ſhall always burn, and we will be one People with you.</p>

                  <hi>Brother</hi> Onas, <hi>and all the People of</hi> Pennſylvania,</p>
               <p>We had the Misfortune that a great and dark Cloud overſpread our Country; but by our Prudence, and that of our Uncles, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> it is now almoſt diſpelled, and we ſee the clear Heavens again. We the <hi>Delawares,</hi> the <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> the <hi>Mohickons,</hi> and <hi>Memſkies,</hi> give you this String Wampum, and deſire you, that the Bitterneſs which might have gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this dark and unhappy Time may be removed, and that you may by this Means ſpit it out; take or accept this as a certain Cure for that Purpoſe, and paſs by all that is paſt, and think on your poor fooliſh Brethren with Mercy, and forget all the Evil done to you by them.</p>
               <p>

               <p>What our Uncles the <hi>Six Nations</hi> required of us, in your and their Behalf, by their Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, at <hi>Otſaningo,</hi> we that live on the River <hi>Saſquehannah</hi> have agreed to. We have laid aſide our Hatchet, and will never make uſe of it any more againſt you or your Brethren, the <hi>Engliſh</hi>: All our young Men have been conſulted about this, and all earneſtly agree to it, and we now ſpeak in their Preſence.</p>
               <p>We muſt give you this Caution, not to charge them with any Thing that may be done by the <hi>Ohio Indians,</hi> who are under the Influence of the <hi>French</hi> againſt you. We aſſure you, our young Men will do no more Miſchief to your People.</p>

               <p>As you on your Parts have confirmed the Treaties and Leagues of Amity ſubſiſting between you and this Government, and given a Belt in Confirmation thereof, and deſire the ſame be done on our Part; I do now, by this Belt, ratify and confirm all former Treaties and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and aſſure, that they ſhall be moſt inviolably obſerved as long as the Sun ſhines.</p>

               <p>

               <p>That you and I may have an Opportunity of making theſe mutual Declarations at a publick Convention, I now kindle a Council-Fire at the Houſe of <hi>Conrad Weiſer,</hi> who is one of the Council of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and the publick Interpreter of the Province.</p>

               <p>N. B. <hi>Mr.</hi> Weifer <hi>ſaid it was neceſſary to name a particular Place; but the</hi> Indians <hi>were, not with ſtanding this, always at Liberty to name another; and he believed, from ſomething Captain</hi> Newcaſtle <hi>had dropped, the</hi> Indians <hi>would chuſe the</hi> Forks-of-Delaware.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having appointed a Place for us to meet in Council, I now clear the Roads to this Place, and remove the Logs and other Obſtructions out of it, ſo that it may be perfectly ſafe for every one deſirous to uſe it to travel to their Brethren when met in Council.</p>
               <p>

               <p>It is offenſive to ſee Blood ſpilt upon the Road uſed by People who have lived in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip together, I therefore remove all Blood out of the Road that leads to the Council-Fire.</p>

               <p>Your <hi>Indians</hi> who live among us go where they pleaſe; they live as we do; and enjoy their Liberty. We only hinder them from going to the Frontiers, where they might be miſtaken for Enemies, and hurt or killed; and that the <hi>Indians</hi> may know the Truth of this, we ſend ſome of them along with our Meſſengers to <hi>Teaogon,</hi> who will declare what Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have had from us. What few we have in Confinement ſhall be ſet at Liberty when the Council meets, and be brought there.</p>

               <p>This laſt is a very important Article, and what we abſolutely depend upon, That all Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners taken on both Sides ſhall be delivered up, as there can be no Sincerity on either Side where this is not done, and that in the moſt faithful and ample Manner, without keeping back a ſingle Priſoner; this Belt aſſures you that it ſhall be punctually performed by us, and we expect the ſame punctually on your Side.</p>

I aſſured you of an hearty Welcome as ſoon as I came here, and of my Protection; and I now, in the Name of this Government, again bid you welcome. As Captain <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> brought me no Anſwer to ſome Part of the Meſſages I ſent laſt by him, I expect to receive them by you. I hope you come prepared to ſpeak to us freely, ſincerely, and openly, and deſire you may do ſo.</p>

I returned an Anſwer to them, and waited for your ſecond Meſſages, which came after ſome Time, and were likewiſe very agreeable. By the laſt you acquainted me that you had kindled a Council Fire, and invited me and my People to it. We accepted the Invitation; and I came accordingly, and have ſtaid ſeveral Days, ſmoaking my Pipe with Patience, expecting to meet you here. We are ready to hear what you have to ſay, and not only we, but five other Nations, in all ten Nations, are now turning their Eyes this Way, and wait what will be ſaid and done at this Meeting.</p>

                  </gap> here, yet it will not be long before you will be convinced that I am here by the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ten Nations, among which are my Uncles the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> authorizing me to treat with you, and what I do they will all confirm. The Truth of this you will ſoon have made evident to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hearken to what I am going to ſay: I declare, in the moſt ſolemn Manner, that what I now relate is the Truth. Abundance of Confuſion, Diſorder and Diſtraction has ariſen among the <hi>Indians,</hi> from People taking upon them to be Kings, and Perſons of Authority. In every Tribe of <hi>Indians</hi> there have been ſuch Pretenders, who have held Treaties, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times publick, and ſometimes in the Buſhes; ſometimes what theſe People did came to be known, but frequently it remained in Darkneſs, or at leaſt no more was imparted to the Publick than they were pleaſed to publiſh. To ſome they held up their Belts, but others never ſaw them; this bred among the <hi>Indians</hi> great Heart-burnings and Quarrels, and I can aſſure you, that the preſent Clouds do, in a great Meaſure, owe their Riſe to this wild and irregular Way of doing Buſineſs.—The <hi>Indians,</hi> ſenſible of this Miſtake of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, are now determined to put an End to this Multitude of Kings, and to this dark Way of proceeding; they have agreed to put the Management of their Affairs into the Hands of a very few, and theſe ſhall no longer have it in their Power to huddle up and give partial Repreſentations of what is done. I aſſure you, that there are only two Kings appointed to tranſact publick Buſineſs, of which I am one. For the future, Matters will go better on both Sides; you as well as we will know who we are to deal with. We muſt beſeech the moſt High to ſcatter the Clouds which have ariſen between us, that we may ſettle Peace as heretofore.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren, the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>and particularly the Governor of</hi> Pennſylvania,</p>
               <p>You know you have invited me here; I came therefore; my Uncles, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> will confirm what I ſay. In your Meſſages to the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Dialago</hi> you ſignified to us, that you heard we were in Want and Diſtreſs, which to be ſure we are, and pitied us and our poor Wives and Children. We took it kindly, and as a Word that came from your Heart. Now is the Time for you to look about, and act the Part of a charitable and wiſe Man.— Be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtrong—be aſſured that, though I am poor, I will do my Share. Whatever Kindneſs you do to me, or my People, ſhall be publicſhed to ten <hi>Indian</hi> Nations. We will not hide any Preſents you ſhall give us; every Body ſhall know that we have heard your good Words. We will not do as others, and ſome of our Uncles, the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> have done, ſneak away, and hide your Words and Preſents in the Buſhes, but ſhall publiſh far and near, that all may join with us. Exert yourſelves now in the beſt Maner you can, and you will obtain your End.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Concluſion of my Words is no more than this; the Matter in Hand is of too great Moment for one Man. I am but a Meſſenger from the <hi>United Nations,</hi> though I act as a Chief Man for the <hi>Delawares.</hi> I muſt now hear what you have to ſay to my People at this Council-Fire. If it be good, I ſhall lay hold of it, and carry it to the <hi>United Nations,</hi> who will ſmile and be pleaſed to hear good News. If what you will ſay be diſagreeable, I will, notwithſtanding, keep it cloſe (<hi>here be cloſed his Fiſt</hi>) and deliver it faithfully to the <hi>United Nations,</hi> and let them, as they are my Superiors, do as they ſee Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Being aſked if he had done, he ſaid he had for the preſent; the main Thing, he added is yet in my Breaſt, laying his Hand to his Heart, but this will depend on what Words the Governor will ſpeak to us. Then he repeated the <hi>Delaware</hi> Word, <hi>Whiſh-ſhickſy,</hi> the ſame in <hi>Mohock</hi> Language as <hi>Jago,</hi> with great Earneſtneſs, and in a very pathetick Tone. Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> who knew the Word to have a very extenſive and forcible Senſe, deſired the Interpreter t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I AM going to ſpeak to you on the Affair we are met about; my Speech will contain Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great Moment: By this String of Wampum therefore I open your Ears, that you may give a proper Attention.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of this Province have ever been a peaceable People, and remarkable for their Love and conſtant Friendſhip to the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and other <hi>Indians</hi> in Alliance with them.</p>
               <p>When our Back Inhabitants were attacked laſt Fall, we at firſt were at a Loſs to know from whence the Blow came; and were much ſurprized when we were informed that it was given by our old Friends and Neighbours the Couſins of our Brethren the <hi>Six Nations</hi>; we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at it; and the more ſo, as we had not, to our Knowledge, given them any juſt Cauſe of Offence.—As ſoon as we knew this, we ſent to the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and informed them of it, and deſired to know, whether this Blow had been ſtruck by their Direction, or with their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity or Conſent: And on receiving Aſſurances from them, that it was not done with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and that they greatly diſapproved ſuch Conduct, we made ready to revenge the Injury we had received, and we wanted neither Men or Arms, Ammunition, nor Strength to do it, and to take Vengeance for the Injury done us; yet, when we had the Hatchet in our Hands, and were prepared not only to defend ourſelves, but to carry the War into the Country of thoſe who had ſtruck us, we ſent again to the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> agreeable to the Treaties ſubſiſting between us, to acquaint them of our Intentions. They let us know they had held a Grand Council, at <hi>Fort Johnſon,</hi> on this Matter, and that Deputies from thence were ſent to ſummon a Meeting of <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe</hi> at <hi>Otſaningo,</hi> who were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an Account, That their Nephews had, at their Interpoſition, laid down the Hatchet, and would ſtrike the <hi>Engliſh</hi> no more. The <hi>Six Nations</hi> having received theſe Aſſurances from the <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> requeſted us not to execute our hoſtile Purpoſes, but to ſuſpend Hoſtilities; declaring, that they would fully accommodate this Breach, and bring about a Peace. At this Requeſt of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> we kept our Warriors at Home, for guarding and protecting our Frontiers. I then ſent <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and other <hi>Indian</hi> Meſſengers to you, to notify the Advices of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> with reſpect to what had been determined at <hi>Otſaningo,</hi> inſtructing him, in caſe he found you ſincerely diſpoſed for Peace, and inclined to return to your Alliance with us, to aſſure you, on the Behalf of this Government, that we were willing to it, on juſt and honourable Terms. <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and the other Meſſengers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with your Anſwers; in which you acknowledged, you had been under the Influence of an Evil Spirit, but were well diſpoſed to return to your old Amity and Friendſhip; at the ſame Time letting us know, that you was ſorry for what had paſſed; that you was in Diſtreſs, and deſired we would pity your Diſtreſſes. To ſhew our Readineſs to enter into a Treaty, and our Sincerity in what was ſaid by <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> I ſent him back again to you, to let you know, on the Behalf of this Government, that I had kindled a Council-Fire, invited all your People to it, cleared the Road, waſhed off the Blood, and promiſed, if your People would come to Council, and renew former Leagues, and do what is further neceſſary on the Occaſion, I would bring ſomething with me to relieve your Diſtreſſes.—I thought it right to go through this Account in this particular Manner, that you might know from myſelf what was the Subject of the Meſſages ſent by <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and what was the Subſtance of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers I received by him. And now, I ſuppoſe (as I do not ſee the Body of your <hi>Indians</hi> here) your People, in general, did not believe <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> but ſent you to know if he had my <pb n="10" facs="unknown:007923_0009_102FC1B4A6143EC8"/>Authority for the ſeveral Matters he delivered to you, and to hear them from my own Mouth. I do not blame you for this Caution, it beſpeaks your Care. The Matters he was charged with being of the laſt Concern, for the Satisfaction of all your People, how wide ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are diſperſed, I do in this publick Aſſembly, in the Name of the Government, and People of this Province, aſſure you, that Captain <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> acted by my Authority; and in Confirmation of what I have ſaid, and that what he delivered, was by Authority from me, I give you this Belt.</p>

                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being now convinced out of my Mouth, of the Sincerity of my Profeſſions made to you by Captain <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and of the Diſpoſitions of the People of this Province, to renew the antient Friendſhip that ſubſiſted between <hi>William Penn</hi> and the <hi>Indians.</hi> I deſire you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this to the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Diahogo,</hi> and to the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and to all the <hi>Indians</hi> far and near, as my Words, ſpoken to them in the Name, and on the Behalf of the Government of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania.</hi> I invite them all to this Council-Fire; the greater the Number that ſhall come, the more acceptable it will be to me. I invite, and deſire you will bring with you, your whole People; but then you muſt bring here with you alſo all the Priſoners you have taken during theſe Diſturbances; I muſt inſiſt on this, as an Evidence of your Sincerity to make a laſting Peace, for, without it, though Peace may be made from the Teeth outwards, yet while you retain our Fleſh and Blood in Slavery, it cannot be expected we can be Friends with you, or that a Peace can come from our Hearts. I repeat this Article of the Priſoners as a neceſſary Condition of Peace, and deſire you will conſider it as ſuch: If in this you deal with us ſincerely, we ſhall eſteem you ſincere in every Thing elſe, and proceed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our former Leagues and Covenants, and become again one Fleſh as before. And I muſt remind you (as we are acting in Conſort with the <hi>Six Nations</hi>) to bring ſome of your Uncles along with you, that they may ſee all that paſſes, and be Witneſſes of the good Effects of their and our Meſſages to you.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In Teſtimony of the Satisfaction you have given all our People by your coming to this Council-Fire, they have put into my Hands a ſmall Preſent for you and your young Men, which will be given you at any Time you ſhall think proper. I have likewiſe given Orders to the Captains of the Forts, on the Frontiers, to furniſh you with as much Proviſions as you can carry, for the Uſe of the People you have left behind you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Only a few of you are now come down; this Preſent of Goods therefore is but ſmall; when the Body of your Nation comes here, which I expect they will, and the Priſoners are delivered up, and a firm Peace made, larger Preſents will be given, and your Diſtreſſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in a more ample Manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great Works require ſtrong Hands and many; this is a good and a great one, the Work of Peace; it requires ſtrong Heads, and found Hearts; we deſire many ſuch may be joined together: I therefore deſire your Aſſiſtance for <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> in this Matter; having great Influence with many who live far diſtant from us, you are eſteemed, and will be heard; we therefore chuſe you as Agent and Counſellor for this Province; engage in it heartily. You ought to do it; you owe it to the Country in which you was born; you owe it to your Brethren the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; you owe it to your Uncles the <hi>Six Nations</hi>; you owe it to your own People over which you preſide: We deſire you will heartily undertake it, and uſe your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Endeavours to bring about this great and good Work we have now begun.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A large Belt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> anſwered, that he had received the Governor's Words kindly, and would, in a few Words, anſwer him. Then taking a large Belt in his Hand, he proceeded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the very Time <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> came with your laſt Meſſages, I was in Treaty with the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> and then received this Authority from them. [<hi>Liſting up the Belt.</hi>] This Belt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes, that the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> by their Chiefs, have lately renewed their Covenant Chain with us; formerly we were accounted Women, and employed only in Womens Buſineſs; but now they have made Men of us, and as ſuch we are now come to this Treaty. Having this Authority as a Man to make Peace, I have it in my Hand, but have not opened it; but will ſoon declare it to the other Nations. This Belt holds together ten Nations; we are in the Middle, between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi>; look at it. There are but two Chiefs of the ten Nations; they are now looking on, and their Attention is ſixed, to ſee who are diſpoſed <pb n="11" facs="unknown:007923_0010_102E02310F94DC70"/>really for Peace.—This Belt further denotes, that whoever will not comply with the Terms of Peace, the ten Nations will join againſt him and ſtrike him; ſee the dangerous Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances I am in; ſtrong Men on both Sides; Hatchets on both Sides; whoever does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to Peace, him will I join.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a good Day; whoever will make Peace, let him lay hold of this Belt, and the Nations around ſhall ſee and know it. I deſire to conduct myſelf according to your Words, which I will perform to the utmoſt of my Power. I wiſh the ſame good Spirit that poſſeſſed the good old Man <hi>William Penn,</hi> who was a Friend to the <hi>Indians,</hi> may inſpire the People of this Province at this Time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then delivered the Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Governor received it, and ſaid, I take hold of the Belt, and am pleaſed with what has been ſaid; it is all very good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> then explained the Belt, ſaying, it was ſent him by the <hi>Six Nation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> let us join together to deſend our Lands againſt both, you ſhall be Partakers with us of our Lands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> and his Son came and dined with the Governor; and after Dinner, ſome more of the <hi>Indians</hi> coming in, the Governor acquainted <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> that he had ſomething of Importance to communicate to him. The Governor then informed him, That as he was going to Council this Morning, he received a Letter from the Northern Frontiers, with very bad News, that gave him a great deal of Concern: By this Letter he received Advice, that ſome <hi>Indians</hi> had killed four of our White People at the <hi>Miniſinks</hi>; this occaſioned our Forces to be upon their Guard, and a Party of them fell in with three <hi>Indians,</hi> and judging them to be Enemy <hi>Indiens,</hi> one of them was killed in endeavouring to make his Eſcape; and then the Governor entered into the Particulars related in <hi>Van Etten</hi>'s Letter. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor ſaid, he did not know what <hi>Indians</hi> had done this Miſchief. If the <hi>Indian</hi> who was killed was our Friend, he was ſorry for it; but if our Enemy, he was glad of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> ſaid, that when he came here to Council, all the <hi>Indians</hi> there abouts knew of it; and therefore he believed it muſt be the <hi>French Indians</hi> that killed our People; but that if his People were ſo fooliſh as to come on our Borders at this Time, and were killed any how, they muſt take the Reward of their Folly. None of theſe private Deaths ought to affect a publick Meaſure; nor would this make any Alterations in his Councils.</p>

               <p>I ACQUAINTED you Yeſterday, that the People of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> had put into my Hands a ſmall Preſent to relieve you, and your Wives and Children, from their preſent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes. I think it further neceſſary to inform you, That a Part of this Preſent was given by the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> (who are the Deſcendants of thoſe who firſt came over to this Country with your old Friend <hi>William Penn</hi>) as a particular Teſtimony of their Regard and Affection for the <hi>Indians,</hi> and their earneſt Deſire to promote the good Work of Peace in which we are now engaged.</p>

               <p>This is not only their Sentiments but my own, and thoſe of the People of this Province; who will all rejoice to ſee this good Work of Peace perfected; and therefore, as you have now received from us this ſubſtantial Proof of our Diſpoſition to relieve your Diſtreſſes, you will be the better enabled to encourage others to return to their former Friendſhip with us. I ſay, Brother, by this we give you a clear Teſtimony of our Readineſs and good Diſpoſitions for Peace. Shew you the ſame Readineſs, and comply with the Terms I have propoſed to you.</p>

                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> returned Thanks; and repeated his Aſſurances of doing all in his Power to perfect a general Peace with the <hi>Indians.</hi>—From the Council, the Governor proceeded to an Entertainment that was provided for the <hi>Indians,</hi> the Officers, and all the Company then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> whilſt at Dinner, was ſo well pleaſed with his kind Reception and generous Entertainment, that he declared, in the warmeſt Manner, no Endeavours of his ſhould be wanting to bring over to the Peace, all the <hi>Indians</hi> far and near, that he could ſpeak or ſend to; and repeatedly deſired the Governor would publiſh what was done, through his and the neighbouring Provinces, and he would do the ſame at Home.—The <hi>Philadelphia Quakers</hi> going after Dinner to take their Leave of him, he parted with them in a very affectionate Manner; but the other Part of the Company ſtaying, he entered into a free Converſation with the Governor; wherein he related many entertaining Particulars reſpecting his Journey to <hi>Niagara,</hi> and afterwards made a Council Speech with a String of Wampum, ſaying:</p>
               <p>Brother,</p>
               <p>You are ſo good, and received us ſo kindly, I will alſo give you ſome of that good To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco that the <hi>Six Nations</hi> have put into my Pipe; you ſhall ſmoak of it yourſelves; you will find it is good, and I will give of the ſame Tobacco wherever I go (meaning the Meſſage from the <hi>Six Nations</hi> to them, to be at Peace with the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) The ſame Thing that I have offered to you I will offer to all the <hi>Indians,</hi> and at the ſame time tell them, that you have ſmoaked of this Tobacco; but to do this requires me to be rich, and yet I am poor.— It will take up a long Time, as there are many Nations to ſend the Pipe to; but in two Months I hope to go my Rounds, and be here again with a large Number, of different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; I ſay it may be in two Months, but it may be longer, as the People live at a great Diſtance from one another. I aſſure you I will execute every Thing you have deſired of me, and let the <hi>Six Nations</hi> know all that has paſſed between us; and that I am your Agent and Counſellor in the <hi>Delaware</hi> Nation.</p>

               <p>I would not have you miſtake me, as if I meant that I could prevail on the <hi>Ohio Indians</hi>: I cannot tell that they will leave off doing Miſchief.—I hope you will ſtrengthen yourſelves againſt them; pray make yourſelves as ſtrong as poſſible on that Side. I muſt warn you likewiſe of another Thing; perhaps on the Eaſt Side of <hi>Saſquehannah</hi> there may be Miſchief done by <hi>Indians</hi> in my Abſence; but be aſſured it will not be by any of my People; it will be by the <hi>French Indians</hi> from <hi>Ohio,</hi> who can eaſily paſs over <hi>Saſquehannah,</hi> and do what Miſchief they pleaſe: Againſt theſe, you muſt be ſure to arm yourſelves in the beſt Manner you can; remember I give you this Warning.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>WEISER</hi> was aſk'd, Whether it was intended the Governor ſhould keep the Belt <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> gave, or return it? Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> anſwered, That having ſome Doubts about it, he put the ſame Queſtion to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> who ſaid the Belt was ſent by the <hi>Six Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> 
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:007923_0012_102E023444631BA0"/>to the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and as it was given by them to the Governor, it ought to be preſerved among the Council Wampum, being a Belt of great Conſequence; and it would be well to return another of a Fathom long, and at the Delivery of it, which muſt be in Council To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, to make a proper Addreſs to <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> that he would be diligent, and carry it to all the Nations within his Influence. <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> ſaid further, That <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> would want Abundance of Wampum, and if he had it not, the Cauſe would ſuffer exceedingly. He hoped the Council Bag was full, and deſired it might be emptied into the Lap of <hi>Teedyuſcung.</hi> Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> concurring in Opinion, and ſaying, that the <hi>French</hi> gave great Quantities of Wampum to their <hi>Indians,</hi> and on Matters of Conſequence their Belts were ſeveral Fathom long, and very wide, the Secretary was ordered to bring what Wampum he had into Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, <hi>viz.</hi> Fifteen Strings, and ſeven Belts, a Parcel of new black Wampum, amounting to ſeven Thouſand; and having no new white Wampum, nor any proper Belts to give in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi>'s Peace Belt, a Meſſenger was ſent to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and he returned with five Thouſand; upon which the <hi>Indian</hi> Women were employed to make a Belt of a Fathom long, and ſixteen Beads wide; in the Center of which was to be the Figure of a Man, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Governor of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and on each Side five other Figures, meaning the ten Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions mentioned by <hi>Teedyuſcung.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King, who was very irregular in his Viſits, as well as in his Diſcourſes, bolted all of a ſudden into the Room, and with a high Tone of Voice ſpoke as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brother,</p>
               <p>I deſire all that I have ſaid, and you have ſaid to one another, may be taken down aright; ſome ſpeak in the Dark; do not let us do ſo; let all be clear and known. What is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Governor holds Councils ſo cloſe in his Hands, and by Candle Light? The <hi>Five Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> uſed to make him ſit out of Doors like a Woman.—If the <hi>Five Nations</hi> ſtill make him a Woman, they muſt; but what is the Reaſon the Governor makes him a Woman, meaning, Why does he confer with <hi>Indians</hi> without ſending for him, to be preſent and hear what was ſaid?</p>
               <p>The Governor anſwered, That he holds Councils on a Hill; has no Secrets; never ſits in Swamps, but ſpeaks his Mind openly to the World; what happens here he has a Right to hear: The Women were ſent for to make a Belt, not to Council. The <hi>Six Nations</hi> may be wrong, they are not under his Direction; and therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> is not anſwerable for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, if they have not treated the <hi>Delawares</hi> as Men.</p>
               <p>The Chief thanked the Governor, ſeemed well pleaſed, and ſaid, To-morrow he would ſpeak more, and what he had to ſay was from the <hi>Six Nations:</hi>—He that won't make Peace muſt die.</p>
               <p>A String.</p>
               <p>It was agreed in the Morning the Governor ſhould deliver the new Belt, then in making, to <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> with a proper Speech; that by two Belts tied together, <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and <hi>Teedyuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cung</hi> ſhould be made joint Agents for this Government, and they be deſired to conſult to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to love one another, and to act for the beſt; that the new black Wampum, and all the Belts and Strings, ſhould be given to <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> and a private Preſent made to him and his Interpreter, <hi>Ben.</hi>

It is very agreeable to him and the People of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania.</hi> He will lay up the Belt in the Council-chamber as a Mark of his Friendſhip.

                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> anſwered, That he might meet with Difficulties in tranſacting the important Buſineſs committed to his Charge; but as he is now one of the Council of the Province of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> he aſſures his Brethren, that he will exert himſelf faithfully, and to the utmoſt of his Abilities, in the Service; and if he meets with crooked Paths, he will endeavour to make them ſtraight.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> ſaid, That he was pleaſed with being joined with <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> in the publick Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that he hoped Matters would be brought to a happy Iſſue; that he wiſhed there might be a firm Friendſhip and laſting Union between the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> the other <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and the People of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and that they might be as one Man. He further ſaid, that he had a large Family, and having a great Way to go, he had no Means of carrying any more Proviſions than would ſerve him on the Road; he therefore deſired that he might be furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Horſe, that he might be enabled to carry Neceſſaries for his Family.—Whereupon the Governor promiſed to let him have a Horſe, and he promiſed to return him again the next Time he came down.</p>
               <p>The Governor then taking into his Hands all the Belts, Strings, and Bundles of new black Wampum, gave them to <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> and deſired he would uſe them to the beſt Advantage among the Nations he ſhould apply to.</p>
               <p>The private Preſents were then given, and the Governor and Council took their Leave, the Council returning to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and the Governor going to <hi>New-York,</hi> on an Expreſs received from General <hi>Shirley.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Conference at Eaſton.</note>ON <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning the Governor, whilſt at <hi>Samuel Dean</hi>'s, received Intelligence from Mr. <hi>Horsfield,</hi> that a Party of <hi>Indians,</hi> who came with <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> from <hi>Diahogo,</hi> ſtaid'd behind at a little Diſtance from Fort <hi>Allen,</hi> and had ſome bad Deſigns in doing ſo; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Moravian</hi> Brother who brought the Intelligence, was immediately diſpatched to <hi>Eaſton,</hi> and the next Morning the Governor received a Letter from Colonel <hi>Weiſer,</hi> inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that the Matter communicated to him by Mr. <hi>Horsfield,</hi> had been examined into along with <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> and was without Foundation; on which the Governor proceeded on his Journey, and came to Town in the Afternoon, and as ſoon as he alighted, the <hi>Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware</hi> King, and two of the <hi>Six Nation Indians,</hi> came to wait on him, by whom he was told, that Colonel <hi>Weiſer,</hi> and two other of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> were gone to meet him, but had taken a different Road.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Weiſer,</hi> and the two <hi>Indians</hi> came afterwards, and expreſſed their Concern at miſſing the Governor.</p>
               <p>This Morning the Governor ſent Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> with his Compliments to the <hi>Indian</hi> Chief, and deſired to know whether he intended to ſpeak firſt, and when; and the King ſaying it was his Duty to ſpeak firſt, withed it might be this Forenoon; on which the Governor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Eleven a Clock; at which Time the Governor marched from his Lodging to the Place of Conference, guarded by a Party of the <hi>Royal Americans</hi> in the Front, and on the Flanks, and a Detachment of Colonel <hi>Weiſer</hi>'s Provincials, in Sub-diviſions, in the Rear, with Colours flying, Drums beating, and Muſick playing; which Order was always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in going to the Place of Conference.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> opened the Conferences with the following Speech.</p>
               <p>Brother the Governor,</p>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Excellency to hear a few Words; I will put the Governor and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in mind, that Conferences were held here in the Summer, and what paſſed there is well known.</p>
               <p>I have taken all the Pains poſſible to execute what I then undertook, and have brought with me ſeveral of different Tribes, as well <hi>Delawares</hi> as <hi>Six Nation Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:007923_0016_102E023D5B434750"/>I held up the Encouragements I received from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſpread them far and near to all the Tribes I promiſed to go to, as well among the <hi>Delawares</hi> as <hi>Six Nations</hi>; and I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, I have been true and faithful to my Promiſes, and uſed all the Diligence in my Power; in Teſtimony whereof I give theſe</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Four Strings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Confirmation that I have faithfully publiſhed what was committed to my Care, ſeveral <hi>Indians</hi> of different Places, as well <hi>Six Nation Indians</hi> as <hi>Delawares,</hi> are come along with me, and being now preſent, will put their Hands and Seals to the Truth of what I ſay; they have acted upon what I delivered in Behalf of this Government, and their Minds are intent on the good Work that is going on; ſome of them were here before.</p>
               <p>In Conformity to an antient and good Cuſtom eſtabliſhed among our Anceſtors, I now proceed to open your Eyes and Ears, and remove all Obſtructions out of your Throats, that nothing may impede the Attention neceſſary to be uſed in a Matter of ſuch Importance as is now going on.</p>
               <p>Some bad Reports have lately been ſpread, which deſerve to be no more minded than the Whiſtling of Birds; theſe I would remove by this Belt, and take away all bad Impreſſions that may have been made by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt of eight Rows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have done for the preſent, and another Time, if God ſpares Life, I will begin the main Matter I came to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Governor replied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I return you Thanks for your kind Speech, and likewiſe for the Regard you ſhewed me in ſending two of the <hi>Six Nation Indians</hi> along with Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> to meet me. I unfortunately took a different Road, and ſo we miſſed of one another; but it gave me great Satisfaction to hear by Mr. <hi>Weiſer,</hi> that he and thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> were deſirous to meet me, and conduct me to Town.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many idle Reports are ſpread by fooliſh and buſy People; I agree with you, that on both Sides they ought to be no more regarded than the Chirping of Birds in the Woods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A String.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Belt I open your Eyes and Ears, and particularly the Paſſage from your Heart to your Mouth, that in what you have to ſay to this Government they may both concur, nor the Mouth utter any Thing but what is firſt conceived in the Heart: And I promiſe you Openneſs and Sincerity in every Thing I ſhall ſpeak.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Belt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Governor ſaid, he would be ready to hear what <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> had further to ſay at Eleven o'Clock To-morrow Morning.</p>

                  </gap> Council-Fire was appointed to be kindled: When I came here, I found every Thing ſaid by your Meſſengers true; which, on my Return, I made known, as well as every Thing elſe that was then delivered to me, to ten different Nations, <hi>Delawares</hi> and <hi>Six Nations</hi>; and as many of them as I have prevailed upon to come with me, can evidence the Truth of this.</p>
               <p>We are all put in mind of the ancient Leagues and Covenants made by our Fore-Fathers, and of the former Union and mutual kind Actions of our and their Anceſtors; what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed here renewed the Remembrance of theſe former happy Times.</p>
               <p>Though we are but Children in Compariſon of them, and of little Ability, as you well know, yet we have picked up a few Chips, and will add them to the Fire, and hope it will grow a great Fire, and blaze high, and be ſeen by all the different <hi>Indian Nations,</hi> Spectators of what we are now doing.</p>

               <p>I am now before you juſt what you ſee me; I repreſent myſelf only to be a Boy; I am really no more. Now as Misfortunes have happened by the bad Spirit, by our Enemy, and by ſome of our fooliſh young People, I declare unto you the Truth, that I have ever been ſorry to ſee it thus, and, as far as I know myſelf, if it coſts me my Life, I would make it otherwiſe.—As I have already proceeded a great Way, and prevailed on thoſe who have ſtept out of the Way, and on many of whom I had little or no Expectation, to enter into peaceable Meaſures, I now call upon you to uſe your Ability, which is much greater than ours, to aſſiſt this good Work, to encourage it, and to confirm it to good Advantage.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt of nine Rows.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I have done wiping your Eyes and Bodies, and cleaning the Ground where you fit; I will alſo heal your Wounds, not only at the Top, but at the Bottom; I will apply to them the good Plaiſter which the Great Creator has made for theſe Purpoſes. I ſay I will heal the Wound, ſo as it may never break out more, but be compleatly cured; in this the <hi>Six Nations</hi> alſo join with me.</p>

                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as I have healed the Wound, our Caſe is like that of two Brothers; when one has been ſick, and has recovered his Health, it is uſual for the other to be glad; juſt ſo it is with me now: Your Wound is cured;—I am glad to ſee you Face to Face, as it has pleaſed the good Spirit to bring us together. I alſo remember every thing you have ſaid; and as to what I have ſaid, or ſtill have to ſay, the other Nations will confirm.</p>

               <p>I am now going to tell you ſomething in a few Words, in Anſwer to your Requeſt laſt Night, that I ſhould give you a true Account how I came to ſtrike you.</p>
               <p>In the Beginning of the Confuſion and War that happened the Fall before this, I lived in the Middle of the Road leading from the <hi>Six Nations</hi> to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> where I was ordered, by my Uncles to ſit down; and there I ſat in profound Peace, under no Apprehenſion of Danger; and when I looked towards <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> I ſaw my Brother the Governor, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Peace and Friendſhip; and when I looked the other Way towards my Uncles the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> every thing was alſo Peace there; ſo it was with me until all at once a Man, whoſe Name is called <hi>Charles Broadhead,</hi> an Inhabitant of this Province, came to me at <hi>Wioming,</hi> and told me, as if he had ſuch a Meſſage from the Governor, that I had ſtruck my Brethren the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which I denied over and over; and when I could not prevail with <pb n="22"
                      facs="unknown:007923_0021_102E0249153179E0"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>him to believe me, I took two Handfuls of Wampum, and deſired him to go down with them to the Governor, and aſſure him that it was not I who ſtruck the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> I alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Governor to let me know what further Meaſures I ſhould take, to ſatisfy him and my Brethren the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of the Truth of this.—I alſo deſired, by the ſame Meſſenger, that the Governor would take all the prudent Methods he could to relate this to Colonel <hi>Johnſon</hi> and to my Uncles the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> as I was under a good deal of Concern that this Charge was laid againſt me.—There were two Kings preſent beſides me, who joined with me in the Meſſage; and I likewiſe deſired the Governor to ſend me Word what to do, for which I waited till I was out of Patience, and obliged to flee, and leave my Inheritance on that Account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a String.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to your other Queſtion or Requeſt laſt Night, to know of me why I ſtruck you without firſt giving you a Reaſon for it; I will tell you the Truth why I have unfortunately ſtruck you. I ſay, Brother, I will tell you the very Truth, in Anſwer to your Queſtion. I never knew any of our ancient Kings ever to have this in their Minds, I now tell you that it came from a great King, at leaſt I think ſo: The King of <hi>England,</hi> and of <hi>France,</hi> have ſettled or wrought this Land, ſo as to coop us up as if in a Pen. Our fooliſh and ignorant young Men, when they ſaw the Proceeding of this Enemy, and the Things that were told them, believed them, and were perſwaded by this falſe-hearted King to ſtrike our Brethren the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>—According to your Deſire I will now tell you the Truth with an honeſt Heart, as far as is in my Power: After this unfortunate Management once prevailed, it is eaſy for all you <hi>Engliſh,</hi> if you look into your Hearts, to find the Cauſe why this Blow came harden upon you than it would have otherwiſe done—but this is not the principal Cauſe; ſome Things, that have paſſed in former Times, both in this and other Governments were not well pleaſing to the <hi>Indians</hi>; indeed they thought them wrong; but as I ſaid before, they were not the principal Cauſe. Being aſked in what other Governments, he anſwered, in the Province of <hi>New-Jerſey.</hi> Now, Brother, I have told you the Truth, as you deſired me, and alſo the Uneaſineſs of my Mind, becauſe I verily believe it was our Duty to go to the very Bottom, be it as bad as it will, and that it is neceſſary we ſhould both open our whole Minds to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we may agree to heal the Wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gave a Belt of twelve Rows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I was here at the laſt Treaty, I did according to what I promiſed. I took the Belt I received from this Government, and held it up to all the Nations I undertook to go to, and I took them all by the Hand (meaning, I invited them all to come to the Council-Fire.) One of the <hi>Delaware</hi> Nations, meaning the <hi>Miniſink Indians,</hi> now about <hi>Fort Ailon,</hi> gave me this Belt, ſaying, he was glad to hear what I ſaid, and laid hold of the ſame Hand, meaning he accepted the Invitation; but ſaid he would only go Part of the Way, no further than to a certain Place, and there he would ſtay, but that I might proceed, for he would agree to whatever I did, being led by the ſame Hand, and giving me Authority to act for him, at this Council.</p>
               <p>Then delivered the Belt, of ten Rows, given him by thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> who be ſaid were <hi>Miniſinks</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this String I alſo let you know, that I would not have you think I have finiſhed every Thing at this Meeting, though what I have now done is of great Moment; if we are ſpared till another Day, that is, until next Spring, I will let you know ſomething further in anoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>Then, pauſing a while, he ſaid he had forgot ſomething, and taking up the String again, he proceeded.</p>
               <p>I will let you know fully and freely my Mind, and what is my Determination to do.— When I return into my Country, I will look about me, I will ſee and hear for you.—If I hear of any Enemy, going towards you, I will ſend a ſuitable Meſſenger to give you Notice though it thould be at Midnight. I will alſo take every prudent Meaſure to prevent any Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that may befal you; perhaps, if the Enemy be but few, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>Then the Governor deſired of <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> as he had mentioned Grievances received by the <hi>Indians</hi> from this and other Governments, to let him know what they were, and to ſpeak his Mind freely and fully without any reſerve; upon which <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> ſpoke as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have not ſo much Knowledge of Things done in this Country as others who have lived longer in it, being but lately come among us.—I have not far to go for an Inſtance: This very Ground that is under me (ſtriking it with his Foot) was my Land and Inheritance, and is taken from me by Fraud; when I ſay this Ground, I mean all the Land lying between <hi>Tohiccon Creek</hi> and <hi>Wioming,</hi> on the River <hi>Saſquehannah.</hi> I have not only been ſerved ſo in this Government, but the ſame Thing has been done to me as to ſeveral Tracts in <hi>New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> over the River. When I have ſold Lands fairly, I look upon them to be really ſold.— A Bargain is a Bargain.—Though I have ſometimes had nothing for the Lands I have ſold but broken Pipes, or ſuch Trifles, yet when I have ſold them, though for ſuch Trifles, I look upon the Bargain to be good: Yet I think I ſhould not be ill uſed on this Account by thoſe very People who have had ſuch an Advantage in their Purchaſes, nor be called a Fool for it. <hi>Indians</hi> are not ſuch Fools as to bear this in their Minds.—The Proprietaries, who have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed their Lands from us cheap, have ſold them too dear to poor People, and the <hi>Indians</hi> have ſuffered for it. It would have been more prudent in the Proprietaries, to have ſold the Lands cheaper, and have given it in Charge to thoſe who bought from them, to uſe the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> with Kindneſs on that Account.</p>
               <p>Now, Brother, hear me; ſuppoſing you had a Pipe in your Mouth, ſmoaking, of little Value; I come and take it from you; by and by, when you ſee me again, you remember it, and take a Revenge: I had forgot, and wonder at the Cauſe, and aſk you, Brother, Why you have done ſo? This makes me remember the Injury I did you, and more careful for the future. Now, although you have purchaſed our Lands from our Fore-fathers on ſo reaſonable Terms, yet now at length you will not allow us to cut a little Wood to make a Fire; nay, hinder us from Hunting, the only Means left us of getting our Livelihood.</p>
               <p>Now, Brother, I am pleaſed you aſked me this Queſtion, having thereby given me an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſpeaking my Mind freely as to any Uneaſineſs I was under.—You are wiſe enough to ſee theſe Things, and to provide a Remedy for them.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> produced a Receipt, from <hi>William Parſons,</hi> for a Bundle of Deer-ſkins he had ſent from <hi>Fort Allen</hi> as a Preſent to Governor <hi>Morris,</hi> and deſired Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> to let him know if he had received them for the Governor; which he ſaid he had.</p>
               <p>He then aſked Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> what was done with the Memorandum he gave to Governor <hi>Morris</hi> when he was in <hi>Philadelphia</hi> in <hi>April,</hi> 1755, containing a Claim to a ſmall Pine Tract in <hi>New-Jerſey</hi>; to which Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> ſaid, that Governor <hi>Morris</hi> had promiſed to enquire into the Matter, and the Memorandum would be returned to him at any Time, with Governor <hi>Morris</hi>'s Report on it.</p>
               <p>The Governor then aſked him, what he meant by Fraud; having ſaid his Lands were taken from him by Fraud, what it meant?</p>
               <p>To which <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> replied.—When one Man had formerly Liberty to purchaſe Lands, and he took the Deed from the <hi>Indians</hi> for it, and then dies; after his Death the Children forge a Deed like the true One, with the ſame <hi>Indian</hi> Names to it, and thereby take Lands from the <hi>Indians</hi> which they never ſold—this is Fraud. Alſo, when one King has Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the River, and another King has Land on this Side, both bounded by Rivers, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Springs, which cannot be moved, and the Proprietaries, greedy to purchaſe Lands, buy of one King what belongs to the other—this likewiſe is Fraud.</p>
               <p>The Governor then aſked <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> Whether he had ever been uſed in that Manner?</p>
               <p>He anſwered, Yes;—I have been ſerved ſo in this Province: All the Land extending from <hi>Tohiccon,</hi> over the <hi>Great-Mountain,</hi> to <hi>Wioming,</hi> has been taken from me by Fraud; for when I had agreed to ſell the Land to the old Proprietary, by the Courſe of the River, the young Proprietaries came and got it run by a ſtraight Courſe by the Compaſs, and by that Means took in double the Quantity intended to be ſold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As you have deſired me to be very particular, I have told you the Truth, and have opened my Mind fully. I did not intend to ſpeak thus, but I have done it at this Time, at your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; <pb n="24"

               <p>YOU expreſſed your Concern for what had happened, wiped the Tears from our Eyes, and the Blood from our Bodies, and having made clean the Council Seat, I heartily thank you for it. I do likewiſe wipe the Tears from your Eyes; I waſh away the Blood from your Bodies, and from the Council Seat, that there may not remain the leſt Defilement,</p>

               </p>
               <p>I make you my Acknowledgments for your having ſearched our Wounds to the Bottom, and the good Remedies you have applied for their Cure, and I pray the Great Creator may bleſs our mutual Endeavours, that they may be ſo effectually healed as not to leave behind them the leaſt Scar, or ever break out again, whilſt the Rivers run, or the Sun and Moon give Light to the Earth.</p>

               <p>As to what you ſay of the Meſſage delivered to you at <hi>Wioming,</hi> by <hi>Charles Broadhead,</hi> the Governor did ſend him, and I could have wiſhed you had ſent ſome of your own People to me on ſo weighty an Occaſion; and for the future, I muſt caution you not to hearken to any Meſſages as from this Government, unleſs the Perſons charged with them are known to be publick Officers, uſually employed for ſuch Purpoſes, and the Papers they produce are ſealed with the Seal of the Government.</p>

The <hi>French</hi> practiſe every Artifice they are Maſters of to deceive the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and I am ſorry your young Men ſhould have been ſo fooliſh as to have hearkened to them.

               <p>As I conceive this Belt to be your Authority for acting at this Council-Fire, in Behalf of the <hi>Miniſink Indians,</hi> who only came Part of the Way, I will keep it, and put it into the Council Bag, being glad to hear they have put their Hand to the Belt I ſent, though I ſhould have been better pleaſed to have ſeen them here.</p>

               <p>You give me Hopes of another Viſit. Aſſure yourſelf it will always give me Pleaſure to receive you, and any other of our <hi>Indian</hi> Friends with you. Your kind Offer of giving me timely Notice of the Approach of an Enemy, is an inconteſtable Proof of the Warmth of your Heart for me; and as you have ſo freely offered it, I ſhall ever have an entire Depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon you; and whatever Perſons are ſent with Intelligence of this Sort, ſhall be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely rewarded.

               <p>I am very glad you have been as good as your Word in coming down to the Council-Fire which was kindled on this particular Occaſion. I believe you have uſed your beſt Endeavours, with great faithfulneſs, to effect every Thing you undertook. I heartily agree to the Peace as you have propoſed it, provided all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies be included in it. But we cannot agree to make Peace for this Government alone, and leave you at Liberty to continue the War with our Brethren of the neighbouring Colonies; for we, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> are all Subjects of one great King, and muſt, for the future, be all at Peace, or all at War, with other Nations at the ſame Time.</p>

               <p>You may remember it was ſtipulated, in the Conferences held laſt Summer, that all the Priſoners you had taken ſhould be brought to this Council-Fire, and there delivered up; and as you have only delivered up five Priſoners, and I am ſure many more have been taken, I deſire to know why they have not been brought; they are our own Fleſh and Blood, and we cannot be eaſy whilſt they are kept in Captivity.</p>

This may be done at a Council-Fire, to be rekindled at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> for you and us, or here, as you ſhall chuſe, when we expect, and inſiſt, that you bring down all the Captives that ſtill remain in your Country.</p>

                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will now in a few Words, according to my Abilities, give you an Anſwer. You deſired me to acquaint you what the Grounds of my Uneaſineſs were, and I complied, tho' it was not the main Thing which I came about. But when you put me in mind, I was pleaſed, for before I thought it not proper to mention it in theſe difficult Times; it was not the Cauſe of the Stroke, tho' it was the Foundation of our Uneaſineſs. Now, Brother, in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to your Queſtion, What will ſatisfy us? It is not uſual, nor reaſonable, nor can I tell you what the Damage is, and adjuſt, as in a Ballance, the true Value at that Time and theſe Times; formerly it might be lighter, but being delayed, it is now the heavier; the Intereſt is to be added. Beſides, there are many more concerned in this Matter, not now preſent; and tho' many who have ſuffered are now in the Grave, yet their Deſcendants feel the Weight, and the more now for the Time they have waited.</p>
               <p>Alſo, Brother, I require you would throw down the Fence that confines ſome of my Brethren and Relations in the <hi>Jerſeys,</hi> that they may, if they ſee Cauſe, come and ſee their Relations. I do not want to compel any of them to come, or to ſtay againſt their Will. If they are inclined to ſtay and live among the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I am quite willing they ſhould come back again; but I want they ſhould come and ſee me, that thereby I may convince their Relations, and the other Nations afar off, that I am now treating with, that they are not Servants, but a free People.</p>
               <p>I do not requeſt that all Men, Women and Children ſhould come; but ſome, or as many as may be ſufficient to convince other Nations that they are not confined, but have Liberty as well as we: In particular, one called <hi>Philip,</hi> he has a Wife, and Relations among us; to my Grief I heard he was carried to Goal, and there confined with ſome others, and put to Death; but I underſtand the Account of his Death was falſe. I deſire he may have Liberty to come and ſee his Relations. I alſo requeſt that you would apply to the Governor on the other Side the River (<hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Jerſeys</hi>) and to uſe your utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours with him, that he would give them Leave to come, and that they may come under your Protection, be they more or leſs, in the great Road to us opened by this Province.</p>
               <p>But though you ſhould not do this, yet I will uſe my utmoſt Endeavours to bring you down your Priſoners, there are only two in my Power. You may hear otherwiſe, but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare I have no more than two in my Power: There are more in the Poſſeſſion of others, and theſe, with your Aſſiſtance, I may be able to bring down; and I will endeavour to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſcoop in as many as I can, but I ſhall want your Help to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have to requeſt you, that you would give Liberty to all Perſons and Friends to ſearch into theſe Matters; as we are all Children of the Moſt High, we ſhould endeavour to aſſiſt and make uſe of one another, and not only ſo, but from what I have heard, I believe there is a future State beſides this Fleſh; now I endeavour to act on both theſe Principles, and will, according to what I have promiſed, if the Great Spirit ſpare my Life, come next Spring, with as great a Force of <hi>Indians</hi> as I can get, to your Satisfaction.</p>

                  <hi>A String.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this String now delivered, and lying before you, I aſſure you I have ſpoken on all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the beſt I could, according to my mean Capacity and Abilities. I ſhall depend on my Interpreter, who I believe is an honeſt Man, but I think it prudent, in order to prevent Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtandings, that I ſhould be furniſhed with a Copy of what is done, as well in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences held here laſt Summer as at this Time; for though I am not able to read, yet others may; it will be a great Satisfaction to have it in my Power to ſhew to others what has paſſed between this Government and me: What is committed to Writing will not eaſily be loſt, and will be of great Uſe to all, and better regarded; and I would have the Names and Seals of all that have been concerned in tranſacting this Buſineſs put to it: I do not deſire a Copy now, but that it may be ready for me when I come again.—The Interpreter, <hi>Pumpſhire,</hi> informed the Governor, that what <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> was going to ſay was not material, or of much Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as it related to himſelf; adding, though he might be conſidered as a ſimple Man, yet throughout all this Affair he had acted uprightly and honeſtly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will ſpeak in Favour of the Interpreter; he acted as ſuch in Governor <hi>Morris</hi>'s Time as well as yours; and I am pleaſed with his Conduct on both Occaſions.—If we ſhould have any further Buſineſs to tranſact, I deſire he may be employed.—You know he lives in another Province, and is on that Account at ſome Expence; reward him well for his Services; and do it well for my Sake; but I ſhall leave it to you.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I have ſomething, though of no great Conſequence, yet to mention. I am in low Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and have not Things ſuitable; I wiſh I had—however, I have fifteen Deer Skins, which, as I ſee you love to have your Hands covered, I preſent you, to make Gloves of, or for any other Uſe you ſhall think proper. Eighty fine large Ones were brought at firſt, but on our Journey from <hi>Diabogo</hi> to <hi>Wioming,</hi> ſome of the <hi>Indians</hi> with me were ſo diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by Alarms, that they returned home, and took with them all but the Fifteen, which, I deſire your Acceptance of.</p>
               <p>The Governor returned him Thanks, and told him, he accepted of them as a Mark of his Affection, without regard to the Value of the Skins.—He then reminded <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> that it was intended the Goods ſhould have been delivered Yeſterday, but as it grew late, and the Room in which they ſat at Dinner was ſo ſmall, it was agreed they ſhould be brought here, and delivered, which was done, the Liſts read, and the <hi>Indians</hi> left to divide the Goods.</p>

               <p>THE Commiſſioners adviſing the Governor to fix at this Meeting the Sum to be given in full Satisfaction of all Injuries done to the <hi>Indians,</hi> and to offer it to them now, Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> was ſent to conſult with <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> if this would be agreeable; and Mr. <hi>Wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi> having done ſo, reported, That the King declared againſt it, ſaying, he had no Power to take any Sum, tho' the Governor ſhould offer him never ſo much, the People to whom the Land belonged being abſent; but he would endeavour to bring as many of them down as he could find to the next Meeting, when it might be further conſidered.</p>
               <p>Several Matters remaining to be mentioned to the <hi>Indians,</hi> the Governor ſent for <hi>Teedyuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cung,</hi> the four <hi>Six Nation Indians,</hi> the two <hi>Shawaneſe,</hi> and one or two <hi>Delawares,</hi> and in the Preſence of the Commiſſioners, and ſome other Gentlemen, he ſpoke as follows.</p>

               <p>By this String, you deſired me to make Application to the Governor of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> that the Fence might be broke down which confined the <hi>Indians,</hi> and that they, or ſome of them, might have Liberty to go into the <hi>Indian</hi> Country, and correſpond with their Relations and Friends as formerly, and particularly to obtain this Liberty for one <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Province of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> you know, is a different Government from this; I will uſe my beſt Endeavours with the Governor to grant your Requeſt, but I apprehend I ſhall meet with this Difficulty, that as you have ſome of their People Priſoners with you, before they grant your Requeſt, they will expect theſe ſhall be returned, which I think would be adviſeable for you to do; particularly you have with you a Boy, whoſe Name is <hi>Hunt,</hi> taken near <hi>Paulin</hi>'s Kiln, in that Province, whoſe Mother is now here, and requeſts he may be ſent down among the firſt.</p>

               <p>Peace is now ſettled between us by the Aſſiſtance of the Moſt High; but the <hi>Indians</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt ſtill commit Murders on our Frontiers, and our Soldiers are in Purſuit of them.

               <p>He then ſpoke in a warm and pathetick Manner in Favour of the Peace now ſettled, and implored the Aſſiſtance of the Moſt High to bring it to Perfection.</p>
               <p>The Governor underſtanding that ſeveral of the <hi>Indians</hi> inclined to ſtay, deſired <hi>Teedyuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cung</hi> to give him the Names of ſuch as would live with their Brethren the <hi>Engliſh.—Teedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſcung,</hi> miſtaking the Governor, as if he had ſaid, they muſt ſtay, anſwered, ſmiling, he did not underſtand any <hi>Indians</hi> were to be forced to ſtay, but left to their Liberty.

            <p>The Offer of the Commiſſioners to furniſh the Means of making the <hi>Indians</hi> immediate Satisfaction, not being fully related, we think it neceſſary to add, That the Reaſons we gave the Governor for that Offer, were, 1. The Abſence and great Diſtance of the Proprietaries, who being the ſole Purchaſers of Land from the <hi>Indians,</hi> in this Province, ought, if the <hi>Indians</hi> were injured in ſuch Purchaſes, alone to make the Satisfaction; but their Agents here had not the neceſſary Powers. 2. For that Promiſes [ſuch being propoſed] of enquiring into <hi>Indian</hi> Complaints, and doing them Right hereafter, had been ſo often made in other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
