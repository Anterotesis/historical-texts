            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE ARIANS and SOCINIANS MONITOR.</head>
            <p>INURED to ſelf-deceptions from my youth up, I laughed at the fantaſtical whims of enthuſiaſtic whigs, the dreams of Anabaptiſts, and cunning inventions of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Prieſts; or cranumian phantaſms of weak and unſtable men; for by ſuch names I was pleaſed to call the glorious doctrines of the everlaſting goſpel. The doctrine of the trinity in unity I contemned, purely becauſe I could not fully comprehend it.</p>
            <p>Reaſon, ſaith I, is the touchſtone of every truth; the even balance in which revelation muſt be weighed. The oracle of GOD muſt be huſhed in ſilence, till reaſon, adorable reaſon is free to ſpeak her mind: Even then it is at the peril of revelation to utter, one word that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of our Godlike reaſon. Every thing that is divinely myſterious I am wont to treat with deriſion and contempt. Myſteries in religion! ſaith I, mere nonſenſe! There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing myſterious in it, nothing myſterious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be believed. Reaſon alone, that noble
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013390_0003_0F9094810E99F9E0"/>principle, muſt give the ſanction to every truth divine. If illuſtrious reaſon will not condeſcend to ſign a certificate for truth, let her wander as a vagabond upon the face of the earth; no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable chriſtian, ſure will venture to receive her.</p>
            <p>Let fanatics and enthuſiaſts receive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on what they call holy myſteries, for my own part I am determined that my reaſon ſhall act ſupreme with me, both in matters of faith and practice.</p>
            <p>Thus elevated with a high opinion of my rational faculties, and pregnated with the ſtrongeſt reſolutions never to admit of any other rule but the dictates of my own reaſon, one evening lately I walked abroad into the fields to meditate on the happy eſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as being capable of meriting, at the hands of the omnipotent, a right to every divine donation, every eternal bleſſing.</p>
            <p>The road which I took led me into a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant avenue, on the one hand decorated with an uniform row of well grown oaks, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſpreading arms almoſt to the oppoſite ſide of the verdant path, and claſped with the ſupple branches of yielding elms, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n an even row decorated the hedge on the left, a graſſy turf, barely ſheered by the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mble teeth of the bleating ſheep, ſpread the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or of the evenue ten yards in breadth; every ſully<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excrement was carefully ſwept up by the yielding broom of the induſtrious ſhepherd,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013390_0004_0F909484F48DF2F0"/>who watchfully followed the fleecy innocents.</p>
            <p>Thus alone, ſecluded from the noiſe of mankind I began to improve what I beheld in this pleaſant but loneſome avenue.</p>
            <p>How beautifully, thought I, do theſe ſtately oaks, with their ſtreight and ſolid, their ſmooth and maſſy trunks, extended arms, and cloathed branches, repreſent the man, the happy man, that is fixed in rational ideas and guided only by the dictates of his reaſon. See how the penetrating roots dig deep into the boſom, and with their forked talons claſp the entrails of their mother earth; the grizly ſtem ſmiles at the angry rage of ſtormy guſts which wreak their vengeance againſt it. It ſtands unmoved. It mocks the fury of the moſt violent ſtorm. Juſt ſo is the man who makes reaſon his only rule. Nothing moves him. He ſmiles at the guſts of enthuſiaſtic zeal. He laughs at the dreams of fanatics, and mocks at the myſteries of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin.</hi> His mind lays deep hold of directing reaſon, and he ſtands in his paradiſaical rectitude.</p>
            <p>Theſe dwarfiſh ſhrubs (continued I) are the lively types of pedantick bigots, who are blindly carried away with enthuſiaſtic fancies to believe in irrational myſteries, called by them the doctrines of grace, but which really are the ſubtil inventions of deſigning men; as the ſhrub is diminutive when compared with the ſtately oak, ſo are thoſe men when compared with theſe who are the happy diſciples of reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:013390_0005_0F909488066D2828"/>
As I thus continued pleaſing myſelf with this improvement of my evening ſolitude, and bleſſing GOD that I was not as other men, even as theſe fanatics and irrational chriſtians are, but believed and acted according to the dictates of my own reaſon, I came near to the end of the avenue, and the path be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came extremely dark and narrow. The op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite trees did ſo interweave their branches with each other, that no gleam of light could penetrate through the ſhade.</p>
            <p>It would now have appeared wiſdom to have turned my face towards home; but by ſome unſeen power I was ſeized with a perfect ſuſpenſion of thought, and heedleſly, walked forward, till at laſt I found I had got out of the avenue, and a duſky light appearing, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to me a variety of frightful objects. The place into which I was now got bore the grizly aſpect of a foreſt devoured by fire: No blooming flower nor verdant leaf was to be ſeen in all its vaſt extent. Only deſolation and deſtruction. All, all was devaſtation.</p>
            <p>I attended occaſionally to the fearful noiſe, that as I thought were, and afterwards proved to be, ſubterraneous. Sometimes I heard, like the noiſe of many waters, the tempeſtuous roaring of foaming billows, in fury daſhing themſelves againſt the ſcornful rocks. Anon, I heard the clinking of chains, the clangor of weapons, and the hideous yellings of perſons in exquiſite torments. Great was the ſurprize
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013390_0006_0F909489C70F4BF8"/>was now in; my hair ſtood erect, and the blood in my veins became cold as the northern ice, my fleſh ſhuddered on my bones, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual tremor invaded my once courageous heart, and gaſtly fear ſat trembling on my aſtoniſhed countenance. My nerves became lax, and in my apprehenſion, the joints of my limbs were unhinged, and dewy ſweat iſſued forth from every pore of my ſkin. I had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courage to ſtand the ſhock, nor ſtrength to fly from the awful appearances of immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger. I would gladly have found the avenue through which I entered this ſolitary waſte; but to no purpoſe did I look for it, now it was hid from my ſight.</p>
            <p>In vain I wiſhed that my rambling fancy had been better guarded, and not expoſed me to theſe nocturnal dangers. Long e'er now the radient ſun having quenched his fiery beams in the weſtern depths, and left the earth enveloped in darkneſs, which glooming ſat on every beclouded object. Nor did the Heavens above my head bear a more pleaſant aſpect; every luminous body having hid its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulgent face in the boſom of a ſable extended cloud. All theſe circumſtances concurring to diſplay the horrors of the place, made me conclude that I was certainly got into the gloomy regions of inexorable Pluto; but whether I was dead or alive I knew not. In the mean while I wiſhed, I earneſtly wiſhed myſelf at home, and reſolved that if
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013390_0007_0F90948D1EB5C548"/>ever I reached my peaceful habitation, I would henceforth correct my wandrings, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them by the judicious rules of ſafety.</p>
            <p>As I was turning over theſe reſolves, I heard a terrible ſubterraneous noiſe, infinitely mote horrible than that fabulouſly, aſcribed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Vulcan's ſmiths, in the convulſive bowels of the mounts Aetna and Veſuvius.—Anon, the earth opened her jaws cloſe by the place on which I trembling ſtood, and belched forth an hedious quantity of curling ſmoak and ſtricked fire intermingled with ſqualid ſpectres, the firey ſmoke lifted up its grizly ſummit, like the towering head of a cloud-piercing pyramid. When the ſpectres had reached the middle path of the aerial regions they ſunk downward, and plunged into the belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing throat that had juſt now diſgorged them. Still it continued with hideous roarings to vomit up brimſtone, ſmoke and coals of fire, mingled with the howling ghoſts of the accurſt to theſe abyſmal flames, Notwithſtanding this fearful phaenomena was enough to have ſpread diſtraction o'er all my reaſonable facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I found myſelf, to my own amazement, in the perfect uſe of my mind, frightened although I was.</p>
            <p>Moveleſs I ſtood on the dangerous brink of the iſſuing pit, nor had power to turn me to the right hand or left. One ſtep forward would have plunged me into theſe devouring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which proceeded from the unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013390_0008_0F90948D5AFA95F0"/>burnings beneath. Here I ſtood trembling with fear of the dire event. The eruption begining to abate; I heard, as I thought, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man voices more diſtinctly, all was howling and ſorrowful complaint. Dreadful was the yell that filled my ears. All which I looked on as the moſt perfect indications of inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible torments. Weepings and wailings which I heard, I concluded were the ſure diagnoſtics of conſummate pain.</p>
            <p>The eruption being now over, I thought I heard a voice which was familiar to me, and which expreſſed the moſt intolerable anguiſh. Being by this time ſomewhat inured to this prodigy, I at laſt ventured to look down to make what diſcoveries I could. O horrible! here was a diſcovery that quaſhed reaſon itſelf. Amazement chills my blood even now when I relate it.</p>
            <p>I looked down into this frightful cave: But what did I ſee? No gilded beauties, but the ſtupendous arches of dread perdition. O! ſhall the direful idea ever be eraſed from my mind? A rolling flood of flaming liquid did play in theſe ſable, theſe frightful vaults. Every revolving billows turned up to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory ſurface an innumerable company of floating ſpectres, and at the ſame time with its ſinking front immerged a number equal to that it turned up. Dreadful was the howl, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible were their direful yellings! I ſaw likewiſe ſtanding on this burning lake a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013390_0009_0F90948DE2EED348"/>company of ſqualid infernals, armed with flaming inſtruments of death, with which they exerciſed the moſt unaccountable cruelty on the unhappy worldings, who had involved themſelves into unſpeakable torment, inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable ruin.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of all, I behold one perſon who ſtood for ſome time on the ſulphurous billows, ſurrounded by an enraged company, who with red hot irons kept puſhing againſt him. He ſtood aghaſt, and fearfully ſtared at me. He looked as if he would fain have ſpoken, but I perceived that his torments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him. He waved his hand to his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors, as I took it, begging for reſpite.</p>
            <p>Deep deſpair and wild diſtraction lowered on his condemned countenance. He raved! he foamed! he wreſtled! and then ſunk down in ſilent deſpair; ſullen and penſive, whilſt the direful floods of omnipotent vengeance rolled upon him.</p>
            <p>In this place I perceived no intermiſſion of the inceſſant floods that rolled along in one continued circle, ever running, but never at an end. Theſe diſcoveries, I truſt, will make me ever fearful of landing in this place of torment.</p>
            <p>At laſt he lift himſelf up from the flaming bed, waved his hand, and called me by my name; and fixing my eye intently upon him, I knew him to be the learned Doctor— with whom I had lived as a pupil, who died ſome few years ago.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:013390_0010_0F90948E8D71C1D8"/>
Amazed to ſee my venerable tutor in ſuch a deplorable condition, I cried out, "O hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible! what do I ſee! my learned, my pious tutor in hell! Am I not aſleep, deceived by my deluding fancy? It cannot be he! A man, whoſe doctrine and converſation was ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the dictates of reaſon, cannot be in hell. No, it can never be! Thou tormented ghoſt, I adjure thee by the greateſt of names to undeceive me! Art thou he! Am I in a dream or not? Is that!—but I cannot doubt it.—Tell me, is that the receptacle of the damned?"</p>
            <p>To which the ghoſt replied. "Deceived mortal, I ſee you are ſurprized to find a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in hell, who in life you eſteemed as highly as an apoſtle. You ſee I am not, as you vainly fancied, in the heavenly manſions of eternal felicity; but, after all my pretenſions to ſanctity, am ſwallowed up unhappily, I am plunged into the unfathomable abyſs of divine indignation, from whence, alas! there is no redemption. No, it ceaſeth now! It ceaſeth for ever. Ten thouſand worlds, if <hi>I</hi> had them now, for one twelve-months reſpite. But oh! there is no reſpite; no intermiſſion of theſe intolerable pains. Oh! piercing, pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pain! more violent far than fire, than burning coals of juniper. Here the keen ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of incenſed juſtice, the irreſiſtable wrath of a holy God do pierce me through with unſpeakable ſorrows. Oh! that <hi>I</hi> had never
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013390_0011_0F90948F560033C0"/>been born! O that <hi>I</hi> had never been a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver! O that <hi>I</hi> had been a huſbandman, a ploughman, or any thing but a preacher. Alas! a preacher, a falſe preacher, endureth a double hell! Oh! unhappy, wretched preacher, that is rewarded in this fiery gulph!</p>
            <p>Ye deluded ſpirits, who by my fallacious deceit have been blinded, and are hither got before me, forbear, O forbear to throw your flaming darts againſt me. Why, O why do you thus torment me? Have not I torment enough already? Sure <hi>I</hi> have affliction enough in ſuſtaining the ſhocks of omnipotent ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, without your malicious piercing arrows being pointed at me. Woful day! accurſed hour! that ever <hi>I</hi> denied the Lord, the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Saviour.</p>
            <p>Bear with me thou deceived mortal, for my pains force words from me, words that are unknown on earth. Oh for a few moments reſpite whilſt <hi>I</hi> ſpeak to a friendly mortal, and make known to him the horrors of this place! Ye my tormentors, allow me time only, ſo much time, as to recite the journal of one twenty-four hours of my unhappy being; grant me this ſmall favour, it may be the laſt <hi>I</hi> ſhall requeſt of you through the revolving ages of a never ending eternity. An hour's intermiſſion, O my tormentors! it cannot in any wiſe prejudice you, whereas to me it may be of great advantage.</p>
            <p>Hold! do hold, your hands, whilſt <hi>I</hi> declare
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013390_0012_0F909490159880E0"/>unto others what hath befallen a Socinian apoſtle.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee Mr.—, <hi>I</hi> cannot, by the moſt preſſing entreaties, obtain ſo long a reſpite from my torment as to communicate to you what hath befallen me; but in the midſt of unſpeakable ſorrow am obliged to converſe with you, for my tormentors are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> lived as you know to advanced years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, and your general opinion was, that <hi>I</hi> was gathered to my people in a good old age. Oh, the fatal miſtake! an old age indeed, but alas! a bad old age it has proved. When the harbinger of my death began to viſit me, my anxious pupils miniſtered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied attendance. My fellow-teachers duly payed their moſt tender regard, by praying for and converſing with me. Both they and <hi>I,</hi> were apprehenſive that my ſickneſs was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, my diſſolution near approaching.</p>
            <p>All proper means were uſed for my relief, but all in vain. No lengthening out of our days beyond the limits of God's decree; no, for he hath numbered our days, and our months are with him; he hath ſet bounds to our habitation that we cannot paſs over it. Phyſic affording no relief, my pupils were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate; they thought <hi>I</hi> was the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolic teacher in the world, and if death ſhould cruelly bereave them of me, they knew not how to repair their loſs, nor who was
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013390_0013_0F909490DE1A63F0"/>worthy to ſupply my place, when as they thought, I ſhould be employed in the more immediate preſence of the infinite JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVAH.</p>
            <p>My friends miſerably comforted me with my ſuppoſed good works. O ſir! ſay they, how comfortably may you die, when you conſider the great deliverances you have wrought for the church. You have relieved her reaſonable members from the irrational doctrines of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> overturned original ſin, and the doctrine of imputed righteouſneſs by your valuable books, which no man but your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could have wrote. Therein you ſhewed moſt excellently, how that man is capable to atone for his own ſins, and to work out his own ſalvation from ſin and wrath.</p>
            <p>As they ſaid, ſo <hi>I</hi> fooliſhly believed, that theſe antichriſtian hereſies were merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the ſight of God. <hi>I</hi> depended greatly on the opinions of men, and thought that my humility, ſelf-denial, and charity, would be a prevalent plea before the throne of the Almighty.—<hi>I</hi> thought on my death-bed that <hi>I</hi> felt a great deal of joy and comfort on look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back and viewing a well ſpent life, as mine at that time appeared to be. <hi>I</hi> truſted in my own holineſs, and the mercy of God; but alas! <hi>I</hi> have ſince learned that <hi>I</hi> had none of the former, and that the latter doth not flow in the channel <hi>I</hi> ſought for it in.</p>
            <p>In my latter hours <hi>I</hi> enjoyed compoſure of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013390_0014_0F9094918FB220A0"/>mind, from an expectation that my pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would ſoon be tranſlated to the ethereal climate, where nothing but holineſs can dwell. Not in the leaſt miſtruſting a falſe treacherous heart, that has undone me, but vainly fancied <hi>I</hi> ſtood in paradiſaical rectitude. O the deceit! O the fallacy of my hope, which lulled me aſleep in deluſive fancies. My ſoul conceived ſuch elevated notions of the divine reward, which <hi>I</hi> thought <hi>I</hi> had merited by my labours, that ſhe longed for the diſſolving moment of ſeparation, truſting in the clemency of the goſpel lawgiver, who <hi>I</hi> thought would bend his law and juſtice to ſuit the circumſtances of his reaſonable creatures. O dreadful! how ſhall <hi>I</hi> relate it? the hour! the appointed hour, the deſtined moment of ſeparation drew nigh.—My ſolicitous ſoul intreated the pale, the ghaſtly meſſenger, to cut ſhort his work, and make a ſpeedy diſſolution of the mortal union. Reluctant nature ſtruggled againſt the fermenting poiſon of the cankered arrow of nature's deſtroyer.</p>
            <p>Convulſive pangs invaded the nervous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric, and half perſuaded the weary heart to forbear to throb. Anon, nature, which juſt before ſeemed to be vanquiſhed by the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the fever, recruits its ſtrength and muſtereth all its powers to reſiſt, as long as might be, the unfruſtrable rage of rapacious death. But alas! the time the unhappy moment arrives! Vanquiſhed nature doth at laſt ſubmit,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013390_0015_0F9094948C49A140"/>yieldeth to the ſuperior power of all conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death.—Here—the dreadful ſurprize! the unexpected, unhappy turn! My deceived ghoſt came ſmiling forth, in full expectation of the righteous reward. But ſoon alas! too ſoon was ſhe convinced of her fatal miſtake. No ſooner arrived ſhe at the pale portal of the lifeleſs lips, but ſhe beheld—Oh! how ſhall <hi>I</hi> name it!—She beheld—O horrible! ſhe beheld a company of devils in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber waiting to carry her hence.—Precipitately back ſhe turned to ſeek for ſanctuary in the deſerted body—but now alas! the gates of mortality were ſhut, the body refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its former tenant. She looked to the right hand and to the left for a way to eſcape, but no avenue was open for retreat. She looked up to heaven, but could not ſtand the ſhock. Oh dreadful! ſhe beheld the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent looſing his engines, and beginning to play his direful vengeance upon her. To avoid this horrible calamity ſhe looked down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and beheld tempeſtuous deſtruction from beneath moved to meet her at her coming.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of all her hurry and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able confuſion—the ſly, ſeducing fiends, who had attended me incognito, and adminiſtred falſe inſtructions and comfort to me during life, with inconceivable fury, like ſo many fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocious panthers, leaped upon and ſeized me with their ſcorching talons; whoſe tormenting touch diffuſeth hell through the whole being of the unhappy priſoner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:013390_0016_0F9094956E7FFDE0"/>
No longer do they act in diſguiſe: having made ſure work of my deſtruction, they threw off every maſk, and appeared devils indeed! Now a tremendous ſcene was unfolded! The mercileſs furies forcibly dragged me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the dreadful, the flaming throne</p>
            <p>Infinite amazement, horrible aſtoniſhment ſeized me, when I beheld the ſame Saviour whom I had denied on earth, now filling the majeſtic, the judgment ſeat, filled with all the fulneſs of uncreated deity, the whole fulneſs of the God head dwelling bodily in him. Infinite numbers of glorious ſpirits were placed around the refulgent throne, caſting their crowns at the feet of him who ſat on the throne, and ſinging holy, holy, holy Lord GOD Almighty, &amp;c. every one cloathed with the righteouſneſs of GOD which is by faith in Jeſus Chriſt. The terrible Judge addreſſed himſelf to me, and ſaid, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou hither not having on a wedding garment.</hi> Alas! now my boaſted reaſon failed, and horrible guilt ſurrounded me; dread con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion environed me on every hand. Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed and ſelf condemned I could not anſwer a word. All my artful evaſions of truth, my contempt of the perſon and righteouſneſs of Chriſt, perverting the ſacred ſcriptures to eſtabliſh my accurſed hereſies, and the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite I had done to the grace, doctrines, and ſervants of GOD, all appeared as dreadful wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013390_0017_0F90949608E1F0E8"/>and advocates againſt me. I lived in hopes of being judged by a mild judge, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a yielding law, but alas! I found an inflexible law and an inexorable judge. No allowance was made for mine infirmities, no abatement would the law admit of. No! not in the leaſt, either eternal and perfect obedience, or perfect and eternal ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>The imperial Judge, who filled the majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſeat, with ſtern vengeance frowning on his irreconcileable countenance, and dire diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure lowering on his tremendous brow, pronounced on me the dread, the irrevocable ſentence, the unchangeable doom of <hi>a wolf in a ſheep's cloathing;</hi> ſaying, Thou flock-deſtroying ravager, thou grace-deſpiſing, and God-denying ſinner, where is now the God thou truſted in? If reaſon is thy God why doth ſhe not deliver from under my vengeful hand? Go learn accurſed ſpirit, go learn whether the torments of hell are infinite and of never-end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duration or not! Feel, wretched being! feel! endure all the ponderous weight of my falling vengeance. Hence, apoſtate! to the deſtined place of thy eternal abode! Here devils, receive your charge— away with the miſcreant to utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>This ſaid, the ſpouts of omnipotent ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance were opened, and the iſſuing indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an angry GOD falling and breaking
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013390_0018_0F90949A5BE12178"/>upon my head, (accurſed, devoted to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) as a ſtream of flaming brimſtone, did pierce me through with infinite ſorrows.</p>
            <p>The obedient infernals no ſooner received, but obeyed the charge, ſeized, and fettered me, with chains of all others the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, chains made of my own doctrines, from the pulpit and preſs, interdicted by the great law-giving GOD. O! amazing! that all my heretical opinions ſhould be ſo interlaced, as to become a chain ſtronger than iron, and, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than ſteel; but ſo it is, and I ſhall never, never, be able to break it.</p>
            <p>Being fettered and chained, the loathſome ſpirits, who had attended me during life, and at death dragged me before the awful tribunal to receive the condemning ſentence, did now ſhoulder and bear me away, through the dreary paſſage, to this dark abode. In the loneſome avenue that leadeth from the gates of heaven to the bottomleſs gulph of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I was frequently met by detached par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of patrolling goblins, who ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice to ſee their companions bringing home to their gloomy abode <hi>the learned the holy Doctor</hi> as in deriſion they called me. At laſt, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py moment! We arrived at the iron gates which opened of their own accord to receive their frightened prey.</p>
            <p>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, was I ſeized by the devouring jaws, and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed into the craving womb, of abyſmal
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013390_0019_0F90949B953682F0"/>hell, where the worm dieth not, and where the fire is not quenched.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was I within theſe frightful manſions, but <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Socinus</hi> were appriſed of my coming, by freſh bolts of divine indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation being thundred againſt their apoſtate heads.</p>
            <p>The moment I entered, I was environed by a numerous body of ghaſtly ſpectres, who, by my preaching and writing, had been hardened againſt the truth, and heedleſly drowned in everlaſting deſpair, they railed againſt my fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, and curſed my indefatigable diligence in deſtroying of them, and in fury unſpeakable, plunged me into the boſom of a flaming bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; ſtill they continued their helliſh reproach and dragged my intoxicated ghoſt through the reeking liquid. And the more fiercely the wrath of the Almighty doth beat upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the more intent are they in renewing my torments. Always, inceſſantly, doth the breath of JEHOVAH, as a ſtream of brimſtone, with ardour intenſe, continue to burn within me? Myriads of ſkilful fiends ſeem to employ all their wiſdom, contriving how to aggravate my pain.</p>
            <p>This alas! is the unalterable ſtate of your revered apoſtle, whom you ſuppoſed was ranged in heaven near the choir of the ancient evangeliſts. Believe me, Mr.—, hell is not a fiction, as miſtaking mortals may dream. The wrath of God is ſomething more than
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013390_0020_0F90949C04908888"/>a bare ſeparation from his joyful preſence The pains of hell are not, as you believe, the dream of fanatics and enthuſiaſts, but real real, inexpreſſible pain! inſupportable anguiſh! increaſing daily as more ſouls arrive."</p>
            <p>As he had thus ſpoke, a flaming billow rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon, and overwhelmed him, and it was a conſiderable time before I ſaw him again. O! thought I, if it is thus with the tutor, how will it be in the end with the pupils? If the leader hath fallen into the ditch, certainly the followers muſt, if they walk in his ways and are governed by his directions. If I am not in a dream, or trance, for my own part, if ever I reach home again, I will examine my BIBLE better, that I may know for myſelf truth from error; for it is a fearful thing thus to fall into the avenging hands of a denied GOD. I cannot, no! I cannot endure devouring flames, nor dwell with unquenchable burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. But I hope it is only a dream. O if it may prove only a dream, I ſhould be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad. But I was awake when I came from home, awake when I entered this horrible place. No, no, it cannot be a dream, it muſt be even as I ſee it. Oh amazing! my tutor, ſo highly eſteemed in life, in this condition; it is ſurely he, I know his voice. Yes, yes, it is he.</p>
            <p>As I was thus reaſoning concerning what I heard and ſaw, my tutor was brought up to the ſurface; and after he recovered himſelf a little, he ſtood erect, and ſaid,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:013390_0021_0F90949CD9F23258"/>
"Unhappy ſoul, to whom, whilſt I lived, my mouth was an oracle, and gained your credence and attention ſooner than the voice of GOD in the ſcriptures of truth, as you hold my memory venerable, hearken to what I ſay unto you. You ſeem greatly to queſtion the truth of the viſion which you now behold, but you may know of a truth that it is even too true, too real indeed! and that it cannot be otherwiſe, you will plainly ſee before you depart from hence. Wretched pupil, you, and your Socinian brethren, may know that it is not love to all, or any of you, that prompts me thus to expoſe to the world what hath befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len me. No! there is no love, no tenderneſs and compaſſion in the ſmoky regions of the damned.—Rage, hatred, envy, and malice fill every breaſt, and penſive lower on every beclouded brow. But my reaſon is this, and none other. When I arrived in theſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible manſions, I lift up my eyes, being in exquiſite torment, and beheld troops of my diſciples poſting after me to the ſame pit of deſtruction. Right well knowing that their arrival would greatly add to my already inſupportable anguiſh, with the rich libertine in the goſpel, I raiſe my voice from the belly of this bottomleſs abyſs, and ſpeak in the language of horrid deſpair, if by any means I may prevent the arrival of my brethren in falſeſhood, and the ſouls by me deceived in
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013390_0022_0F90949FE84A50D8"/>hell, to my unſpeakable ſorrow. <hi>I</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready more than <hi>I</hi> can bear, but bear it I muſt, and <hi>I</hi> am fearful of its increaſe, for I ſee you and your brethren ſpeeding to this dreadful goal. O why, why will you follow me, ye deluded ones? As for me, my ſtate is unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably fixed, the dye is caſt, my loſs is irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and my afflictions remedileſs; for there is neither work nor device in the grave. The irrevocable doom is paſt, my tree is fallen, and in hell it muſt lie, burning, but never to be conſumed! dying yet never dead! But for you, you are yet in a land of hope, on the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſide of death, on the mortal ſide of Jordan, not out of the reach of mercy, and the light of the goſpel of truth ſhining around you. Caſt off then your errors, and cleave to the truths of the Bible, the verbal report of which, as rational creatures, you are capable of receiving: and it will be your condemnation if you do it not. For <hi>I</hi> can tell you, if ever ſalvation do reach your unhappy ſouls, it muſt come through the ſame truths that I taught you to deny, but am myſelf, though too late, alas! convinced of. Oh! that <hi>I</hi> had owned them in time, but now my owning them is only forced, and by no means acceptable.— But that you may avoid the horrible deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into which <hi>I</hi> am involved, hearken to the word of admonition.</p>
            <p>Conſider your deſtructive error relating to the Godhead; You talk as <hi>I</hi> did, when <hi>I</hi> lived
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013390_0023_0F9094A0A70522C0"/>amongſt you, of an uncreated, ſupreme, and eternal God; two who are created and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate. You ſay that the firſt perſon of the deity created the ſecond, and the ſecond created the third. You ſay that the deity of Chriſt is ſubordinate; but believe me, if ever you are ſo unhappy as to ſee him in the terrible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which I beheld him on the judgment ſeat, you will have done with talking of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinacy in the Godhead. His terrors, the awful terrors of omnipotence, will pierce you through with infinite ſorrow. His tremendous majeſty will frighten you! will make the ſtrongeſt heart amongſt you to wax feeble, and the ruddieſt face to gather blackneſs.</p>
            <p>Is not this infinite vengeance that I ſuſtain? Is not this Almighty wrath that rolls inceſſant floods upon me? yet this is the very wrath and vengeance of the Saviour whom <hi>I</hi> denied. Nothing leſs than Omnipotence could thus torment, and along with the torment, convey ſuſtaining ſtrength. Is he a creature? no! verily this is uncreated indignation that falls upon me. Oh beſotted! befooled! as I was. Conſider how irrational it is to talk of a created God. Nothing can be God but infinity; but the higheſt creature is only a finite being, therefore not God.—Was yonder being who pronounced my deciſive doom only a creature? Why then did the terrors of Godhead ſtrike me, before the tremendous throne. Could creature terrors thus pierce me through with
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013390_0024_0F9094A136D93AB0"/>infinite torment! racking ſorrow! Is he only a creature, under whoſe vengeful hand all the infernal myriads do ſprawl in the utmoſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and agony?</p>
            <p>Deep infatuation! falſe reaſon, that denies the ſupremacy of the Son. Your reaſon, were it not groſly perverted, would readily ſee in the ſacred volume that the Father is ſupreme, the Son ſupreme, and the Holy Ghoſt ſupreme, and that theſe three are ſo inſeparably united, as to be only ONE everliving and ſupreme GOD. Blinded creatures! O my diſciples! will you believe nothing but what your reaſon can comprehend? Is your reaſon finite or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite? If it is but finite, as you know it is, how can you think thereby to graſp infinity? But the light of your reaſon is only darkneſs, therefore it conceiveth irrational ideas of the deep things of GOD.</p>
            <p>Be you aſſured, that when you land in theſe intolerable manſions, you will then, if not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, repent that you gave the teſtimony of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the preference to that of the divine oracles. O! what will you do, wretched men, when your reaſon bears teſtimony againſt you? It is a dreadful thing for a man to be witneſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by his own reaſonable faculties. Yet ſo it muſt be when you die, if you hearken not to the voice of truth, whoſe invariable dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates inſtruct the moſt enlightned reaſon to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit itſelf to revelation.</p>
            <p>For my own part, <hi>I</hi> confeſs to you that I
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013390_0025_0F9094A618986300"/>am condemned as a wilful idolater: and it will fare no better with you, if you recant not in time, for you are all wilful idolaters. You knowingly worſhip a being whom you believe only to be a dignified creature: now know, that the worſhip of any being who is not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially GOD, how great ſoever that being is, is only rank idolatry. You know likewiſe that our Arian and Socinian ſect doth, contrary to the law of GOD and right reaſon itſelf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce more Gods than one: What is this but paganiſm? The truth is, we, who were of the Socinian tribe whilſt on earth, now we are in hell, are ſunk lower in the bottomleſs abyſs, and endure far higher degrees of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the infidels who worſhipped the ſun, moon, and ſtars, and all the hoſt of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. O blind and perverted reaſon, that by truſting to thy falſe dictates I have deſpiſed the truth and unhappily deſtroyed myſelf. O cruelty never to be forgot! Treachery, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be forgiven! Thro' ſelf-deception, cruel in its nature, I have loſt, ruined myſelf!</p>
            <p>Unhappy men, when you come to view your tenets in the light of eternity, as your teacher and fellow-hereſiarch now unhappily does, you will ſee that the profeſt atheiſts and we do ſtand on a level. They deny the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of GOD in terms that are obvious and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, we deny the ſame being in a ſubtile indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect manner: For in denying the divinity of the Son, the whole deity is denied; for the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013390_0026_0F9094A7292395F0"/>God head of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit, is one and the ſelf ſame Godhead, differing only in the manner of ſubſiſtence; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in denying one of the divine ſubſiſtence, ſtrictly ſpeaking, you deny all the three. But as for my diſciples, you deny two of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſubſiſtences, and aſcribe unto them ſome kind of unſcriptural ſuper-angelic qualities. Pray what do you call this? Is it not real atheiſm? Ceaſe from following me, I deſire you. Burn, O burn my books againſt the truth, and forget my irrational hereſies. Ceaſe, I ſay! ceaſe from following after me, before you are ſwallowed, to my unſpeakable diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the ſame perdition with me. Believe what the ſcriptures ſay of him whom you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. If any man believe not that JESUS is the ETERNAL I AM, he ſhall die in his ſins.</p>
            <p>A ſecond ſentiment of yours which I adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe you of, and warn you to recant, is, the good opinion you have of your ſuppoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent purity, in oppoſition to the voice of religion and the dictates of common ſenſe. O that I had never maligned the truth by aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the doctrine of original ſin is a fallacy? Alas! though my repentance is ſincere, it is now too late! is not that predominant pride which is peculiar to the tribes of the Deiſts, Socinians, and Arians, a ſtrong demonſtration of our original depravity. Is it not pride that ſwelleth our haughty reaſon to that degree, that it not only vyes with, but even ſupercedes everlation. We are wont to ſay that we will
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013390_0027_0F9094A74941EF20"/>believe nothing but what our reaſon can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. The native meining of this decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is, that the word of GOD may err, but reaſon is infallible. What is this better than Popiſh pride, Infidel blindneſs, and Turkiſh arrogance. Believe me, my followers, if you chooſe to be governed by the dictates of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reaſon, rather than divine revelation, you will find that yours will do by you as mine hath done by me; It will plunge you into hell in the end. Conſider, my deluded followers, that if we by our reaſon had been capable of knowing the whole mind of GOD, there had been no need of revelation, no need of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt being ſent down from heaven to lead his people into all truth; to reprove the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doth not your inconſiſtency in preaching, ſometimes contradicting one day what you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the other, plainly prove the inſufficiency of reaſon to graſp infinite myſteries. Ah! my diſciples! how can you think to eſcape the damnation of hell? ſeeing, though you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to hearken to the voice of reaſon, you only liſten partially to her.</p>
            <p>Reaſon tells you that it is irrational to preach and unpreach, to contradict in one ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon what you preached in another. But how can you do otherwiſe, if you adhere not to the voice of revelation, which is perfectly uniform, as reaſon alſo doth allow. But you and I are wont to charge the ſcriptures with contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013390_0028_0F9094A8073FCA08"/>I am now convinced indeed. that they are one chain of uniform truth. But alas! you remain unconvinced; and lo! I ſee you poſting after me to the paths of perdition. Woe is me, for they will not ſtop till they be in hell, notwithſtanding all my admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Unhappy diſciples! are you not guilty of ſelf-contradictions every day? Do not you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that you will believe nothing but what your reaſon can comprehend? And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this declaration, you believe that you are poſſeſt of rational immortal ſpirits, and you cannot comprehend how, or in what manner, theſe ſpirits dwell in you. Your reaſon tells you, that no creature is, or ought to be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of religious adoration; but, contrary to the dictates of common ſenſe, you worſhip Jeſus Chriſt, whom you are taught to call a creature. Your reaſon tells you that GOD muſt be an infinite, uncreated, ſupreme being: but, contrary to all reaſon, you and I are wont to talk of a finite, created, and ſubordinate GOD. Witneſs heaven and earth, if theſe and many other glaring contradictions are not ſo many plain ſymptoms of natural depravity and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</p>
            <p>As long as you believe yourſelves exempt from natural defilement, and in no danger by ſin; as long as you cry up your own inherent power and worth, ſo long are you in a ſtate of condemnation, from which nothing can
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013390_0029_0F9094AB23B0F680"/>ſave you but the attoning blood of Chriſt, which ſacrifice I taught you to deſpiſe. Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to your own wants and danger being a certain teſtimony of your depravity, and of the hardneſs of your hearts againſt GOD.</p>
            <p>Remember, that as long as you continue in that good opinion you have of yourſelves, ſo long you are enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, blaſphemous contradictors of GOD's holy word, that hath judiciouſly concluded all men under ſin, and declared them dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, children of wrath, &amp;c. O that I had preached thus while I lived! then had not my hell been ſo hot as alas! I find it. If you are ſo unhappy as to follow me to this place of torment, you will ſoon be convinced, that your boaſted natural light is only darkneſs, that your virtue ſo much talked of is only painted vice, your ſtrength imbecillity; and that your pretended humility is none other but pride in diſguiſe. Oh! the Socinians hell is hot, ſeven times hotter than that of the profeſt Pagans.</p>
            <p>A third evil of a damning nature which attendeth your heretical tribes is, denying the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, for pardon and acceptance; a doctrine of GOD's word which none ever died in the denial of, and eſcaped the damnation of hell. Conſider, my unhappy followers, that I, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen the myſteries of eternity, muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed capable of teaching you leſſons that you, in a ſtate of mortality are utter ſtrangers unto:
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013390_0030_0F9094ABD0F16AE8"/>and if you ſubmitted yourſelves to my inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when I lived on earth, with far more reaſon you ought to attend to me now, when my knowledge is refined by the flames of hell.</p>
            <p>In denying the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs for the ſinner's pardon and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, you in effect deny the juſtice and truth of Jehovah. Juſtice hath ſaid <hi>the ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die,</hi> truth is engaged to ſee the decree executed. Now, either the ſinner muſt die in himſelf, or in ſome other perſon who ſtands in the relation of ſurety for him: If the ſinner die in himſelf, then is there ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for none, for all have ſinned; but if he die in his ſurety, or if his ſurety die for him, then what his ſurety did for him muſt be imputed to him for his acceptance. But as I taught you, ſo you ſay, that he died not in his ſurety, neither needs he to die in him ſelf—as a juſt conſequence of this, the mercy and truth of God do both fall to the ground. Now, if both the juſtice and truth of God be denied, God himſelf is denied, and you commence ATHEISTS on the ſpot.</p>
            <p>Let not you and your brethren ſtrive to evade my arguments, and think yourſelves ſomewhat better than ATHEISTS; for I can aſſure you, that the profeſt ATHEISTS and we, do compoſe only one canton in theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal regions. Is the imputation of Chriſt's
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013390_0031_0F9094ACA330CDE8"/>righteouſneſs contrary to reaſon? ſurely no! Do not you ſir, remember that affair between your two neighbours, Meſſrs. <hi>Auſterity</hi> and <hi>Falſhort,</hi> that happened about ſeven years ago, a little before I died.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Falſhort</hi> ſtood charged in Mr. <hi>Auſterity</hi>'s Books with the ſum of a thouſand pounds. <hi>Auſterity</hi> called on him once and again for his money, but meeting with nothing but good words and fair promiſes inſtead of ſatisfactory payment, he reſolved to have Mr. <hi>Falſhort</hi>'s circumſtances tried; and upon trial found that he was not worth a thouſand pence. <hi>Auſterity</hi> enraged at the diſappointment, immediately arreſted <hi>Falſhort</hi> and laid him in goal, where he lay in a helpleſs and hopeleſs condition, often ſolliciting Mr. <hi>Auſterity</hi> for a releaſe. But <hi>Auſterity</hi> obſtinately perſiſted in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, either payment of the whole ſum, or impriſonment during life.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Goodwill,</hi> a neighbouring gentleman, and relation to Mr. <hi>Falſhort,</hi> moved with pity and compaſſion towards his unfortunate friend, and being a man of ſubſtance and honour, went to Mr. <hi>Auſterity</hi> unknown to Mr. <hi>Falſhort,</hi> and reſolved to deliver his, poor, inſolvent friend out of priſon, but ſcorning to have it ſaid that <hi>Auſterity</hi> ſhould be a loſer by his friend <hi>Falſhort,</hi> he paid down chearfully the whole ſum, to the ſatisfaction of the creditor and deliverance of the inſolvent: on which payment he obtained a diſcharge in full of all demands on the account of Mr. <hi>Falſhort.</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:013390_0032_0F9094B2F5C9C298"/>Now the quere is, did <hi>Auſterity</hi> impute unto <hi>Falſhort</hi> the payment of Mr. <hi>Goodwill,</hi> and account it the ſame as if <hi>Falſhort</hi> himſelf had payed the debt. You know he did. Ah! my diſciples, your abuſed, yet boaſted reaſon, if you recant not, will be a terrible devil to torment you when you arrive in theſe intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manſions, as my reaſon, alas! is the greateſt of all my tormentors.</p>
            <p>But you ſay you have no need of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of another, becauſe you have power of yourſelves to do that which is well pleaſing in the ſight of GOD, and ſufficiently work out your own ſalvation. Now if you could do ſo, you would at once ſtop my mouth. Ah! poor deluded mortals, you little know what it is to keep the law of God! The command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is exceeding broad!</p>
            <p>Does there never a vain thought paſs through your mind? Does there never an idle word iſſue from your mouth? Do you in all things do unto others as you would that they ſhould do unto you? Unleſs you can anſwer the two firſt queries in the negative, and the latter in the affirmative, never boaſt of ſtrength, but be mortified for want of will to keep ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all or any precept of the moral law perfectly. Remember what the apoſtle Paul ſaid of himſelf, <hi>to will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not.</hi> Can the damned to theſe dark regions extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelves out of the inconceivable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013390_0033_0F9094B607358CF0"/>into which they are involved? Juſt as much power have you to work out your own ſalvation. You can as ſoon deliver yourſelves from the torments of hell if once you are ſwallowed up in it, as to deliver yourſelves from the ſlaviſh bands of your pride and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. Bewitched Socinians, let right reaſon have its courſe, and it will teach you to ſubmit to revelation. O! how it pains me to find that your blood is required at my hands! and to ſee you and your fellows ſeeking death in the groſſeſt of hereſies. Oh! my diſciples, <hi>this is our condemnation, that light is come into the world, and we have loved darkneſs rather than light becauſe our deeds are, and have been evil"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Doctor had thus ſpoke, he was ſurrounded by a number of mercileſs furies, ſeized, and plunged into the flaming abyſs, ſo that for ſome time I loſt ſight of him, and the ſmoke of his torment aſcended up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, darkening the air in its paſſage.</p>
            <p>After the ſpace of about half an hour, I perceived him caſt up at the farther ſide of a rolling billow, and after ſome violent ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glings he ſtood erect, and in horrid diſtraction ſaid.—"Damnation! ah me! is this the Damnation I was ſo often threatened with by the Calviniſts, and as often laughed at it as a fanatic's dream? Is this the hell I ſo often heard of, and ſo fallaciouſly concluded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt barely in a ſeparation from the bliſsful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013390_0034_0F9094B758A19A60"/>of GOD! Alas! alas! theſe floods of vengeance that inceſſantly keep pouring in upon me, are ſomething more than a bare ſeparation. Blinded teacher who had, and blinded diſciples who have, ſuch diminutive notions of the torments of the damned.</p>
            <p>Wretched creatures, as I lift up my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented eyes, I behold them poſting onward toward the dreadful goal. If they arrive, my torment, though already inexpreſſible, will be greatly aggravated.—Let me once more try what effect the eloquence of deſpair may have upon them. Who knows but it may retard their march!</p>
            <p>Still! ſtill do you purſue your courſe! O my deluded followers? Still will ye remain tenacious of your errors, notwithſtanding I plainly tell you to what diſmal diſtraction they have reduced me! into what unalterable anguiſh they have plunged me! You perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in your errors, therefore I muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in admoniſhing you. Hearken ſir! hearken Mr.—while I ſpeak to you, and I charge you to tell your brethren what I ſay.</p>
            <p>Your denying the efficacy of divine grace in regeneration and ſanctification is juſtly ranked among your damnable errors, and is one of the greateſt hereſies that ever <hi>I</hi> taught you.—Had I experimentally known the influences of efficacious grace, I had never come to this place of torment, but had been
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013390_0035_0F9094B7C69D1D80"/>joining yonder aſſembly, yonder glorious church of the firſt-born, which I ſee afar off written in heaven, beautified with all the luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of grace, both imputed and imparted, cloathed with all the radiance of undecaying glory, filled with the inexpreſſible pleaſures that iſſue from the throne of ſovereign love and goodneſs. Alas, I never ſaw the need of the operations of unfruſtrable grace till I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in eternity, and now too late I repent my denial thereof.—The flames of hell give a laſting and full conviction of the truth of all the doctrines of the goſpel, and at the ſame time that we, the ſpirits accurſed, have no ſhare in their ſalutary report and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.</p>
            <p>When I lived on earth amongſt you, I taught you to attend to the voice of carnal corrupted reaſon; now I am in hell, I adviſe you to hearken to the voice of right reaſon compared with the word of GOD.</p>
            <p>In the word of GOD converſion is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a quickening or riſing from the dead: and reaſon tells you, that you cannot quicken or bring to life again the deareſt, the moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved object which death hath bereaved you of; nor can they quicken themſelves, or they would never ſuffer their delicate bodies to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nauſeouſly putrified in the devouring womb of the hungry grave. For my own part, I find I cannot quicken my body again, or I would not lie here broiling in theſe
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013390_0036_0F9094B8985080A8"/>flames.—Some of you have hair of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely colour of which you are aſhamed, why do you not change its colour agreeable to your minds? Others of you my diſciples have legs or ſhoulders not ſhaped, eyes and temples not ſet to your liking, why do you not mend the matter and alter the proportion of your parts? Your own reaſon tells you, you cannot ſo much as alter the colour of a ſingle hair of your head.</p>
            <p>But the quickening of the ſoul is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater work. And is it reaſonable to pretend to do the greater, when you are convinced you cannot do the leſs? O my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples! how have I your blind leader darkened your underſtanding by my falſhoods. Woe is me! for my followers are at the point of falling into this horrible ditch.</p>
            <p>Again, the work of converſion is a creation of the ſoul anew. Now if divine grace is not the efficient in this ſoul creation, you your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves muſt be the efficient therein. Can you do it? You profeſs you can. Firſt try your creating hand on a leſſer job before you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the greater. Can you create riches and honour? You love them well enough; if you have power to create them why do ſo many of you go deſtitute of both? Can you create peace in the midſt of trouble? Joy in the midſt of ſorrow? Eaſe in the midſt of pain? Light in the time and place of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Beauty inſtead of deformity? You
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013390_0037_0F9094BB08F165F0"/>know you cannot. But to create the ſoul <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus to good works</hi> is a taſk by far more difficult. If you cannot, as your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences confeſs, do the leaſt, is it not then a great degree of madneſs to pretend to do the greateſt, even a work that requires Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to perform.</p>
            <p>Hearken ye blinded mortals, hearken to the voice of him who hath condemned me! It is not effected by <hi>works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but by the walling of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, inconſiſtent creature that you are, (ſaith he to me) if you can create yourſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, why do you not do it? Why are you ſo long e'er you begin the work? If you muſt perform the work with your own ſingle hand, you will be long in finiſhing it: Moſt likely you may ſpend all your life time before you are half gone through with you work, then all your creating labour will be loſt. Is it not highly unreaſonable when a man hears that he <hi>muſt be born again, created anew, quicken'd together with Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. and at the ſome time believes that the renewing power is in himſelf, that he ſhould ſit down contented in an unrenewed condition, not knowing but death may ſeize him every moment?"</p>
            <p>Here I was cut to the heart, to ſee that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being guided wholly by reaſon, that in many things I both believed and acted contrary to reaſon. The old Doctor, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving my confuſion, continued:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:013390_0038_0F9094BB9FC4D7D0"/>
"Conſider that if you deny the operations of the comforter, you deny the author of the bible, who is the very GOD that made you. Here you may ſee that I taught you Atheiſm in various forms. Oh! that you repented your receiving my inſtructions as ſincerely as I repent teaching them! then would not my torment be increaſed by your arrival in hell. I do aſſure you I recant all theſe blaſphemous errors, though now alas! it is too late. You may recant in time as you are yet on the mortal ſide of the gulph! Oh! that you might all recant in time! I dread your arrival in this fiery tophet! becauſe it will bring additional torment to me.</p>
            <p>Miſerable teacher that I was, I taught you to deny the operations of the Holy Ghoſt, and in doing ſo to deny the truth of God, which in fact is the ſame as to deny GOD himſelf. O! what ſpirit accurſed can ſtand up under the fury of a denied God! Alas if you do not hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſign your recantation in time, you muſt needs ſtand the ſhock, the dreadful ſhock of his fiery indignation to all eternity.</p>
            <p>Another deſtructive error by which you treaſure up unto yourſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath, is the truſt you have in a mild, yielding law, and flexible juſtice of God the judge.</p>
            <p>You may fancy what you will; but for my part, when I trembling ſtood before the awful throne, I found no condeſcenſion in, no abatements made by, the rigid law,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013390_0039_0F9094BC58241D60"/>not the leaſt in divine juſtice! All was ſtern, all was ſevere, beyond all poſſibility of miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. I then found, though never before, that the council of the moſt high doth ſtand, and that his word is as invariable as himſelf. O! if you had ſeen as much of the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the law as I have! you would have done with talking as you do about abatement of its rigorous demands, or that juſtice doth make allowances for ſins, however ſuppoſed venal. This error of yours doth directly wound both the mercy and juſtice of God: for if God is juſt, then muſt his law be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled according to the tenor thereof; if God is merciful, his mercy muſt be unbounded: but if, as in effect you ſay, he in part forgives and in part receives, his mercy is limited by the circumſtances of the object. One man requires a greater, another requires a leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of mercy. Is not this as great an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as you can offer to the mercy of God? As for me, I now ſee in the light of eternity, that where ever ſalvation comes, it comes wholly, fully and freely, <hi>without money and without price,</hi> without any works of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs on the part of man.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, I now ſee that God's juſtice is infinite, which it could not poſſibly be, if it could in any ways paſs by the leaſt ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed. Fooliſh dreamers that we were! to think that God would drown his juſtice in the flood of his mercy, would prejudice
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013390_0040_0F9094BD08BC7728"/>one attribute of his incomprehenſible nature, to the honour of another, and all for the ſake of creatures who are leſs than nothing, in his ſight altogether vanity. Folly in perfection indeed! That being who is GOD muſt be infinitely holy and juſt as well as infinitely mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful. If he is infinitely holy, than he can make no allowance for ſin. If infinitely juſt, then his mercy can be extended to none, but to the honour of his juſtice. But if his juſtice can paſs over ſome ſins, why not all ſin? and then there would be no need of a Saviour; for verily if ſalvation could have come by the holineſs of the creature, Chriſt hath died in vain. Have not you an equal right to a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which one man may owe you, as to a pound which another may? Such is the rigour of the law, (and that ſoon you will find) that he who offends in one point, though it were but in a ſingle thought, is guilty of the whole,—GOD will by no means clear the guilty,—there is no releaſe from his law's arreſt,—no appeal from the tribunal of his juſtice! O faithleſs and unbelieving, as I was, will you not open your eyes to ſee the light of inſtruction? Will you ever ſhut your ears againſt the voice of truth?</p>
            <p>I know you ſay, that when you come to be tried at the divine bar, that your vices muſt be put in one ſcale, and your virtues in the other, and if there happen to be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilibrium in the balance, that God will put
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013390_0041_0F9094BDC4156900"/>in ſo much of his divine clemency, as will make your virtues overweigh your vices. Alas! alas! I can look back to the time that I had ſuch a fooliſh notion, which greatly facilitated my ruin. But when I came to be weighed, all my deeds were accounted evil; my virtues, which I formerly thought I had ſtore of, were, when weighed in the balance of the ſanctuary, lighter than nothing, vanity itſelf. You will find that unleſs Chriſt be put in the balance with you, <hi>you will be ſound wanting</hi> as I was. How ſhould it be otherwiſe, when <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe</hi> GOD, and <hi>whatſoever is not of faith is ſin?</hi> Why then will faithleſs mortals pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do <hi>that which is well pleaſing in the ſight of</hi> GOD? When I expected my virtues to appear as my <hi>wedding garment,</hi> I was ſtruck as with a thunder-bolt, and when I heard the Judge, the holy GOD to ſay, <hi>Let his filthy rags be burned with him, both he and they are an abomination to me, from this time forward I will rejoice over him to do him evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah my diſciples, you will find that the firſt touch of the flames beneath will at once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all your ſuppoſed virtue. The law ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth not of compoſition, and the juſtice of GOD cannot be bribed with imperfect virtues, rather the appearance of virtue. If you muſt ſtand in your own righteouſneſs, alas! you muſt bear the whole weight of JEHOVAH's
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013390_0042_0F9094BE80B4D4F8"/>vengeance, as I do at this day. O that I had been wiſe, and had underſtood this in time, then had not my latter end been ſo terribly dreadful. Ah me! theſe complaints are now too late!</p>
            <p>Another error whereby your hands are ſtrengthened in wickedneſs, is your vain imaginations concerning the torments of the damned. You ſay that the torments of hell conſiſts only in a ſeparation from the joys of heaven, the bliſsful preſence of GOD: If that indeed were all—it were no hell to ſouls whoſe natural language is,—<hi>depart from me, O Lord, I deſire not the knowledge of thee.</hi> All the heaven unregenerate men deſire, is an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeparation from GOD. But I can tell you from woeful experience, that excluſion from the mercy of GOD is inſeperable from endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his wrath. Separation from the joy of heaven, in eternity, is immediately connected with the moſt exquiſite pain. Can the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of angels perſuade me that I feel not the moſt intolerable anguiſh? Are the flaming billows, that roll inceſſantly upon me, nothing but bare ſeparation? Are theſe ſtreams of vengeance, that iſſue continually from the ſpouts of omnipotent wrath, nothing but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration? Doth this noiſome ſmell, ariſing from the flaming ſulphur, impart no torment to the damned? Doth theſe diſmal howlings of ſouls in unutterable agonies—theſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013390_0043_0F9094BF70892FA8"/>yellings of hideous ghoſts, cutting their flight through the tremendous arches of the expanſive tophet,—yield no degree of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the damned ear? Or the ſight of millions of frightful ghoſts floating upon the ſurface of the burning lake? All the ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine breed in their moſt ghaſtly dimenſions, with all the ſwelling floods of JEHOVAH's vengeance, rolling in continually on us: can theſe be beheld with a peaceful eye! And all this within view of the overflowing joys of the righteous, whom on earth we accounted fanatics, enthuſiaſts, &amp;c.—Is all this, and infinitely more than human heart in a ſtate of mortality can form any idea of, no more than a bare ſeparation from GOD? Now I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal a myſtery unto you. You ſay that the damned are ſeparate from GOD: but verily it is a miſtake! He is as fully manifeſted in theſe dreadful manſions, as he is in heaven. There he is manifeſted in his love, grace, mercy, truth, and holineſs. Here he is manifeſted in his holineſs, truth, juſtice, and wrath. If this manifeſtation of GOD doth not create a hell of infinite torment, I know not what poſſibly can.</p>
            <p>But you ſay that deſpair conſtitutes hell. I aſk you, did you ever ſenſibly know what is meant by deſpair? If you felt the awful tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cauſed by that gnawing worm, for the ſpace of one minute, you would dread it as long as you lived. Know of a truth that hell is intolerable! Flatter not yourſelves that your
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013390_0044_0F9094C0030C6D10"/>puniſhment will conſiſt in a ſeparation from the perſon whom you hate. If you are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to perſiſt in your hereſies till the laſt, you will find that one hour in this dark abode will convince you of their fallacy.</p>
            <p>But to make the beſt of a bad bargain, you have got a notion, that in ſome future period there ſhall be a general releaſe from the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell. This is a flat denial of the oracles of God, an inſult on the author, and crafty method of hardening ſinners in their ſins. When I lived on the earth I was of the ſame mind with Mr. <hi>Bourn;</hi> but now I am in hell, and am convinced of its eternity.—Alas! my conviction adds greatly to my torment. Could we who are confined to this gloomy dungeon but once think of a releaſe, it would in a great meaſure alleviate our diſtreſs. But ſuch a thought doth not ſo much as once enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our minds. No, never will whilſt eternity endures. O eternity! eternity! To think of eternity is a galling thought. Any torment is to be choſen, rather than an eternity of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Eternal inevitably it muſt be! Woe is me, I am loſt! Eternally loſt! beyond all remedy!</p>
            <p>Bewitched man, to meaſure eternity by the diviſions of time. Here we have no years, months, weeks, and days! But eternity is eternity, that is all you mortals can know of it. Inſufferable inſolence! thus to aſſault the truths of JEHOVAH, and give the lie to the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013390_0045_0F9094C3ED702FD8"/>God of eternal veracity. Should you treat the law of an earthly prince with equal contempt, would he calmly and patiently ſuffer it? Is it poſſible that ſuch daring impiety can go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed! ſurely no! I charge you Mr.—, that you write down and publiſh to the world all that you have heard and ſeen, if by that means any of my deceived followers may be perſuaded to believe the truth, and eſcape this direful miſery into which I am plunged. Tell them I heartily recant all the doctrines where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I have ſupplanted the truths of the goſpel. Tell them I, ſleeping, dreamed all the days of my life, and never awoke till vengeance laid hold of me.—Tell them, that if <hi>I</hi> had liberty to come on earth, and there remain for one twelvemonth's ſpace, <hi>I</hi> would openly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge all mine errors, publicly recant all my hereſies.—Speak, ſpeak to them, and do not ſpare.—Tell them, that if here they arrive, their blood will be as oil in the flames of my torments that now blaze all around me. Regard not my memory. Let it be cut off from the face of the earth!—O that the earth were alſo cut off from my mind! But alas! <hi>I</hi> have the lively images of all my paſt tranſactions intimately preſent with me.—The ſound of my hereſies for ever ring in my tormented ears.—After all, remember what I told you at firſt. It is not love either to you or them, that makes me thus ſolicitouſly concerned for the welfare of you all, but a ſlaviſh fear that my already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013390_0046_0F9094C6487E1668"/>pains will be increaſed on your arrival in this bottomleſs abyſs. Mercy and love are for ever baniſhed from amongſt us.—</p>
            <p>As the doctor had thus ſpoke, I beheld him ſurrounded by a ſquadron of black infernals, who cut their way ſwifter than the wind through the ſmoky arches of dreadful Tophet. They ſurrounded, ſeized, and carried him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as I ſuppoſed, to renewed torments, by reaſon of his hideous ſhrieks, that reached up unto heaven, and even now fill my afflicted ears as I write the ſtory.—They carried him off, and I ſaw him no more.—</p>
            <p>Amazed I ſtood on this dangerous precipice, revolving in my mind what I had heard and ſeen, aſtoniſhed to find myſelf ſo clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of infidelity; fearful leſt <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſhare the ſame end with my unhappy tutor; and partly, wondering that I was not indeed with him already, becauſe <hi>I</hi> had hitherto ſo cloſely followed his doctrines. As I was meditating on theſe things, I heard a noiſe equally fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with that which <hi>I</hi> heard at the beginning: <hi>I</hi> trembling ſtood, expecting a ſecond eruption, fearful leaſt thereby <hi>I</hi> ſhould be overwhelmed with certain deſtruction. As <hi>I</hi> thus ſtood dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſequence, the noiſe waxed louder and louder, like many rolling thunders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centring in one: all the noiſe ſeemed to come from the bowels of the earth. Anon the earth began to tremble, at laſt to ſhake in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common manner; and by and by the pit in
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013390_0047_0F9094C7557FBD08"/>which <hi>I</hi> had ſeen ſuch wonders cloſed its lips, and ceaſed further to belch froth from its fiery entrails either fire, ſmoke, or hideous ſpectres. This done the earth regained her ſtability, and all nature appeared ſerene.</p>
            <p>Not knowing into what place of the world I was got, I judged it ſafeſt to abide where <hi>I</hi> was, and wait for the wiſhed for morn, the welcome harbinger of day already appearing in the Eaſt.—When fair Aurora had ſpread her broidered ſkirts over all the oriental world, and darted her pleaſant ſmiles towards the Weſt, <hi>I</hi> found in her light, that <hi>I</hi> was got to the middle of the common on the ſouth ſide of the town. Now knowing right well the place on which <hi>I</hi> ſtood, <hi>I</hi> began with the light of day to ſearch for the burned foreſt <hi>I</hi> had ſeen overnight; but could ſee nothing but what was uſual on the common. <hi>I</hi> gladly would once more have viewed that pleaſant, but ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary avenue, through which <hi>I</hi> paſſed the night before; but no avenue was to be ſeen; <hi>I</hi> ſought it, but could not find it. This made me conclude, that both the foreſt and avenue were only viſionary.</p>
            <p>I dreaded going home, expecting to find my wife and children buried in the ruins made by the earthquakes; but to my joyful ſurprize, <hi>I</hi> gladly found them all in perfect health, and my wife told me, that though the ſlept none in the night, by reaſon of my abſence, yet ſhe had heard no uncommon noiſe, nor felt the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013390_0048_0F9094C9D54E5498"/>leaſt ſhock of an earthquake; making further enquiry among my neighbours, they anſwered in like manner: nor indeed was there to be ſeen about all the town the leaſt appearance of a paſt earthquake: All which tended to aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh me more and more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> knew not what to think of the viſion—Certainly, thought <hi>I,</hi> it cannot be a dream! But <hi>I</hi> feared leaſt my brain was diſtempered, and in the midſt of its diſtraction painted out ſuch apparitions to me. However, two things <hi>I</hi> reſolved on; 1ſt, Utterly to caſt off all Arian and Socinian errors, and embrace the orthodox faith, which <hi>I</hi> had deſpiſed the day before; but <hi>I</hi> judged it prudent candidly to examine the doctor's books by the ſcriptures of truth, before <hi>I</hi> committed them to the flames.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, <hi>I</hi> reſolved to keep all theſe things which <hi>I</hi> had ſeen and heard a profound ſecret. The regard <hi>I</hi> had for the doctor's memory had great influence upon me.</p>
            <p>That very day <hi>I</hi> began to take a ſcriptural view of the works of my unhappy tutor; and in the concluſion, found them very worthy of the fire, which accordingly in due time they fed.</p>
            <p>Still <hi>I</hi> was reſolved to hide the viſion in my heart, till one night in my ſleep <hi>I</hi> dreamt that the doctor appeared to me in all the ghaſtly deformities of a damned ſpirit, charged me with ingratitude to that God who had in ſo
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:013390_0049_0F9094CA82FFB340"/>uncommon a manner delivered me from the dangerous hereſies <hi>I</hi> had imbibed from my tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and want of love to my fellow creatures, in that, having got the knowledge of the truth myſelf, <hi>I</hi> did not ſtudy to reclaim others from error. He ſaid <hi>I</hi> had no true regard either for his perſon or memory, or <hi>I</hi> would publiſh unto mankind what might in part, prevent the increaſe of his torments. And withal told me, if <hi>I</hi> would not reſolve to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh what <hi>I</hi> had heard and ſeen, that he would haunt me every night in my ſleep, to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mortification.</p>
            <p>Self-preſervation hath in it a perſuaſive elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; rather than be troubled every night with the ghoſt of my unhappy tutor, <hi>I</hi> have prevailed with myſelf to obey him; though for my pains, <hi>I</hi> expect to be called a madman by one, a fanatic by another, an enthuſiaſt by a third, and perhaps by a fourth a malicious perſon.</p>
            <p>But <hi>I</hi> reſt myſelf content, that the notable day will ſhew who is the wiſeſt diſciple of reaſon, or the maddeſt enthuſiaſt; who uſeth and who abuſeth right reaſon: whether they that deſpiſe my viſion, or their humble ſervant, whoſe name henceforth is</p>
