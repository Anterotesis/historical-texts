            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>And I will make of thee a great Nation, and I will Bleſs thee, and make thy name great; and thou ſhalt be a Bleſſing.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHEN the World was deeply immerſt in Idolatry, God was pleaſed from his Sovereign pleaſure, to call ſome out of darkneſs into his marvellous light, ſhedding down upon them the Saving and Regenerating influences of his Spirit, whereby they were enabled willingly to turn from Idols to Serve him, who is the true and living God.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the famous Worthies that the Sacred Hiſtory makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of in the new World, was <hi>Abraham;</hi> who lived about the Twenty firſt Century from the Creation: He by the abundant Grace of God beſtowed upon him, exceeded all, in thoſe two comprehenſive Graces, <hi>viz.</hi> a fixed <hi>Faith,</hi> and a filial <hi>Fear.</hi> In <hi>Faith,</hi> in that he readily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved all Gods Promiſes, which ſeem'd to have inſuperable difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the way of their accompliſhment; <hi>Who againſt hope believed in hope, and ſtaggered not at the Promiſe of God through unbelief; but was ſtrong in faith, giving Glory unto God,</hi> Rom. 4. 18, 19, 20. Hereupon that hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Title, <hi>the Father of the faithful,</hi> was given unto him.</p>
            <p>He had ſuch an awful fear of God, as that he ſtuck at nothing in
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001205_0003_0FB133C718654510"/>
order to a compliance with his revealed Will: as it appears in his ready ſubmitting himſelf to that Painful Ordinance of Circumciſion; he being then well nigh an hundred years old: in offering up his only begotten Son by <hi>Sarah</hi> as a Sacrifice; which is teſtifyed from Heaven by an Angel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 12. And alſo in leaving his Native Country, and Kindred, at the Command of God.</p>
            <p>This his Country was <hi>Ur</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> which lay between thoſe two great and noble Rivers <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tygris,</hi> therefore called in the Hebrew Tongue, <hi>Aram-Naharajim,</hi> or <hi>Padan-Aram:</hi> and in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> whereabouts was the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> or Paradiſe; as ſome Learned men judge. Though this Country was bleſſed with a fertile Soil; when God orders his removal, he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attends his pleaſure, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tu,</hi> Two things ſeem not unworthy of our conſideration; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Gods People are ſometimes called by Him, to remove from the places of their Nativity, into a Country afar off.</hi> This call of God is not now Immediate, as <hi>Abraham'</hi>s was: but Mediate; namely, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Live comfortably where they are, and have a plain proſpect of mending themſelves in another Land; as in this Chapter, it is related that <hi>Abraham</hi> went down into <hi>Egypt</hi> upon the account of the <hi>Famine</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> without any Immediate Command from God. So <hi>Lot</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved himſelf from <hi>Abraham;</hi> they not being able, by reaſon of the Multitude of their Cattel, to Live Peaceably together. Or when they cannot enjoy the Ordinances of God with Peace and Purity: this Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was the caſe of our Pious Predeceſſors, the firſt Planters of this Land: Many of which had fair Accommodations, and very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Eſtates; who yet for the Satisfaction of their Conſciences, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it far more eligible to turn their backs upon all the good things, in their own Native Country, and expoſe themſelves and their Families to great hazards, and difficulties, by Sea and Land; than to abide where they were. Surely, it was not to gain great Eſtates: but for the promotion of Religion, and the advancement of their own and their Poſterities Spiritual good, that was in their Eyes; which made them to come from a fruitful Land, into this <hi>Jeſhimon,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated Wilderneſs. And God was in a ſignal manner preſent with
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001205_0004_0FB133C8A3B795D0"/>
them, who obtained their deſired end, in the peaceable enjoyment of Gods Ordinances; and having all of them aſcended into thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Regions that are above, have left their Poſterity in poſſeſſion of the good things of Gods Houſe; which we yet through the bounty of our Merciful God, enjoy without moleſtation and rigorous Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
            <p>Will it not now be an hazardous attempt in any, to introduce that into our Congregations, which is diametrically oppoſite to the great end of our Worthy and Religious Fathers, in their coming over into this Wilderneſs? (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) Who did not ſeparate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as denying it to be a true Church; their departure from thence was an orderly Seceſſion, having the Countenance and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supreme Authority of our Nation. Therefore they did not deſerve to be Stigmatiz'd with that ill title of Schiſmaticks.</p>
            <p>But have we not cauſe to bewail the irreligious folly of many that have planted themſelves in ſuch remote corners of this Land, for the ſake of Worldly conveniencies, that they might live as Lambs in a large place; ſo as that they have not been capable of enjoying the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt, and by that means have ſeemed to bid defiance, not only to Religion, but to Civility it ſelf: and ſuch places thereby have become Nurſeries of Ignorance, Prophaneneſs and Atheiſm. But hath not God left upon them the marks of his ſore diſpleaſure? whereby many ſuch places are become ruinous heaps; upon which God hath in Righteouſneſs ſtretched the line of confuſion, and ſtones of emptineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing obſervable is: <hi>That complyance with the revealed. Will of God,</hi> is <hi>uſually followed with manifold Bleſſings.</hi> Theſe Words as they ſtand related and are tack'd to the firſt Verſe, plainly hold forth this Truth: there are none that do any Service for God, but they are rewarded for it. <hi>In keeping thy Commands there is great Reward,</hi> Pſal. 19. 11. This our Saviour with Solemnity declares, Luk. 18. 29, 30. <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, there is no man, that hath left Houſe or Parents or Brethren, or Wife or Children, for the Kingdom of Gods ſake, who ſhall not receive manifold more in this preſent time, and in the World to come Life Everlaſting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When men Serve and obey God, though not in a ſincere manner, yet they have not miſs'd of a reward from God: as <hi>Jehu,</hi> who at the Command of God deſtroyed the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and the Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of <hi>Baal,</hi> which he did with reſpect to his own Worldly Intereſt; yet his Poſterity, according to that promiſe of God, Sat upon the Throne of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the fourth Generation. And <hi>Nebuchadnezz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> did
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001205_0005_0FB133CA177D84F0"/>
Service for God in ruining the proud City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> where little Booty was found that might countervail his great pains and labour: He therefore gave him the rich and opulent Kingdom of <hi>Egypt;</hi> as it is fully expreſſed in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29. 17. <hi>ad finem.</hi> Then ſurely ſuch as obey God in an upright manner, they ſhall not miſs of a full Recompence. If we look back into the Old World we ſhall find two Perſons that did Eminent Service for God, <hi>viz. Enoch</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> who walkt with Him, and trod <hi>Antipodes</hi> to that licentious World, refuſing to run with them in the ſame exceſs of Riot. Thoſe were ſignally owned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded; the one was perſonally tranſlated into Heaven; and the other with his Family preſerved, when by that univerſal Deluge, the whole race of Mankind were ſwept away.</p>
            <p>Sometimes God confers Riches upon ſuch as obey him; as he did upon <hi>Abraham, David,</hi> and many others: and ſuch as have not much in the World, what little they have, is accompanyed with a Bleſſing, and their Spirits are well ſatisfyed with what they have. Indeed the ſhorteſt way to be rich, is not by enlarging our <hi>Eſtates;</hi> but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting our <hi>Deſires.</hi> Upon ſuch God beſtows <hi>Honour,</hi> as it is promiſed, 1 Sam. 2. 30. <hi>For them that honour me, I will honour.</hi> Prov. 3. 16. <hi>In her left hand are riches and honour.</hi> There is a ſilent Dignity in reproached Piety; and a ſilent Ignominy, in exalted Iniquity. <hi>Herod feared John knowing that he was a juſt man,</hi> Mark. 6. 20. Such alſo have Spiritual pleaſures having quietneſs and tranquillity of mind; that fear of God that paſſeth all underſtanding, keeps their hearts: This is a bleſſing that far ſurmounts all Earthly enjoyments. <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Habakkuk</hi> could ſit and ſing, when great troubles were ſurrounding them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. Theſe keep a conſtant Jubilee in their own boſomes.</p>
            <p>In a word Eternal Life will be the iſſue, and happy reſult of a right Obeying of God. This the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expected when about to bid Farewel to the World, 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8. <hi>I have fought a good fight</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is <hi>laid up for me a Crown of righteouſneſs.</hi> Yea, this is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>

                  </gap>e faithful to the Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</hi> And ſo Servants, that obey Chriſt in their places, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 24. How ſhould this excite all Perſons, eſpecially Superiours, to Obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God: they ſhould be ſtedfaſt, &amp; immoveable in ways of Well-doing, knowing that their labour will not be in vain; for God will not deny his Word; but will give a full accompliſhment to his promiſes. Godlineſs hath the promiſe of the Life that now is, and that which is to come: as we find it accompliſhed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the promiſes that he here makes to him in the words read.</p>

And is neceſſarily implied in this Promiſe of a numerous Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or making him a great Nation, as the Stars of Heaven, as the Duſt of the Earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 10. He engageth that he will beſtow upon him <hi>Spiritual</hi> Bleſſings. <hi>I will bleſs thee;</hi> that is <hi>Spiritually.</hi> He farther promiſeth to make him a great Name. <hi>Name</hi> in Scripture, hath a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acceptation; and ſo it denotes (1.) <hi>Dignity, viz.</hi> Riches, Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of Parts and Gifts, nobleneſs of Birth; ſo it may be taken in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 4. They were men of <hi>Renown,</hi> and as the Hebrew hath it, Men of <hi>NAME, Numb.</hi> 16. 2. (2.) <hi>Authority;</hi> So <hi>Name</hi> is frequently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Scripture, as in that form uſed in the Adminiſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 6. &amp; 4. 17. Theſe two are ſeparable; Perſons may be Honourable by virtue of their Birth, Breeding, and great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and yet deſtitute of Authority: Both theſe were beſtowed on <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was endowed with Riches, both internal and external. He had alſo great Authority, who was a Ruler over a vaſt and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Family; and the Sons of <hi>Heth</hi> call him Lord, and a very great Prince, which in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is expreſſed by the Name of God, a <hi>Prince of God;</hi> that ſtands in the room of the ſuperlative degree. And be ſure, his Poſterity, many of them, were Rulers and Kings, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have an expreſs <hi>Precept; Thou ſhalt be a Bleſſing:</hi> Or as it is in the Original, <hi>Be thou a Bleſſing:</hi> and ſo it is rendred by <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melius, Eſto Benedictioni;</hi> were it in the future tenſe as it is tranſlated, yet it may be lookt upon as a Command; for not only Negative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are ſet down in the future tenſe, as in the <hi>Decalogue;</hi> but alſo Affirmative, as in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. where in the Original, it is in the future tenſe; <hi>A Son ſhall honour his Father, Mal.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 2. compared with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> was to be a Bleſſing, not only in that he was to be the mediate Progenitor of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> in whom all the Nations of the Earth were to be bleſſed; but alſo he was to be a Bleſſing in his <hi>own</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by his Uſefulneſs to others, in the due improvement of the many temporal and ſpiritual bleſſings that in abundance God had beſtowed upon him. There is a great difference in being bleſſed in a <hi>paſſive,</hi> and being a Bleſſing in an <hi>active</hi> ſenſe. Many are <hi>bleſſed</hi> with Riches, excellent Gifts and Authority, but are not <hi>Bleſſings</hi> in their Places, but the contrary.</p>

The words read, with what precedes, may admit of this Paraphraſe: <hi>Abraham!</hi> 
               <q>I have exalted my ſelf to ſhew mercy to thee, by giving thee an effectual Call, whereby thou art brought nigh to me; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a remarkable diſtinction between thee and many others, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring upon thee my powerful Spirit, whereby thou art made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to become a follower of me.

            <p>Or, Such as God doth advance to places of Dignity and Authority; they are, in an eſpecial manner, by a faithful improvement of them, to promote the Good of others.</p>
            <p>There are three Aſſertions, which may be Prelimenary to what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; which are plainly legible in the Text; <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That GOD is the Author and Giver of every Bleſſing.</hi> As it is three times declared in the Words: He is the Father of Mercy; Every good and perfect gift comes down from God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17. Whatever Mercies are beſtowed upon us; we are to acknowledge them to be the free and gratuitous gifts of God; the many pleaſant ſtreams of Mercy that flow in upon us, and follow us; they come down from Heaven; all our freſh Springs are in God. He gives large meaſures of Wiſdom to ſome; whereby they are fitted to rule and govern others; and he exalteth men to high Places of Authority, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 6, 7. He ſets a Crown upon the heads of ſome, veſting them with Supreme Authority, to whom he gives a Spirit of Government, as he did to <hi>Saul</hi> &amp; <hi>David.</hi> To others he gives power to become Rich, making their Labours ſucceſsful: Hence we are to acknowledge God in all the Wayes of Mercy wherein he Walks towards us; rendering to him the Tribute of Praiſe; both Verbal, and

Some ride upon the High Places of the Earth, when others are paſſing through the dark Valley of the Shadow of Death. Thus God dealt with <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom he exalted above many others: This is a plain evidence of Gods Soveraign Wiſdom, and it is neceſſary for the upholding of Order amongſt men: Did all ſtand upon a Level, there could not poſſibly be any Order; for Order is, <hi>AEqualium inaequaliumque apta diſpoſitio;</hi> a fit diſpoſing of equal &amp; ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual; as gives to every thing and perſon their due and proper place.</p>

            <p>There are two Queries that call for an Anſwer, in order to the clearing up of this Truth before us.</p>
            <p>Queſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Who they are that may be ſaid to be Bleſſings, in the Improvement of the Signal Bleſſings of God beſtowed on them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. In general:</hi> All truly Sanctifyed Ones, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was; who having the Image of God fairly drawn upon them, are made partakers of the Divine Nature: who being called out of the World, do not faſhion themſelves to a complyance with the Evil Cuſtoms &amp; Immoralities that are abounding: but are tranſformed in their Minds ſo as rightly to <hi>Know,</hi> and ſincerely to <hi>Do</hi> the Holy Will of God: who labour to pleaſe God, and to walk worthy of his peculiar Grace beſtowed upon them. Theſe are Excellent Ones in whom God's Soul takes pleaſure; for whoſe ſake the World is upheld: Theſe are God's <hi>Jewels,</hi> whom he ſo regards, that as long as they are here in the World, he will not deſtroy it; but will Exerciſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to long Suffering; theſe are the <hi>Wheat,</hi> for the ſake of which the <hi>Tares</hi> are not pluckt up, and burnt. Theſe are the <hi>Pillars</hi> of the places where they Live. In a word, they are the <hi>Chariots</hi> and <hi>Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> that defend the World; who by their Faith and Prayer ſtand in the Gap, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, to prevent the irruption and breaking in of Divine Wrath; and keep the gracious preſence of God with them amongſt whom they Live: This is intimated to us by the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. <hi>ult. The holy Seed ſhall be the ſubſtance thereof.</hi> The Word rendred <hi>Subſtance,</hi> ſignifyes a <hi>Pillar,</hi> which is made uſe of to ſupport the building. Of this uſe, are Gods own People; who are called the holy Seed: Alſo that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 8. Where there is an alluſion to an Husbandman that eſpies ſome Grapes, which gives hopes of the recovery of the Vine; he then layes aſide thoughts of cutting it down: So the Saints of God are a Bleſſing; for whoſe ſake he will ſpare a People, and not utterly deſtroy them. It is often ſaid, that for <hi>David'</hi>s ſake he would continue the Kingdom of <hi>Judah.</hi> And we know, that for <hi>Paul's</hi> ſake, near three hundred Souls were Saved, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 24. Others, that are not truely gracious, being in high Places of Authority, may have their hearts ſo wrought upon by the powerful Spirit of God, as that they may be Uſeful and Serviceable. <hi>The Earth helped the Woman,</hi> Rev. 12. 16. that is, (as it is interpreted by ſome) great Rulers that had little or no Religion in them; for their own ends were helpful to the Church

of God. So <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> were very uſeful to the People of God in promoting their return to their own Land, and rebuilding of the Temple. Particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Such as are Religious, who ſet an high Value and Price upon the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Inſtitutions of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and are Willing to further and promote them.</hi> Such an one was <hi>Abraham,</hi> who, wherever he came, ſet up Altars unto God, to Worſhip him, and call upon his Name: The Word which is tranſlated <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> is a branch that Springs from the Hebrew root in <hi>KAL,</hi> which properly ſignifies to bow the Knee; which is that natural Ceremony which is uſed in the Worſhip of God, and is put for Praying to Him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 95. 6. by which the Saints obtain bleſſings. By this <hi>Abraham</hi> Saved <hi>Let</hi> from thoſe ſcorching flames that devoured the Inhabitants of the Plain.</p>
            <p>Thus were <hi>Joſiah</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> Bleſſings, who purged the Houſe of God, and took care that the Sabbaths were Sanctifyed, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned. Such as God, in his Wiſe Providence, doth advance to places of Authority, they become Bleſſings when they make it their principal care to promote and Set Up the Worſhip of God in their Dominions. Now the Power of Magiſtrates, relating to the Worſhip of God, is of an External nature; which lyes in taking care that duely Qualifyed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be ſent forth, and authorized to Preach the Word, and Adminiſter the Seals of the Covenant; that they be able to Feed the People of God with Knowledge and Underſtanding. In order thereunto they are to Endeavour that <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Colleges</hi> be Erected, whereby Perſons may be furniſhed with Learning, and ſo become <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, able to Teach: That People attend upon the Publick Worſhip of God: And Suitable Proviſion be made for the faithful Diſpenſers of the Goſpel, whereby they may be Encouraged in the right diſcharge of the Work incumbent on them. We ſhall find in the Sacred Hiſtory many Inſtances of Religious Kings and Rulers, who thus did, and were thereby great Bleſſings to their People. For it is evident, that where Religion, according to the Word of God, is ſet up and countenanced by Magiſtrates; there the Bleſſed God Dwells, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs many Bleſſings: For wherever God records his Name, there he will come and bleſs his People, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 24. But where the Worſhip of God is laid aſide; generally omitted, or greatly corrupted; there outward Bleſſings are removed; and ſore diſtreſſes come in their room: As it is expreſſed in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 3, 5.

Bleſſings to the Places where they live. This hath been the Happineſs of <hi>New-England</hi> from the beginning.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such as are Juſt and Righteous in all their Wayes and Actings.</hi> Thus was <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is ſtyled the <hi>Righteous Man,</hi> as ſome underſtand that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. 2.

Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſhould be to all men, eſpecially to Magiſtrates, the <hi>girdle of their loins, Iſa.</hi> 11. 5. Thus it was with <hi>Job, Chap.</hi> 31. 38, 39. Such ſhould be able to make ſuch a Challenge as <hi>Samuel</hi> did; <hi>Whoſe Ox have I taken?</hi> 1 Sam. 12. 3, 4. And to avouch with <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>they have corrupted, wronged and defrauded no man,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 2. When Rulers are careful to diſtribute Juſtice without Partiality; abhorring Bribes, which do <hi>blind the eyes of the Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>pervert the Judgment of the Righteous,</hi> as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 19. And having to do with Equals, in making Bargains and Contracts, which is called Cummutative Juſtice, they endeavour to keep a good Conſcience, willing in all things to Live Honeſtly; Such are Bleſſings, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was, who bore a ſevere Teſtimony againſt the Oppreſſion of the <hi>Jews, Chap.</hi> 5. They who conſtantly wear the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs; they honour the Chriſtian Religion. This is a neceſſary requiſite in a Magiſtrate, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 3. <hi>He that Ruleth over men muſt be juſt, Ruling in the fear of God.</hi> It is not enough that Magiſtrates ſee to the Obſervation of the firſt Table; that Religion flouriſhes; but alſo, that the Second-Table Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be performed; that Righteouſneſs be exalted, and have an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted paſſage; which is the moſt compendious way to draw down Heavens Bleſſings upon a People.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Such as give all diligence to perform their Relative Duties; and do not willingly ſtep out of their Places, or Omit what is required of them.</hi> Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> was a faithful Ruler over his numerous Family, inſtructing them in what did appertain to the honour of God, and their beſt good. This is teſtifyed of him by God himſelf: <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 19. <hi>I know that he will command his Children, and his Houſhold after him, that they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon</hi> Abraham <hi>that which he hath ſpoken of him.</hi> Thus was <hi>Joſeph,</hi> his great-grand-Son, who, as a <hi>Son,</hi> was a bleſſing to his Father: as a <hi>Servant,</hi> he was a bleſſing to <hi>Potiphar</hi> his Maſter, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 5, 6. <hi>God bleſſed the Egyptians houſe for Joſeph'</hi>s <hi>ſake;</hi> As a <hi>Priſoner,</hi> he was a bleſſing to the Jaylor, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. <hi>ult.</hi> And after his advancement by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as his <hi>Viceroy,</hi> he was a wonderful bleſſing to all the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt;</hi> as he was a <hi>Father</hi> to

               <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in ſeeking his honour, and maintaining his right: So he was a <hi>Father</hi> to the diſtreſſed <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and his own Relations.</p>
            <p>GOD, in his All-Wiſe Providence, doth fix all Perſons in this or that Relation; and of his condeſcending Grace, hath given an expreſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Will, how all ſhould act therein. Now while Perſons, whether Superiours or Inferiours, do act in their Places with Faithfulneſs, filling them up with Duty, they are bleſſings: and indeed this is needful to evince the truth and reality of their <hi>Piety</hi> towards God, and <hi>Love</hi> towards men. If we be not <hi>Relatively</hi> good, we have reaſon to queſtion whether we be <hi>Really</hi> good. The World would be a quier Habitation, did all mind their own proper Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and keep within the bounds and limits of their Places and Callings. There are none ſo Great Bleſſings in their Places as Magiſtrates and Miniſters, who are careful and conſcientious in the due diſcharge of their Duties. It is to be noted, that the neglect of Duty in one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, will not give a diſcharge to the Correlate, to omit the doing of his Duty; as it is evident in that of a Maſter and Servant: Tho' the Servant hath a cruel and crabbed Maſter; yet he ought to attend the performance of his own proper Duty, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>Servants be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to your Maſters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward,</hi> &amp;c. Hereby the ſincerity and ſtrength of Grace will be made manifeſt. Should Magiſtrates be ſomewhat defective in their places; yet that will not countenance Subjects to neglect their Duties.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Such as are of a Quiet and Peaceable Spirit, who labour to keep Amity and Unity in Societies.</hi> Such an one was <hi>Abraham,</hi> who ſhew'd it in his fair &amp; amicable propoſals that he made to <hi>Lot</hi> his Nephew; who tho' he was his Superiour, yet was willing for peace ſake, to recede from his own right, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 8. Such as have a tender regard to the peace and unity of a Society, and abhor to do any thing that may hazard it; they are Bleſſings where they live: as ſuch are bleſſed in the account of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers;</hi> ſo they are undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly Bleſſings: Theſe do prevent a world of evil, and make way for much good. Contention is a great and voluminous Evil, exceeding baneful and deſtructive to the ſpiritual and temporal weal of Perſons and Societies: Such therefore as prevent, and extinguiſh it when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, they are happy ones; who are like unto the Bleſſed GOD, who is the Author and Lover of Peace. Such may be ſaid to be good, and do good. <hi>When our Officers are peace, and our Exactors righteouſneſs,</hi> as it is Propheſied that there ſhall be ſuch in Goſpel days, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 17. When they are <hi>healers of breaches, and reſtorers of paths to dwell in;</hi> then ſuch are Eminent Bleſſings.</p>

5. <hi>Such as are of a Publick frame of Spirit, who are ſtudiouſly careful to do what lies within the compaſs of their power, for the furtherance of the good of Others.</hi> Thus was <hi>Abraham,</hi> who with importunity did intercede for the <hi>Sodomites;</hi> who alſo did expoſe himſelf and his many Servants to danger, that he might reſcue <hi>Lot</hi> out of the hands of his Enemies. Such as are ready to ſacrifice their Eſtates, and lay themſelves open to great difficulties and dangers for the promotion of the good of others; they deſerve to be owned as great Bleſſings. Such an one was <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> who denied himſelf, laid aſide his eaſe, turn'd his back upon the pleaſures of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court, &amp; was willing to engage with manifold difficulties, in travelling from <hi>Shuſhan</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which was Nine hundred miles. All this he did to advance the good of his Afflicted Brethren in <hi>Judea. Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewed themſelves to be endued with a publick frame of Spirit in thoſe hyperbolical imprecations of theirs upon themſelves, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 32. <hi>Forgive their ſin; if not, blot me out of thy Book:</hi> Rom. 9. 3. <hi>I could wiſh my ſelf accurſed from Chriſt, for my Brethren.</hi> It is uſually ſaid, <hi>No man is born for himſelf:</hi> God hath ſo ordered all Creatures, that they have a dependance each upon other, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 21. 22. The Sun and Fountains they conſtantly teach men a Leſſon of Self-denial &amp; publick Spiritedneſs; the one is ſending <hi>down</hi> its warm and fructifying beams; the other is ſending <hi>up</hi> its ſweet and refreſhing ſtreams. Surely ſuch as Divine Providence hath fixed in publick Stations, they are to have hearts proportionated thereunto. Thoſe Excellent Perſons that were the firſt Beginners of theſe Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were endued with largeneſs of heart to promote the Weal of this whole People: The <hi>College</hi> which hath been of abundant uſe to this whole Land, is a ſtanding Monument of it. Had not the Firſt Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters been men of a Noble and generous Spirit, ſeeking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and the good of the whole; we had never arrived to that growth and maturity that we are at this time. It will be the honour of ſuch that ſucceed them in Dignities and Authority, to tread in their footſteps; whereby they will become great Bleſſings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> The other Query is, <hi>Why thoſe that are ſignally bleſſed, are to be Bleſſings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe this is to anſwer the end and deſign of God in the beſtowal of his Bleſſings: which is, that men may be put into a better capacity of doing good, than others are. The more good God beſtows
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001205_0014_0FB133D988973BE8"/>
upon any, the more Service to his Name he looks for from ſuch. As for thoſe that are by God called into Places of Authority over others, from ſuch he looks for great Diligence in order to the furtherance of the good of others; as it is expreſſed in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>He is the Miniſter of God for good.</hi> People are not made for <hi>Rulers,</hi> but <hi>Rulers</hi> are ſet up for the ſake and good of <hi>People.</hi> Whether in caſe of mans perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in that ſtate of integrity in which he was firſt made, there had been need of Magiſtrates to Govern men, is not ſo eaſily determined; tho' Order then as preſcribed in the Fifth Command, would have been obſerved. But now there is an apparent neceſſity of Magiſtrates, partly to reſtrain men from thoſe exorbitant motions that their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſts would unavoidably inſtigate them unto: and partly to provoke them to the doing thoſe duties, that the Law of God, and light of nature dictate ought to be done. So that the End of God in furniſhing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with intellectual abilities, and cloathing them with Authority, whereby they are called to the exerciſe of them; is to promote the weal and benefit of others. This is expreſſed by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. where people are required to pray for Magiſtrates, Supream and Subordinate, that their Councels and Purpoſes may be ſo diſpoſed by God, that under them we may live a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty; whereby it is plainly intimated, that the advancement of perſons into Places of Authority, is intended by God for the ſpiritual and temporal weal of People and Societies. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for ſuch as are ſet over others, to uſe their power for the hurt and oppreſſion of ſuch as are under them, is a plain perverting of the end of God in the beſtowal of thoſe Bleſſings upon them. Hence for the preventing of this, God hath given Rules in his Word to people that have liberty of Chuſing their Magiſtrates, to direct them in Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as are rightly qualifyed, who will ſtudy to promote their good, and will abhor to do any thing that is inconſiſtent with their weal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe this doth directly tend to the Glorifying of God.</hi> When per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſtand higher than others, are careful to make a right uſe of thoſe advantages that God puts into their hands, they become very ſerviceable to the Name and Honour of God: Thoſe by their well-ordered Converſation do greatly encourage others to an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them: For the Examples of ſuch are very influential upon others. Such will practically rebuke others that are ſcandalous in their actions; and they will be afraid to do thoſe things that are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Laws of God, and juſt Laws of men; as the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001205_0015_0FB133DB30898D68"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3. <hi>Rulers are a Terror to evil works.</hi> But then when God in great anger doth ſuffer Evil Perſons to bear Rule; there follows upon it an overflow of Wickedneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. <hi>ult. The Wicked walk on every ſide, when the vileſt men are exalted.</hi> As it is moſt evident in the Hiſtory of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah:</hi> Then the Name and Honour of God is laid in the Duſt, his Ordinances ſpurned at, and the Faithful Diſpenſers thereof contumeliouſly treated: which made way for the utter overthrow and captivity of the <hi>Jews</hi> by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> as it is expreſſed, in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>This Truth Treated of preſents before us,</p>
            <p>I. Matter of <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Heart-grief,</hi> in that there be ſo many found in the midſt of us, that are not Bleſſings in their Places: Who tho' they be not cloathed with Authority, either Political, or Eccleſiaſtical, yet being Endowed with intellectual abilities and many outward Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, do greatly abuſe them, whereby they become Curſes &amp; Plagues to the Places where they Live! Are there not with us Contentious Perſons? Who like the <hi>Salamander,</hi> Love to Live in the Fire and Flames of Contention: Who caſt Fire-brands into Families, and Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties; and improve their wit and intereſt to foment &amp; continue them; who puſh men on to Law Suits, by means of whoſe evil counſels not a few have been undone: By means of ſuch litigious perſons, who are fill'd with pride and prejudice, whole Societies are ſometimes put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a flaming poſture; ſuch are an abomination unto God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 16, 19. Among ſuch as are hateful to God, are ſuch as Sow ſtrife among Brethren: Such muſt needs be grievous burdens unto men, when they are ſo loathſome unto God. With us are ſuch as are very Unjuſt, who boggle at no Unrighteouſneſs, ſo as they can get out of the reach of mans Law: by means of ſuch we are under an ill character abroad in the World. Such wickedneſs of this kind is hardly found in places that want the light that hath ſo plentifully ſhin'd upon us. This Sin of Unrighteouſneſs, where it hath abounded, it hath made very fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſolating Judgments upon Gods viſible People. In the ſeveral Indictments that are drawn by Gods Prophets againſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Jews:</hi> We ſhall find that this Sin of Unrighteouſneſs was a principal Article. Tho' God doth uſually bear witneſs in his Providence againſt men for their injurious and cheating practices, by blaſting thoſe Eſtates, that by fraud, extortion and oppreſſion have been rak'd together, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 11. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 6. Yet ſuch is mens great love to the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001205_0016_0FB133DDE21DD360"/>
               <hi>World,</hi> and little fear of God, that they will deal Unrighteouſly. With us are ſuch as commit Lewdneſs, and are reſigning up themſelves to their Senſual Luſts; who ſpend much of their precious <hi>Time;</hi> and not a little of their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> in Publick Houſes; transforming themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to beaſts: Who <hi>Live in Chambering and Wantonneſs, in Rioting and Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs;</hi> who act as tho' they were ſent into the World for no other end, than to gratify their brutiſh Luſts. It is pity that any Heatheniſh Cuſtom ſhould be imitated by the People of God, that directly tends to the furtherance of Intemperance. With us are thoſe that profane Gods Holy Sabbaths. Tho' theſe and other Scandalous Evils have been born Witneſs againſt from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne once and again; yet how do they prevail, and threaten the overthrow of Religion! Some may wonder that ſo many in this Land of Light, and means of Grace, ſhould arrive to ſuch an height of Wickedneſs. This certainly proceeds either from the nature of ſome of theſe Sins, which naturally tend to beget a Stupefaction of the Mind and Conſcience, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Whoredom, and Wine, and new Wine take away the heart:</hi> Or from Gods Righteous Judgment in giving men up to their own hearts Luſts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 11, 12. <hi>Iſrael would have none of me, ſo I gave them up to their own hearts Luſts.</hi> And we know that the richeſt Soil produceth the rankeſt Weeds. This Land was at firſt Sown with excellent Seed, they were a choſen Generation, a peculiar People zealous of good Works: God planted here a Noble Vine; but how are we turned into the degenerate Plant of a ſtrange Vine? How many are there among us that may juſtly be accounted Burdens and <hi>Plague</hi> Sores? Surely the reiterated Judgments of God upon us do give in full Evidence to this ſad Truth: Theſe Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Scripture bear the ignominious name of <hi>Fools,</hi> and <hi>Mad-men;</hi> who are not only miſchievous and hurtful to themſelves, but alſo to all that are round about them.</p>
            <p>II. This Truth preſents us with matter of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> in that there are yet with us that are truly and properly Bleſſings in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places and Capacities: For whoſe Sake we may hope that after the Righteous God hath in Mercy chaſtened us, for our revoltings from, and decayes of Love to Himſelf, and his Ordinances; and thereby brought us to a true ſenſe of our Sins, and thereby wrought in us a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere purpoſe to amend our Evils: He will Save us, and make us a Praiſe and Glory. With us are many Pious Ones, who are glorious within; being adorned with the Graces of Gods Holy Spirit, who are endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001205_0017_0FB133DFC9FE9FD0"/>
to Walk with, &amp; act for God, in their reſpective Capacities; Striv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all things to pleaſe their Heavenly Father, and to Walk Worthy of him, who hath Called them to his Kingdom &amp; Glory. I believe there are as many real Saints in this Land, as in any Land or Nation in the World, for the quantity of People. And that which is to be minded, is, That our Magiſtrates and Miniſters are Pious &amp; Religious, who are Seekers of God, and do ſedulouſly ſet themſelves to promote the Spiritual, as well as the Temporal Weal of Gods People in this Wilderneſs. We have yet many Praying <hi>Abrahams, Nehemiahs, Elijahs</hi> and <hi>Jeremiahs,</hi> that are pleading with God, and Crying with Tears, ſaying to God, O ſpare thy People, and give not thy Heritage to become a prey to the Heathens! We read of Gods readineſs to ſpare <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> if there were but ten Righteous Perſons among them: and are there not among us more than an hundred times Ten? Yea, we find God ready to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his People, if they could but find a <hi>Man, Jer.</hi> 5. 1. That is, a faithful and zealous <hi>Magiſtrate:</hi> and are there not many ſuch with us? Who deſire to <hi>do Juſtly, ſhew Mercy, and walk humbly with their God:</hi> Who tho' they may be defective (and who is not?) yet are endeavouring to Rule and Direct this People, over whom they are Set, according to the Integrity of their hearts, and Skilfulneſs of their hands. Yea, are there not ſeveral Well-qualifyed Perſons with us, who are prepared in a good meaſure to act in the Place of Magiſtracy, and Miniſtry? If we take meaſure by Gods acting with his own People of old: We may foſter and maintain Hopes within us, that God will not as yet reject us, nor Write a <hi>Loammi</hi> upon us. Tho' it is true that in Goſpel times God may juſtly make quicker Work now with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>m, than he did upon his People heretofore; in regard of the greater plenty of Light, that hath ſhined upon, and Love that hath been ſhown to us. I would not venture to ſay any thing of this nature, to lull any aſleep in a Secure and Sinful State. Let us therefore know, We that have received more Mercies, and have enjoyed greater Privileges than others; if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in an Unbelieving and Impenitent State; We ſhall be liable to bear and ſuffer greater meaſures of Woe &amp; Wrath, than others, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 2. <hi>You only have I known of all the Families of the Earth, therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities.</hi> Our greater exaltation to <hi>Heaven</hi> will make way for our great depreſſion in <hi>Hell, Mat.</hi> 11. 23.

            <p>Let me with much Reſpect and deep Humility addreſs your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency: Much Honoured SIR, The Unerring Hand of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath Set you on High, making you the Head &amp; Chief Ruler, under our Gracious Sovereign, of the People of this Province; Placing you in the Seat of Juſtice and Chair of Honour: whereby you are in a Capacity of being a Rich Bleſſing to this People of God. 'Tis to be hoped that the Senſe of Gods great goodneſs in your Exaltation to ſo High a pitch of Honour and Authority; together with the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of His ſignal Mercy in effecting Salvation from great and immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Dangers heretofore; and eſpecially of Late; (upon the account of which we have abundant reaſon to give Thanks to God) will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence your Heart into a Willingneſs to improve your admirable Accompliſhments for the furtherance of the Welfare and Safety of this People, over whom you are made Chief Ruler; by Encouraging ſuch as are Religious; and diſcouraging ſuch as are Profane and Vitious; Rewarding the One, and Puniſhing the Other. Doubtleſs, when <hi>Moſes</hi> that Renowned Ruler of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had made a Serious reflection upon the peculiar Mercy of God in preſerving his Life, that was in eminent danger by means of that cruel Edict of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> as alſo Gods remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring him when Swimming on the River in a little Canoo made of Bulruſhes; putting him into a near Relation to the King of <hi>Egypts</hi> Daughter, whereby he had a liberal Education in the Court of <hi>Pharaoh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> all this wrought his heart into a forwardneſs to lay out himſelf for the Honour of God, and the good of his own afflicted People. Honoured SIR, You have had very fair Copies heretofore in thoſe that have been Governours of this People, preſented before you (from One of which, who was Eminent for Parts and Piety you have immediately deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) after which, if by the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, you endeavour to Write; You will be, as they were, a ſignal Bleſſing to this People; by which you will confute the Jealouſies and Cenſures of ſome; and anſwer the Hopes and Expectations of others: and ſo a Bleſſing will come down upon you, and yours.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe Honoured Perſons that are concerned in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the People in this Province; <hi>viz.</hi> The Honoured Deputy Governour, and the Counſellors, that may be Choſen this Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Honoured SIRS, You are called to Sit with his Excellency at the Helm, to guide and order the affairs of this Province, in a Stormy and Tempeſtuous time: therefore you have need of much Prudence and Patience, that you may act aright in order to the promotion of the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001205_0019_0FB133E224BF9BA8"/>
Welfare &amp; Safety of this People. That one Title, which is Superiour to all others; <hi>viz.</hi> that you are <hi>Gods, Pſal.</hi> 82. 6. that intimates to you that you are to be Bleſſings. That Title <hi>Elohim</hi> is the firſt of thoſe <hi>Hebrew</hi> Names, that are given to GOD, which we find in the firſt line of the Bible: Who having by His infinite perfections Erected this Stately Edifice of the World, and furniſhed every Room thereof with variety of Creatures, hath an abſolute &amp; Underived Authority to Rule and Govern all Things. This Name and honourable Title He hath fixed upon you whereby He tells you that your Power is derived from Him, and that as He hath ſet you above many; ſo you are to imitate Him in Goodneſs and Uſefulneſs; that by the ſweet and benign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of your Authority you become Inſtruments in furthering the Good and Benefit of all ſuch as are under you, by a due and right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of the Affairs of this People of God, and that you in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner ſhew it in advancing Religion and Godlineſs, taking care that the Houſe of God be not forſaken, and his holy Sabbaths be not prophaned. About thoſe, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> that Pious Ruler acted with an holy Zeal, as we may ſee in that Book which bears his Name.</p>
            <p>It concerns thoſe worthy Gentlemen, the Repreſentatives of this Province, to be very carefull in putting in their Suffrages for Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, that they be Perſons duly Qualified, who may give grounded Hopes that they will in all things act ſo, as that they may be Bleſſings to this People of GOD: and that they readily concur in making ſuch Acts and Laws, as apparently tend to the Furtherance of Piety, and Equity. If it might not be accounted too much boldneſs, I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe One thing to ſuch as have the power of Legiſlation: Whether it be not needful that there be ſomething Enacted to quicken under Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, as <hi>Tything-men, Conſtables, and Grand-Iurors,</hi> to a more Vigorous accompliſhment of thoſe Promiſory Oaths that Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they take, in the Suppreſſing of Intemperance and Diſorders, that ſeem to be growing among us.

            <p>

It is moſt certain, that the Miniſtry is a Signal Bleſſing, and one of thoſe Royal Gifts which our Exalted Lord Jeſus gave to his Church, when he Rode in Triumph into Heaven; as is evident by what we find in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 10, 11. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 20, 21. Hereupon we are bound to give a plain and faithful Declaration of the whole Counſel of God, ſo far as we are able: That ſolemn charge which is uſually given to Miniſters at their Inſtallment into this Sacred Office of the Miniſtry, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2. ought frequently to be minded by us. And it ſhould be our great care to maintain the honour of Goſpel Truths which we publiſh; by an unſtained and unſpotted Converſation. We are not only <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> to walk aright, tranſcribing the Laws of the Goſpel in our lives and actions. Such as did bear the Veſſels of the Sanctuary, were to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a peculiar manner; the Prieſts were to be void of bodily defects, they were to have their <hi>Urim</hi> &amp; <hi>Thummim;</hi> as alſo a Bell and Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate: the meaning of which we are not ignorant of. If our <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> do not correſpond with our <hi>Inſtructions</hi> and <hi>Reprehenſions;</hi> they will be in a great meaſure inſignificant. We ſhall pull down with one hand, what we build up with the other. We are by the <hi>Purity</hi> of our Doctrine, and <hi>Piety</hi> of our lives, to endeavour to win men to Chriſt, and to bring them out of love with their evil wayes; in a liking of the good Wayes of God, and ſo we ſhall ſave our ſelves, and thoſe that hear us. In a word, the Honour of the bleſſed God, the Welfare of mens Souls, and our own Peace in a Dying Hour, are arguments very cogent to provoke as all to a faithful diſcharge of the Duties of our Places. One thing I would propoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That we all endeavour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Unity in our <hi>Affections,</hi> and ſo far as we can, in our <hi>Apprehenſions.</hi> It is a good rule delivered by ſome: <hi>In neceſſariis Unitas, in non neceſſariis Libertas, in utriſque Charitas.</hi> We are all well agreed as to Fundamentals of Doctrine and Order; we ſhould therefore exerciſe Charity towards ſuch as may differ from us in matters that are not ſo plainly revealed in the Word about Church-Diſcipline, and may be lookt upon as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a prudential nature; forbearing to brand ſuch as differ from us, and do not ſo fully concur with ſuch things as have been practiſed, with the ill Titles of Apoſtates, and Subverters of the Order of the Goſpel.</p>

I ſhall conclude with a few words to all: Let us all act ſo as we may be in our reſpective places Bleſſings; In order thereunto,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us become the true and ſincere Servants of God, reſolving to Obey, and be Subject to him in all things.</hi> It is our honour, and it will be our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to be able to ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> that we are the Servants of God, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in all things to glorifie his name, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 23.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let us be Thankful for the many Privileges and peculiar Mercies that we are at preſent poſſeſſed with.</hi> Tho' it may not be ſo well with us as it hath been; yet be ſure it is far better with us than it is with many others. That we have our Titles to our Houſes and Lands confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, ſo as that we need not fear a Writ of Ejectment to be Served upon us, for want of a Patent: That we have a Government ſet over us, is a mercy to be minded: <hi>Tyranny</hi> is accounted more eligible than <hi>Anarchy.</hi> Without Government and Magiſtracy the World would be as one ſtyles it, <hi>Magnum Latrocinium, q. d.</hi> a great Den of Thieves and Robbers: <hi>Might would bear down Right.</hi> Men, like Dogs, would try their titles with their teeth; and all difference between <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> would be aboliſhed. But that which challengeth our thankfulneſs is, that we are Governed by Religious Magiſtrates, who reckon it to be their Duty to be at all times, <hi>Utriuſque tabulae Cuſtodes,</hi> by means of which the wayes to our Solemn Aſſemblies do not mourn; and ſo we are a bleſſed People, in that we hear and know the joyful Sound, and may with joy draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation, walking in the light of Gods Countenance, and may expect alſo to have redreſs of wrongs and injuries done unto us. Unſenſibleneſs of Gods Mercies, and our unthankfulneſs for them, is one of our provoking Evils; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we may obtain Bleſſings from God, &amp; a removal of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; let us, every one of us ſet the Crown of Praiſe upon Gods Head, and be inwardly affected with his peculiar favours beſtowed on us. Let us be Prayerful; all ſuch have been Bleſſings in their places, as <hi>Moſes, David</hi> were, who frequently with fervency were applying themſelves by Prayer unto God for all manner of Mercies ſuitable and needful for themſelves and others. The calamitous nature of the time doth require of us the performance of this Duty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 15.

as is evident in <hi>Jacob, David,</hi> and others. Prayer rightly performed, hath a kind of Omnipotency in it; as <hi>Moſes, Elijah</hi> and others their Prayers had. This is that Golden Key, which being oyled with Tears, and turn'd with the hand of Faith, will unlock the Cabinet of the Promiſes, and thereby many Bleſſings will be flowing in upon us: And in an eſpecial manner, let us Pray for our Rulers, as it is plainly required without any exception or limitation: This Command was given when <hi>Nero</hi> that monſter of men for wickedneſs, was Emperor, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. Would we have our Magiſtrates to be Bleſſings: Let us ſtrive with God in our Prayers for them. The hearts of Kings and Rulers are in the Hand of God, who can diſpoſe all their purpoſes and councels, ſo as that they ſhall conduce to, and iſſue in the Good and Weal of his People. Did People turn their malicious <hi>Prating</hi> againſt Magiſtrates and Miniſters, into ardent <hi>Praying</hi> for them, they would both honour themſelves, and the Name of God, call'd upon them.</p>
            <p>Let us ſtand clear from raſh Judging and Cenſuring our Rulers. Certain it is, that People are not competent judges of the actions of Magiſtrates: it is a uſual ſaying, that there are <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of State, to the bottom of which, People are not able to dive.</p>
            <p>Let us not entertain groundleſs Jealouſies of our Rulers. This hath put People ſometimes into an unquiet, yea, into a rebellious Poſture; and at no time they prevail ſo much as when diſtreſs and hardſhips have been predominant: as we find it in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>They ſhall paſs through it, hardly beſtead and hungry,</hi>—<hi>they ſhall fret themſelves, and Curſe their King, &amp; their God.</hi> We have inſtances of this in Scripture, as of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Exod.</hi> 14. 11, 12. whom the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ready to Stone, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtorian ſaith, but his <hi>Meckneſs</hi> overcame their <hi>Madneſs.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> was in great hazard of his Life when he came to <hi>Ziklag,</hi> 1 Sam. 30. 6. <hi>The People were greatly diſtreſſed, and they ſpake of Stoning of him.</hi> We ſhould root out all hard thoughts of our Rulers; Endeavouring that our hearts be filled with Love to them: thereby we ſhall conſtrue all their actions in the beſt ſenſe; and ſo live a quiet and peaceable Life under them.</p>
            <p>Let People account it their Duty to Contribute to the Comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; Honourable Support of their Rulers: This is expreſsly required, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7. Our Saviour exemplifyed this Command in his own Practice: who wrought a Miracle that he might have Money to pay Tribute, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 21. which he did partly to prevent Offence, and partly to ſee an Example to all Chriſtians in after Generations. The height and dignity of their Places calls for it, for God allows his Vicegerents, <hi>viz.</hi>

The Chief Magiſtrates to Live at an higher rate than others, that ſo they may maintain the Honour of their Places. Their Fare, their Rayment, their Buildings, are to tranſcend others. 'Tis to be hop'd that our Honoured Rulers have a Senſe of the Low Eſtate of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of this People.</p>
            <p>Let us fill up our Lives and Places with Duty: be like our Saviour, who went up and down doing Good. Let us put on bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and be communicating to ſuch as are in neceſſity, and ſtrive to help Sinners out of their Sinful Wayes, hereby we ſhall be bleſſings.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, Let us all endeavour to amend what is, and hath been amiſs, unfeignedly returning unto God. As one Sinner deſtroys much good, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. <hi>ult.</hi> So many Repenting and Reforming Sinners may procure much good: whereby we ſhall be Bleſſings in our Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. God hath ſignalized his Mercy, not only in making many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of much good to Penitents, but he hath alſo accompliſhed them unto ſuch; as he did to the <hi>Iſraelites, Judg.</hi> 10. 15, 16. Let us ſay with the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>Let us ſearch and try our wayes, and turn unto the Lord;</hi> And with them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 1, 2. <hi>Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us: he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up. After two dayes will he revive us, in the third day he will raiſe us up, and we ſhall live in his ſight.</hi> Thereupon we may expect that God will be with us, as he was with our Fathers; He will not leave or forſake us. And in theſe perilous and burdenſome times, the Eternal God will be our Refuge, and underneath us will be his Everlaſting Arms. <hi>Unto Him be Glory in the Church by CHRIST JESUS, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Ages, World without End.</hi>
