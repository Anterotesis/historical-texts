            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>EUGENIUS</hi> AND <hi>SELIMA.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>A GENTLEMAN of fortune in this metropolis, (whom it will not be improper to diſtinguiſh by the name of Moroſus) ſent his only ſon, Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, to the Univerſity;—there to finiſh his ſtudies under the care of a tutor.</p>
            <p>The fortune and engaging carriage of this young gentleman rendered him an agreeable gueſt to all the polite &amp; gay aſſemblies of the place, &amp; his ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and vivacity a welcome viſitor of the houſes of the more private perſons of faſhion.</p>
            <p>Being one night at a card party at Mrs. R—'s, he was introduced to Mrs. C—, and her beautiful daughter Selima. Eugenius was ſtruck at firſt ſight with the charms of this young lady, and felt a pleaſing ſenſation in contemplating her perfections. Mrs. R—, obſerving his embarraſſment, took him by the hand, and preſented him to the lady and her daughter. "I introduce to you," ſaid ſhe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing herſelf to the latter, "a young gentleman who has long wiſhed for the pleaſure of being in your company." "Madam," ſaid he, bowing and emboldened by what Mrs. R— had ſaid, "'tis not alone to be in your company that I deſire; I beg leave to be permitted to increaſe the number of your admirers." He now pauſed, but perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ladies had left them together, he was reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his diſcourſe, when ſhe interrupted him. "You confound me, ſir," ſaid ſhe, "as I am ſenſible I am unworthy ſuch flattering compliments." Here Mrs. R— and her friend entered, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe turning on different ſubjects, till the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny encreaſed, they ſat down to cards, leaving Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius abſorbed in thought.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>Love now began to make powerful inroads in his heart, Selima ſat oppoſite him during the evening, and the more he beheld her the more his paſſion augmentened; but he feared his addreſſes were fruitleſs, as ſhe did not once deign him a tender look. Love, however, had, in reality made as powerful and rapid a progreſs in her heart as in his, though modeſty taught her to diſguiſe it.</p>
            <p>The evening paſſed principally at cards—Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius indeed found nothing to croſs his deſires, yet it is conſequent to love to be attended with inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etude;—he longed for another opportunity of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her; but at that time it was impracticable, as ſhe and her mother withdrew at a very early hour. Before he departed, he paid his compliments to Mrs. R—, who aſked him how he had liked his evening's entertainment. He replied, he was perfectly happy in the ſociety of ſuch agreeable perſons, and hoped for the renewing of that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the next evening.</p>
            <p>Eugenius waited with impatience the expected moment which ſhould again bring him into the preſence of the dear object of his affections, in which interview he reſolved to come to an expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;—but imagine his diſappointment when the time arrived, and he was informed, indiſpoſition prevented, her mother, and which neceſſarily hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her being there. His conjecture was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, that it was merely an excuſe, and their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was purpoſely calculated to deter his further purſuit. The idea was ſufficient to make him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, and he now began to ruminate upon the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of his miſtake in having regarded the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant reſpect ſhe had ſhewn him, as a mark of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was, he now thought in reality only the ſimple effects of politeneſs. He left Mrs. R—'s that evening with leſs ſatisfaction, as may natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033700_0004_0FF8FB189FDB5988"/>
be ſuppoſed, than he had done the proceeding.</p>
            <p>After having paſſed a reſtleſs night, next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he paid a viſit to Mrs. R—: that lady right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judged the cauſe to which ſhe was indebted for the honour of this his early viſit, and to remove his ſuſpicions, aſſured him he had been deprived of Mrs. C— and her daughter's company, ſolely by the indiſpoſition of the former. Luckily, during their converſation, the ladies entered. After they had paid their congratulations to Mrs. C—, on her reſtoration to health, and other uſual compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had paſſed, Mrs. R— took the mother by the hand and withdrew into another room in order to give Eugenius an opportunity of diſcovering his ſentiments to Selima: nor did he fail of making uſe of the preſent advantageous moment. "Madam," ſaid he, taking her tenderly by the hand, "this is the firſt time I have had the pleaſure of being alone with you; permit me, now I enjoy that opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to inform you the impreſſion your charms made on me the firſt time I had the honour of ſeeing you, and believe me, my dear Selima, that if ever paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was fervent and true, mine is ſo;—and, knew you the unhappineſs I endured the ſhort time I was deprived of your company, it would be ſufficient to give you a clear proof of the truth of what I have ſaid, and of the ſincerity of my affection.— Such, my dear Selima is the declimation of my heart; I ſcorn deceit;—ſpeak then, my lovely girl, determine with a ſmile, my happineſs; or fix with a frown my eternal miſery." "Ah ſir," returned ſhe, "could I think what you have ſaid to be true, and that it is I who have cauſed the tender unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in you, you fain would have me believe; I ſhould reflect on it with pleaſure; but ſhould I liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to your purſuaſive words, I fear I ſhould be drawn to imbibe a tenderneſs which might hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033700_0005_0FF8FB37378AC3E8"/>
prove difficult to baniſh. Yet this, in juſtice I muſt ſay, among the fine ſpeeches I have had ſaid to me on this ſubject, yours ſeem to wear moſt the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſimple ſincerity. I ſhould hope, ſir, that what I have already ſaid, will be ſufficient to make known to you my ſentiments on what you have juſt now ſaid."</p>
            <p>The happineſs which theſe few words of Selima conferred on Eugenius, can only be conceived by thoſe who have been in a ſimilar ſituation. But her mother and Mrs. R—, now entering, no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſe paſſed. It may be ſuppoſed he was eaſily prevailed on to ſtay dinner; and in the evening more company coming, they ſat down to quadrille. He had again an opportunity of converſing with Selima, ſhe having declined playing. "Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, Selima," ſaid he, "that ſuch a reſerved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference ſhould be thought a recompence worthy the love you muſt be convinced I entertain for you. I fear ſome more happy rival occaſions this behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour to me; be engenious and eaſy my troubled ſoul, for it were death to continue in that torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſituation, which your treatment has reduced me." "You are miſtaken, ſir, I aſſure you," replied ſhe, "and inſenſible of the feelings my heart but too freely indulges in your behalf;—your behaviour charms me, and I confeſs, what modeſty ought to have obliged me to conceal, that your tenderneſs has affected me much; but whilſt you are thus earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoliciting to know what my ſentiments are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you; permit me to require you to return me the ſincereſt proof of your regard by endeavouring to make your parent &amp; mine approve of it, and then you will find I ſhall not be averſe to your wiſhes."</p>
            <p>She uttered this with the moſt enchanting ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and innocent ſimplicity. He promiſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his father immediately; and they ſpent the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033700_0006_0FF8C23B34B47268"/>
remainder of the evening in aſſuring each other of a mutual tenderneſs and affection; and when the company ſeparated, he departed perfectly ſatisfied with the aſſurances ſhe had given him of her love, and not doubting but his father would conſent to their union, as he could have no reaſonable objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to her perſon, nor to her fortune, ſince it was equal if not ſuperior to his own.</p>
            <p>The viſible happineſs in his countenance was quickly perceived by his tutor, who enquired the reaſon. Eugenius thinking he might be of ſervice to him in interceding with his father did not heſitate to tell him the cauſe, nor did he conceal in the leaſt the purport of his laſt converſation with Selima. "Sir," ſaid his tutor, "you have, I fear, engaged in an affair that will be the cauſe of laſting unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to you, and that amiable young lady. Not that love itſelf is to be condemned; no! far from it; it is the ſureſt mark of a great and noble ſoul; but you ſhould not indulge yourſelf in it too precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately—for, continued he, no one can tell but that your father may have fixed on a lady for your wife, and, nevertheleſs whatever we may think, parents know, or at leaſt ought to know better what is to the advantage of their children, than they themſelves. Your father gave me particular orders not to ſuffer you to make any engagement without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and ſhould I fulfil my truſt, did I not give him the earlieſt account of this tranſaction? which, excuſe me if I ſay I know it will be contrary to his inclination."</p>
            <p>His tutor was right, and when he found all his advice was to no purpoſe, he deſiſted, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately wrote to Moroſus, to acquaint him of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection his ſon had formed; adviſing to ſend for him home, abſence might cure him of this paſſion, and reſtore him to his ſences.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:033700_0007_0FF8FB47993DAF68"/>In a few days Eugenius received a letter from his father, containing an order to return home; this was ſufficient to render him unhappy; the idea of leaving Selima was death; but his father's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were abſolute, and muſt be obeyed. The ſame evening he went to take his farewell of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Selima; they parted with tears, after having ſworn fidelity to each other. Mrs. R— ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſed in their unhappineſs, by giving them all the conſolation friendly advice could afford. Eugenius begged her to permit him to write to her from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, to acknowledge the obligations he had already experienced; of which he ſhould always retain the moſt lively ſenſe of gratitude. She readily granted his requeſt, and it was a conſolation to him that by this means he could enjoy the pleaſure of hearing ſome news of his dear Selima.</p>
            <p>When Eugenius arrived in London, his father's cool behaviour hurt him not a little. The morning after his arrival, his father ſent for him into his cloſet; he obeyed his command and went trembling, but fully reſolved to diſcover his ſentiments. On his entrance, Moroſus addreſſed him thus: "Sir," ſaid he, "pray how have you employed your time ſince you left home." The youth inſtantly, and without any reſerve confeſſed his love for Selima, and in the tendereſt expreſſions and perſuaſive elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence exaggerated her merit and beauty—nor did he forget to mention her ample fortune, beſeeching him at the ſame time not to diſapprove his paſſion by a denial of their union. "I am ſurpriſed, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the father) you ſhould have formed ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment without my conſent, and more ſo at your boldneſs in avowing it. But, young man, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, remember, I command you to think no more of this ridiculous paſſion, unleſs you would incur my utter diſpleaſure, and oblige me to a ſeverity I
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033700_0008_0FF8FB57C9BA5370"/>
willingly would avoid." In vain he remonſtrated he had plighted his honor in the moſt ſacred oaths to marry her. Moroſus broke from him, and would hear no more.</p>
            <p>His tutor, who was acceſſary to what had paſſed, came to give him all the comfort in his power, but he was incapable of receiving any.—He abandoned himſelf to diſpair, &amp; would ſcarcely receive nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſeveral days; nor could all the remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his tutor bring him out of his chamber.</p>
            <p>The firſt opportunity he could take, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved, he wrote to Mrs. R—, informing her how averſe his father was to his marriage and begging her to acquaint Selima of his eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to her, and if poſſible to ſend him ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence concerning her.</p>
            <p>Having thus unburthened his mind, he now felt more happy than he had done ſome time. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to eat his meals with cheerfulneſs, hoping ſoon to receive an anſwer to his letter, which arrived in a few days wherein ſhe condoled with him on the unhappy ſituation to which he was reduced by his father's barbarity; and telling him that Selima could not reſtain a tear on reading his letter; but that young lady had conſidered it as improper to ſhew it her mother, left, piqued by his father's refuſal, and influenced by pride, ſhe might be induced to uſe her daughter in the ſame manner—but what pleaſed him above all, was the following poſtſcript in Selima's own hand:
<floatingText type="letter">

                     <p>I partake in the uneaſineſs your father's cruel behavior has occaſioned; but if my love can afford any conſolation, you poſſeſs it:—Make yourſelf as eaſy as poſſible, and be aſſured my affection ſhall only ceaſe with death.</p>

mind, and reſtored him to his wonted tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility. The family judged from the cheerfulneſs of his countenance, that he had got the better of this fooliſh paſſion, as they called it.—His father and tutor were alſo inclined to believe the ſame; and their ſuſpicions being lulled aſleep, he carried on his correſpondence with Mrs. R— and Selima for ſome time, without interruption, till at length an incident happened which gave riſe to a diſcovery, which involved the ill-fated Eugenius in freſh trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and reduced him, if poſſible, to a more pitiable ſituation than before.</p>
            <p>Moroſus unfortunately obſerved a ſervant deliver his ſon a letter, and though he imagined it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his amour he took no notice of it at preſent.</p>
            <p>A ſhort time after, he ſent the tutor to Eugenius, in order to diſcover if poſſible the preſent ſtate of his mind concerning Selima, who artfully inſinuated he was glad to find he had forgotten that young lady: But Eugenius, with more ſincerity than pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, anſwered, "No, ſir, I have not forgotten her, and though I may appear tranquil in this long and cruel abſence from her, yet her lovely image is too deeply engraven on my heart ever to be eraſed, either by time or misfortune." "So much the worſe, (replied the tutor) I pity you; for your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this moment ſent me to tell you, he intends diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of you in marriage, as alſo to prepare you for that event, and you know his diſpoſition will not brook a denial." "Impoſſible, (cried Eugenius) by obeying my father, I forfeit my honor—What then can I do."</p>
            <p>His father had in reality no intentions to marry him, but tried this experiment to ſee if it were poſſible to make him forget Selima; and finding this fail, he had recourſe to other expedients, which proved equally ineffectual. He ſent for the ſervant
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033700_0010_0FF8FB7172E119C8"/>
he had ſeen give him the letter, who by threats and perſuaſions diſcovered the correſpondence that had ſubſiſted between his ſon and Selima. However, Moroſus ordered for the future to bring him all the letters that came for his ſon: And what was his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment when he found, in the firſt letter he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, to what length the young lovers had gone; but he did not fail anſwering this himſelf, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly informed Mrs. R— that he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to marry his ſon to a lady he had fixed upon, and begged her, in order to wean his affections from Selima, to write him word ſhe was on the point of marriage.</p>
            <p>Mrs. R—, knowing the rank of Moroſus, complied with his requeſt; and the next letter Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius received, brought him the diſagreeable news of a ſuppoſed match that was on foot between Selima and a gentleman of her parent's choice, whom the former had conſented to marry.</p>
            <p>His father expecting this news would drive him to the extremity of deſeperation, ordered the tutor to be preſent when he knew the letter would arrive; and the precaution was very wiſely taken, for, without doubt, had he been alone he would put a period to his exiſtence.</p>
            <p>He raved with the madneſs of a man bereft of his ſenſes, and his father coming in at the diſturbance, relaxing his former ſeverity of look, endeavored by gentleneſs to bring him to reaſon, pretending ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the cauſe from whence this ſudden phrenzy proceeded. "Leave me, (cried the afflicted Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us) to my fate; aſk me not whence my ſorrow ariſes; as well you know you yourſelf have cauſed it, by refuſing to give your conſent to my union with Selima, who, alas! is now inſupportable; deprive me of it, O barbarous father, at once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</p>
            <p>He uttered theſe words with ſuch vehemence, that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033700_0011_0FF8FB7F33F404B0"/>
his father feared this affair would end in ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cataſtrophe. He therefore thought it neceſſary not to leave him to himſelf, till he had endeavored by every argument in his power to convince him how deſpicable it was for a man of ſpirit and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to be ſubdued by ſuch a weakneſs. In the interval, when reaſon triumphed over madneſs, he ſeemed to comply with his father's advice, as he thought that would be the only and ſureſt means to gain more liberty and obtain an opportunity of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Oxford, to ſatiate his revenge upon his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed happy rival, and puniſh the perfidy of Selima. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſo credulous was he, that though the letter was ſufficient to give him ſufficient proof of his miſtreſs's infidelity, yet he imputed it to her parents having heard of the difficulties his father had made to their union, and that they in revenge had forced their daughter to marry, contrary to her inclination, for he ſtill thought Selima incapable of deceit.</p>
            <p>Fortune ſeemed to favour the unfortunate Eugenius; for a few weeks after, his father was obliged to go to Oxford on Buſineſs of importance. This gave him an opportunity to carry his intended project into execution. His father was not the leaſt ſuſpicious of his ſon, but imagined that by the indifference he feigned, he had forgot every thing relating to Selima, ſo accordingly took him with him.</p>
            <p>Eugenius, however, went as ſoon as poſſible after his arrival in the country to Mrs. R—'s, who was much ſurpriſed to ſee him. At his earneſt ſolicitation to be informed who the happy rival was, that Selima had preferred to him, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſhe confeſſed the deceit that had been put upon him at his father's requeſt. This intelligence brought a compoſure to his troubled mind, which for a long time it had been unacquainted with; he now with eagerneſs demanded, if Selima lived where ſhe did formerly? and was told ſhe did not; that ſhe had been ill ſome time, and that her diſorder was now grown to ſuch a height, that her life was deſpaired off. This was a new cauſe of unhappineſs; but he determined to ſee her.</p>
            <p>Mrs. R—, who ſaw her every day, promiſed to acquaint her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his arrival, and to beg the favor that he might be permitted to ſee this young Lady. But after the deceit he had already experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, he paid no regard to promiſes, but endeavored to find out an expedient to introduce himſelf. Altho' he was fearful his preſence might occaſion an emotion that might increaſe her illneſs, yet he could not help thinking it would have <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:033700_0012_0FF8C20C470CCF40"/>Fluſhed with theſe hopes he made it his buſineſs to find out the phyſician that attended, who happened fortunately to be one who had viſited him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a fit of illneſs a few years back; and making himſelf known, begged the favor of him: <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>et him accompany him in the next viſit he ſhould make to Selima. The phyſician complied, and he accompanied him that evening to Mrs. C—'s.</p>
            <p>Eugenius not being perſonally known to any of the domeſtics, gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed admittance as a friend of the phyſician. When he entered Selima's chamber, he ſaw her mother kneeling by the bed-ſide drowned in tears. In deſpite of his efforts to the contrary, he could not help ſhedding tears of latent tenderneſs on beholding this melancholy ſcene; which plainly diſcovered the intereſting part he bore in her diſorder. As ſhe was raiſed up to receive ſome nouriſhment, he beheld her face, once the glowing ſeat of florid health and yield bloom, all wan and covered with deadly paleneſs. But her eyes, notwithſtanding her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, ſtill maintained their uſual vivacity. Her attendants <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

"If I ſtill love you! (returned he) Ah! my dear Selima, when I ceaſe to love you, I muſt ceaſe to exiſt." "Enough, (anſwered ſhe) I am ſatisfied; I feel my laſt moments approach; bear my death with reſignation—farewel—love me forever—preſerve the ſame affection you have always profeſſed, and live content." She could utter no more; but falling into her lover's arms, heaved a laſt ſigh, and expired without a groan.</p>
