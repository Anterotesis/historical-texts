            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>PREFACES in general are eſteemed of ſo little conſequence, that few perſons take the trouble to read them. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an irkſome taſk to be obliged to write, what will neither call up the attention, nor intereſt the feelings of thoſe who may peruſe the book; and yet, irkſome as the taſk is, I find myſelf neceſſitated to perform it.</p>
            <p>I am conſcious that ſome apology ought to be made to the public, for the length of time that has intervened ſince I firſt awakened their curioſity by announcing my intention of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent work. In excuſe for this tardineſs, I muſt allege ſeveral months of ill health, during which time I was incapable of purſuing my favourite amuſement of writing; and ſince my health has been re-eſtabliſhed, an avocation of a more ſerious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has employed every hour, and almoſt abſorbed every faculty of my mind.</p>
            <p>When I firſt ſtarted the idea of writing <hi>"Tales of Old Times,"</hi> it was with a fervent wiſh to awaken in the minds of my young readers, a curioſity that might lead them to the attentive peruſal of hiſtory in general, but more eſpecially the hiſtory of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country. It has ever been my opinion, that when inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is blended with amuſement, the youthful mind receives and retains it almoſt involuntarily.</p>
            <p>The firſt volume of the preſent work was written before I had entered on the arduous (though inexpreſſibly delightful) taſk of cultivating the minds and expanding the ideas of the female part of the riſing generation. If I was before careful to avoid every expreſſion or ſentiment that might miſlead the judgment, or corrupt the heart, what was then inclination became now an indiſpenſable duty. And though none of my characters are ſo very faultleſs as to occaſion the young reader to neglect imitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at all, becauſe they deſpair of attaining the ſame degree of perfection, yet they diſcover ſuch an innate love of virtue, ſuch
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:034490_0003_0FFF2058E6CC1930"/>
a thorough contempt of vice, that the uncontaminated mind will contemplate with pleaſure the beauty of the one, and ſhrink with abhorrence from the deformity of the other.</p>
            <p>As a noveliſt, I think it is more than probable that I have made my laſt eſſay. Flattered and encouraged as I am in my preſent undertaking, in having the education of ſo many young ladies entruſted to my care by their reſpectable parents, it ſhall henceforward be my ſtudy conſcientiouſly to diſcharge the truſt repoſed in me; and whilſt I endeavour to cultivate their taſte, and improve their underſtandings, implant, with the utmoſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude, in their innocent minds, a love for piety and virtue.</p>
            <p>To this end, I ſhall devote my leiſure hours to preparing a ſet of progreſſive leſſons in reading, for the youth of my own ſex, from five years old to ten or twelve; after which period, there are a multiplicity of books, better calculated to forward the great deſign of education than any my pen could produce.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that the generality of books intended for children are written for boys: even Mrs. Barb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uld's Leſſons, which are the beſt productions of the kind I ever met with, are addreſſed to a boy. And as for the generality of little books which children are permitted to read, they are ſuch a jumble of inconſiſtencies, that though they may aſſiſt the child to learn to read with propriety, they do not convey one idea to the head that is worth retaining. Mrs. Trimmer, and ſome few others, are exceptions to this remark, having laboured to correct this falſe idea, that it was neceſſary to excite the young mind to the purſuit of learning by tales wonderful and indeed impoſſible, and have diſplayed to their view the real wonders and beauties of nature.</p>
            <p>For my own ſex only I preſume to write; and if hereafter one woman ſhould think herſelf happier or wiſer from the fruits of my endeavours, I ſhall be overpaid for the time or pains beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in writing and arranging them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <head>An old faſhioned Widow.</head>
               <p>IT was about the middle of the fifteenth century that the lovely and amiable Iſabelle found herſelf a widow, reduced from eaſe and affluence to a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined income. Though her circumſtances were altered; her mind elevated, her ſpirit noble and independent, was ſtill the ſame. Iſabelle was a native of Spain, of noble parentage, expanded heart, ſuperior ſenſe, and highly finiſhed education. The beauty and elegance of her perſon, though ſtriking, were but ſecondary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the eſteem and admiration ſhe was ſure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite wherever ſhe was ſeen or known.</p>
               <p>In the prime of life, having ſcarcely reached her 35th year, ſuddenly deprived of a valuable and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved huſband, ſhe retired from a court of which ſhe had been a principal ornament, to a caſtle romanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſituated on the borders of Wales. Amongſt her huſband's vaſt poſſeſſions, this only had eſcaped the rapacious hand of his enemies. It was an antique caſtle which formerly had been deſigned for defence, as well as a habitation; but the fortreſs had been for many years totally neglected, and the caſtle itſelf, in many places, was fallen to decay. The ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it conſiſted of but a few acres, and thoſe few were uncultivated and rude; a few clumps of old <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aks were here and there ſcattered on the ſides of the hill, on the ſummit of which the caſtle ſtood; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſurrounding it, was a ſmall patch which once
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:034490_0005_0FFF2060829C3E50"/>
had been uſed as a kitchen garden. The very trifling value annexed to this ſmall demeſne and its retired ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſituation, made it no object to the enemies of Arundel; and thither Iſabelle, with her only child Columbia, retired.</p>
               <p>An old female ſervant, a native of South-America, whoſe name was Cora, and Matthias, a veteran ſoldier who had grown old in the ſervice of her huſband's father, with a lively little girl particularly attached to Columbia, compriſed the whole of her houſehold.</p>
               <p>Mina was the daughter of a peaſant in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of London. The little Columbia, when quite a child, walking with her maid on the banks of the Thames, ſaw Mina gathering ſome dry ſticks, which ſhe carefully tied in a bundle, and, dropping a curteſy as Columbia paſſed, cried, "Bleſs you, ſweet little lady." Mina was juſt nine years of age, her complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion clear olive, a profuſion of jetty hair waved in gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy ringlets over her neck, and partly ſhaded her expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive countenance; her full black eyes beamed unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoftneſs, as taking up her bundle of ſticks ſhe gazed after Columbia, and cried, "Bleſs you, my ſweet little lady!" And "bleſs you, my pretty girl," ſaid Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia; "why do you carry that heavy bundle?" "'Tis wood to make a fire for mammy who is ſick." "Where does your mammy live?" "There, in that little cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by the road ſide." Columbia, though not eigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> feelings of humanity; ſhe darted forward, and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was at the door of Mina's cottage. "You muſt not go in, Miſs," ſaid the ſervant; "if the woman ſhould be ſick of any contagious diſorder, and you ſhould catch it, what would my lady ſay?" "What would ſhe ſay (replied the child) if I paſſed by the houſe without inquiring what ailed the poor woman? I will go in, and then I can tell my mother, who will, I am ſure, give me ſome money to bring to her to-marrow." Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was uſeleſs; the benevolent child entered the cottage, and beheld a ſcene of miſery, which, though ſhe did not fully comprehend, ſhe on her return home ſufficiently explained to her mother, to obtain immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:034490_0006_0FFF206251201C08"/>
relief for the poor cottager; and Mina was taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the family and promoted to the honour of waiting entirely on her little benefactreſs.</p>
               <p>When the lady Iſabelle retired to Auſtenbury Caſtle, Columbia was eleven years old. It was her mother's chief amuſement to cultivate an underſtanding naturally good, but where ſometimes the ſhoots of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male vanity impeded the progreſs of thoſe virtues, which nature with a liberal hand had implanted in her heart. Remarkably lovely in her perſon, ſhe would frequently decorate her hair with field flowers, at the ſame time placing garlands of them in fantaſtic drapery about her dreſs; and then, having admired herſelf in the natural baſon, which ornamented their little garden, fly to her mother, and exclaim with tranſport, "Only ſee how beautiful!" When Mina, who thought her young miſtreſs almoſt a divinity, would rapturouſly cry, "Don't ſhe, my lady, look like an angel?"</p>
               <p>Iſabelle, though delighted to obſerve the unbounded vivacity of her daughter, and the grateful affection of her little dependant, was fully ſenſible of the neceſſity there was for checking thoſe ebullitions of vanity, which, if ſuffered to paſs unnoticed, would effectually throw a ſhade over the really valuable qualities of good ſenſe, good nature, and benevolence, with which the ſoul of her daughter was amply ſtored. Her reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on this ſubject were often painful in the extreme. Secluded from the world, ſhe had no friend with whom ſhe could adviſe. Severity (ſhe would ſay within her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) will but teach my child to conſider me as a frigid monitreſs, her heart will contract and hide its thoughts from an eye that beams only with reproach! No; I muſt watch the favourable moment, and effectually eradicate this error, by convincing her underſtanding of its folly. I would be the guardian of my child's morals; I would be her friend, and direct her in the way moſt likely to ſecure her preſent and future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; but for the univerſe I would not forfeit the exquiſite pleaſure of participating every thought, every wiſh of her innocent heart.—No; let me not, by ill timed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> harſhneſs, drive her guileleſs and unſuſpecting nature
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:034490_0007_0FFF2063E23EEC08"/>
to mean ſubterfuge and artifice; had ſhe a thouſand errors, ſhe is ſtill my child, and though it is my duty to correct, it is alſo my duty to conceal and palliate faults, which reflection tells me, are but the offspring of human nature.</p>
               <p>It was ever the care of Iſabelle to impreſs on the mind of her daughter a proper ſenſe of a wiſe, benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, overruling Power; to whom ſhe was indebted for her being, and to whom ſhe was accountable for her words and actions; but this was done more by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample than precept. Calumny was a ſtranger to her lips; to perform every good work of peace and mercy was the delight of her heart. She worſhipped her Creator with ſincerity and fervor; no appointed hour, no ſet form of prayer; every bleſſing was received with thankfulneſs, every correction ſubmitted to with patience. Amongſt the moſt heinous offences ſhe rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned the miſuſe or neglect of time, and the total abuſe or perverſion of God's good gifts. Every hour of her life was uſefully employed, and ſhe dealt by every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being, as ſhe wiſhed them to deal by her.</p>
               <p>It was a fine evening in the middle of September, when Columbia aſked her mother to partake of ſome fruit in a neat arbour Matthias had dreſſed by the ſide of the pond. "You forget, my dear mother, (ſaid ſhe) that this is the day I always devote to joy and playful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This is the day on which you relieved poor Mina's mother, and brought that good girl home to live with me; and ſhe has been ſo affectionate, ſo grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that to-day I am determined ſhe ſhall be queen of the feaſt. You do not know how charming it will be! Matthias has got us ſome peaches, and Cora has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided cream, with baked apples and wheat cakes; and whilſt you refreſh yourſelf, Mina and I will ſing and dance to divert you." Iſabelle claſped the intereſting child in her arms, and repaired to the appointed ſcene of infantile feſtivity.</p>
               <p>After the collation was over, at which Mina was made to preſide, Columbia told her mother, that ſhe could never repay the pleaſure her firſt acquaintance with that little girl had given her; "For," ſaid ſhe,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034490_0008_0FFF2069B808E4F8"/>
"before I ſaw her diſtreſs, and you, my beloved moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, gave me the means to relieve it, I had no idea of happineſs beyond myſelf; but that bleſſed day taught me, that to confer happineſs on another, gave the mind ſenſations a thouſand times more exquiſite than any other enjoyment the world affords." She then, with the ſwiftneſs and light bound of an antelope, ſprang from her mother's embrace, and ran toward the caſtle; but ſoon returned with Mina, decorated in all the finery they could put together. The jetty hair of Mina hung looſe and unadorned about her neck and ſhoulders, whilſt her little white jacket and petticoat were richly ornamented with orange lilies, poppies and blue iris.</p>
               <p>The fine auburn treſſes of Columbia were bound up with a garland of corn flowers, and autumnal daiſies, whoſe glowing tints vied with the colour, whilſt the conſciouſneſs of their becoming effect gave an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional brilliancy to her eyes. Her dreſs, which was compoſed of light grey ſatin, ſhe had lightly and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly ornamented with feſtoons of oak leaves, whoſe dark native green was at this period of the year enliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the bright yellow, and glowing ſcarlet hue, they had caught from the chilly breath of autumn. Light as the goſſamer they bound over the turf, danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the notes of their own harmonious voices. The evening was ſerene; the glowing ſun juſt touched with his broad diſk the weſtern ocean, whilſt as he ſunk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ſhades of night, the moon, emerging from her watry bed, reflected his departing beams, and tinged the cold eaſtern ſky with ſaffron hue, whilſt here and there a ſcattered cloud, dark in itſelf, caught her pale rays, and brightened by degrees to high-wrought ſilver.</p>
               <p>Fatigued with the exerciſe of dancing, Columbia pauſed upon the margin of the ſtream; its ſurface was ſmooth and even as the poliſhed mirror;—her elegant form, becoming dreſs, and angel countenance were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected in the water. She ſtopped and gazed. A beam of exultation ſhot from her eyes. It was the moment Iſabelle had ſo long wiſhed for.</p>

                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:034490_0009_0FFF206C52E668D0"/>
"And what does my child ſo intently gaze at?" (ſaid ſhe, approaching her daughter.)</p>
               <p>Mina ſtood at a little diſtance; her own beauty was to herſelf unknown, her whole ſoul was wrapt in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the beauty of her young lady. When the lady Iſabelle ſpoke, ſhe drew near and liſtened with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. She loved her with grateful affection, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from her lips ſunk directly to her heart.</p>
               <p>"And what does my child ſo intently gaze at?" ſaid Iſabelle, "is it the lovely form with which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has bountifully endowed her; and which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruffled ſurface of the water ſo beautifully reflects to her admiring eyes? Alas, my child, if that is the object of your admiration, how fragile is the pleaſure you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive! What is it you contemplate? A ſhadow; nay, leſs than a ſhadow; for beauty itſelf is but a ſhadow, ſcarce ſeen before it is gone; and that fair ſemblance you there behold is but the ſhadow of a ſhade. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, my child," continued ſhe, throwing ſomething into the water, "ſee that beauteous figure, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, how diſguſting; every trait of lovelineſs is gone." Columbia turned from the ſtream with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary ſhudder. Iſabelle continued—"Or ſee, my love, theſe flowers, with which but a few hours ſince you decorated your hair; they were then freſh-bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and beautiful beyond deſcription; behold them now! their ſweets are all exhaled, their vivid tints are flown, and no longer valuable, you would throw them from you with neglect and abhorrence. Even ſo, my dear Columbia, is it with the frail beauty which you ſo ardently admire. One breath from the creative Power that gave you being, might level you with the duſt. Sickneſs, miſfortune, poverty, might deprive your eyes of their luſtre, your ſkin of its gloſſy hue, and ſteal the luxuriant treſſes from your head. Nay, even at this moment, the cold hand of death might ſink you into nothing; and thoſe who to-day looked at you with admiration, would to-marrow turn from you with diſguſt and terror. Like theſe poor flowers you would be thrown upon the earth, be trod under foot and forgotten."</p>
               <p>

Mina, dropping her garland on the ground, ſeized her young lady by the arm, as though ſhe would ſave her from ſo diſgraceful an end. Columbia looked at her with affection, gently freed herſelf from her graſp, and, looking at the faded flowers, with eyes ſtreaming with tears aſked her mother, "Am I, then, of no more conſequence than theſe flowers, and may I be as eaſily deſtroyed? Shall I be as ſoon reduced to nothing?" "No, my beloved girl, (ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> ever bloomed, or the richeſt gem that ever decked the brow of royalty. Look round, my love, behold this vaſt, this glorious univerſe; what beauty, what order! How does the mind expand with wonder and delight as we contemplate the fields of ripened grain, the load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fruit trees, verdant plains and majeſtic mountains, whoſe ſummits ſeem to kiſs the face of heaven. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how grand, how ſtrikingly ſublime, appears the orb of day, juſt ſinking in the weſtern ſky, which flames with crimſon, burniſhed gold and purple; and ſee, as he retires, the placid moon aſſumes her ſilent reign, whilſt millions of ſtars compoſe her ſplendid train, and glitter in the vaſt expanſe of ether. Stupendous, great and wonderful as theſe appear, believe me, my child, one pure, virtuous human ſoul is of more value in the ſight of the Creator, than all that you behold. They ſhall fade away, ſhall vaniſh as a dream, and be no more remembered; but the ſoul, ſtudious to perform its duty, beneficent to its fellow creatures, and glowing with grateful, humble affection to the great Firſt Cauſe of all, ſhall ſtand ſecure amid the general ruin, and riſe triumphant from a ſinking world."</p>
               <p>Thus did Iſabelle endeavour to inſpire her daughter with a thorough contempt for all frivolous purſuits, and to give her a juſt ſenſe of the value of mental acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. From this time ſhe fully comprehended of how much more conſequence was the embelliſhing of the mind, than the trifling decorations of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Beſides, having been informed of the immortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the ſoul, ſhe was anxious in inquiry for the means by which ſo invaluable a bleſſing might be preſerved;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034490_0011_0FFF206F6DF87A78"/>
and to hint to her the danger of forfeiting ſo great a privilege, was always ſufficient to deter her from any thing that was wrong.</p>
               <p>It cannot be imagined that a woman like Iſabelle could paſs at once from the court to the cottage, and be ſuffered to glide unnoticed into obſcurity. Amongſt the friends and intimates of her days of ſplendor, were ſome, tenderly attached to her from principle, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whom the united beauties of her mind and perſon had inſpired with a wiſh, to lead her again to the altar of Hymen. But Iſabelle had drank too deeply of the bitter cup of affliction to ſuffer love ever again to enter her boſom. Faithful to the memory of her regretted lord, her heart could receive no ſecond impreſſion. "Our love," ſhe would ſay, "was unfortunate, but he has left me an ineſtimable pledge behind; ſhall I give the daughter of my adored Arundel another father, or by extending my family duties have leſs time to beſtow in rendering my child worthy of the name ſhe bears? No; the ſincereſt proof I can give of my affection to her father, is to live a widow for her ſake."</p>
               <p>This reſolve of Iſabelle being once known, and ſhe ſtill perſiſting in ſecluding herſelf from the world, ſhe was ſoon forgotten, almoſt as much as if ſhe had been dead; for love cannot long exiſt without hope, and the gay and thoughtleſs ſoon forget thoſe on whom the ſun of proſperity no longer ſhines. She was left in peace to enjoy her retirement, and to cultivate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted the mind of her lovely daughter.</p>

               <p>AS Columbia increaſed in years, her affection for her mother daily ſtrengthened. It was an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion actuated by the enthuſiaſtic fervor of youth, yet ſweetly tempered by a friendſhip which might have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come maturer years. Iſabelle was to her daughter,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034490_0012_0FFF20711F40AFC8"/>
mother, ſiſter, friend; every tender connexion combined in one. Never did child more love or fear a parent; yet her fear did not proceed from the apprehenſion of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment or ſevere correction. But to ſee her mother frown, to be told ſhe had offended her, and to be ſpoken to with coldneſs, gave her ſuch inexpreſſible an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, that the thought at any time was ſufficient to fill her eyes with tears.</p>
               <p>As ſhe advanced towards womanhood, ſhe could not but obſerve the extreme penſiveneſs of her mother's diſpoſition; the purſuits and pleaſures of childhood gradually loſt their charms, ſhe more frequently ſought the ſociety of Iſabelle, and when ſometimes ſhe ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her in tears, ſhe would ſink on her knees before her, and, folding her arms round her waiſt, cry, "Why, my beloved mother, will you confine your ſorrows to your own breaſt, why not repoſe them in the boſom of your child? Let me ſhare them, my mother, and in ſharing ſoothe them." Iſabelle would faintly ſmile at theſe effuſions of her daughter's tenderneſs, and as ſhe kiſſed the affectionate girl tell her, it was too early in life for her to be acquainted with ſorrow, though ſhe could feel it only from the tenderneſs of her nature, leading her to compaſſionate the ſufferings of others.</p>
               <p>"I am not ſo happy as I formerly was, my dear Mina," ſaid Columbia to her attendant one evening as they were walking in the garden; "I ſee my mother daily ſinking under the weight of afflictions I can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comprehend or alleviate. Yeſterday I tremblingly aſked her, if I was the cauſe of her ſorrow; ſhe preſſed me to her heart and ſaid, in ſome meaſure I was. Alarmed, I inquired what I had done to offend her. Nothing, ſhe replied; you are my only comfort, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> greateſt bleſſing, and I cannot but lament—Her tears at that moment impeded her words, and when ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her voice, ſhe bade me leave her. I obeyed; but ſtill I have a weight upon my heart, an anxious, reſtleſs wiſh to know, how without offending I can cauſe her ſo much affliction."</p>
               <p>Mina could not ſatiſfy her young lady's curioſity; ſhe could only kiſs her hands, and in a voice rendered
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034490_0013_0FFF20762CB1C1D8"/>
exquiſitely ſoft by grateful affection, declare it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible her dear little benefactreſs could offend any one!</p>
               <p>But though Mina was ignorant of the cauſe of Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle's tears, Cora, the Indian ſervant, was not equally ſo. She ſaw Columbia partook of her mother's depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, without underſtanding the cauſe; and the loquaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty naturally prevalent in perſons of an advanced age, made her eagerly watch for an opportunity to inform the innocent girl of all ſhe knew. The moment long ſought at length arrived. Columbia had frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved her mother weeping over papers which ſhe took from a private drawer in an eſcritoire which ſtood in her bed-chamber, and which in no other part was lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except that which ſhe moſt wiſhed to explore. One day coming ſuddenly into the room, ſhe ſaw her gazing at a portrait which ſhe preſſed to her lips, raiſing her eyes toward heaven with a ſort of reverential awe. "May I not, my dear mother," ſaid ſhe, "behold the object that ſeems at once to excite both grief and exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." Iſabelle turned the portrait towards her; it was an Indian maid habited in the manner of her country; but in habiliments that beſpoke her of elevated rank. Her jetty hair, which flowed in profuſion round her face and over her neck, was ornamented with a coronet of pearl and gold; her thin white robe was claſped at the boſom with ſtuds of the ſame valuable materials, and her arms, which were naked to the ſhoulders, were in ſeveral places bound with bands of ſilver and coral.</p>
               <p>"This," ſaid Iſabelle, as ſhe preſented it to her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, "is the portrait of your grandmother; by birth a <hi>queen,</hi> the only child of a monarch whoſe wealth had no bounds, and who, far from the haunts of thoſe who call themſelves civilized people, reigned unmoleſted, till the adventurous ſpirit of your great anceſtor Columbus prompted him to ſeek in diſtant ſeas for unknown worlds. Oh, ſublime and too daring ſpirit," ſhe continued, whilſt her raiſed eyes gliſtened with the tear of extorted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, "why wert thou endowed with qualities, which ſerved but to ſtir up in the breaſts of thine enemies the malignant fiend Envy. Why! whilſt thou wert la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034490_0014_0FFF2077C06D6FA0"/>
to benefit and enlighten poſterity, wert thou ſealing thy own ruin!"</p>
               <p>The portrait dropped from her hand, and her head reſted on the ſhoulder of her child. "Oh! my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter," cried ſhe enthuſiaſtically, as her tears ſubſided, "whilſt I glory in the qualities with which it has pleaſed Heaven to endow your mind and perſon, I cannot but tremble for your future fate; for to poſſeſs ſuperior beauty, ſenſe or genius, is but to excite the wonder of the ignorant, and the envy of little minds, whilſt thoſe who are wiſe, or great in their own conceit, will wound your feelings with contempt or ridicule, which your own good nature and ſenſibility will not permit you to retaliate. I cannot proceed, my child; my powers are not at preſent adequate to the taſk of recounting the miſfortunes of your family." Iſabelle pauſed for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then tenderly kiſſed Columbia, and leaving the portrait in the hands of her child, paſſed from the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Sinking upon the ſeat her mother had left unoccupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, one hand ſupporting her head as her elbow reſted on the eſcritoire, the other which held the portrait fell on her knees, her eyes immoveably fixed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> thoſe of the inanimate face ſhe contemplated, Columbia ſat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable as a ſtatue, till rouſed by the voice of Cora. "Look there," ſaid ſhe, putting the miniature towards the aged ſervant; "ſee! my mother ſays it is the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of my grandmother." "It is, it is," cried Cora, dropping on her knees and kiſſing the picture with rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; "it is the figure of my queen, my miſtreſs, in the dreſs ſhe wore on the day ſhe was eſpouſed by Don Ferdinando. Oh fatal day! unhappy hour! by that union ſhe ſealed her own wretchedneſs, the ruin of her father, the ſlavery of his people, and brought deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the heads of her adored huſband and his reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parent! Ah! my ſweet young miſtreſs, I can no longer forbear; I muſt tell you the fatal ſtory of your father's wrongs."</p>
               <p>"Do ſo," ſaid Iſabelle, who at that moment returned to her apartment; "do ſo, my good Cora; and let it be a warning to my child how ſhe quits the quiet paths of

Tell our dear Ferdinando, that though I have by my marriage with his mother deprived him of his birthright as the only heir of an ancient and wealthy marquis, I will toil to recompenſe to him the ſacrifice his dear mother made to me. Sweet Beatina, do not grieve at this our long ſeparation; when I return, I will return worthy of your love; I will make my charmer worſhipped by thoſe who now hold her in contempt. I am about to lay before the king of Portugal a plan for making thoſe diſcoveries, you have ſo frequently heard me mention as more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If he liſtens to me, my fortune is certain; if he treats my propoſals as chimerical, the offſpring of a diſordered imagination, I will apply to ſome other power.

                     <p>I leave my native land to-morrow, in order to ſolicit Ferdinand of Spain to grant me the veſſels and ſupplies neceſſary for proſecuting my intended voyage. I am told the court of Spain is more enlightened than any other court in Europe.</p>
                     <p>I had, previous to my quitting you, found means to lay my plans before the Britiſh throne; but I fear they were treated as the project of a viſionary; for though my brother undertook the charge, I have received no anſwer. Alas! Beatina, how hard it is to combat any received prejudice. The wiſe and learned men of paſt ages have held it impoſſible for mariners to find a paſſage, or proceed, without incurring immediate death, beyond certain boundaries which their confined knowledge has marked out. But I will not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from the experiment. If I ſucceed, after ages will revere my name; if I fail, it will ſink quietly into oblivion; or perhaps ſome future genius, enterpriſing and ſanguine as myſelf, ſhall drop a tear to my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, and as he laments my fate, tremble for his own.

                     <p>CONGRATULATE me, my lovely friend; I am at length ſucceſsful! How have I counted the tedious months that kept me from my ſoul's idol; and how often have I feared that my perſeverance would be of

no avail, and that I had ſacrificed ages of real happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (for hours are ages to the heart that loves as mine does) to the viſionary hopes of future greatneſs. But I am ſucceſsful. I ſhall explore thoſe diſtant ſeas, with which my ſtudies have ſo well acquainted me, and in ſome unknown world ſeek out a kingdom of which my Beatina ſhall be queen. Yes, you ſhall be queen; for whatſoever world I find, be it the faireſt, greateſt, or the beſt the ſun ever ſhone on, no man ſhould ever claim a right to govern it. For it is to a woman I owe the means of making the great attempt. I am ſo overjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I cannot proceed methodically; yet I know you languiſh to learn every particular that concerns your Columbus.</p>
                     <p>I have in former letters informed you of my hitherto fruitleſs ſolicitations. Wearied by attendance on min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters and creatures, who hung about the king like bees upon the ſweet ſcabious, draining it of its vital moiſture till its very root decayed, when they returned to their hives laden with the precious ſtore, regardleſs of the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate of the flower from which they had extracted both life and health; diſguſted with their unmeaning profeſſions, their hypocriſy and ſtupidity, I had nearly relinquiſhed the undertaking, when I one morning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an order to attend the queen's private drawing room. You may ſuppoſe I did not heſitate to obey the ſummons. The royal Iſabelle received me with affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and encouraging ſweetneſs; ſhe condeſcended to confer with me on my intended voyage, and on the ſtudies which led me to hope for ſucceſs. She liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with attention to my reaſons, and bade me attend the levee next morning. I went. My royal patroneſs urged my ſuit to the king with all the earneſtneſs of perſuaſive eloquence. He liſtened; but it was with cold, almoſt contemptuous ſilence. Yet was ſhe not diſmayed; her fine features glowed with enthuſiaſm, as ſhe expreſſed a prophetic aſſurance of ſucceſs. Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſions were finiſhed with this heroic declaration:—"If your majeſty," ſaid ſhe, "conceives the plan too wild, too eccentric to be countenanced, by ordering this enterpriſing man the neceſſary ſupplies from the public
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034490_0020_0FFF208BBAFD3DF8"/>
treaſury; and if your own private purſe will not at preſent allow of ſo large a diſburſement, ſuffer me to raiſe the money on my own perſonal jewels. I beſeech your majeſty do not ſay me nay. I want no ornaments to render me pleaſing to my ſovereign, and will cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully part with them, to benefit his ſubjects, or add to his territories."</p>
                     <p>Struck with the magnanimity of the propoſal, Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand could no longer refuſe; he gave immediate or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the equipment of a fleet, in which I am to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on my intended diſcovery; and a ſum of money is to be paid to me from the treaſury, to provide every neceſſary for the voyage.</p>
                     <p>I fell at the feet of the royal Iſabelle, and kiſſed, with grateful tranſports, the hem of her garment. She graciouſly raiſed me, and with a ſmile of heavenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity aſſured me, that you, my Beatina, and our dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Ferdinando, ſhould be taken under her immediate protection. Haſten then, my deareſt, on the receipt of this; haſten to Spain, and let me introduce you to our auguſt queen.

I ſhall not fulfil my duty to the moſt gracious of ſovereigns, if I do not try ſome method to inform her, whatever may be my fate, her wiſhes are fulfilled. The new, the hitherto unexplored world, of which I fondly dreamed ſo many anxious years, is at length diſcovered! I ſhall annex to this the courſe by which I ſteered, the ſoundings as we approached the land, and every requiſite direction for mariners to find the place where I have left a little colony of forty men.</p>
                     <p>Our voyage from Spain was tedious in the extreme, and thoſe who had not the ſame internal aſſurances, which my intenſe ſtudy had given me, of our being in a right courſe, were almoſt tempted to mutiny, to confine me, and, taking command of the fleet, return to Spain; but to my inexpreſſible joy, when even my own ſpirits began to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ail, nor could I longer have ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced the fears of the mariners, on the morning of the 12th of October, I diſcovered land. We made for the ſhore, and on the 13th landed and took poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a beautiful fertile iſland, in the name of your auguſt conſort Ferdinand. I kiſſed the ground as I landed, and called it St. Salvadora, in honour of my gracious patroneſs; for her bounty relieved me when I was in utter deſpair of ever making the attempt of a diſcovery, and the ſight of this iſland preſerved me from the vengeance of a diſappointed, terrified ſet of ſeamen, who thought I had fooliſhly dragged them from their friends and country to periſh on the ocean. I found the inhabitants humane, ſocial, and tractable; and left our little colony in a ſtate of greater comfort than could have been expected. But the impoſſibility of obtaining proper proviſions for the long voyage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and the very fragile ſtate of our barques to combat ſeas unuſually tempeſtuous at this ſeaſon, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me fearful I ſhall never again ſee Spain, or kneel at the feet of my royal miſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>The iſland I have diſcovered yields plenty of gold duſt; pearls are found in the rivers; and from what I could obſerve, diamonds and other precious ſtones are eaſily procured. For the natives not only wear them in their hair and about their necks, but decorate their
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034490_0023_0FFF2093675774F8"/>
temples with them, intermixed with gold and ſilver. Theſe temples are in general dedicated to the <hi>Sun,</hi> which is their chief object of adoration. The ſacred duties are performed by prieſteſſes, who vow eternal virginity. Their men are tall and well proportioned; the women beautiful in the extreme.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I ſlightly touched on the many charms to entice my ſovereign to make this territory her own. Oh may the wealth its mines contain, enrich her above all her cotemporaries; may the colony ſhe plants increaſe and flouriſh; there may ſhe found a new, a glorious world, that after ages ſhall at once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and fear.</p>
                     <p>And now that life perhaps is near its cloſe, will my benignant queen permit her ſervant to recommend once more to her protection, my wife and child? Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando is now fifteen. When he attains the age of manhood, let him purſue the path I have marked out, and finiſh what his father but begun; and ſhould his ſearches meet with the ſucceſs my ſpirit propheſies, let the new world be called <hi>Columbia.</hi> It will unite the name of Beatina with Columbus, perpetuating her lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed name with mine.</p>
                     <p>I would have wrote to my beloved wife, but what could I ſay? My heart bleeds for what ſhe will ſuffer. You, my gracious miſtreſs, will not forſake her.

               <p>"IT was on the firſt of Auguſt," ſaid Cora, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf forward, whilſt memory ſeemed upon the ſtretch to recal events ſo long paſt; "it was, as near as I can recollect, about the beginning of Auguſt, when my mother, who was chief attendant about the royal chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Orrozombo, king of Peru, was ordered to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the queen and her children to a palace newly built on the ſea-coaſt, a great diſtance from the capital. I ſhall never forget it; it was as fine a morning as ever ſhone. The princeſs Orrabella was the oldeſt of five daughters; for my royal maſter never had a ſon, and ſhe was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as our future queen. I was then, as I told you, but eight years old, quite delighted with our new habitation. I followed the princeſs, with whom I was a great favourite, from one apartment to another, till we reached the top. There, as we ſtood looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ſea, we ſaw a monſtrous fiſh or bird, for it was impoſſible to tell which it was; its body was black, its wings white; it was coming quick toward the ſhore. The princeſs ſhrieked. The king and queen had, from a lower apartment, obſerved the ſame monſter haſtily approaching; and ordering forth the guards, bade them draw up on the beach, and as it drew near diſcharge their arrows at it. But, Oh terrible, if I was to live a thouſand years, I never ſhall forget how frightened ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery creature was, when the huge monſter, drawing quite near, ſtopped on a ſudden, and dropping all its wings, a burſt of fire and ſmoke iſſued from its ſide, with tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous noiſe. Many fell to the earth with terror, as this dreadful phenomena was repeated three times. When our fears were in ſome meaſure abated, we plainly ſaw living creatures move upon it, and ſoon a ſmaller fiſh of the ſame kind, only without wings, came from its ſide, and ſeveral men were borne by it quite to the ſhore. The guards affrighted, dared not diſcharge their arrows, but let their bows fall, and gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſilent wonder. The king, the queen, and all the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:034490_0026_0FFF209C55FB26C8"/>
royal children were ſtanding on the ſhore. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs Orrabella was ever brave and undaunted; ſhe ſtood leaning on my mother's arm, the foremoſt of them all. I had hid my face in her robe; but though afraid to look long on the terrifying object, I now and then drew it aſide to peep at a creature ſo wonderful.</p>
               <p>"But, my good Cora," cried Columbia, rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient at the old woman's prolixity, "if you are thus particular, you will never get to the end of your ſtory. This monſter, as you deſcribe it, I ſuppoſe was the ſhip that bore the great Columbus to the Peruvian coaſt; and the little fiſh you mention was the boat in which he landed."</p>
               <p>"Well, I know that," replied Cora, angrily; "but I like to tell a ſtory my own way. If I am not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to tell all the particulars, I ſhall never be able to tell it at all." Columbia ſmiled and was ſilent.</p>
               <p>Cora again began, but ſhe ſo often interrupted herſelf telling the ſame incidents ſeveral times over, and dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on each with a tireſome minuteneſs, that Columbia, though anxious, could ſcarcely command her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the end of the ſtory. From it ſhe gathered the following circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Columbus, though he had made two voyages before, one when he diſcovered St. Salvadora, and another with relief and ſupplies for the colony he had left there, had not diſcovered the part of the American continent of which Cora was a native, till his third voyage; when many noblemen and cavaliers from the court of Spain accompanied him in his expedition, in hopes of ſharing at once the glory and emolument the diſcoveries were likely to produce. Amongſt the gallant group of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen was Ferdinando, only ſon of Columbus. He landed with his father, both richly habited and followed by a train of cavaliers equally gay. With white flags waving, and their drawn ſwords pointed towards the earth, they advanced to the party deſcribed by Cora to be aſſembled on the ſhore. Orrabella, ſtruck with the majeſtic yet conciliating mien of Columbus, perhaps more with the perſonal beauty and elegant deportment of Ferdinando, who advanced at his right hand, preſſed
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:034490_0027_0FFF209EE40A3DF8"/>
forward to meet them; and with a countenance at once expreſſive of wonder, admiration and timidity, her right arm extended ſeemed a barrier to prevent their approaching her parents and ſiſters, whilſt laying her left hand on her breaſt ſhe knelt to the ground, raiſing her fine eyes in token of ſupplication. Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando raiſed her, laid his ſword at her feet, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtring of beads about her neck, told her, in the language of nature, which is alike underſtood in all nations, that ſhe had nothing to fear.</p>
               <p>Orrozombo, aſſured of their friendly intentions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them cordially, and ſhewed them every mark of hoſpitality. They reſided on the continent many months, collecting ingots of pure gold, bars of ſilver, with pearls, diamonds and coral, forming the moſt wealthy cargo ever borne into a Spaniſh port.</p>
               <p>During the time Columbus and his followers tarried at the Peruvian court, Ferdinando had numberleſs oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of improving the favourable impreſſion his firſt appearance made on the lovely Orrabella. He ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed her in the Spaniſh tongue; and with equal facility, became himſelf a proficient in her native lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. He found her poſſeſſed of ſtrong powers of mind, quick perception, ready wit; in ſhort, an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding capable of the higheſt improvement. The mutual paſſion that ſubſiſted between them was early diſcovered, and encouraged by their parents. Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus looked forward to the union as a mean of inſuring wealth and power to his poſterity, and Orrozombo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined, by reſigning his daughter to this young ſtranger, he ſecured to himſelf a powerful friend and ally in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus. For the Spaniards had taught his ſubjects many of the uſeful arts; and Science, by their means, began to unfold her beauties to the delighted monarch and his court.</p>
               <p>Upon their marriage, Orrozombo gave up part of his territories to Columbus, as a portion for his daughter; and a colony was begun, where every thing was regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated according to the Spaniſh form of government.</p>
               <p>This being ſettled to the ſatisfaction of all parties, the adventurers prepared to reviſit their native land;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:034490_0028_0FFF20A1916CE448"/>
and the royal bride of Ferdinando determined to go with her huſband. Several of her attendants were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to accompany her; amongſt whom was the mother of Cora, who at the princeſs's requeſt took her daughter with her. With many tears did Orrabella quit her parents and ſiſters; tears which ſeemed to forebode they would never meet again. Alas! Avarice had diſcovered this new world was an inexhauſtible mine of wealth; and, not content to ſhare its bleſſings in common with the natives, came with rapine, war and devaſtation in her train: And as ſhe tore open the bowels of the earth to gratify her inſatiate thirſt for gold, her ſteps were marked with blood.</p>

               <p>THE ſhip in which Ferdinando and his bride em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked was deſtined to proceed immediately to Spain; but Columbus himſelf, in a ſmall caravel, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to croſs over to Hiſpaniola, and viſit a colony which now began to wear a very flouriſhing appearance. Many families had emigrated from Spain, ſome of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtinction; and Columbus had, previous to his embarkation, ſolicited the government of this colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for an indigent friend, hoping he might in the new world retrieve his ruined fortunes. It was partly a wiſh to ſee how his intention ſucceeded, that prompted him to viſit Hiſpaniola at this time.

                     <p>THY father is returned, my dear ſon, returned to his native land. But how? Not as an enterpriſing ſpirit whoſe plans had proved ſucceſsful, ſhould return; but as a traitor to his king, loaded with ignomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034490_0029_0FFF20A422805A08"/>
chains. Oh! my brave boy, I ſee thy noble ſpirit fire at the intelligence. But beware; conceal the workings of thy honeſt ſoul. To proſper in this ungrateful world, you muſt wear the maſk of hypoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy; wear the ſemblance of humility, honeſty, patriotiſm, till you have obtained ſome favourite point, then throw them aſide as uſeleſs, and glory in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of your ſtratagems.</p>
                     <p>Pardon me, my ſon, I write from the impulſe of a broken heart. I know you would ſcorn ſuch advice if ſeriouſly given, even from a father; but I have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much from ingratitude and duplicity, and have ſeen thoſe who practiſe them moſt, ſeem to ſucceed the beſt, that I would willingly ſhut my eyes on the light of day, and ſink into eternal reſt. My dear Ferdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, your father has received a wound no time can heal. Surely we muſt hope, that in the bleſt abodes of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, the ſoul retains no remembrance of what paſſed in this ſublunary ſtate; elſe certain I am, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of paradiſe itſelf would be alloyed by the retroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the ignominy I have endured, and the chains I have worn.</p>
                     <p>And what will that treaſure of my ſoul, thy adored mother, ſay? How will my Beatina bear the degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Columbus? Will not her father, (but lately reconciled to his child) again ſpurn her from him? And will not her haughty brothers and ſiſters pour their inſolent reproaches on the wife of a diſgraced, a ruined favourite? Your lovely Orrabella too! Alas! I greatly fear, whilſt we were hoſpitably entertained at her father's court, we were ungratefully paving the way for the introduction of war, rapine and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet witneſs, ye immortal Powers, I am inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. I ſought not new worlds for conqueſt, or for power; I felt, forcibly felt, the bleſſings of Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, the comforts reſulting from a commercial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with other nations. I vainly thought thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings through my means might be extended, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly wiſhed them participated by the whole world. But I am venting the ſorrows of my agonized ſoul, and forget you are a ſtranger to what has cauſed
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:034490_0030_0FFF20A743775C10"/>
them. Oh! ever, ever, may you remain a ſtranger to ſuch anguiſh. May my ſon never experience how far beyond all other miſeries which malice can inflict, or human nature ſuffer, is the torture occaſioned by the poiſoned ſting of ingratitude. But to my ſad tale.</p>
                     <p>Light pleaſant gales, and a ſmooth ſea quickly bore the caravel in which I embarked to Hiſpaniola. A certain emblem of the viciſſitudes of human life; for how often does the ſun of proſperity gild the horizon, and its delightful airs play around and faſcinate the ſenſes, whilſt the ſtorms of adverſity hang unobſerved, ready to burſt on our devoted heads.</p>
                     <p>Roldan (whom you muſt remember was appointed through my interceſſion to the government of this colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony) received me with the greateſt marks of reſpect, and a profuſion of compliments. I ought to have been upon my guard and ſuſpected his exceſſive adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His profeſſions of gratitude and attachment pained me; but as I knew the preſent affluent ſtate of himſelf and family originated from my friendſhip, I attributed all to the nobleſt motives, nor once ſuſpected, that as I held him to my boſom I was enfolding a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that waited but an opportunity to ſting me to the heart.</p>
                     <p>The morning after my arrival the natives thronged in crowds to ſee me, and in the moſt tumultuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner expreſſed their joy at my return. Roldan, with an inſidious ſmile, warned me to beware of giving them too much encouragement. "They are," ſaid he, "an encroaching ſet of wretches, and will torment you with complaints, which, as they exiſt only in their own imaginations, it is not in your power to redreſs. You had better ſpeak to them a little ſternly, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs them to their homes."</p>
                     <p>"How?" ſaid I, rather ſurpriſed, "I do not rightly underſtand you. What privilege can theſe people ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit from you or me, which they have not a right to demand? Is not this continent theirs by right of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? and is not the privilege of living here unmoleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enjoyed by us through their unſuſpecting good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the confidence they place in our honeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions?
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:034490_0031_0FFF20A9E65F3248"/>
and ſhall we abuſe this confidence, repay their hoſpitality by infringing their natural rights? Heaven forbid! If they have complaints to make, it is our duty to hear, and to the utmoſt of our power redreſs them."</p>
                     <p>As I ſpoke with fervor, I obſerved the countenance of Roldan change. A livid paleneſs overſpread his face; his eyes gleamed, his lips trembled, and every feature expreſſed a rage which he in vain attempted to conceal by a haggard ſmile.</p>
                     <p>"All is not as it ſhould be," ſaid I mentally; "I will inquire into the nature of the complaints he ſeems ſo anxious to evade. If Roldan has made an unjuſt uſe of his power, it is not our paſt friendſhip ſhall ſcreen him from my reproach, or lead me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue him in a ſtation he appears inadequate to fill."</p>
                     <p>Full of theſe thoughts, I immediately ſet an inquiry on foot concerning the general conduct of Roldan and his officers. I found they had groſsly abuſed the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er intruſted to them; that they had diſtreſſed and treated the natives in many caſes with the utmoſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity! and that this arbitrary governor had ſupported the Spaniards in every act of injuſtice or enormity they choſe to commit.</p>
                     <p>Having traced theſe grievances to their ſource, I requeſted a council might be called; and then, in the moſt forcible language I could think of, yet with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and mildneſs, I repreſented to them all the iniquity of their proceedings, conjured them to redreſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries they had committed, and to reform the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Some few ſeemed pleaſed with my remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, but the greater part heard me in ſullen ſilence.</p>
                     <p>Roldan thanked me with a ſarcaſtic ſmile for my advice; but at the ſame time told me he held his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by a commiſſion from the royal Ferdinand, and to him only was accountable for his actions. I was thunderſtruck by his ſpeech and manner, and left the council room in a perturbation of mind not eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the officers under the command of Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan in this ſettlement, was a young man of diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:034490_0032_0FFF20AC73708C70"/>
manners, named Diego. He was younger ſon to a noble family; but having diſſipated a conſiderable fortune, and from being at firſt only weak and fooliſh, having become vicious, his friends thought proper to ſolicit employment for him in the new ſettlement, and he was accordingly appointed third in command. This man I found the boſom confidant and privy counſellor of Roldan. His rapacity knew no bounds; his paſſions were his only maſter; and hurried by them to dreadful exceſſes, he committed crimes at which humanity at once bluſhed and trembled. Though the very little knowledge I had of Diego had by no means prejudiced me in his favour, I could not have ſuppoſed he would have perpetrated crimes of the blackeſt die without compunction, or that Roldan would have openly dared to ſanction his licentiouſneſs; but I was at length fatally convinced, that when vice and folly are leagued-together, there is no wickedneſs, however horrible, at which they will heſitate.</p>
                     <p>Bruna was the only child of a venerable Indian, whoſe poſſeſſions were extenſive and valuable. I had cultivated a friendſhip with the father of Bruna, when firſt the ſettlement was formed; and both myſelf and followers experienced from him the kindneſs and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention which nature, when unadulterated by art, is ever ready to offer to the friendleſs, or the ſtranger. His dwelling was at our ſervice; he ſupplied us plentifully with goat's milk, the fleſh of deer, dried maize, and other comforts of life, which, to men who had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced a tedious and weariſome voyage, were real luxuries.</p>
                     <p>Bruna at this time was a lovely child of about twelve years old; ſhe was wild and untutored; but there was ſomething ſo engaging in her manner, ſo faſcinating in her vivacity, that I could not ſee her daily without becoming inſenſibly attached to her. Her curioſity was unbounded; and the ſureſt way to become a favorite with her, was by gratifying a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity which in general was directed to laudable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. I was charmed with her artleſs thirſt for knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, and employed my leiſure moments in inſtructing
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034490_0033_0FFF20B056A77428"/>
her. But though eager to learn, that very eagerneſs counteracted her wiſhes. She was too haſty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous to allow herſelf ſufficient time to become a proficient in any thing; therefore all my attention could do, was to give her a trifling knowledge of the Spaniſh language. For when I ſpoke to her of the cuſtoms and manners of the European world, ſhe would laugh, and declare her own country manners were beſt; for ſhe could not poſſibly think any duty obliged us to conceal our thoughts, or that any cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom whatever could make it laudable to ſpeak one thing and think another. I give you this ſlight ſketch of her character, that you might not be ſurpriſed at what I have to relate concerning this Indian heroine.</p>
                     <p>It was about ten days after my arrival, as I was walking a few miles from the plantation, and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the improvement agriculture had made on the face of this beautiful fertile continent, when in a low-built hovel I ſaw an ancient Indian ſeated on the ground; his elbows reſted on his kneeſ, his hands claſped his forehead, as his head reclined upon them. I ſtopped for a moment to contemplate a figure ſo ſtriking; and as I pauſed, the ſighs that broke from his agitated boſom, went to my very heart. The noiſe I undeſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly made as I moved nearer the hovel, occaſioned him to raiſe his head. I was amazed; it was the father of Bruna! He gazed for a moment eagerly upon me; then ſpringing forward, fell on his knees, kiſſed my hands, my feet, the very hem of my garments. In vain I attempted to raiſe him; he proſtrated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the earth, and laid my hand upon his head, in token of owning me for his maſter.</p>
                     <p>Pray riſe, my worthy friend, ſaid I, and tell me what is the meaning of this humiliation? who has cauſed the change I perceive to have taken place in your circumſtances?</p>
                     <p>"Chriſtians! Chriſtians!" replied he with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, gnaſhing his teeth as he ſpoke, "they have plundered me of my wealth, torn my child from my arms; but you are come, and I ſhall be revenged."
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:034490_0034_0FFF20B1EA814578"/>
The confidence this poor Indian ſeemed to have in my integrity, filled my eyes with tears.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," ſaid I, "tell me who has treated you thus barbarouſly; and if I have the power, you ſhall have ample reſtitution," "Alas!" cried the old man, "of what avail will be the reſtitution of my wealth, unleſs you can reſtore my child, my darling to my arms pure and unſpotted?"</p>
                     <p>He then informed me that ſoon after the arrival of Roldan at the ſettlement, an entire change took place in the government; vice was tolerated, private proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not in the leaſt regarded, but every thing ſubjected to the lawleſs power of the new governor and his favourite.</p>
                     <p>Diego ſaw Bruna; her beauty kindled in his boſom an unholy flame; he ſolicited her love and was rejected. He dared attempt her chaſtity, and was repulſed with ſcorn. That moment ſealed the ruin of her father. Diego complained to Roldan, that the father of Bruna refuſed to ſubmit to the Spaniſh laws, and had even treated him with contempt and deriſion, who had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of his favourite; and driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unoffending Indian from a home he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited from his anceſtors, ſeized on all his valuable property, oſtensibly in the name of the Spaniſh King, but in reality to enrich his own private coffers.</p>
                     <p>Bruna, unknowing to what danger ſhe expoſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and thinking this piece of injuſtice was entirely the act of Diego, flew to the governor for redreſs. Her tears, her innocent ſupplications, had no effect on the obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heart of Roldan! he inhumanly rejected her ſuit, detained her perſon, and gave her into the power of Diego. This horrid ſcene was acted but the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my arrival.</p>
                     <p>"You ſhall have juſtice, old man," ſaid I; "come with me." He followed me to the houſe of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor. At ſight of him, Roldan ſtarted and turned pale; but ſoon recovering himſelf, he aſked him, in a ſtern voice, what he did there. "He comes for juſtice,"
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:034490_0035_0FFF20B4B6F30440"/>
ſaid I, "he comes to demand reſtitution of his prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, of which he has been robbed, and his daughter, who is unjuſtly detained from him." "The artful wretch has impoſed on you," ſaid Roldan fiercely, "but go, ſlave," turning to the Indian, get from my ſight, and be thankful your inſolence does not coſt you your life. I was preparing to reply in a proper manner to this inhuman tyrant, when Bruna ruſhed into the apartment, her hair diſhevelled her garments diſordered, and her eyes wild with terror. She threw herſelf into her father's arms, and gave way to a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent guſh of tears; but the tenderneſs that ſeemed to overcome her was but momentary. She recovered herſelf, and raiſing her head, looked round with a kind of ſullen dignity. Her eyes met mine. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſhe knew me, I offered her my hand, and was proceeding to comfort her; but with a rejecting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe put back my proffered hand, and covering her face with both her own, turned from me. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly comprehended the extent of the injury ſhe had ſuſtained, and my ſoul ſhuddered within me.</p>
                     <p>Roldan's agitation was too great to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> notice; he attempted twice to ſpeak, but words were denied him. His pale countenance betrayed his guilty heart.</p>
                     <p>At length he heſitatingly told Bruna, if that was her father, and ſhe had forcibly been detained from him, ſhe was now at liberty to return home. The poor girl ſtood for a moment the image of mute deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; then raiſing her hands and eyes to heaven, cried, "Home! No! never! Bruna is the daughter of the chaſte Lilah, and was inſtructed by the wiſe precepts of her father, to prize her honour above her life. Their manſion was the dwelling of innocence, piety, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and never will their wretched daughter carry pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thither." Then turning toward her father, ſhe made as though ſhe would have embraced him; but with a kind of involuntary ſhudder, ſhrunk again from him, and drawing a dagger ſhe had concealed in her boſom, plunged it in her heart.</p>
                     <p>This ſudden, unexpected event threw the governor and all his attendants into the utmoſt confuſion. The ſervants, terrified, opened the doors; and a
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:034490_0036_0FFF20B942B14CF0"/>
concourſe of people, Spaniards as well as natives, ruſhed in. The bleeding form of the lovely Bruna, the agonizing ſorrow of her father, acted like a taliſman on the minds of the people; and in a few hours the whole ſettlement was in a ſtate of inſurrection. Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice! juſtice! was the cry: Deliver up Diego to our power, or we will extirpate the race of Chriſtians from amongſt us. Roldan in this exigence applied to me to quiet the enraged multitude. I ſpoke to them; I promiſed they ſhould have ample juſtice! I ſoothed them by ſpeaking of the virtues of Bruna, and execrating the author of her ruin, and conſequent death; and at length perſuaded them to depart quietly to their homes; aſſuring them that Diego was in confinement, and ſhould be made to ſuffer, to the extent of the law, the puniſhment due to his crimes.</p>
                     <p>After a day of ſuch unuſual agitation, I retired to my apartment. Fatigued in body, and diſtreſſed in mind, ſleep was a ſtranger to my eyes, and I was rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating on the beſt mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Reſiſtance or remonſtrance was vain; they were the tools of arbitrary power, and I ſubmitted in ſilence. They manacled my hands and feet, and putting a gag in my mouth, conveyed me on board a veſſel ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the harbour. Yes, Ferdinando, your father was chained, and ſent to his native country as a traitor.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as I was on board, and the guard departed, I found, by the motion of the veſſel, we were under way; the wind was fair, and ſhe left the ſhores of Hiſpaniola with rapidity.</p>
                     <p>About two hours after daylight, the captain entered the cabin where I was, and entreated my pardon for having been obliged to act contrary to his inclinations. "I am but a ſervant," ſaid he, "and muſt obey thoſe whom the king has ſet over me. I am ordered to keep you a cloſe priſoner till our arrival in Spain; but here I ſhall dare to tranſgreſs my orders ſo far as
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:034490_0037_0FFF20BADD6281B8"/>
to releaſe you from your chains." He then advanced to take off the inſulting badges of my diſgrace, but I forbid him. "No, Don Sancho," ſaid I, "if I am guilty, I will ſuffer the ſentence my ſovereign may think proper to paſs on me with reſignation. If I have been unjuſtly accuſed, to him do I look for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; into his preſence will I go, loaded with theſe ignominious bonds, and when my innocence is proved, from his hands only will I accept of liberty."</p>

Comfort and conſole your angel mother ere you leave her. Embrace your charming wife for me. Whilſt I live, you ſhare my heart amongſt you. The ſtrong ſenſe I have of my preſent injuries, is only for your ſakes? for of what conſequence would the ſmiles or frowns of princes be to me, were not my wife and children to be involved in my diſgrace, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted by my ſucceſs and honour.

                     <p>HAD I a conveyance, ſwift as my own impatience, to forward to my revered mother the joyful tidings of my father's triumph over his enemies, the wings of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:034490_0038_0FFF20BC6A351D60"/>
the wind would be too tardy to bear this to your hands. Yes, my dear mother, Columbus, the great, the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Columbus, is reſtored to all his former dignity, and even freſh honours are heaped upon him. But I know you wiſh me to be particular; and how can I be more pleaſingly employed than in recounting the noble conduct of a father, and obeying the commands of the beſt of mothers?</p>
                     <p>When in obedience to my father's mandate I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to court, and requeſted an audience with the royal Iſſabelle, I was, within a few hours after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requeſt was made, admitted. An unuſual gloom. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt approaching to ſeverity, was caſt over a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which heretofore had only on me beamed ſmiles of benevolence. It chilled me to the heart. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with extreme agitation; and, bending one knee to the ground, preſented the ſealed paper which was incloſed in my father's letter. The queen pauſed for a moment, ſeemingly irreſolute whether or not to break the ſeal. My agitation increaſed, my knees trembled, my heart beat violently. My diſorder did not paſs unnoticed. "Calm your fears, Ferdinando," ſaid Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabelle, as ſhe at length opened the letter; "your fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er has, it is true, powerful enemies; but if his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is apparent, he will ever find in me a ſteady, powerful friend." I bowed in grateful acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her goodneſs, and ſhe in ſilence peruſed the letter. A crimſon glow-overſpread her face as ſhe read; it ſeemed the glow of reſentment, as folding the paper ſhe unlocked a ſmall cabinet, and depoſited it amongſt ſome other writings.</p>
                     <p>"You have a letter from Columbus," ſaid ſhe, "permit me to ſee it," I preſented it. "Go," ſaid ſhe, taking it from me, "retire in peace; the ſucceſs of my hero has awakened the envy of thoſe who had not courage to follow his example, he has been traduced to the king; but Iſabelle will not ſuffer a man, whoſe merit ſhe eſteems and whoſe cauſe ſhe eſpouſes, to be injured with impunity."</p>
                     <p>Charmed by theſe condeſcending expreſſions, I bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and retired. In about two hours, I received a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:034490_0039_0FFF20BFE0A37030"/>
ſigned by the queen's hand, ordering me to repair immediately to the port, and conduct my injured fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to her preſence. "Take off his chains," were the words, "and let him come to his ſovereign, attended with all the reſpect and honour a man deſerves, who, whilſt he was adding new territories to our crown, whilſt he had it in his power to heap up mines of wealth for his own coffers, forgot not the cauſe of humanity, and rather than countenance one act of tyranny, haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arded the diſpleaſure of his king, the loſs of his fortune, nay even life itſelf. But his ſovereign ſhall reward him."</p>
                     <p>Her majeſty's own ſervants and mules attended my commands; and quick as it was poſſible, I purſued my journey, and flew to the arms of my father. Our meeting was beyond deſcription. The agitation of his mind had affected his health; his countenance was pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> and dejected; his perſon neglected. I offered to take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> his fetters, ſhewed him the queen's mandate, but in vain. "I will go to my royal miſtreſs," ſaid he, "but I will go as I am." When he ſaw the ſervants that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to conduct him—" Poor pageantry, "ſaid he, "pitiful recompenſe for the injuries I have received! No! no! I will have no attendants. I am a diſgraced man, and will enter the metropolis with as little noiſe as poſſible; obſcurity and ſilence ſuits beſt with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour. But mark me, my ſon, as my diſgrace has been public, ſo ſhall be my juſtification." There was ſuch majeſty in his manner, ſuch fixed reſolution in his looks, I dared not oppoſe him. I diſmiſſed the retinue that attended; and with only my own ſervant, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied my father, by the moſt unfrequented roads, to the court of Ferdinand and Iſabelle.</p>
                     <p>It was about twelve o'clock when we arrived, and orders were given for our immediate admiſſion. Never ſhall I forget the countenance of the royal Iſabelle, when ſhe beheld her hero enter thus encumbered with the teſtimonies of his diſgrace. The king and queen were ſeated at the upper end of the preſence chamber, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by many noblemen and cavaliers, tried friends of my father, and ſome whom I knew to be his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Columbus entered the door a few ſteps, then
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:034490_0040_0FFF20C17171CE70"/>
making a full ſtop, bent his knee to the ground, and raiſing his manacled hands, attempted to ſpeak; but pride, reſentment, wounded honour, ſwelled his brave heart nearly to burſting; and, ſpite of his endeavours to ſuppreſs them, the ſcalding tears rolled down his pale face. It was a reproach more poignant than words could have conveyed.</p>
                     <p>Iſabelle roſe from her ſeat, her own eyes gliſtening with the dew of ſenſibility; and advancing to my father, raiſed him. "Riſe, my brave admiral," ſaid ſhe, "and let thy queen take off theſe fetters, of which ſhe has more cauſe to be aſhamed than you have." Then leading him to the king, "Royal Sir," ſaid ſhe, "how ſhall we recompenſe this worthy man for the underſerved humiliation he has received?" "Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus," ſaid Ferdinand, "I bluſh for the indignities of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered you in the perſon of my repreſentative; but you ſhall have ample revenge. Go to your wife and friends, indulge awhile in eaſe, and recruit your ſtrength and ſpirits; in the mean time, I will give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the preparation of a fleet ſuperior to any you have yet commanded; in it you ſhall return to our new colonies, of the whole of which I from this moment create you viceroy, giving you unlimited power to create or diſplace officers, and diſtribute rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at pleaſure. I know it is a power you will not abuſe. Go, valiant chief, and reign over a people, whom you have conquered by practiſing humanity, not the arts of war. But take thoſe fetters from my ſight," continued he; "that Columbus ever wore them, will caſt a laſting ſhade on my memory; and ages yet unborn, when they ſhall hear the tale rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will accuſe Ferdinand of ingratitude."</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me, gracious fire," ſaid my father, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his foot on the chains as one of the guards at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to remove them; "theſe fetters are mine. I purchaſed them with fatigue and danger, went through many perils by ſea and land to obtain them, nor will I lightly part with them.

                     <p>Ferdinand was ſilent. Iſabelle ſmiled; it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Their majeſties then left the chamber followed by the court, and in a moment I was locked in the arms of my father, and mingled with him ſome of the moſt delicious tears I ever ſhed.

Yes, my revered mother, I ſhall behold once more all the deareſt objects of my affections united in one family circle.

               <p>"ALAS," ſaid Columbia, laying down the paper, "I now ſee the ſource from whence ſprang all my dear mother's ſorrow. She was bred in the Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olic perſuaſion, and my father tempted her to diſobey the rigid commands of her guardian, forfeit her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, embrace his faith, and, leaving all her connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions

in Spain, follow him to England. Poor, bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beatina, little did you think, when making your will, that you ſigned the mandate for your grandchild's miſery. For what might not avarice tempt the ſon of the marquis Guidova to do? Might not he wink at a marriage that was to inveſt him with all the vaſt wealth of the unfortunate Iſabelle? But perhaps I injure him; he may be innocent of ſuch an intention; my miſguided parents themſelves may be alone to blame. Yet knowing and adoring them as I do, how can I believe that poſſible?" Thus was Columbia bewildered with conjecture. At length, thinking the manuſcript might ſatisfy her curioſity, and remove her doubts, ſhe again addreſſed herſelf to the peruſal of it.</p>
               <p>"It was the beginning of the year 1500, that the great Columbus embarked on board the fleet which Ferdinand had ordered to be equipped for his ſervice, (with all the attendance, ceremonies, &amp;c. cuſtomary on ſuch occaſions,) as viceroy of the new-diſcovered continent. Ferdinando was appointed governor of the ſettlements in Peru. Myſelf, the princeſs Orrabella, and her ſon Chriſtopher, embarked with them. The king, queen, and all the court at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended us to the water ſide; a vaſt concourſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple crowded the ſhore, wearying Heaven with prayers for our happineſs whilſt abſent, and our ſafe return. At parting from his auguſt patroneſs, Columbus knelt to kiſs her hand. She raiſed him, and throwing a gold chain over his neck, by which her own portrait was ſuſpended, "Go, my invincible hero," ſaid ſhe, "go, and enjoy the reward of your labours. And if we never meet again on this ſide eternity, let my memory ever be dear to you; for whilſt you live, Columbus, you will never find a truer friend than you have found in Iſabelle." As ſhe finiſhed ſpeaking, ſhe inclined her head towards him; he reſpectfully ſaluted her cheek. "Heaven ever bleſs and defend my royal miſtreſs and her auguſt conſort," ſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus. "And protect my hero," added the queen. Then turning haſtily to hide her tears, ſhe ruſhed into
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:034490_0045_0FFF20CDB875BC40"/>
the midſt of her attendants, and retired. Yes, my child, the good, the noble-hearted, royal Iſabelle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired; and we ſaw her no more. Before we returned, ſhe ſlept in peace; but her name ſhall be revered to after ages. The brave and worthy will remember it with gratitude; and the pious tears of millions yet unborn, ſhall ſanctify her memory to all eternity.</p>
               <p>"It was determined at our departure, that the whole fleet ſhould accompany Ferdinando and Orra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella to her native coaſt; and having ſeen him ſafely ſettled in his government, proceed to Hiſpaniola, and ſend Roldan and his licentious aſſociates home in the ſame diſgraceful circumſtances in which he had before ungratefully involved Columbus. A fine ſeaſon fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured our voyage; and in leſs than two months from our embarkation, we ſaw the fertile ſhores of Peru riſe upon our ſight. The joy of Orrabella as ſhe beheld her native land was beyond all bounds. "I ſhall ſee my father and mother," ſaid ſhe, "and embrace my dear ſiſters; I ſhall ſit beſide them for hours, and relate to them the wonders I have ſeen in your world; and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they know my lips abhor falſehood, they would think ſome of the ſtrange things I have to relate were nothing more than fictions. Then careſſing her child, ſhe would talk of the joy of her father's ſubjects when they ſhould behold her offſpring, whom ſhe fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved was born to ſway the ſceptre of Peru.</p>
               <p>"It was on the ſecond day after we had diſcovered land, that we reached the deſired harbour. But as we drew near to ſhouts of joy welcomed our approach; no king, no guards, no exulting ſubjects appeared to greet us. All was ſilent, all was deſolate. Our hearts ſunk within us. "They are at Quito," ſaid Orrabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la; but her pallid countenance and tremulous voice betrayed that ſhe hardly dared hope what ſhe aſſerted. "We will land, however," ſaid Columbus; accordingly the boat was hoiſted out, and we proceeded to the ſhore. When within a few yards of the beach, a party of arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men appeared. Their dreſs, their arms, beſpoke them Spaniards. Our fleet bore the ſtandard of Spain, we could not fear our countrymen as foes. Columbus
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:034490_0046_0FFF20CF7257A260"/>
addreſſed them from the boat in terms of amity; they returned a haughty anſwer. However, they permitted us to land. But Oh! Iſabelle, what were our feelings, when we diſcovered this beautiful continent had been invaded by a party of freebooters; its hoſpitable inhabitants rifled of all their treaſures, many of them maſſacred, and the remainder driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the interior parts of the country. The palace of Orrozombo was converted into a den for theſe robbers, where riot and intemperance reigned without control. The ſettlers left by Columbus, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the intereſt of the king and natives, were driven with them to ſeek an aſylum in the woods and mountains.</p>
               <p>The chief of theſe banditti was named Garcias, fierce, cruel and vindictive. He received Columbus with a gloomy haughtineſs of demeanor, and when queſtioned as to his right in theſe dominions, he ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully replied, "By the right of conqueſt; not by a ridiculous family compact with a ſavage." Orrabella was preſent when Garcias thus inſulted her family. "Inſolent Spaniard," ſaid ſhe, her eyes darting light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, her fine face and perſon uncommonly animated by the fire of reſentment; "inſolent Spaniard, the king my father, though you term him a ſavage, was your ſuperior in every virtue! What though unpoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he had but nature for his guide? that nature taught him humanity, honour, patience, fortitude, and Orro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zombo would have died rather than deceive a friend, or inſult a fallen foe. Oh my father! my father!" continued ſhe, burſting into an agony of tears, "where are you now? Where is my revered mother, my poor defenceleſs ſiſters? Tell me, barbarian, have you entirely extirpated the race of the children of the ſun, or do you hold the lawful king of this territory in bondage, whilſt you uſurp his rights, and riot in the ſpoils of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted ſubjects? If ſo, Oh lead me to the dungeon where you have confined him, that I may weep in his arms, and die with grief to ſee my king, my father, a ſlave to the nation he had vainly hoped to have held in eternal bonds of friendſhip, and gave his child as a

hoſtage of his faith towards them. Alas! what hoſtage did he require to inſure their faith to him? None; his noble heart harboured not deceit, nor could ſuſpect it in another."</p>
               <p>From theſe pathetic remonſtrances and lamentations of Orrabella, we perceived ſhe ſuſpected Columbus and Ferdinando were knowing to the voyage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent invaſion of Garcias and his lawleſs band; but in this ſhe was ſoon undeceived. For Columbus, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated by the inſolence of Garcias, threatened him with ſpeedy vengeance unleſs he informed him where Orro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zombo and the royal family were. Garcias laughed at his menaces, but on being informed that Columbus was deputed viceroy of all the new-diſcovered lands on that ſide the globe, and being requeſted to do homage to him as the repreſentative of his royal maſter Ferdinand, or expect the puniſhment due to a pirate, a traitor and a robber, he became more humble, and many of his followers, underſtanding the dangerous predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which they ſtood, declared themſelves ready to ſupport the new viceroy in the diſcharge of his duty as the king's delegate, and as ſuch ſwore allegiance to him.</p>
               <p>It was then we learnt that Garcias Du Ponty, a Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian by birth, young, diſſolute and ambitious, having heard of the ſucceſs of Columbus, and the vaſt treaſures himſelf and followers had brought from the new world, reſolved to make an experiment himſelf; and having, by promiſes of large future reward, and ſome rich preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents artfully beſtowed, won over an experienced mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r (who had been the laſt voyage with your grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and returned in the ſhip with Orrabella) to undertake to navigate his veſſel, and give directions to the pilots of the reſt of the fleet how to follow him; Garcias prevailed on a number of young Caſtilian noblemen and gentlemen to embark on the expedition. They applied for no letters of leave from Ferdinand; for had they, it is moſt probable they would have been prevented purſuing this (in the end) ruinous voyage.</p>
               <p>A large fleet collected from the different ports of Spain, met in the Mediterranean ſea many other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iners
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:034490_0048_0FFF20D633E95268"/>
who wiſhed to purſue their good fortune, and, not being content to wait till another fleet ſhould be ſent out by the king's orders, were eager to embark with theſe licentious noblemen, and direct their courſe to the land where they imagined they were to become petty princes, and revel in all the luxuries which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could afford, or unbounded wealth ſupply.</p>
               <p>This fleet was on the ocean at the time Columbus returned from Hiſpaniola. They had a more ſpeedy voyage than their inhuman deſigns deſerved; but Heaven often permits the wicked for a while to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that the ſucceſs of their lawleſs plans may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their puniſhment, and the reverſe of fortune coming unexpected, may fall the heavier on them. And thus it proved with Garcias Du Ponty and his followers.</p>
               <p>On their arrival on the coaſt of Peru, they found the king with his family, as was their cuſtom, ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſummer at their palace on the banks of a river that mingles its waters with the ocean. Garcias and his party landed. Orrozombo, and indeed the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſettlers, believed them to be a party ſent by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus to bring ſupplies to the colony, and received them with open arms and every mark of affection. But alas, they were too fatally undeceived, when theſe invaders of the rights of nature and the law of nations aſſumed the authority of maſters, exacting enormous ſums as tribute from the king, and forcing his ſubjects to labour in the mines, often rewarding thoſe labours (when the produce of them was not equal to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate avarice of their deſires) with death.</p>
               <p>Orrozombo, wearied by their repeated inſolence, and terrified by their rapacity, entreated them to leave the continent, offering them immenſe treaſures. But they were not thus to be ſatisfied. They proceeded from one ſtep to another, till neither age nor ſex be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a ſafeguard from their cruelties. The chaſte wife and the pure virgin were violated in the preſence of their parents and protectors, who, confined by theſe inhuman monſters, had not the power to reſcue or avenge them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:034490_0049_0FFF20D7C3899420"/>
Human nature, however patient, could not tamely endure ſuch enormities. The natives and the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards united their forces to endeavour to expel the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders; but it was too late. They had ſent a part of their company to ſearch the interior country for mines. Theſe returned, boaſting of the ravages they had committed, and diſplaying the ſpoils they had gleaned. They had plundered every village through which they paſſed, and then ſet fire to it. Thouſands of innocent families, thus deprived of their homes and all means of ſupport, fled into the mountains, where many periſhed through famine, and the reſt dragged on a wretched life, living on wild fruit, and what game their bows and arrows produced, ſleeping in caves or receſſes of the rocks, and too often their miſerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence was terminated by the fangs of the tyger or the lion. Fluſhed with ſucceſs, the Caſtilians meditated on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how to make an entire conqueſt of the country.</p>
               <p>Undiſciplined in the arts of war, and though experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing its effect every hour, ſtill unſuſpecting of treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery,—the Peruvians were at this time, by the art of the Spaniards, induced to throw aſide their arms, and agree to terms of peace with Garcias, who aſſumed a graver demeanor, and made ſome ſlight conceſſions to Orrozombo for the miſconduct of his companions, who by a few weeks of quiet regular behaviour lulled him into ſecurity; then, when in full confidence of the faith of their enemies, the Peruvians, who had been celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the annual feaſt of the ſun at which theſe ſtrangers had been admitted to participate; then, when parting from them in amity they tranquilly ſunk to reſt; then did the blood-thirſty Garcias and his deteſted crew ruſh on the defenceleſs victims, and maſſacre them without mercy and without remorſe.</p>
               <p>Oh thou Power eternal, whoſe name is a tower of ſtrength, and whoſe mercy is as infinite as thy wiſdom! what ſhall we ſay, that theſe barbarians ſhould call themſelves thy ſervants, and bear the glorious appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians? Alas, miſtaken men, the God you ſerve delighteth not in blood; his precept and example taught peace, mercy and good will to all mankind.
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:034490_0050_0FFF20D9500DF088"/>
But the Peruvians were idolaters! cries the miſguided enthuſiaſt; and ſo was Garcias and his followers; their idols were avarice, ambition, luxury, and lawleſs paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; to them they bent the knee, and on their altars did they ſacrifice millions of innocent people.—But I digreſs.</p>
               <p>Du Ponty, though the wretch his actions proclaim him, was handſome in his perſon, gay, lively and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant; his fair outſide attracted the notice of Alzira, the youngeſt ſiſter of Orrabella. Alzira was equally lovely as her ſiſter, but ſhe poſſeſſed not that greatneſs of ſoul, that intrepid firmneſs which characterized your mother. By nature ſoft, gentle and complying, when the ſubtle Caſtilian, who read her paſſion in her admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes, ſued for ſome token of her favour, ſhe heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to own her love, and confeſs, could her father be brought to approve it, to be the wife of Du Ponty would conſtitute her chief felicity.</p>
               <p>But Garcias had not an idea of an honourable union; he meant to conquer her father's kingdom; and had it in contemplation to degrade the fair Alzira to the ſtation of a ſlave, for the amuſement of his looſer hours. On the night of the horrid maſſacre, Garcias was purpoſely in the apartment of the princeſs, where he was frequently privately admitted after her parents were retired to reſt. Alzira, who was liſtening to the adulating voice of her lover, did not at firſt attend to the confuſed murmur that ran through the palace on the entrance of the Spaniards; but a ſudden ſhriek, that ſeemed to come from the apartment of her mother, rouſed her dormant ſenſes. She ſtarted, and would have run to the aſſiſtance of her parents, whom ſhe imagined were ſuddenly taken ill, but reiterated ſhrieks which now iſſued from every room in the palace, made her pauſe, and ſhe became a motionleſs ſtatue of horror.</p>
               <p>"The palace is beſet," cried Garcias, "let me bear you, lovely Alzira, to a place of ſafety; I will then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the aſſiſtance of your father," "Oh no! now, now reſcue him, or let me die with him," was all ſhe could ſay, before Du Ponty bore her in his arms, out of the chamber, and down the ſtairs. At the foot of theſe
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:034490_0051_0FFF20DBC52B9FA8"/>
ſtairs ſhe ſaw (by the light of torches which were every where flaming round) her father dragged by the hair of his head; whilſt an inhuman wretch, regardleſs of his grey hairs and defenceleſs ſtate, plunged a poniard in his boſom. Alzira, driven almoſt to madneſs at the ſight, ſprang from the arms of Garcias, and threw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into thoſe of the dying monarch. He knew his child, preſſed her to his boſom, faintly articulated a bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on her, and expired.</p>
               <p>Alzira's ſenſes forſook her. In that ſtate ſhe was borne to the tent of her betrayer. The ſcene that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed is too horrid for repetition! Morning dawned, and the ill-fated princeſs awoke to a perfect ſenſe of all the miſeries of her ſituation. She wiſhed for death, but all means of accelerating that period was removed from her. She once conceived the thought of refuſing all food, but had not reſolution to perſiſt. Garcias was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and kind; pretended to mourn with her the fate of her parents: She, not fully acquainted with his treachery, liſtened to his ſoothings, was conſoled, and endured life for his ſake. But uninterrupted poſſeſſion brought on ſatiety, and at length indifference and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. Du Ponty neglected and treated her harſhly. She felt her ſituation, but ſhe was now a mother, and more than ever attached to the father of her child; ſhe dragged on a wretched exiſtence, without joy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope, without even a dawn of comfort.</p>
               <p>The natives of Peru who had eſcaped the ſwords of the Caſtilians on that memorable night, failed not to attribute their miſfortunes to their unhappy ſovereign Orrozombo; he had been ſlack in the obſervance of ſome of the ceremonious devotions directed to be paid to their deity, the Sun; he had even doubted whether their religion was the true religion; he had refuſed to dedicate one of his daughters to the ſervice of their god; he had married the heireſs of his crown and kingdom to a ſtranger, who abſolutely denied the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the power they worſhipped, and called their rites and ceremonies, abſurdities and ſuperſtitions; and had ſuffered this ſtranger to carry her with him to a diſtant land. Theſe, in the eyes of the unenlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:034490_0052_0FFF20DFC8C967A8"/>
Peruvians, were heinous offences, and had drawn down the wrath of their deity upon them; and thus, for the crimes of an individual, did they fooliſhly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine a whole nation was puniſhed.</p>
               <p>It was at this period our fleet arrived, but the name of Spaniard and of Chriſtian had become hateful to the ears of the natives; not one therefore appeared to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe the cauſe of Columbus, imagining no doubt that they ſhould but expel one tyrant to make room for another. Some few ventured by ſtealth to come and ſee their princeſs; but their ſpirits were depreſſed, and their expreſſions of love and duty conſequently cold and languid. When ſhe preſented her ſon to them as their rightful king, they would ſhake their heads, and cry emphatically, "He is a Chriſtian and a Spaniard."</p>
               <p>Whilſt Columbus was ardently labouring to reduce the Spaniards to ſome degree of ſubjection and order, at the ſame time ſtriving to draw the natives back to the duty and allegiance they owed the princeſs, the treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous Du Ponty, who had for ſome time worn the maſk of friendſhip in combination with ſome of the leaders of the banditti, had laid an infernal plot to burn our fleet, and then, having the few that might at the time be on ſhore entirely in their power, oblige them to ſubmit to whatever terms they pleaſed to offer.</p>
               <p>But this plot was providentially diſcovered by a young Peruvian maid, who, detained in the palace by Garcias to attend on Alzira, though too young to become a prey to any of his officers or aſſociates, was yet old enough to deteſt their actions, weep over the ruin of her native country, and pray for ſome propitious hour to arrive, when its enemies might be puniſhed. She had overheard Du Ponty diſcourſing with one of his comrades on their intended plan, on the very night before it was to be put in execution; and, waiting till all was wrapt in ſilence, ſhe ſtole from her apartment, and came to our tent. Having diſcloſed what knowledge ſhe had obtained of their deſigns, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabella told her ſhe ſhould ſtay with us, and become one of her attendants; but ſhe laid her hand on her heart and cried, "No! I cannot;" then looking ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:034490_0053_0FFF20E15413C540"/>
in the face of the princeſs, ſhe cried, "Poor Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zira! ſhe is alive; ſhe is miſerable! I will live or die with her." "Alive! my ſiſter alive!" ſaid Orra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella, ſtarting from her ſeat; lead me to her; I will deliver her, or ſhare her fate."</p>
               <p>The impatience of the princeſs was only to be ſtayed by the remonſtrance of her huſband and his father. "Your precipitancy, my love," cried Ferdinando, "may ruin all. Our enemies are now wrapt in ſleep; the time is favourable; we muſt repay treachery with treachery; fall upon them whilſt they are unprepared, and make them priſoners."</p>
               <p>This reſolution taken, Ferdinando took a ſmall boat, and, going to the ſhips, ordered from them a number of men, who were landed at different times, in ſeveral boats. The officers were informed of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias's intended treachery; the private ſoldiers and ſailors were not told of it, leſt the ſpirit of revenge might be more powerful than the reſpect they bore their commander, and tempt them in the firſt moment of paſſion to commit outrages at which they would have cauſe to bluſh hereafter. Columbus diſpatched parties to the dwellings of the principal officers; theſe parties he took the command of himſelf. Ferdinando was appointed with a ſtrong guard to inveſt the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace, which Du Ponty had made his own reſidence ever ſince the night, when he put its unoffending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates to the ſword. Ferdinando knew every apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, every ſecret room in it; and the private entrance by which the ill-fated Alzira uſed to admit her lover, was pointed out by the Indian girl.</p>
               <p>No perſuaſions, however urgent, could prevail on Orrabella not to accompany her huſband, who, anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious for her ſafety, and more ſo on account of her ſituation, (for ſhe almoſt daily expected to preſent him with another pledge of mutual affection) earneſtly entreated her not to go, promiſing to conduct her ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in ſafety to her—but in vain. Orrabella was not eaſily to be perſuaded from doing what ſhe conceived a duty. As I found her determined to go, I reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to accompany her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:034490_0054_0FFF20E3CDB5E340"/>
Through a ſmall gate, at the utmoſt extent of the garden, we were all admitted, and about twenty yards from the houſe entered a door that appeared to be fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſide of a green ſloping bank; this opened in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an arched paſſage, which led to the cellars of the palace, which we traverſed with no little perturbation; and, aſcending a flight of ſtairs, found ourſelves in a ſpacious hall; when the young Indian, taking hold of Orrabella's hand, led her to the left, placing her finger on her mouth, in token of ſilence. I followed; and, entering a room in the midſt of which glimmered a pale lamp, perceived by its feeble beams, and elegant female habited in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eruvian dreſs, kneeling on the floor beſide a bed, on which lay a ſleeping infant. Her long hair hung negligently over her neck and ſhoulders; her arms were croſſed on the bed, and her head reſted between them. At the moment we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, her ſorrows were lulled into forgetfulneſs. At the noiſe we made, (though it would have been ſcarcely perceptible to another ear, yet miſery is wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſtarts at every ſound) ſhe raiſed her languid head, gazed earneſtly at Orrabella, who ſunk on her knees beſide her. "Siſter! ſiſter!" ſaid ſhe; and, throwing herſelf into her arms, fainted on her boſom.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we were buſied with Alzira, Ferdinando and his followers made good uſe of their time. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the caſtle were in a deep ſleep, partly the effects of intemperance; ſo profound were their ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that many of them felt the chains on their hands and feet, before they could recover ſenſe ſufficient to know who had put them on. Some few made a faint reſiſtance; but theſe were ſoon intimidated into ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and in ſuch quiet did every party proceed, that before the dawn of day all the leaders, and a great number of their followers, were in confinement, and at the mercy of Columbus.</p>
               <p>In the morning, the incidents of the night ſpread terror and conſternation through all the Caſtilian par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and thoſe who were ſtill at liberty, readily vowed ſubmiſſion to the viceroy, in hopes by ſo doing to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their lives and fortunes, as they imagined Du

Ponty and his officers would be immediately execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their treaſures ſeized on as public property. But in this they were miſtaken; Columbus wiſhed to ſecure his own and followers lives and properties, but he did not arrogate to himſelf the right of plunging a multitude of human beings into eternity, becauſe they oppoſed his plans, or had been blindly led by an unprincipled commander to perpetrate actions their better reaſon would have ſhuddered at.</p>
               <p>During the remainder of this eventful night, Alzira informed her ſiſter of the circumſtances I have already related to you. Orrabella's ſoul was in a flame at the thought of her ſiſter's diſhonour. She finiſhed her melancholy recital in theſe words; "When I heard of your arrival, my dear ſiſter, a gleam of joy ſhot through my boſom; but reflection told me I had little reaſon to rejoice, for I was diſhonoured, ſtained! and could I hope to be preſſed to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

I knew I had forfeited all right to your affection, and I reſolved ſedulouſly to ſeclude myſelf from your ſight, ſuffering you to believe I had been ſacrificed on the ſame night with my parents and ſiſters." "Would to Heaven you had," ſaid Orrabella, fervently; "for it is a thouſand times more afflicting to my heart to ſee you thus, dragging on a miſerable life, with public loſs of honour, than to ſee you covered with wounds, and breathing out your ſoul in agony. Oh! my poor ruined Alzira, where was the ſpirit that was wont to animate the children of the ſun when the wretch firſt diſcloſed his impious propoſal? Why had not my ſiſter raiſed her arm, and ſtruck the monſter dead?" "Alas!" replied the weeping princeſs, "I loved him with ſuch enthuſiaſtic fervour, that I would have given my own life to preſerve his.

"Raſh woman," ſaid I, ſnatching the dagger from her, juſt as the trembling Alzira had extended her hand to receive it; "raſh woman, what is it you do? Have you forgot that the precepts of the Chriſtian religion forbid ſelf-deſtruction?" "So, (ſhe replied haughtily) does it forbid murder, rapine, fraud, perjury, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Du Ponty, I think, profeſſes Chriſtianity. Oh! madam! madam! the profeſſors of your religion muſt practiſe themſelves what they would teach others, before you can hope to make ſincere converts." The arguments was unanſwerable, and I remained ſilent.</p>
               <p>Tranquillity was now in a great meaſure reſtored; it was reſolved the leaders of this lawleſs expedition ſhould be ſent immediately home to Spain.

                     <p>WHILST preparations were making for two of the fleet to return to Europe, that Garcias and his followers might, from the juſtice of a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar court of judicature, receive their ſentence, your mother preſented Ferdinando with a daughter, who (by promiſe given to the queen of Spain on our leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that kingdom) was chriſtened Iſabelle. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the baptiſmal benediction when but four days old; for the diſtreſs of mind under which your mother
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:034490_0057_0FFF20ED2F5F3668"/>
had laboured, had affected the health of the infant, and its life was very doubtful.</p>
                     <p>It was nearly a fortnight from the birth of this daughter, when as Alzira, your father, and myſelf, were ſitting in the apartment of Orrabella, an unuſual drowſineſs ſeemed to affect us all. The atmoſphere had been for ſome days heavy and oppreſſive, which at this time had increaſed to ſuch a degree as to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſomething like a ſenſe of ſuffocation; the heat too was intenſe, though in general the climate is temperate and pleaſant. A torpor ſeized our ſenſes, and we ſat gazing at each other, without power to ſpeak, and with ſcarce the faculty of thinking. From this ſtupor we were arouſed by a tremendous noiſe, like the howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a mighty wind, the ruſhing of waters, and the craſh of thunder. In a moment the palace ſhook to its foundation, and in leſs than ten minutes all was again profound ſilence. "One ſhock is paſt," cried Alzira, in breathleſs agony; "another, and all is loſt. Oh Garcias! beloved Garcias! let me ſave you whilſt I can." She caught up her child, who was playing on the floor, and ruſhed toward the wing of the palace where Du Ponty was confined. Ferdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, who had learnt from his wife the nature of theſe convulſions of the earth, caught her in his arms; and bidding me haſte and follow him, bore her with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation from the palace. The two children, Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topher and Iſabelle, were in an adjoining apartment with their attendants. I ran to the door in hopes to ſnatch them from impending death, when the houſe again began to totter. I ſaw the apartment fall that held the precious babes, and heard their cries as they were cruſhed beneath the ruins. At that moment, my ſon, who had borne his wife to an open field, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and carried me through the falling fabric, which nodded horror on every ſide, to the ſame place of comparative ſafety.</p>
                     <p>Two hours of ſuch tremendous threatenings from gleaming meteors, burſts of thunder, and contortions of the earth, as could hardly be ſupported by human nature, we paſſed ſitting on the ground, expecting ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:034490_0058_0FFF20EECB68A780"/>
moment it would open and ſwallow us, when at length nature became more compoſed; the dark miſts which had obſcured the face of heaven began to diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, and the ſetting ſun darted his watery beams acroſs the harbour. What then were our ſenſations, when, added to our terror at ſeeing the whole face of the country a univerſal wreck, we beheld the harbour empty, not one veſſel to be ſeen? Columbus had gone on board that afternoon, to give ſome orders prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to our departure for Hiſpaniola, and we imagined that the hurricane, attendant on the earthquake, had buried him and his companions in the waves. We caſt our eyes towards the place where lately ſtood the tents and dwellings of our friends and aſſociates; nor tent nor dwelling appeared; all was ſilence, all was deſolation. A vaſt cavity was ſeen where once the dwellings were, through which impetuouſly ruſhed a foaming torrent; which, as it roared along, bore on its ſurface trees, ſhrubs, ruins, and bodies of wild beaſts which had periſhed in the tempeſt.</p>
                     <p>Oh! what a night of agony we paſt. Yet this rude ſhock had not affected univerſal nature. The dews fell as kindly, the zephyrs blowed as refreſhing, and the ſun aroſe with as much ſplendor, as though the night had paſſed in its uſual tranquillity. And why not? The whole world is but an atom floating in infinite ſpace, and we who crawl on its ſurface but as emmets, thouſands of which might be accidentally cruſhed beneath the foot of the paſſenger, without deranging, in the leaſt, the beauty, order and ſymmetry of the univerſal whole.</p>
                     <p>When we beheld the deſolation which ſpread far and wide on every ſide, deſpair had nearly ſeized our minds; but as the morning advanced, we deſcried four of our veſſels coming with a gentle breeze into the harbour. Columbus landed, and our meeting was ſpeechleſs ecſtacy.</p>
                     <p>From the devaſtation of the night, about forty ſouls had eſcaped, and theſe entreated to be allowed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark and quit the coaſt immediately. Columbus having aſſented to their requeſt, and had us conveyed on board his own ſhip, put immediately to ſea. He
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:034490_0059_0FFF20F058F66568"/>
then informed us, that hearing the hurricane roar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came upon him, he cut the cables of his ſhip, and ordering the ſails to be looſed, prepared to put before it, whichever way it ſhould drive, as the only hope of ſaving his veſſel. Several others followed his example; and providentially the tempeſt bore directly out of the harbour. Thoſe who caught the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to put to ſea, were ſaved; three ſhips remained in port, and were ſwallowed in the general ruin.</p>
                     <p>Garcias and his whole party were in this dreadful night hurried out of time into eternity. Of all the princeſs Orrabella's attendants, only Cora and her mother were ſaved. Poor Alzira, with the virtuous Peruvian maid who ſaved us from the vile ſchemes of the Caſtilians, were buried in the ruins of the palace.</p>
                     <p>On our arrival in Hiſpaniola, Columbus ſhewed his commiſſion and authority to diſplace Roldan and his officers, and to take upon himſelf the reins of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The natives, and indeed the inhabitants in general, received him with acclamations of joy, and followed the degraded Roldan to the water ſide when he embarked, with curſes, ſhouts and hiſſes.</p>
                     <p>Two years from this period paſſed on in the utmoſt tranquillity. The only alloy to our happineſs at this period, was the ill health of your mother, whoſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate frame had received a ſhock almoſt beyond her ſtrength to ſupport. But time by degrees weakened the remembrance of her ſevere loſſes; and as her ſpirits began to regain their wonted tone, health faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tinged her cheeks, and enlivened her grief-ſwoln eyes.</p>
                     <p>It was at the cloſe of the year 1504, that we receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the afflicting intelligence of the death of Iſabelle of Spain. When Columbus was informed of an event ſo diſtreſſing to us all, but to him in particular, he preſſed her portrait (which he ever wore about his neck) to his lips; "Oh! my royal miſtreſs," ſaid he, "in the grave, with thy virtues, lies buried the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me, the honour, the happineſs of Columbus." He ſpoke prophet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ically; for within ſix months from the death of the queen, your grandfather was recalled; and Davilla, a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:034490_0060_0FFF20F38E478868"/>
of the king's, and an intimate of Roldan's, was appointed to ſucceed him as viceroy. Your father, offended at the indignity offered his parent, reſigned all his offices, and we returned to Spain together. Columbus never viſited the court; but immediately on landing retired to an eſtate he poſſeſſed in Vallado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. Ferdinando attended the levee of the king ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, but he was either entirely overlooked, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed in ſuch terms of chilling coldneſs, that his high ſpirit could not brook it, and he followed his father into retirement.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps your inexperienced mind will wonder how Roldan, but a few years ſince poor, and dependent on the friendſhip and bounty of Columbus, could have intereſt ſufficient to diſplace that valiant commander, and place a favorite of his own in his office. But, my dear girl, the neglected Roldan was poor, the return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing governor was rich. And they who in the former ſituation treated him with contemptuous neglect, or at beſt with cold, ſupercilious civility, now received him with open arms, applauded every word he ſpoke, and, like ſummer flies round a veſſel which contains honey, ſwarmed with a fond, officious, greedy hum, in hopes to ſhare the ſweets that it contains.</p>
                     <p>Roldan was a man of the world; he heard them, received their careſſes, ſmiled internally at their duplic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, made them ſubſervient to his purpoſes, and then retaliated on them the contumely and ſcorn which he well remembered once to have received. Added to this, Iſabelle was dead; and Ferdinand, who never cordially loved Columbus, eagerly caught at any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, however frivolous, to diſgrace a man whoſe unexpected ſucceſſes were a conſtant reproach to him.</p>
                     <p>Poſſeſſed of a princely fortune, beloved by his friends, and (even fallen as he was from power) ſtill feared by his enemies, ſurrounded by a loving and beloved fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Columbus might have been expected to enjoy many years of uninterrupted tranquillity. But, alas! his noble heart was wounded paſt cure. It was not pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he had coveted from the firſt; wealth he deſpiſed; titles were beneath his notice; it was honour, untar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:034490_0061_0FFF20F6AAA3B9C8"/>
and unſullied fame, he ſought. The one had been twice involved in ſuſpicion, and the other was threatened to be wreſted from him; for many of the creatures that infeſted the court of Ferdinand, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the diſcovery of the vaſt-continent now called America, was nothing extraordinary; and that many had ſpoken of it as a thing more than poſſible long before Columbus attempted it. Beſides this, a report was ſpread that the continent had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by ſome mariners who were ſhipwrecked on its coaſt, and providentially returned to their native country; that the chief of theſe mariners, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained at the houſe of Columbus's father whilſt he was yet a boy, he had liſtened attentively to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions he gave of its ſituation, latitude, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted diſtance from Europe; that he had treaſured this in his memory, and the old mariner dying ſoon after, Columbus had impoſed the diſcovery on the world as his own, the fruit of indefatigable applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and intenſe ſtudy.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reports, which were maliciouſly circulated by his enemies, preyed on his ſpirits. His health daily declined; his appetite forſook him, and reſt was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to his pillow. He ſhunned the ſociety even of his neareſt connexions; he would ſpend whole days in his cloſet, where he had carefully preſerved his chains, and I have often ſurpriſed him weeping over them like an infant. Life became a burthen to him, grievous to ſupport, and it pleaſed Heaven to releaſe him from it on the 20th of May, 1506.</p>
                     <p>What my ſufferings were, thus deprived of my firſt and deareſt friend and companion, it is impoſſible to give you any idea of. For many months, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ſhut my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the ſight of all; even the preſence of your father and mother were painful to me. Their afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſcarcely leſs poignant than mine, and the moſt luxurious moments any of us knew, were when we were recounting the virtues, and weeping over the memory of our departed hero. But from theſe tender indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies we were arouſed by a furious war breaking out between Spain and the Ottoman Empire. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:034490_0062_0FFF20F836DEBCD8"/>
of volunteers, gentlemen of the firſt rank, prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repel theſe invading Moors.</p>
                     <p>Ferdinando inherited the ſpirit of his father; his country required his aid, and unaſked, he offered it. During a war of ſeven years, your mother and myſelf (who remained retired in Valladolid) ſaw him but three times. His viſits were always ſhort, and our fears for his ſafety were ſo great and multiplied, that the pain of parting more than counterbalanced the pleaſures of meeting. His laſt receſs from arms was four months, during the winter of 1514. At parting, he tenderly embraced me. On taking leave of his wife, who after ſo many years again gave him hopes of becoming a father, he entreated her, ſhould he not return before the birth of his child, and it ſhould prove a girl, that ſhe would have it chriſtened <hi>Iſabelle.</hi> "It was the wiſh of our late royal miſtreſs," ſaid he, "that one of our children ſhould bear her name. She is now no more; but the ſmalleſt wiſh of the patroneſs of my departed father will ever be a command to me." "And to me," ſaid Orrabella; "if my child is a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, Iſabelle ſhall be her name." Your father again embraced us, bleſſed us, and departed.</p>
                     <p>The war continued with unabated fury on both ſides. Ferdinando was in conſtant and dangerous ſervice. Six months paſſed, and no hopes of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; at the expiration of that period, you, my dear child, were born; and in ten days after, you were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by the name of Iſabelle.</p>
                     <p>Your mother had not left her apartment, when one day as we were ſitting by the window, we perceived a courier riding full ſpeed up the avenue that led to the houſe. I left the room to take the expreſs, my heart foreboding fatal tidings, and wiſhing to conceal them as long as poſſible from your mother. But as I went down the front ſtairs, a ſervant, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the packet from the meſſenger, ran up the back way, and delivered it into the hands of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Orrabella. She opened it, ſhe read. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando was no more, and I returned to the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment juſt time enough to ſave her from falling to the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:034490_0063_0FFF20F9D2D65F58"/>
floor. Violent convulſions ſucceeded each other; and before morning, my poor little Iſabelle was an orphan. How I ſupported myſelf through ſuch accumulated miſery, Heaven (who no doubt aſſiſted me) alone can tell.</p>
                     <p>It was many days before I could ſummon reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to examine the fatal packet particularly. When I did, I found my brave ſon had fallen gloriouſly in ſingle combat with the heir to the Ottoman ſceptre; that he ſaw his antagoniſt fall, and died triumphing in the excellency of his own religion, and exhorting all around him to perſevere to the end. I wept at the loſs of my child, but I gloried in his faith, valour and conſtancy in the Chriſtian cauſe.</p>
                     <p>From that time, my life has been a continued blank. I have ſeen but little company. My nephew, the marquis Guidova, ſon to a brother of mine, the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of a marriage that my father contracted after my union with your grandfather, with two amiable young women his ſiſters, and a charming creature whom he had made his wife, were the only ſociety that afforded me any ſatiſfaction. I endure ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious viſits, it is true; but I always feel them inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portably tedious, and impatiently look for the moment when the departure of my gueſts would releaſe me, and I might either unbend my mind in obſerving your innocent ſports, or in deep ſolitude, by reflection and hope, be again united to thoſe departed objects of my affections, Columbus, Ferdinando and Orrabella.</p>
                     <p>In leſs than a twelvemonth after the death of your parents, I made my will. For the contents and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that <hi>will,</hi> I refer you to the beginning of this long epiſtle, which, at hours when my ſtrength and ſpirits would permit the employment, I have been nearly three months in writing. And now, my dear Iſabelle, I bid you adieu. May you poſſeſs all the virtues of your father and grandfather, all the beauty and fortitude of your mother, and be ever exempt from the ſorrows that have lacerated the heart of</p>

Your chief attendant was your mother's favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite Indian ſervant, Cora. Should ſhe live till you reach the years of maturity, be to her a firm friend; her attachment to your parents, and affection for yourſelf, has been unbounded; let your gratitude be the ſame.</p>
               <p>Columbia had read, and pauſed, and wept, and read again, till, in her anxiety for the fate of Orra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella, ſhe had forgot what ſhe ſo earneſtly had wiſhed to know, concerning the marriage of her mother. The concluſion of the manuſcript, however, brought it freſh to her memory. She turned the paper on all ſides; no farther intelligence was to be gleaned from that. But Cora, Cora had been particularly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as ſtrongly attached to the lady Iſabelle. No doubt ſhe could inform her of all ſhe wiſhed to know. She had no ſooner conceived the idea, than, folding the papers which ſhe replaced in the eſcritoire, ſhe locked the drawer, and haſtily ſought the apartment of her aged ſervant.</p>

               <p>"I HAVE read all the papers," ſaid Columbia, ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf beſide Cora, who was taking her even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's repaſt; "I have read them all, but they do not give me any account of my father, or how he became acquainted with the lady Iſabelle." "I did not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they would," replied Cora, ſipping with affected unconcern ſome milk which ſtood before her, and then breaking into it the remainder of a ſlice of brown bread, which lay beſide it.</p>
               <p>"Well, but dear Cora," ſaid Columbia, laying her right arm over her old ſervant's ſhoulder, and looking with ſmiling earneſtneſs in her face; "but dear Cora, I dare ſay you could tell me all about it." "Oh!
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:034490_0065_0FFF2100AC4FE710"/>
not I," ſhe replied, putting from her with a rejecting motion the lovely arm that encircled her neck; "not I, indeed. I tell a ſtory ſo badly, and make ſo many repetitions, and am ſo tedious and minute, you would have no patience to liſten; ſo you and Mina may go and walk, and I'll go to bed, and then, you know, we ſhall both be ſatisfied."</p>
               <p>"Nay but, dear, dear Cora, now don't be angry. Pray forgive me if I was a naughty girl, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently would not give you leave to tell the ſtory your own way. Only inform me how my mother became acquainted with, and afterwards married to, an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman, and a Proteſtant, and I will promiſe not to interrupt you from the beginning of your ſtory to the end."</p>
               <p>"Aye, to be ſure," ſaid Cora, "we are mighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending now. O my conſcience, there is nothing like curioſity to make a young lady gentle and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying. This morning it was, Be quiet, Cora, and pray hold your tongue. Hold my tongue indeed; why I warrant I could have told you every thing that happened, as well as thoſe letters. But you liked reading the letters beſt then, and ſo mayhap you may find ſome more to-morrow that will tell you every thing you wiſh to know."</p>
               <p>"'Tis well," ſaid Columbia, ſomewhat haughtily, "I will go to my mother. She referred me to you; but ſince you do not chooſe to comply with her deſires, I will from her mouth requeſt a recital of events, which, however the recollection of them may make her own heart bleed afreſh, ſhe will, I am ſure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to gratify the laudable curioſity of her child. You, Cora, may go to bed and reſt; your lady, the daughter of the princeſs Orrabella, and her unfortunate offſpring, will paſs the night in ſorrow. She in tears of bitter remembrance, and I in lamenting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions I cannot but feel, though I have not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to alleviate."</p>
               <p>This was attacking Cora in the moſt vulnerable part. "Stay," ſaid ſhe, catching hold of Columbia's robe, "ſtay, my dear young lady, but a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:034490_0066_0FFF210247EF6710"/>
and I will tell you all." "That's my good Cora," ſaid ſhe, kiſſing her cheek with affection; "I will now go and take leave of my mother for the night. You ſhall go to bed, Mina, and I will come and ſit beſide you. We will put out the candle. For you know the moon ſhines full into your chamber, and I always think a ſtory doubly intereſting when it is told by moonlight.</p>
               <p>This arrangement made, Columbia went to the apartment of her mother, and partook of a ſlight repaſt. But little converſation paſſed between them. Iſabelle was buried in reflection, and the mind of her daughter fully occupied by the events ſhe had been ſo lately made acquainted with, mixed with a reſtleſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to repair to the chamber of Cora. Supper finiſhed, ſhe requeſted leave to retire; and Mina, being diſmiſſed from her attendance on the lady Iſabelle, they ſeated themſelves on the ſide of Cora's bed, who eagerly began the promiſed recital.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The old lady Beatina died when your mother was not ſeven years old, and ſo the Marquis Guidova thought it beſt only to leave a few people juſt to take care of the houſe and pleaſure grounds in Valladolid; and diſcharging the reſt of the ſervants, take my young lady with him to Madrid, where he for the moſt part lived. He was a good gentleman, and his lady, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven bleſs her, was as kind a gentlewoman as ever breathed. They were as fond of your mother as though ſhe had been their own child; but who could help loving her? She was ſo condeſcending, ſo benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſo good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> natured, and more than that, ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. So there was maſters hired to teach her every thing, that ladies of quality generally learn, and they uſed to ſay they had no trouble in teaching her; for ſhe underſtood every thing they told her in a minute, and never forgot what ſhe had once learnt.</p>
                  <p>Many cavaliers and gentlemen ſought her for their bride before ſhe was fifteen. Not a family in the Court of Spain but would have thought it a high honour to have had her for a daughter-in-law. The young King of Spain uſed to call her a ſtar of the firſt
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:034490_0067_0FFF2103DE7BDD10"/>
magnitude; a gem fit for the crown of a prince, and many other ſuch pretty names. But ſhe, ſweet lady, was never made proud or conceited by theſe praiſes, but was always the ſame humble, affable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as ever. Then ſhe was ſo pious! Ah, when ſhall I ſee her equal? Her behaviour was an example, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by all, but I am afraid followed by very few.</p>
                  <p>Well, as I was ſaying, many noble gentlemen ſought to win her love, but ſhe was indifferent to them all; and at the age of eighteen, was ſtill unmarried. At that time, Sir Thomas Arundel arrived at the Spaniſh Court. He was travelling to finiſh his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and came with a deſign of paſſing a few months in Madrid. Ah! he was a brave gentleman."</p>
                  <p>"Yes," ſaid Columbia exultingly, "my father was a brave man, a worthy man, an honour to human nature."</p>
                  <p>"Aye, but," replied Cora, "he was much hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer then, ſo tall and graceful, ſuch fine blue eyes, and ſuch a complexion, ſo fair and ruddy, and his beautiful dark brown hair fell in ſuch becoming ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets round his face and ſhoulders, that he looked like ſomething more than mortal."</p>
                  <p>"Why, Cora," ſaid Mina, laughing, "you deſcribe his perſon with ſuch rapture, that I do believe you fell in love with him yourſelf." "Heaven help me!" cried the old woman, "that would have been a fine ſtory truly! No, no, I knew my ſtation better. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I was old enough to be his mother.

                  <p>"No, to be ſure," ſaid Columbia, "and I dare ſay my dear mother admired him as much as you did."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed ſhe did," replied Cora; "he was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Marquis by the Duke de Medina, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by him to a ſplendid entertainment which he gave to all the foreigners of diſtinction at that time reſident at the Court of Spain. Oh! how beautiful did my dear lady Iſabelle look on that day; her dreſs was always plain, but it was always becoming, and more than uſually ſo at that time. No wonder the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:034490_0068_0FFF21089F954420"/>
young Engliſhman was captivated at firſt ſight. I could have gazed at her for the whole day without being tired; that when muſt he feel, who had never before ſeen a woman ſo charming? For to excel her, I am ſure would be impoſſible. A ball was given in the evening; Arundel danced with your mother. Every eye was turned upon them as they gracefully and lightly followed the muſic. Every tongue mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured their praiſe.</p>
                  <p>"When the lady Iſabelle retired for the night, ſhe aſked me if I had ſeen the accompliſhed cavalier Arundel, and whether I did not think him very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. "I have been deaf to all my lovers as yet," ſaid ſhe, ſmiling; "but I believe, Cora, if Arundel ſhould aſk my hand, I ſhould not long withhold it." The next morning, as ſhe was riſing, the whole of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was on the gallant Engliſhman; and ſhe could not help wiſhing to ſee him again, and wondering whether he thought of her as much as ſhe did of him. Whilſt ſhe was prattling on in her lively innocent manner, the Marchioneſs Guidova entered the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>"Iſabelle, my love," ſaid ſhe, "I have ſome papers in my poſſeſſion, which I blame myſelf for not having earlier entruſted to your peruſal. Here are ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidential letters which paſſed between your father and his parents; and here is a packet addreſſed to you, my love. It was written by your grandmother during the laſt years of her life. It will inform you of ſome particulars in her will, which it is neceſſary for you to know. You are there ſtrictly forbid to unite yourſelf to a man who profeſſes the reformed religion.</p>
                  <p>"The Marquis and myſelf could not but obſerve laſt night the pointed attentions, and undiſguiſed admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with which Sir Thomas Arundel addreſſed you; and I think it is not unlikely but he may requeſt you in marriage. Now, my dear Iſabelle, Arundel is a ſtrict Proteſtant. This, you are ſenſible, will place an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable barrier between you. And fearful that my dear girl might let her heart be allured by an agreeable perſon and inſinuating addreſs before ſhe

knew the fatal conſequences that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt reſult from ſuch an indulgence, I would no longer delay requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to give a few hours ſerious attention to the papers I here leave with you, particularly that writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by your grandmother."</p>
                  <p>"When the Marchioneſs had thus ſpoke, ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the lady Iſabelle, who had not once attempted an anſwer; and laying the papers on the table, left the apartment.</p>
                  <p>"While the Marchioneſs was ſpeaking, I had retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, out of reſpect, to a window at the moſt diſtant part of the room; but I now approached my young lady, and found her pale, trembling, and her eyes brimfull of tears. "My fate, I fear, is fixed, Cora," ſaid ſhe. "My heart has hitherto been inſenſible to the admiration and love I heard numbers daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs for me; but though ſo lately acquainted with him, I had, almoſt unknown to myſelf, ſuffered a wiſh to riſe, that Arundel might be the man deſigned to be my huſband. It is true, I never ſaw him till yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; but to his character I am no ſtranger. Fame ſpeaks highly of his honour, integrity and wiſdom. But I am told our fates can never be united. If ſo, a convent ſhall be my choice, and I will ſhut myſelf from a world that will, I greatly fear, contain no charms for me, when deprived of the hope of ſharing the fate of Arundel.</p>
                  <p>She then haſtily finiſhed dreſſing, and diſmiſſed me; nor did I ſee the dear lady again, till noon. Oh! how her ſweet countenance was altered ſince the morning. She was bathing her eyes in water, in hopes to take off the redneſs; but it was in vain. The traces of her tears ſtill remained upon her cheeks, and her eyes were ſunk and heavy. The papers lay open on the table before her; ſhe ſpoke but little to me; and though when ſhe did ſpeak, ſhe forced a ſmile, I could ſee her poor heart was almoſt breaking.</p>
                  <p>The Marquis had rightly judged, that Arundel was enamoured of my lady; for on the very next day, he took an opportunity to call, when he knew the Marquis was at the levee, and going into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:034490_0070_0FFF210BB7F735A0"/>
as he ſaid to amuſe himſelf till the Marquis's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, he ſent one of the ſervants to deſire I would grant him a few minutes' converſation. I went, you may be ſure; for I gueſſed his errand, and thought it no harm to pity him, and hear what he had to ſay on the ſubject. So as I was ſaying, I went, and he aſked me a thouſand queſtions about the lady Iſabelle; as whether ſhe was engaged, whether ſhe had ever mentioned him, and whether it was with diſlike or approbation. Oh! Miſs Columbia, he was a fine ſpoken man; it would have done your heart good to have heard him.</p>
               </q>
               <p>"Your lady is angel, Cora," ſaid he; "and I ſhould think myſelf but too happy to be permitted to wear out my life in her ſervice. I mean to aſk her of her guardian; but as I would firſt be aſſured, that by ſo doing I offer no violence to her heart, I have written to her. Take this letter, then, my good Cora, and deliver it into the hands of your divine miſtreſs. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow I will expect an anſwer, and my future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſhall be regulated by her commands. Be not alarmed, (for I drew back as he offered me the letter) be not alarmed; I ſwear to you, I have nothing but honour in my thoughts." He then forced the letter into my hand, and with it his purſe, containing about twenty ducats; and at that moment hearing the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis's voice in the garden inquiring for Arundel, I could neither return his preſent, nor tell him of how little effect his letter would be; ſince my lady was reſtricted from marrying a Proteſtant. But the exact terms of the reſtriction I did not then know. So, as I ſaid, hearing the Marquis coming, I was glad to avoid meeting him; ſo turned into another walk, and made the beſt of my way to the houſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>When I gave your dear mother the letter, ſhe chid me for bringing it, ſhe heſitated for ſome time; but when I told her he promiſed to be guided by her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſhe opened and read it. Then bidding me bring her pen and ink, ſhe wrote an anſwer, frequently ſtopping to wipe off the tears that guſhed into her eyes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="unknown:034490_0071_0FFF210E6BDAE208"/>
From this time for above a fortnight, letters paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between them every day. My poor lady grew penſive, languid, and avoided company; ſpent great part of every night in writing; and in the day time, every moment when ſhe thought nobody obſerved her, ſhe would read over the letters of Arundel.</p>
               </q>
               <p>"At length ſhe told me one evening, that ſhe had promiſed to give him an interview. "He ſups here to-night," ſaid ſhe, "and after ſupper will retire to the alcove on the eaſt ſide of the garden, and thither I have promiſed to go to meet him; and you, Cora, muſt go with me."</p>
               <p>"I felt as though it would be right to perſuade her not to go, but did not know how to begin; nor could I rightly comprehend how (as they both worſhipped the ſame God) the differing in a few trifling forms and ceremonies could make it ſuch a crime for them to marry. I thought perhaps the Marquis and his lady might be angry at firſt, but that they loved her ſo well they would ſoon be reconciled. After this interview, the whole of which I did not hear, and what I did hear I did not fully underſtand, only this I know, that Sir Thomas Arundel ſpoke ſo finely, that he made me cry more than once; the lady Iſabelle told him, that by marrying a Proteſtant ſhe ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit her whole fortune. "And what of that, my love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iſabelle," ſaid he, "I have fortune enough for us both, it is your invaluable ſelf I adore; you flatter me; I am not indifferent to your generous heart; why then does my charmer heſitate? Let me call this dear hand mine; and my wealth, which is more than enough for all the comforts, nay, even the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of life, will be happily employed, if it can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a moment's ſatisfaction for the idol of my ſoul."</p>
               <p>"Take me not thus by ſurpriſe," replied your moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; "give me a few days to reflect ſeriouſly, and your generous propoſal ſhall have an ingenuous and candid anſwer. Believe me, Arundel, I will examine my heart with the minuteſt ſcrutiny; and if I find its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to you unconquerable, I will not inſult the majeſty of Heaven by making profeſſions with my lips
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:034490_0072_0FFF2112A23FF5A8"/>
which my ſoul would refuſe to ratify. I will them openly, in the face of the world, avow my choice; and if I do ſo, we will not have different intereſts in ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a concern as our everlaſting peace in futurity. No, Arundel, if I become your wife, I embrace your religion. Your faith ſhall be my faith, your God my God."</p>
               <q>
                  <p>She then ſuffered him to kiſs her hand, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on my arm, returned to her apartment.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, after this interview, my lady became more compoſed; in ſome meaſure regained her wonted cheerfulneſs, and the Marquis was pleaſed to perceive a ſadneſs wearing off, the ſource of which he had been afraid to inquire into.</p>
               </q>
               <p>"It was about ten days from this time, that my lady aſked me if I would go with her to England. "For I am reſolved, Cora," ſaid ſhe, "to ſhare the fate of Arundel. This day I mean to avow my deſigns to my guardian, and relinquiſh my eſtates to my couſin. Will you, then, follow the ruined fortunes of your poor miſtreſs?"</p>
               <p>"Will I?" ſaid I, throwing my arms round her; "can any thing but death ever ſeparate me from you?"</p>
               <p>"It was towards the evening of this day, that the lady Iſabelle ſent me to requeſt the Marquis, his lady, and their eldeſt ſon, would grant her half an hour's converſation. They returned for anſwer, that they were perfectly at liberty, and awaited her preſence in the ſaloon. She then bade me go into the garden, where ſhe knew Arundel was waiting, and bid him come to her. He obeyed the ſummons, and they entered the ſaloon together. It was then your noble mother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to her guardian and his family the reſolution ſhe had taken. "Had you entruſted me," ſaid ſhe, "earlier with the contents of my grandmother's will, I might have been upon my guard; but my heart was ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocably gone before I knew it was a crime to love a Proteſtant. Having made my election, I do not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to confeſs, that, deprived of Arundel, I would nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unite with any other man. Secluſion from the world would have been my next choice; but reaſon
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:034490_0073_0FFF21142E75F778"/>
and religion told me, that a heart throbbing with all the anxieties of a diſappointed paſſion, is not a fit ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to be offered to a Being of infinite purity. My fortune I reſign to my couſin, and wiſh him as much happineſs in the enjoyment of it as I feel in relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. My perſonal ornaments I imagine are my own. To-morrow I ſhall beſtow them and myſelf on Arundel; and in becoming his wife, I embrace the Proteſtant perſuasion."</p>
               <q>
                  <p>When my lady had finiſhed ſpeaking, ſhe gave her hand to your father, who ſpoke ſomething very handſome, though I can't remember what. But I know the old Marquis raved, his ſon locked quite hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, the Marchioneſs cried. One moment embracing lady Iſabelle, and entreating her to remember her grandmother's laſt injunctions, and not forfeit her eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal peace by quitting the boſom of the holy mother church; then ſhe would entreat her ſon not to enforce the will to its fall extent, but to be content to divide the fortune with his couſin. Oh! dearee me, it was a terrible night; for what with the rage of the one and the tears of the other, my poor lady was almoſt diſtracted.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Well, ſure enough the next morning ſhe was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and in a few days they ſet off for England. On our arrival in London, ſhe publickly abjured the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh religion, and would have had me do the ſame; but I thought changing my religion once in my life was enough.

<pb n="71" facs="unknown:034490_0074_0FFF211827E2BD38"/>
She had ſenſe and education to underſtand what ſhe was doing; but I was weak and ignorant, and feared by renouncing one error, I might perhaps fall into a greater."</p>
               <p>"Well but, Cora, what was the cauſe of my father's ruin? He was a man of family and fortune, and though I perfectly remember him, and recollect that I had not ſeen him for ſome months before, I loſt him forever, I ſhall never forget the day on which I was told he died. My dear mother, who had been abſent ſome days, was brought home in a ſtate almoſt bordering on diſtraction. She embraced me, called me her dear orphan girl, wept, wrung her hands, and then claſping them, cried, Oh! my Arundel, you are loſt to me, but I truſt you are reaping the heavenly reward of your faith, conſtancy and fidelity. She then ſent me from her, and a few weeks after we came to this old Caſtle. I did not half life it, Cora, nor am I quite reconciled to it now. Thoſe old ruins at the weſt end, the long gallery that leads to it, the great arched gate-way that looks ready to fall down, and the naſty moat full of green water, fill me with terror and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt; and if it was not for the little garden that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias has done up ſo cleverly, and the pond where we go to fiſh, I ſhould be ready to die with melancholy."</p>
               <p>"And ſo ſhould I," ſaid Mina, "and with fear too; for they people about here."</p>
               <p>"Now do be quiet, Mina," ſaid Columbia, "for it grows late, and I want Cora to finiſh telling about my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ather."</p>
               <p>Mina was ſilent, and Cora continued. "Ah! my dear Miſs, thoſe were ſad times indeed; it was then your dear mother was plunged into poverty; for you know your father was a Proteſtant. Well, he was a favourite with our young King Edward the VIth. And greatly beloved by the Protector Duke of Somerſet. They favoured the reformers very much. And there was that wicked Biſhop Gardiner, who was for burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hanging every body that did not ſay their prayers juſt as he did. He hated your father; and ſo he, and ſeveral others as wicked as himſelf, laid a
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:034490_0075_0FFF2119C2A1D400"/>
plan to take away the life of the good Duke of Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erſet. They ſaid he had laid a plan to murder the young King, and accuſed my worthy maſter, Sir Thomas Arundel, of being an accomplice; and they threw them into priſon, and a great many more good men were confined. And then Gardiner, and the Duke of Northumberland, and others of his enemies, pretended to have a regular trial. But what ſort of a trial was that, when the men that accuſed them were the judges? So they condemned them all to ſuffer death, and all their ſubſtance was forfeit to the crown, as they called it; but I warrant theſe righteous judges had pretty pickings out of them. So your dear father was beheaded on Tower Hill, and all his eſtates ſeized on by theſe robbers. For I am ſure they deſerve no better name; for Northumberland only took away the life of the good Duke of Somerſet, that he might ſupply his place about the perſon of the King, and lay a plan for his own advantage. For he perſuaded the King to make a will, and appoint the lady Jane Grey, daughter to the Marchioneſs of Dorſet, his ſucceſſor; and this he pretended to do out of love to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed religion; but it was only becauſe ſhe was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to his ſon, the Lord Guilford Dudley. But Heaven puniſhed him for his wickedneſs, in the ruin and death of thoſe beloved and charming children.</p>
               <p>"Oh! what a heavenly creature lady Jane was; your mother loved her dearly. She, ſweet ſoul, did not wiſh to be a queen; and when, on the death of King Edward, they offered her the crown, "I pray you pardon me, my friends," ſaid ſhe, "and ſuffer me to decline this honour; it is too much for me, frail mortal that I am. I would ſeek an eternal, not a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral crown; and much I fear the cares and anxieties attendant on the one, will prove a hindrance to my do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my duty neceſſary for the obtaining of the other;" and when urged to comply, ſhe bowed her head in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of aſſent. She ſaid to thoſe who knelt to do her homage, "Pray riſe, my friends, this is mockery. You think I am aſcending a throne; but I ſee clearer, and perceive it is a ſcaffold. Heaven pardon me this
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:034490_0076_0FFF211C2CA2A2C0"/>
uſurpation, for I feel I have no right to theſe honours, and ſhall be ready, when called upon, to reſign them to my rightful queen."</p>
               <p>When Northumberland told her it was for the good of the Proteſtant cauſe that ſhe ſhould aſſume the reins of government, ſhe replied, "The God of the Proteſtants is all-ſufficient for their protection; he will not ſuffer them to be puniſhed or perſecuted, unleſs it be for his own wiſe purpoſes, to prove their faith, and bring home more to the fold. He needs not the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of my feeble arm. However, my good lord Duke, if you think you are in the way of your duty in heaping theſe unrequired honours upon me, I ſubmit; and Heaven forgive us both."</p>
               <p>"I have heard Matthias, who was in London at the time, repeat her words ſo often, that I cannot be miſtaken in repeating them again. So the ſweet, good lady was proclaimed queen, and nine days after, ſhe was ſeized, with her huſband and her father-in-law, and ſent to the tower, and ſoon after they were all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed. And ſo I have no doubt but the wicked Duke repented, before he died, of his malice to the good lord Protector and your dear father; and when he came to lay his own head upon the block, I dare ſay he wiſhed he never had been the means of bringing ſo many innocent people there. The lady Jane left one ſon by lord Dudley; he was chriſtened Henry; but he bears neither the title, nor inherits the fortune of his father, more ſhame for them that have wronged him of it."</p>
               <p>Here Cora ceaſed ſpeaking; but Columbia was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thank her, or articulate a ſingle word. The unmerited accuſation and ignominious death of her father, the untimely fate of the lovely and pious lady Jane, had ſo oppreſſed her heart, that it was only by the indulgence of tears ſhe could ſave herſelf from fainting. At length ſhe recovered ſome degree of compoſure, kiſſed Cora, bade her good night, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Mina's hand, retired to her own apartment.</p>

               <p>IT was now near midnight. The moon, which had ſhone ſo bright on the beginning of the evening, was now enveloped in black clouds. The wind whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hollow through the branches of the half-naked trees, and the turrets of the old Caſtle echoed its mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy notes. A cold rain beat againſt the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſhook in their frames from the violence of the riſing tempeſt, and every thing wore a dreary, ſombre appearance.</p>
               <p>"I declare," ſaid Columbia, ſhuddering, "my ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its are ſo depreſſed, and the apartment looks ſo gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, I almoſt wiſh I had not put out the candle."</p>
               <p>"And I'm ſure ſo do I," ſaid Mina, "for I can't get thoſe ſtories out of my head, that the people, who live round about, tell of this old Caſtle; for I do aſſure you they wonder how we can live in it, and often aſk if we never hear or ſee any thing."</p>
               <p>"What ſhould we hear or ſee," ſaid Columbia, "more than our own family?" But ſhe ſhuddered involuntarily, and drew nearer to Mina, caſting a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful glance round the room.</p>
               <p>"Nay, I don't know," replied Mina, "I never give much ear to ſuch ſtories; but they do ſay the Caſtle is haunted; and that a great Baron, who owned it a good many years ago, killed his brother here, that he might win the love of his lady, whom he afterwards ſeduced, and then ſent her beyond ſea, where ſhe was never more heard of. And they ſay the young Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's ghoſt often is ſeen about the weſtern ruins; and that he walks round the garden, and even ſometimes through the long gallery and up the winding ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe that leads to the turret that joins this range of apartments."</p>

               <p>Mina began to ſay, "Good night;" but ſtopping ſhort, was ſeized with a univerſal ſhivering; her heart beat violently, and ſhe trembled ſo that the bed ſhook under her.</p>
               <p>"Oh heavens," ſaid Columbia, "what's the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?"</p>
               <p>"Huſh," replied Mina, "liſten." In trembling ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence they both raiſed their heads from the pillow, and diſtinctly heard human ſteps aſcend the ſtairs, which led to the turret, and which winded on the ſide of their apartment immediately againſt the head of the bed.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps Matthias is not gone to bed," ſaid Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbia. "Oh! but I'm ſure he is," replied Mina, "I ſaw him take the candle and go into his own room. Beſides, what ſhould he do up in the old turret at this hour, on ſuch a diſmal ſtormy night?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I do believe," ſaid Columbia, "it was only imagination." Juſt as ſhe ſpoke, they heard the ſame noiſe repeated, but it was the ſound of a perſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending; and preſently a man's voice was heard, but not loud enough to diſtinguiſh what he ſaid.</p>
               <p>At the ſame inſtant they both ſprang out of bed, and ruſhed into Cora's apartment; there, as they ſtood trembling and trying to awake her, they diſcerned through a window, that looked towards the entrance that led to the long gallery, two figures come from the door; and by the pale glimmer of the moon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that one, by his beaver which appeared orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with feathers, was a gentleman of rank, the other ſeemed habited like a ſervant.</p>
               <p>"There, there," ſaid Mina, "do you ſee?" "Yes," ſaid Columbia; "but there are two figures." "Aye, to be ſure," replied Mina; "I dare ſay that was his faithful ſervant, who was killed endeavouring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his maſter."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="unknown:034490_0079_0FFF21241EE47A50"/>
Columbia, terrified as ſhe was, could ſcarcely help ſmiling at the readineſs of her young attendant in thus explaining every thing according to her own fancy. They followed the two figures with their eyes, till they ſeemed to vaniſh amongſt the weſtern ruins; and then waking the old ſervant, and creeping into her bed, one on one ſide and one on the other, related the wonderful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance they had ſeen, and the ſounds they had heard.</p>
               <p>Cora was ſtrongly tinctured with the ſuperſtition ſo prevalent at that period in almoſt every rank. She fully believed that they had ſeen ſupernatural beings, and related, as ſhe lay trembling between them, ſo many horrible ſtories, that the terrified girls were afraid to open their eyes, leſt ſome ghaſtly ſpectre ſhould meet their view.</p>
               <p>At length the clock in the great hall chimed three; and Cora, believing that at that hour ſpirits of every kind returned to their graves, compoſed herſelf to ſleep, as did her young companions.</p>
               <p>But the ſpirits of Columbia had been ſo haraſſed, that her ſleep was diſturbed by frightful viſions, and ſhe awoke before the ſun had cheered the face of day. Glad to behold returning light, ſhe aroſe, dejected and unrefreſhed; and throwing a mantle over her ſhoulders, walked into the garden, in hopes the morning air would revive her, and take off the appearance of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor which the want of reſt had given her, and which ſhe was ſure would alarm her mother. There, as ſhe wandered through a walk of filbert trees which had been planted by Matthias near the margin of the pond, ſhe endeavoured to perſuade herſelf, that the terrors they had experienced in the night, were merely the effects of an imagination previouſly weakened by mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy recitals, and tinctured by the gloomineſs of the weather. The ſtorm was now paſt; the ſun was above the horizon; the ſky was ſerene; the air juſt ſharp enough to brace the nerves, and give elaſticity to the ſpirits. Columbia, enlivened by its vivifying power, had nearly aſſumed her uſual cheerfulneſs and ſerenity, when turning out of the walk towards the houſe, from an arch-way in the ruins ſhe ſaw, advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:034490_0080_0FFF2128227ED750"/>
towards her, the ſame figures ſhe had faintly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived croſs the court yard in the night. She ſhrieked, drew her mantle over her face, and fell fainting to the earth.</p>
               <p>When ſhe recovered, ſhe found herſelf ſupported in her mother's arms, the ſtranger ſtanding beſide her. The alarming myſtery was now ſoon diſſolved. This phantom, who had ſo alarmed Columbia and her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant, was a material ſubſtance, Sir Egbert Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by name; who, with his ſervant, flying from the perſecution of Mary (that cruel oppreſſor and tyrant of her Proteſtant ſubjects) to the coaſt of Wales, in hopes to ſeek in ſome foreign land that liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience denied him in his own, was benighted, and had loſt his way.</p>
               <p>Sir Egbert, thus weary and diſconſolate, wandering over the dreary heath, drenched by the ſtorm, fatigued, cold and hungry, made up to Auſtenbury Caſtle, which he perceived at a ſmall diſtance. The ruinous appearance of the weſtern wing, which, being next the path he had taken, he firſt entered, gave him little hope to find inhabitants in it. He made his way through the mouldering apartments into the court yard, which he croſſed; and in the hope of finding ſome room more habitable than any through which he had paſſed, he aſcended the ſtairs which lead to the turret. But diſappointed in his wiſhes, he ſaid to his ſervant as he come down, "This is certainly a deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ruin, and we had better return to the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable place we can find on the other ſide the court yard. For this old turret is more diſmal and ſhatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than any thing we have yet ſeen." Theſe were the footſteps and voices that had ſo alarmed Columbia. And according to this reſolution, they were returning to the weſtern wing, when the terrified lady and her ſervant ſaw them from the window.</p>
               <p>Sir Egbert, and his man Rawlins, having led their horſes into a place of comparative ſhelter, ſought for a room that might be beſt calculated to guard themſelves from the damp nocturnal air. Finding one leſs ſhatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the hand of time than the reſt, they ſtretched
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:034490_0081_0FFF2129B03D03A8"/>
themſelves on the floor, and reſting their heads on their ſaddles, compoſed themſelves to reſt. Hard as the bed was, Sir Egbert, worn out with fatigue and anxiety, ſoon dropped into a profound ſlumber; nor was Rawlins long in following his maſter's example. From this ſtate of inſenſibility they did not awake till day light ſtared them in the face, and the all-cheering ſun darted his beams through the high-arched win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.</p>
               <p>Having ſeen that their horſes were ſafe, they were preparing to explore the whole of the Caſtle, which they now perceived contained ſome apartments which wore a face of comfort, and ſeemed as though lately repaired; when as they came from the ruin, the firſt object that met their eyes was Columbia. Surpriſe riveted them to the ſpot. But her terror on beholding them, her ſhriek, and conſequent fall, made them hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to her aſſiſtance; when juſt as they had raiſed her from the ground, Matthias appeared at the farther end of the garden. He haſtened towards them, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſupport his dear young lady, and by his loud cries ſoon alarmed Mina and Cora. The fainting Columbia was borne into the hall, and the lady Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle, hurrying to her aſſiſtance, had juſt taken her in her maternal arms, when ſhe recovered ſenſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection. The confuſion of this ſcene had been too great to allow of any explanations on one ſide, or queſtions on the other; but Sir Egbert ſeeing the young lady now free from alarm, related, in as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a manner as poſſible, the foregoing circumſtances, entreating leave to reſt for a few days in the Caſtle, whilſt he ſent Rawlins to the neareſt ſea-port to inquire for a veſſel bound for Holland or Germany.</p>
               <p>To this Iſabelle aſſented; and in the courſe of the day Columbia, half aſhamed of her terrors, related to her mother and her gueſt the adventures of the night. Cheerful and unreſtrained converſation begets confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and before the hour of reſt arrived, Sir Egbert had informed his fair hoſteſs of the real cauſe of his haſty flight from London, and his reſolution to quit the kingdom. Iſabelle was aſtoniſhed at the account he
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:034490_0082_0FFF212C541CE918"/>
gave of the dreadful perſecutions under which the Proteſtants ſuffered, from the bigotry and cruelty of Mary, and thoſe tools of her power, Gardiner and Bonner. Secluded as ſhe was from the world, though ſhe knew they had great difficulties to ſtruggle with, yet ſhe had no idea to what height they carried their barbarity, and that burning, ſtarving, hanging, and ſometimes drawing the victims of their miſguided zeal in quarters, was the method taken to bring back the heretics (as they were called) to the ceremonies and ſuperſtitions of the church of Rome.</p>
               <p>"Ah! my dear child," ſaid ſhe to Columbia, "how much gratitude ought we to feel toward the divine Diſpoſer of all events, that it has pleaſed him, with a correcting hand, to lead us into this happy obſcurity, where we can enjoy that liberty of conſcience which calms and fortifies the ſoul, and fits it for all events. Alas! Columbia, had your dear father lived to this day, we might all have ſuffered at the ſtake together. Then let us be humble and ſubmiſſive to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Creator, ſince followed by the invaluable bleſſings of peace, life, and the liberty of worſhipping him in ſecurity, according to the dictates of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences."</p>
               <p>Sir Egbert was charmed with the poliſhed manners and unaffected piety of the lady Iſabelle. But the youth, beauty, innocence and vivacity of Columbia had faſcinated his ſenſes. The harmonious trio parted for the night, mutually pleaſed with each other; Iſabelle reflecting, in pious gratitude, on her preſent happy ſeclusion from a court which ſeemed a ſcene of murder, and where, perhaps, the morals and principles of her darling child might have been tainted by the bigotry and ſuperſtition of the times, Sir Egbert to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate on the intereſting figure, and ſweet ſimplicity of manner that characterized Columbia, and Columbia herſelf to chat with Mina about the handſome Sir Egbert Gorges.</p>

               <p>"Do you not think our viſitor very handſome?" ſaid Columbia. "Yes, indeed I do," ſaid Mina; "and his man is a clever kind of body." "And you think him very handſome too, Mina?" "No, not very handſome; but he has a great deal to ſay; and Cora ſays he muſt have travelled, for he knows all about her country as well as if he had been there." "But that may be from reading, Mina; for my mother told me to-day, that her father, Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando Columbus, wrote a full account of her grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's voyages, during the two years they lived re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired at Valladolid. And that at the time my father's papers were ſeized by his enemies, the manuſcript was found, and it has ſince been printed."</p>
               <p>"And ſo, madam, this fine ſtranger, this Sir Egbert, is going away to live amongſt the Dutch people, Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins tells me. I'm ſure, if I was as him, I would ſtay where I was." "But that would be improper, Mina; my mother could not poſſibly entertain a ſtrange knight here above a day or two, as ſhe has neither huſband or ſon to bear him company."</p>
               <p>"Well, if ſhe has no ſon of huſband, ſhe has a daughter; and I warrant Sir Egbert would excuſe the deficiency of the one for the ſake of the other." "How wildly you talk, Mina; I ſhall be angry with you preſently." "What, madam, for ſuppoſing the handſome young knight is pleaſed with you; nay, now, I don't think you would be very much out of humour if a ſtorm was to detain him at the Caſtle a week or ſo; for then you know there would be ſome excuſe for his ſtaying." "Pho! you talk like a ſimpleton, Mina; I wiſh you would go to ſleep."</p>
               <p>"Well, I wonder how ſome folks can be ſo inſenſible; for my part, as ſoon as I ſaw him this morning, and found he was real fleſh and blood, I ſaid to myſelf, Well, he is a charming cavalier, and if he would but

fall in love with my lady Columbia, and ſhe with him, we ſhould have a wedding, and there is always rare doings at a wedding; and then we ſhould go away from this old Caſtle. And now, if you won't be angry, I'll tell you the truth. I never do ſay my prayers, but what I pray that we may ſoon go away from this ſhocking old place. Why the arch, at the entrance of the great gate, looks as if it would fall whenever the gate is opened; but to be ſure that a'nt very often, we are not much troubled with horſemen, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when Matthias comes from market, with the old blind crippled creature that brings home our provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And then one never ſees a young man. I declare, I bleſſed my eye-ſight when I ſaw Mr. Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins: for what with Matthias's ſtories about the wars, and Cora's earthquakes, and ſhipwrecks, and ſtorms, and ſo forth, I am heart ſick."</p>
               <p>"And I'm ſure, ſo am I, Mina, to hear you talk ſuch a parcel of nonſenſe. However, if you are tired of ſtaying in the Caſtle, you are at liberty to leave it whenever you pleaſe."</p>
               <p>"Me leave it, madam? No indeed, madam; if it was ten times more frightful than it is, I would not leave it without you, and my dear lady your mother, for the whole world. No; I meant that if you were married to this handſome Sir Egbert, we ſhould go to London again, and have fine dreſſing and balls and feaſting."</p>
               <p>"You don't know what you wiſh for, Mina. Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is no place for Proteſtants. London is now the ſeat of every enormity which is practiſed under the maſk of religion. Queen Mary is determined that every one of her ſubjects ſhall think as ſhe thinks, and thoſe who heſitate to obey her, are burnt at the ſtake."</p>
               <p>"And pray, madam, why don't the people burn her? She is but one, and ſhe has multitudes of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects."</p>
               <p>"She is their queen, Mina, and they dare not lift the hand againſt her."</p>
               <p>"Queen indeed! Well, I am but an ignorant girl, to be ſure; but I can't ſee why a queen ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:034490_0085_0FFF21328E9C0938"/>
murder without being puniſhed for it, any more than other people."</p>
               <p>"But it is not called murder, when a perſon is executed for acting contrary to a queen's commands."</p>
               <p>"They may call it what they pleaſe; but if a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is innocent of any real crime, and is only accuſed of not thinking as the queen does, or perhaps they don't preach and pray juſt as ſhe would have them; I do ſay, and will ſtand to it, if ſhe orders them to be hanged or burnt, it is murder. Aye, and I fancy her cruel queenſhip will find that out, when ſhe dies."</p>
               <p>"You are a ſtrange girl, Mina, and are now talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a ſubject we neither of us are competent to ſpeak upon; therefore let me beg you to ſay no more. Let us ſay our prayers, and be thankful we are, by our ſecluſion from ſociety, and our diſtance from the metropolis, ſecure from any fear of her power. And ſo, Mina, good night."</p>
               <p>Columbia ſpoke this in ſo reſerved a tone, that Mina did not dare to proceed, though ſhe never felt leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſleep. Yet ſhe endeavoured to obey her young lady, ſaid her prayers, and addreſſed herſelf to ſleep.</p>
               <p>The next morning, Rawlins was diſpatched to the neareſt ſea-port, to inquire for a veſſel, and from ſome unforeſeen accidents, he was detained nearly a week.</p>
               <p>During this interval, the daily, nay, almoſt hourly opportunities Sir Egbert had of converſing with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbia, and obſerving her mildneſs, modeſty, and underſtanding, which had been highly cultivated by the tender and careful hand of maternal affection, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired him with a paſſion ardent as it was ſincere; and he could not repel the riſing wiſhes of his heart, that this lovely creature might be ordained his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to ſmooth the rugged path of life.</p>
               <p>Columbia had not been inſenſible to the many vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and graces of Sir Egbert; but ſhe had not learnt to diſguiſe her thoughts from her beſt and only friend. She conſidered it no crime to love a worthy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed man, and her mother became the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:034490_0086_0FFF21341AD1A190"/>
of her paſſion almoſt as ſoon as ſhe diſcovered it herſelf.</p>
               <p>"I cannot blame you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my child," ſaid this indulgent parent, "for the admiration and eſteem you feel for Sir Egbert Gorges; but I would wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſcarcely eighteen, and Sir Egbert is almoſt the firſt man you have ſeen above the rank of a clown. It is to be hoped, my love, we ſhall not always be ſecluded in this ſolitary Caſtle. I underſtand from Sir Egbert, that queen Mary's health is in a declining ſtate. Should ſhe die without iſſue, her ſiſter Elizabeth is next heir to the throne. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth is herſelf a Proteſtant, and will no doubt encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age all the profeſſors of that religion. I ſhall in that caſe, for your ſake, my child, repair to court, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for a reſtitution of your father's lands. I have alſo another duty to fulfil. A dear friend of mine, who ſuffered death a few years after your father, in her laſt moments recommended her infant ſon to my care. Should ſo fortunate an event take place as the princeſs Elizabeth's acceſſion to the throne, I ſhall to her protecting care recommend this laſt branch of an unfortunate family, the innocent part of which have been the ſufferers for the guilty ambition of the reſt."</p>
               <p>"I apprehend madam," ſaid Columbia, "that you mean the offſpring of the Lord Guilford Dudley and lady Jane. Cora informed me of their unfortunate exaltation and conſequent death; and I have no doubt but the royal Elizabeth will, ſhould ſhe ever have the power, reſtore to him his rank and the fortunes of his anceſtors."</p>
               <p>"Heaven grant that I may ſee the day," ſaid Iſabelle. "And now, my dear child, though I would not put any reſtraint on your inclinations, I could wiſh you to decline a union with Sir Egbert Gorges, till quieter and more proſperous times. Enter into no ſerious engagements with him, which hereafter may cauſe you much uneaſineſs. Mix firſt with the world. The heart is apt to be deceived in its firſt emotions, when little knowledge of the world, and ſecluſion from
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:034490_0087_0FFF2135EA9419C8"/>
ſociety, prevents a free election; and the object who, when the only one, appeared to have every attraction, to poſſeſs every virtue, when compared with others of more ſhining talents, loſes the charm that had at firſt engaged the affections. The diſappointment then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes intolerable, and the unfortunate victim of inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience paſſes a life of unceaſing regret and fruitleſs repining. I will confeſs to you, that Sir Egbert has ſpoken to me on this ſubject, and I then adviſed him, as I now adviſe you; and I hope my dear child will not find a difficulty in following advice, that can have no other end in view than her happineſs."</p>
               <p>"I cannot heſitate a moment, my dear mother," ſaid Columbia, "to promiſe that your wiſhes, which to me are commands, will ever be obſerved as laws. Think not, beloved parent, that your child was ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your ſociety, as to renounce it for that of a ſtranger, whom ſhe had ſcarcely known a week. Oh no! however partial my heart may be, I could wiſh to be better aſſured of the merits of the object, before I gave my future happineſs into his keeping. Let Sir Egbert purſue his intended voyage; if at ſome future period he ſhould return ſtill conſtant to me, I think I can anſwer for the ſtability of my affections."</p>
               <p>"Make no raſh promiſes, my dear child," ſaid Iſabelle. Columbia bowed her head aſſentingly, and remained ſilent.</p>
               <p>Rawlins now returned, with intelligence that a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for Amſterdam would be ready to ſail in the courſe of three days. On the morning of the ſecond day, therefore, Sir Egbert, and his faithful Rawlins, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted; the former having, with many thanks for her hoſpitality, taken leave of his fair hoſteſs, and entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her permiſſion for Columbia to accept a ſmall dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond ring in remembrance of him; which, as it was of trifling value, ſhe allowed, at the ſame time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him with a plain gold one from her own fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſaying, "I know you will condeſcend to accept this in token of amity, for trifles become valuable when we eſteem the giver."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:034490_0088_0FFF213B1080CEC8"/>
Mina had, at parting from Rawlins, received from him a ſmall ſilver coin, on which with his knife he had marked the initials of his name, and over the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were two hearts. A puncture was made near the extremity, and a ſtring being paſſed through it, Mina ſuſpended this pledge of affection round her neck.</p>
               <p>But Mina, though ſhe fancied herſelf in love paſt cure, and that ſhe ſhould be conſtant through long abſence and trials of every kind, was a ſtranger to her own heart. She was by nature a coquette, fond of admiration, and pleaſed with thoſe who gave it. She loved Rawlins, becauſe he had profeſſed to love her. But, alas! poor Mina, when ſhe uſed daily pathetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to lament the abſence of her lover, had ſhe but ſearched her heart thoroughly, ſhe would have diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered that it was the flattery ſhe miſſed; and that food of female vanity, artfully adminiſtered by any other perſon, would ſoon have effectually baniſhed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Rawlins, and dried up her tears for his departure.</p>
               <p>For differently affected was the heart of Columbia. Her partiality to Sir Egbert was ſanctioned by the voice of reaſon. She felt that, was ſhe his wife, ſhe could brave every hardſhip with him without repin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For his ſake ſhe would then have faced perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, poverty, famine, nay, death itſelf. But at the ſame time ſhe forcibly felt, that to deſcend in the ſmalleſt degree from the reſpect ſhe owed herſelf, from that neceſſary pride and dignity of manner which is the ſafeguard of female honour, would be no longer to deſerve him. When engaged in ſtudies that enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her mind and expanded her underſtanding, ſhe thought ſuch employment would render her a more pleaſing companion to Sir Egbert. He was ſeldom from her thoughts in her waking hours, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſited her dreams; and in her daily devotions were mingled conſtant prayers or his ſafety.</p>
               <p>Yet Columbia was not totally diveſted of that vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which in her childiſh years had formed ſo ſtriking a trait in her character; but it had been ſo judiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repelled and corrected by her mother, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

more of it remained than ſerved as a foil to her virtues. She knew ſhe was handſome, and ſhe ſtudied to ſet off that beauty by humility, benevolence, ſimplicity and candour.</p>

               <head>Confuſion, Diſtreſs, unexpected Journey.</head>
               <p>ABOVE eighteen months after the departure of Sir Egbert paſſed in the uſual way, in which time Rawlins had twice been to Auſtenbury Caſtle with letters from his maſter. But the enemies of Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, encouraged by Mary, purſued him with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting fury, that he dared not himſelf venture to England.</p>
               <p>It was in the ſummer of 1558, that an event took place which had nearly put a period to the life of lady Iſabelle, and involved her daughter in accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated miſery. A report had been circulated, that the child of lady Jane and lord Guilford Dudley was in exiſtence, and in the protection of a Proteſtant family.</p>
               <p>The furious zeal of Mary inſpired her with the idea, that by getting this infant into her power, and having him educated in the Catholic religion, ſhe ſhould render Heaven an acceptable piece of ſervice, and entirely atone to the child for the death of his parents, the ſigning of whoſe death-warrant ſometimes lay hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy on her conſcience; and in thoſe fits of gloomy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, ſhe always had recourſe to her ghoſtly confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor for ſpiritual advice and comfort, who upon theſe occaſions did not fail to inflame her mind, and render her bigotry more obſtinate.</p>
               <p>This man, who was in the confidence of Gardiner, biſhop of Wincheſter, encouraged the queen in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to get young Dudley into her power; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, diligent inquiry was made after the place of his ſecluſion. At length, accident diſcovered what they had begun to deſpair of. Sir James Howard, a
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:034490_0090_0FFF0CDF9A58B870"/>
younger branch of the houſe of Norfolk, (a family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for their attachment to the Catholic perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,) a man in high favour with the queen, and in habits of ſtrict intimacy with Gardiner, Bonner, and the reſt of the perſecuting party, having received an invitation to ſpend the decline of the ſummer in Wales, at the ſeat of Sir Owen Langwylling, and partake of the diverſions of hunting and ſhooting, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Auguſt, repaired to the antique manſion of his friend.</p>
               <p>Sir Owen was young, gay, and fond of diſſipation and expenſive pleaſures, which the ſmallneſs of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal inheritance would not permit him to enjoy to the extent he wiſhed. Howard was rich in money, as well as in court favour; and Sir Owen invited him into Wales, in hopes the youth and beauty of his only ſiſter, Winifreda, might catch his affections, and at once ſecure on honourable alliance for herſelf, and a powerful friend for him.</p>
               <p>It was during this viſit, that Howard, tired one evening with the rude and turbulent mirth of his hoſt and his Welſh aſſociates, left them to finiſh their uſual libations to Bacchus; and mounting his horſe, on whoſe neck he ſuffered the reins to reſt, giving a looſe to reflection, and intending only to eſcape from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting ſociety, and enjoy the pleaſures of retirement and contemplation, he permitted the animal to take what courſe he pleaſed. Nor was his attention arouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to the time he had been abſent, till, coming ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly out of a wood into a wide-extended heath, he perceived the ſun was drawing near the weſtern hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon; and turning his horſe with a deſign to meaſure back the path he had trod, on the ſummit of a hill, he ſaw Auſtenbury Caſtle. The parting beams of the ſun ſhone full on the venerable ruin, and his rays gave an uncommon richneſs to the ſurrounding proſpect. Curioſity urged him on, and once more turning his ſteed, he proceeded at a good pace up the hill.</p>
               <p>It has been obſerved, that the moſt ruinous part of this Caſtle was that which fronted the heath; and Howard, having led his horſe over a broken draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:034490_0091_0FFF0CE144C344D0"/>
bridge, which appeared as though it had not been rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for more than a century paſt, faſtened his bridle to a ring which had formerly ſupported a ſwing gate, or private entrance to the fortified part of the Caſtle, and proceeded through an aperture in the wall immediately into the garden, the neatneſs and cultivation of which convinced him there were inhabitants in the Caſtle. He went forward, and at the extremity of the garden, in the arbour before mentioned as the ſcene of Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia's childiſh ſports and feſtivity, he ſaw a female, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a bunch of reeds in the form of a wheat ſheaf, and a boy ſtanding beſide her, apparently about five years of age. As he approached nearer, the beauty of Mina ſtruck him with ſurpriſe. For it was ſhe who had been walking with young Dudley, who was now become an inmate at the Caſtle, and who wanted to go into the water after the reeds, that he might play at reaping. She had gathered a few to divert him, and was employed in binding them up, when How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard approached them. He ſpoke before ſhe ſaw him. She ſtarted from her ſeat, and the blood mounted to her cheeks. But Howard was young, handſome, and addreſſed her with ſuch an air of gallantry, that ſhe ſoon recovered herſelf, and felt more inclined to be pleaſed than alarmed at his intruſion.</p>
               <p>Night was now rapidly approaching, and our knight was chagrined at it. He wiſhed to have entertained the pretty, bluſhing Mina with expreſſions of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and wonder, to ſee ſo much lovelineſs thus buried in ſolitude; but time would not permit. He aſked, however, a few trifling queſtions, ventured to take her hand and kiſs it, careſſed the child, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Mina with a jewel which he took from his beaver, and which he had obſerved ſhe eyed with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, requeſted her to meet him there again early the next morning.</p>
               <p>"But be ſure, pretty creature," ſaid he, "you do not mention having ſeen me to your father and moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er." "I have no father and mother, Sir," ſaid Mina.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, to your uncle, or aunt, or grandmoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er." "La! Sir," ſaid Mina, with ſimple earneſtneſs,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:034490_0092_0FFF0D045117FDE8"/>
"I have no relations; I am only poor Mina, and live here in the old Caſtle with my lady." "And who is your lady?" "The lady Iſabelle Arundel."</p>
               <p>"Well, you need not tell her, or any body, that you have ſeen me; I have a particular reaſon for it. I will be here by ſix o'clock to-morrow morning."</p>
               <p>Mina promiſed ſilence, and dropping a curteſy, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a good night.</p>
               <p>The thoughts of this ſimple girl were agitated and confuſed, as ſhe proceeded towards the houſe. She was reſolved not to mention the ſtranger; but then Henry, he might tell the lady Iſabelle. But to prevent this, immediately on her entering the Caſtle, ſhe put the child to bed, and then repairing to her lady, gave as a reaſon for having done ſo, that he was tired with his walk.</p>
               <p>The uſual avocations of the evening ſo entirely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied Mina, that ſhe had no time to think, till the hour of retirement. No ſooner was ſhe in her own apartment, than, drawing the jewel from her pocket, ſhe compared it with the ſilver token of Rawlins' hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt love. "It is much finer," ſaid ſhe, delighted with its luſtre; "but then what will poor Rawlins ſay, if I ſhould prove falſe-hearted?" A deep ſigh, as this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection paſſed through her mind, ſeemed to tell her, the aſſignation ſhe had made with the gallant ſtranger was improper. But Mina poſſeſſed that unfortunate flexibility of diſpoſition, that unfits its poſſeſſor for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of any kind. Her inclination to keep her appointment was ſtrong, and the courtly manner, handſome perſon, and rich preſent of Howard, had ſuch an effect upon her deluded ſenſes, as to lead her to imagine ſhe had never loved Rawlins half ſo well, as ſhe found ſhe was inclined to love him.</p>
               <p>Had the lady Columbia been preſent, ſhe would no doubt, notwithſtanding her promiſe to the contrary, have confided to her the intruſion of the ſtranger, and her promiſe to ſee him again in the morning. Indeed, full of her own praiſes which ſhe had heard from his lips, and occupied entirely in reflecting on his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="90" facs="unknown:034490_0093_0FFF0D1E2F029390"/>
than an opportunity to repeat it all to her young lady. But Columbia now ſlept in an apartment by herſelf, and the young Dudley partook of Mina's bed; ſo the ſecret was of neceſſity confined to her own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. Its importance in her ideas, was ſufficient to baniſh ſleep from her eyes; and ſhe impatiently count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the clock till it ſtruck four. "Well, two hours will be ſoon paſt," ſaid ſhe, and immediately began to dreſs herſelf. But quick as her impatient wiſhes led her to imagine they might paſs, when ſhe was anxiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counting every minute, ſhe thought the period an eternity.</p>
               <p>Having dreſſed herſelf, ſhe deſcended to the great hall, and thought to be ſure it muſt be near five; but poor Mina was deceived in her calculation, and found it but a quarter paſt four. She liſtened, ſhe watched the hand, ſhe could ſcarcely perceive it move; it had certainly ſtopped; her lady would be up, ſhe ſhould be prevented meeting the ſtranger. Impelled by this idea, ſhe had walked more than a dozen times from the hall to the arbour and back again, and ſtill it was ſcarcely half-paſt five.</p>
               <p>At length the long expected ſtranger was ſeen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching; for he had been impelled by a curioſity, as reſtleſs as the new born paſſion of Mina, to repair early to the place of aſſignation.</p>
               <p>As he had leiſurely walked his horſe homeward the evening before, he had reflected on the name of Mina's lady. Arundel! It was ſurely the widow of Sir Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Arundel; if ſo, the intimate friend of lady Jane Grey. Might not that boy be the long-ſought off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Dudley? If ſo, how would it elevate him in the queen's favour, to inform her where the boy might be ſound! Let no one blame Howard; he thought it right to endeavour to ſnatch the child from the dangers of what he termed an heretical education; he acted from principle; and it were well for every one, who courts the favour of the great, if they could lay their hands on their hearts, and with truth aſſert the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:034490_0094_0FFF0D209EF7FE68"/>
In his converſation with the artleſs and infatuated Mina, he drew from her every circumſtance he wiſhed to know. Her inexperienced heart, faſcinated with his flattery, and thinking him all that was amiable on earth, could not imagine him a Catholic. She thought he profeſſed the ſame religion with her lady and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He perceived her error, and ſuffered it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, till he made himſelf acquainted with every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular within the knowledge of Mina; and in the end triumphed in the ſpoils of her innocence.</p>
               <p>For three weeks, an illicit intercourſe was carried on between them; during which period Howard had ſent intelligence to his friend Gardiner, that the object of their hitherto fruitleſs ſearch was now within their reach. At the name of Arundel, Gardiner felt all his hatred revive towards the widow and child of his departed enemy; and, glad of an opportunity to wreak on them the vengeance which the blood of the huſband and father had not ſated, eagerly flew to the queen, and obtained from her an order to oblige the lady Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle, and her daughter Columbia, with their young charge Henry Dudley, to repair immediately to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and in caſe of heſitation and reluctance, to bring them away by force.</p>
               <p>It was morning; breakfaſt had been removed; Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle and Columbia were employed at their needles. Mina was reading (as was the cuſtom of that lady to make either her daughter or her attendant do every morning) ſome extracts from a book of devotion. A violent knocking at the gate alarmed them. Matthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, with all the haſte his advanced age would permit, went to open it. In a moment the court was filled with horſemen, ſoldiers and friars, and at their head was Sir James Howard, who was appointed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the party, and conduct the priſoners to London. Mina's heart leaped within her. She thought her lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was come with this noble train, to claim her as his bride, (as he had frequently promiſed he would) and take her with him to London. Lady Iſabelle turned pale. Loſt! ruined! undone! were all the words ſhe
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:034490_0095_0FFF0D2880D23480"/>
could articulate, and ſhe ſunk almoſt lifeleſs on the neareſt ſeat.</p>
               <p>The little Dudley was playing in the hall, when Howard and Sir Owen entered. Unuſed to danger, unacquainted with fear, he ran to the brave gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, as he called them, admired their waving plumes and laced doublets; and hanging on the hilt of Howard's ſword, told him he remembered when he came through the broken wall into the garden. This circumſtance, which a variety of other childiſh amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had contributed to efface, had lain dormant in his youthful mind, till the appearance of Howard; who happening to wear the ſame dreſs then, as when the child firſt ſaw him, brought it freſh to his memory.</p>
               <p>Howard took the child in his arms; and, followed by Sir Owen and a number of other gentlemen, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the apartment of lady Iſabelle. Though nearly overcome by her fears, the widow of Arundel had ſtill a dignity of manner, a chaſte ſeverity of countenance, that awed even the moſt ferocious. Sir Owen Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wylling, a man neither celebrated for his politeneſs or ſenſibility, was a proof of this. He met the glances of her penetrating eyes, and ſunk abaſhed behind How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, mingling in the thickeſt of the crowd, his beaver off, and his eyes bent to the earth.</p>
               <p>Iſabelle aroſe from her ſeat at their entrance, and bowing gracefully, requeſted to be informed of the cauſe of their viſit. Howard was confuſed; he heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated as he attempted to ſpeak, and at that moment catching the eye of Mina, who ſtood trembling behind Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbia, he bowed low, to conceal the agitation that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his articulating a ſingle ſentence. At length recovering, and obſtinately fixing his eyes in ſuch a manner as not to be able to catch a glimpſe of Mina, he thus addreſſed the lady Iſabelle.</p>
               <p>"Our auguſt ſovereign Mary, queen of England, hearing that Henry Dudley, ſon and heir to the lord Guilford Dudley, (who ſuffered with his unfortunate lady for their attempt upon the Britiſh crown) is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your ladyſhip's protection, and wiſhing to compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate to the child for the enforced rigour with which ſhe
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:034490_0096_0FFF0DB4EC9400A8"/>
was obliged to treat his parents, has commiſſioned me, James Howard, in conjunction with theſe noblemen and eccleſiaſtics, to bring the boy to her court, that ſhe may reſtore to him the title and eſtates of his fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and have him educated in the principles of that holy religion, which alone leads to ſalvation."</p>
               <p>The full conviction of the imprudence ſhe had been guilty of, and the duplicity Howard had practiſed, now flaſhed on the mind of Mina. She gave a faint ſcream, and ſunk lifeleſs to the floor.</p>
               <p>Cora, whom the general confuſion had brought to the apartment, aſſiſted to raiſe her, and ſhe was borne into the open air. It was not till ſhe was quite out of the room, that the lovely form of Columbia attracted the notice of Howard. He beheld her following, with looks of the tendereſt ſenſibility, the apparently lifeleſs form of her ſervant and in a moment every other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was obliterated from his mind. He ſeemed at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the lady Iſabelle as ſhe ſpoke, but his ears drank not one word of what ſhe uttered; nor was he awakened from his trance of admiration, till ſhe ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpeaking, and prepared to lead her daughter from the room. He then endeavoured to recollect himſelf, and aſked, "If ſhe would not accompany her young charge to London?"</p>
               <p>"I thought I had expreſſed my intention ſo to do," replied Iſabelle, with a look of ſurpriſe; "if you, Sir James, did not underſtand me, I here repeat that I will go with him. Not to reſign my precious charge to the queen, but to aſſert my prior right, the right of friendſhip, ſealed by a moſt ſolemn vow, that Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Dudley ſhould be educated in the religion of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. I know you will tell me there are tortures to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force obedience to the queen's will; but I have learnt to deſpiſe them. Happineſs and I have long been ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arated, nor do I hope ever to taſte it more, till, in the realms of bliſs, I am again united to my martyred friends and huſband. Think not, then, the threats of death can terrify me. Death is the only period I can look forward to with camlneſs, hope and comfort."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="unknown:034490_0097_0FFF0DB6E7A9CF00"/>
She then ſlightly bowed her head, and taking young Dudley in her right hand, and leaning on her daughter with her left, ſhe paſſed into an inner apartment.</p>
               <p>In half an hour's time, ſhe ſent a meſſage, intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe would be ready to attend their orders by four o'clock the enſuing morning. In the mean time, ſhe requeſted they would make themſelves welcome to whatever her poor habitation afforded.</p>
               <p>It was late in the day before Mina was ſufficiently recovered to be able to quit her apartment. The weather had been ſultry, the anxiety of her mind had contributed to enervate her frame; and as ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to walk, the univerſal debility and weakneſs which ſhe experienced alarmed her. She thought the air might refreſh her. Paſſing from her chamber through the hall into the garden, the firſt object that met her view as ſhe deſcended the ſteps, was Rawlins. She trembled, ſhe gaſped for breath; but ſhe recalled her fleeting ſenſes, and haſtily gliding down the ſteps, catching his hand, in ſilence hurried him to an obſcure part of the garden. There, as ſoon as the tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous throbbings of her heart would permit her to ſpeak, in a few words ſhe unfolded to him the unhappy ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of her lady and family; but ſhame prevented her revealing the unfortunate part ſhe had uninten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally had in their ruin.</p>
               <p>"If you have any letters," ſaid ſhe, "give them me quick, and then fly and conceal yourſelf in the weſtern ruins till I can bring you anſwers, which you muſt with all ſpeed convey to your maſter."</p>
               <p>Rawlins gave her the letters, and would have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her; but conſcious guilt made her ſhrink from him, and covering her face with her hand, ſhe waved him toward the place of concealment, and returned to the houſe. She paſſed unobſerved to the apartment of her lady, and delivered the packet to the hands of Columbia.</p>
               <p>Fortunately Rawlins had not been ſeen by any of Howard's party; and Iſabelle, having aſſured herſelf of this, determined by his means to ſend Henry Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:034490_0098_0FFF0DBB131DCC80"/>
into Holland, to Sir Egbert Gorges. She even urged Columbia to fly with the child from the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution that awaited them. But that heroic girl refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſert her mother in the hour of diſtreſs. "Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides," ſaid ſhe, "the ſafety of Henry will be more certain, when Rawlins has no woman with him, with her fears and her weakneſs, to impede his journey."</p>
               <p>Iſabelle, anxious to put her plan in execution, at night-fall ſent a meſſage to Howard and his followers, craving their excuſe, that the preparations for the morning's journey would not permit her to ſee them again that night; but that ſhe hoped they would not ſpare her poor proviſions, and as early in the morning as they pleaſed, ſhe would commence her journey.</p>
               <p>Mina, who delivered this meſſage to them as they were taking their repaſt in the great hall, led young Dudley by the hand round to bid them all good-night; then through an apartment, which by a private door communicated with the weſtern wing, ſhe conveyed him immediately to Rawlins, who waited till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night; and then mounting his horſe, with the child before him, proceeded with all poſſible ſpeed to the neareſt ſea-port, where the bark he had come over in laying ready, he went immediately on board, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on the maſter, by promiſes of a large reward, to put directly to ſea.</p>
               <p>The fortitude Mina had been obliged to exert in the execution of this plan was almoſt too much for her frame to ſupport. The facing the perjured Howard, and delivering to him a meſſage from her lady, the taking what ſhe firmly believed to be a laſt farewel of Rawlins, were excruciating trials. But ſhe thought the ſevereſt ſufferings were too little to atone for the miſchief ſhe had brought on the houſe of Arundel; and the conſolatory reflection that ſhe had been the means of ſaving one innocent victim from the power of Mary, having ſhed a temporary calm over her ſoul, ſhe enjoyed a few hours repoſe, which in ſome degree enabled her to ſupport the confuſion of the enſuing day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:034490_0099_0FFF0DBD4A67F890"/>
By three o'clock, Howard and his followers were in motion. Iſabelle heard them, and awaking Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia and Mina, who that night both ſlept in her chamber, they equipped themſelves for their journey. Their clothes had been previouſly packed the night before, and ſent down ſtairs.</p>
               <p>As the clock ſtruck four, the widow of Arundel, with her daughter and attendant, deſcended the great ſtair-caſe into the hall. Howard received them at the foot of the ſtairs; but not perceiving the child, eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inquired for him. "He is gone," ſaid Iſabelle, with a dignified compoſure; "but that he has eſcaped is not your fault. I have ſent him out of the reach of bigotry and cruelty, and am now ready to go and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the queen for my crime. It is I, I only, that am guilty, if guilt it can be termed. And I do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, Sir James Howard, and you, holy fathers, whoſe profeſſion is peace and mercy, ſuffer not theſe children to be inſulted or puniſhed for my faults. To you, Sir James, I ſolemnly commit the ſafety of my daughter; that young woman is her attendant. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to her from almoſt infancy, I do beſeech you let them not be ſeparated. Your family is noble, you wear the badge of a ſoldier; I ſhould hope you would neither diſgrace the one or the other by injuring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>protected women, whom ill fortune only has thrown into your power. Now I am ready to ſet forward, and Heaven be my ſupport."</p>
               <p>The majeſty of her manner as ſhe ſpoke, awed them into ſilence. Sir James Howard, confounded by the pointed rebuke ſhe had innocently given him, when ſhe recommended her daughter to his protection, had not power to anſwer; nor was it till they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded a conſiderable way on their journey, that they began to conſider the very fooliſh appearance they ſhould make at the court of Mary without Henry Dudley, who had been the chief object of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion.</p>
               <p>During the journey, which the badneſs of the roads and the heat of the weather rendered fatiguing and tedious in the extreme, Howard let no opportunity
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:034490_0100_0FFF0DBED43F3E28"/>
paſs in which he thought he could effectually pay his court to Columbia. But the confeſſion of Mina (who on the firſt night after their departure from Auſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Caſtle, had on her knees to her aſtoniſhed ladies revealed the whole of her imprudence, and Howard's ſeductive arts) would have effectually ſteeled her heart againſt him, had there been no other motive for her rejection. But with ſuch a woman as Columbia, the levity and unmeaning gallantry of Sir James Howard could make no impreſſion on her heart; eſpecially when it is remembered ſhe had been previouſly awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to ſenſibility by the intrinſic merit of Sir Egbert Gorges.</p>
               <p>Iſabelle and her daughter bore the journey better than could have been expected, and on the tenth day from the commencement of it, they arrived in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. Mina had drooped from the beginning, and was on their arrival ſo ill, from fatigue and grief, that there ſeemed but little hopes of her recovery.</p>
               <p>The old ſervants, Cora and Matthias, were left in the Caſtle, heart-broken for the departure of their kind and beloved miſtreſs. Their ſolitary days were paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in enumerating her virtues, and in offering up pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for her ſafe and ſpeedy return.</p>

               <p>ON the arrival of Iſabelle and her daughter in London, they were committed to cloſe confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; though by the care of Howard, whoſe power kept the eccleſiaſtics at a diſtance, they were treated with reſpect.</p>
               <p>The enſuing morning Iſabelle was ordered to attend the queen. With a moſt threatening aſpect did Mary interrogate her on the ſubject of Henry Dudley's eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and demanded to know where ſhe had ſent him. The widow of Arundel was inflexible. She only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:034490_0101_0FFF0DC06E472330"/>
that ſhe had ſent him to a place of ſafety; that in ſo doing ſhe only conceived ſhe had performed her duty, ſince, being herſelf convinced of the errors of the Catholic perſuaſion, ſhe had given by letter a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn promiſe to his dying mother, that whilſt ſhe lived, Henry ſhould be carefully inſtructed in the tenets of the reformed religion.</p>
               <p>Irritated beyond expreſſion by the noble firmneſs, which ſhe termed obſtinacy, of the lady Iſabelle, Mary commanded her from her preſence; at the ſame time giving orders for her to be put to the torture, to force a confeſſion from her. But Gardiner, who was preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and conceived this would be an impolitic meaſure of the queen's, humbly entreated a few days might be allowed for reflection. "Perhaps, moſt gracious ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign," ſaid the deſigning prelate, "your royal clem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency may have a more powerful effect on the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous mind of lady Arundel, than rigour; and the power of gratitude may draw from her a ſecret, which the moſt cruel tortures might not effect.</p>
               <p>Iſabelle was preparing to ſpeak again, but How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, who feared ſhe might too far irritate the queen, and trembling for the fate of Columbia, hurried her out of the preſence. Having committed her to the guards, who waited to re-conduct her to priſon, he returned to the queen, and informed her of his paſſion for the daughter of the haughty Iſabelle. "She is young, royal madam," ſaid he, "and if I can judge of her diſpoſition by her countenance, might be eaſily converted to the true religion; for ſhe appears all compliance, affability <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd gentleneſs. Permit me to try to bring her over to our party. When once convinced of the errors of the faith ſhe now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, it will become a point of conſcience with her to retrieve young Dudley from his preſent loſt ſtate."</p>
               <p>"I ſuppoſe this girl is handſome?" ſaid Mary. "I ſhould call her ſuperlatively ſo, had I never ſeen your majeſty," replied Howard, bowing profoundly.</p>
               <p>Mary, though at this period paſt her fortieth year, naturally plain in her perſon, and now more than ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from the ravages of a diſeaſe which daily gained

ground and began to give ſome very alarming ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, was ſtill open to the voice of flattery. The compliment of Howard had an inſtantaneous effect on her temper. She ſmiled, and told him ſhe would ſee this paragon. "I will converſe with her myſelf," ſaid ſhe, "and endeavour to draw her by perſuaſive arguments to the true faith. But if I fail, let her and her proud mother beware. Her beauty ſhall not ſave them; they ſhall ſubmit to the puniſhment appointed for obſtinate heretics."</p>
               <p>Columbia had ſuffered almoſt a martyrdom in the abſence of her mother; a thouſand fears had diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her. Sometimes ſhe imagined ſhe ſhould never ſee her again; that the furious queen, provoked by her refuſal to diſcover the retreat of Henry Dudley, would doom her immediately to the ſtake; then would ſhe wring her hands, and utter the moſt piercing lamentation, in which ſhe was joined by Mina, whoſe diſtreſs was the more poignant, as it was mingled with ſelf-accuſation. At length ſhe beheld her return, and her joy was for a few moments as wild as had been her ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Iſabelle was convinced within her own mind, that the hour drew near in which ſhe would be called upon to ſeal her faith with her blood, and endeavoured to arm herſelf with patience and fortitude for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected trial. Every haſty ſtep ſhe heard, every unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual noiſe that iſſued from the ſtreet, ſhe imagined was the meſſenger of her fate. But ſhe carefully concealed theſe thoughts from her daughter, thinking to ſave her the miſery of hourly expecting an event that would leave her an unprotected orphan, and which, however ſhe might lament, ſhe had no power either to prevent or retard.</p>
               <p>They partook but ſparingly of a repaſt that was brought them, when Iſabelle endeavoured to divert her own and Columbia's melancholy by converſation; at the ſame time ſelecting thoſe ſubjects which might tend to ſtrengthen and fortify their minds againſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending miſfortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="unknown:034490_0103_0FFF0DC844F568C0"/>
The afternoon was not more than half worn, when Howard arrived with the queen's mandate for Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia to repair forthwith to the palace. It was then the tender mother had need of all her fortitude. In vain ſhe pleaded to be permitted to go with her child; it was contrary to the commands of Mary.</p>
               <p>Finding entreaty fruitleſs, ſhe embraced her with tenderneſs, and ſaid, "Remember, my child, thy moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's happineſs depends on thee. Oh beware! Suffer no temptation, however great, to draw thee from thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to thy Creator. No, Columbia, not even to ſave the life of thy mother, let thy faith be ſhaken. If I muſt ſuffer, let me at leaſt have the conſolation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting, in my laſt hours, that my child preferred miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery to apoſtacy."</p>
               <p>"Fear me not, beloved parent," replied Columbia, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning her embrace, "I can never forget the noble examples of firmneſs and reſolution ſet me by my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; and if the remembrance of thoſe ſhould fail to animate me, I will think that my failure in ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a point would call a bluſh into the face of my mother; and that would give me ſtrength to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all temptation, however alluring, and defy all threats, all tortures, however terrible to human nature. Pray for me, my mother, pray for your poor child." She fell on her mother's neck, and ſobbed aloud. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard re-aſſured them, by pledging his ſolemn word, that no evil was intended; and taking her reluctant hand, led her from her mother into the preſence of the queen.</p>
               <p>Columbia, though endowed with all the rigid vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that ſo eminently adorned her mother, yet had an appearance of more ſoftneſs; and the awe a young perſon, totally unacquainted with the forms of courts, as well as of the world in general, might be ſuppoſed to feel on finding herſelf in the preſence of her ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and that ſovereign incenſed againſt her, gave her an air of timidity and humility highly gratifying to the pride of Mary.</p>
               <p>The queen queſtioned her concerning the departure of young Dudley. "He went away with a ſervant
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:034490_0104_0FFF0DCB17D29260"/>
belonging to a particular friend of my mother's," ſaid ſhe, "who wiſhed me to have gone too, but my love for the beſt of parents, and my conſcience, which told me I ſhould be wanting in filial duty, prevented my embracing the propoſal."</p>
               <p>"Conſcience?" ſaid Mary, fiercely, "the conſcience of a heretic cannot be ſuppoſed very tender; tell me, are you not a heretic?"</p>
               <p>"I do not underſtand the meaning of the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion," replied Columbia mildly.</p>
               <p>"I will endeavour to explain it to you," ſaid the queen; "come, child, be not alarmed. I will talk with you a little on religious matters. Your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is really pitiable, but it is more your miſfortune than your fault."</p>
               <p>"I humbly pray your majeſty to pardon me," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Columbia; "I am a weak girl, and totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate to the taſk of ſpeaking on ſo reverend a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, eſpecially before a perſon of your majeſty's ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior underſtanding and extenſive erudition. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ave hitherto lived a peaceful, happy life, unknowing and unknown; where, to the extent of my abilities, I have endeavoured, ſtrengthened as I was by the example of a reſpectable mother, to diſcharge my duty both to my Creator and my fellow creatures. I beſeech your majeſty, ſuffer me to return to that calm retirement, where the remainder of my days may glide on in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, and my name paſs quietly into oblivion."</p>
               <p>"I fear," ſaid Mary, "you entertain erroneous ideas of your duties, both moral and religious. Your faith and mine are different." Columbia was ſilent. "I will appoint ſome holy men to viſit your mother in her retirement," continued the queen, "and they ſhall alſo inſtruct you in the tenets of our holy church. Are you willing to be inſtructed and converted?"</p>
               <p>"I am willing to be inſtructed by wiſe and good perſons," replied Columbia; "I will liſten to them with patience; and if my reaſon is convinced—"</p>
               <p>"It muſt, it will be convinced," ſaid the queen, eagerly, "unleſs you wilfully ſhut your eyes and ears."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="unknown:034490_0105_0FFF0DCCEAD5FCF8"/>
"And that I hope I never ſhall do," ſaid Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia, fervently, "againſt the light of truth."</p>
               <p>Mary was ſatisfied, and diſmiſſed her, and ſhe was conveyed by the guards to the arms of her impatient and anxious mother.</p>
               <p>Both Howard and the queen from this interview en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained ſanguine hopes of converting Columbia. They did not perceive that all her anſwers were am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous, and might have been explained in a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſenſe than the one they took them in.</p>
               <p>Howard ſeized the favourable moment of the queen's good humour, to requeſt the charge of the priſoners might devolve on him. "I have a houſe, moſt gracious ſovereign," ſaid he, "not far from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; ſome of the apartments have heretofore been uſed as a ſtate priſon. Suffer me to convey the widow of Arundel and her daughter thither; I will anſwer for their being kept in ſafe cuſtody, with my life. In the mean time, my confeſſor, with whatever other ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtic your majeſty may pleaſe to appoint, can viſit them every day."</p>
               <p>"I ſee," ſaid the queen with a half ſmile, "you wiſh to have an opportunity of proſecuting your ſuit to the fair daughter of Arundel without interruption. Well, be it as you deſire; into your charge I commit them, and at the hazard of your head," continued ſhe, ſtern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, "be they forth coming whenever I demand them. For by the crown of my anceſtors I ſwear, they ſhall not eſcape my vengeance, unleſs they renounce their heretical opinions, and give up young Dudley to my power."</p>
               <p>Howard, pleaſed that by this manoeuvre he had got the perſon of Columbia entirely in his power, thanked the queen for her condeſcenſion, reiterated promiſes of not permitting them to eſcape, and haſtened to the place of their confinement, where he informed the lady Iſabelle and her daughter, that he had prevailed on the queen to let him remove them to a manſion of his own, not far from London. "You will there," ſaid he, "have the benefit of the air, and the indulgence of ſometimes exerciſing yourſelf in the garden. But I
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:034490_0106_0FFF0DCF252A05D8"/>
have obtained this favour at the hazard of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; for I have promiſed the queen that you will daily converſe with eccleſiaſtics of the Catholic perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Your patience one moment, dear lady," ſeeing Iſabelle was about to reply, "it is what you muſt ſubmit to if you remain here. Let me on my knees entreat you, then, to ſuffer me to convey you, and this angel your daughter, out of the reach of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Mary. Whilſt you remain ſecluded in her palace, the inſtruments of her power may, in the dead of night, ruſh in and ſacrifice you to her vengeance; but under my roof you will at leaſt be ſecure from ſudden inſult and ſurpriſe, and ſhould ſhe menace your precious lives, I will preſerve them at the hazard of my own."</p>
               <p>"Howard," ſaid Iſabelle, "I would fain believe your profeſſions are ſincere; but when I remember who betrayed us into the power of the queen, how can I?"</p>
               <p>This was the firſt moment Howard had ſuſpected that Mina had diſcovered his frequent viſits at Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenbury Caſtle. He had ſtrove ſeveral times, during their journey, to draw her apart from her ladies, but in vain. She had always carefully avoided him. But this he thought proceeded from her fears of awakening ſuſpicion; nor did he once imagine ſhe would confide an intercourſe, that would appear ſo much to her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, to the ear of a woman ſo rigidly virtuous as Iſabelle. It is true, Iſabelle was rigid in her own practice; but ſhe always made a juſt diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the errors incident to human nature, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated guilt. For the folly of Mina, ſhe found an excuſe in her ſimplicity, and ignorance of the world; but for the art and ſeduction practiſed by Howard, ſhe felt only contempt and horror.</p>
               <p>"What reliance," continued ſhe, ſtedfaſtly fixing her eyes on his face, "what reliance can I place on the word of a man, who by flattering promiſes dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w an artleſs, innocent girl to her ruin, whilſt from the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her unſuſpecting nature, he learnt ſecrets, the divulging of which has plunged her only friends and benefactors in unavoidable deſtruction?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="unknown:034490_0107_0FFF0DD2FA461358"/>
The cheek of Howard glowed with the crimſon tint of ſhame. The penetrating eye, the forcible voice of Iſabelle, ſunk to his heart.</p>
               <p>"I have been to blame," ſaid he, in accents ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly audible, "but do not too haſtily condemn me. Allow ſomething to the impetuoſity of youthful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and if, betrayed by an enthuſiaſtic partiality to the religion in which I was educated, I haſtened to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my ſovereign where ſhe might find the offſpring of Dudley and lady Jane, let it be ſome expiation of my error, that I am ſeverely puniſhed in having unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally involved two ladies in miſfortune, who, to every grace that can excite admiration, unite every virtue that ſhould command eſteem. Let not, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, the diſcovery of my errors blind you to what is abſolutely neceſſary to your own intereſt and ſafety, nor, by obſtinately refuſing the aſylum I offer, heap freſh guilt upon me, by making me in a manner acceſſory to your death, and that of your lovely daughter. The beauty and innocence of the fair Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbia have already awakened in the breaſt of Mary a malignant ſpirit, which ſhe will be glad to gratify by ſacrificing her to her pretended zeal; for your daughter has already expreſſed her attachment to the reformed religion, in terms too pointed to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked. Another interview with the queen, and ſhe will be loſt beyond recovery."</p>
               <p>Howard pauſed for an anſwer. The mind of Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle was in a ſtate of agony. Her own life would have been nothing; ſhe would have deſpiſed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Howard, and undauntedly braved the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the queen; but her child, her darling Columbia, her fate, perhaps, hung on her anſwer. She was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of the bigotted queen, Howard might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, might ſave her. What mother, in ſuch a caſe, could heſitate?</p>
               <p>Iſabelle bowed her head, and, in a voice tremulous through fear and ſtifled indignation, aſſented to his propoſal. A ſhort time ſufficed for preparation, and that very night they ſlept in the houſe of Howard, at Hamſtead, if ſleep it could be called, when to their
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:034490_0108_0FFF0DD4881BED80"/>
other anxiety was added the diſappearance of Mina. She came with them to the houſe, retired after they had taken ſome refreſhment, and when the hour of reſt arrived, was not to be found. Howard was ſuſpected by Iſabelle, but Howard had departed with the ſetting ſun, and could not be queſtioned.</p>
               <p>At the firſt appearance of day, Columbia aroſe; and for the firſt time, eagerly counted the hours that would moſt probably intervene before ſhe could hope to ſee Howard. The morning wore heavily away; Iſabelle was dejected and uneaſy; her daughter endeavoured to hide her own painful ſenſations, that ſhe might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the anxiety of her mother.</p>
               <p>About noon, their attention was arouſed by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of two eccleſiaſtics, who were appointed by the queen to viſit, exhort, and endeavour to convert the two priſoners. Iſabelle heard them in ſilence. Columbia was ſeveral times on the point of replying; but a reproving look from her mother repreſſed her thoughts before her lips could give them utterance.</p>
               <p>At the concluſion of the conference, the widow of Arundel ventured to inquire of theſe religious men if they had any knowledge of the fate of Mina; but ſhe received from them a ſtern reproof, and was bid to think more of eternal and leſs of temporal things, as her deſtiny was as yet undetermined, and it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſolely with herſelf whether a few days would rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate her in her late huſband's forfeited eſtates and property, or ſign the mandate for her death.</p>
               <p>When the prieſts left her, the fortitude of Iſabelle ſeemed entirely to forſake her. She threw her arms round the neck of her daughter, and gave way to an involuntary guſh of tears. Columbia, unprotected, dependent on the bounty, and liable to be enſnared by the artifice of Howard, was pictured to her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in colours ſo ſtrong, that ſhe could not ſupport the idea.</p>
               <p>Thus miſerably did day after day wear on, diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied only by the tedious exhortations of the monks, and the agonizing feelings of ſuſpenſe and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. A fortnight was now paſt, and they had not
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:034490_0109_0FFF0DD610DC3D08"/>
once ſeen Howard. They were attended with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful aſſiduity; they had but to name a wiſh, and it was inſtantly complied with. And only that they were not permitted to paſs the boundaries of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wall, their ſituation might have been thought en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viable.</p>
               <p>The charms of autumn were now beginning to fade, and winter was rapidly approaching, when one even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after a chilly walk to the extremity of the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of ancient elms that fronted the houſe, as Iſabelle and her daughter were ſitting down to their repaſt, experiencing ſome ſmall degree of comfort, in the neatneſs of their apartment, and the cheerful blaze of a wood fire that glowed on the hearth, they were ſtartled by a loud knocking at the gate, and in leſs than two minutes Howard ſtood before them. Spite of the reaſons they had for diſliking him, yet their long ſecluſion from all ſociety, (except the perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing zealots who daily viſited and tormented them) the many comforts they had through his means enjoyed, and the earneſt wiſh they had to inquire after the fate of Mina, gave to their countenances an air of pleaſure that was not altogether foreign to their hearts. Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle aroſe from her ſeat as he entered; Columbia ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced two or three ſteps towards him, and half ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her hand to welcome him. Theſe tokens of joy at his appearance, thrilled to the enraptured heart of Howard. He eagerly ſprang forward, caught the half-reluctant hand, and, dropping on one knee, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on it a fervent kiſs. The action recalled their momentarily forgotten dignity; the features of Iſabelle aſſumed their uſual frigidity. Columbia bluſhed ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let deep, and putting him from her with a rejecting motion, "Riſe, Sir," ſaid ſhe, "nor, by affected hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, inſult your priſoners."</p>
               <p>Howard now haſtened to inform them, that, anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious only for their ſafety, he had been aſſiduous in his court to the queen, and, bribing the prieſts to conceal the ill ſucceſs of their endeavours, he had perſuaded Mary that there was more than probable hopes of their converſion. "But I fear," continued he,
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:034490_0110_0FFF0DD84A9B9B50"/>
"I ſhall not long be able to elude her ſuſpicious vigilance. She this afternoon hinted ſomething of recalling you to London, examining you herſelf, and accordingly as ſhe found you inclined, either receive you into the boſom of the church, or give orders for your immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate execution."</p>
               <p>"Then our fate is inevitable," ſaid Iſabelle, with as much firmneſs as ſhe could aſſume. Columbia caſt a look of unutterable tenderneſs at her mother, and, gaſping to ſuppreſs the anguiſh of her heart, cried, "Yes, my mother, we will die together."</p>
               <p>"Not ſo," ſaid Howard, ſtruck with the magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity of the two charming women; "not ſo. My employment at court, which places me almoſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately about the perſon of the queen, gives me an opportunity of knowing her deſigns almoſt as ſoon as ſhe conceives them. I will attentively watch her; not a command ſhall be iſſued forth of which I will not learn the motive and intent; and ſhould I find her aim at the lives of my lovely, my eſteemed priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I will deliver them from her power, or die in their defence."</p>
               <p>Iſabelle ejaculated an expreſſion of gratitude, and Columbia, in tremulous accents, ventured to inquire after Mina. But Howard, with a look of ſurpriſe, proteſted his entire ignorance of her abſence in terms ſo poſitive, that it appeared impoſſible any longer to doubt his veracity.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the evening was ſpent in ſocial converſe. He inquired if they had all the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations they wiſhed, and if their commands had been readily obeyed by their attendants? On taking leave, he requeſted them to be conſtantly ready for a remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as he ſhould take care to give them early notice of impending danger, and provide them with horſes and attendants to facilitate their eſcape.</p>
               <p>After this viſit, their time was paſſed in the uſual way, till the morning of the ſeventh of November; when, juſt before day, Howard arrived, attended by a numerous retinue, and, hurrying Iſabelle and Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia from their beds, told them the moment ſo long
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:034490_0111_0FFF0DDC7AA4F468"/>
dreaded was at hand, and nothing but immediate flight could ſave them. They aroſe with precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and mounting the horſes that ſtood ready for them, proceeded, with all the expedition their ſtrength would permit, to the borders of the kingdom next the ſea on the coaſt of Suffolk, where, in a mutilated for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, (a very ſmall part of which was habitable) How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard requeſted them to repoſe, till, as he ſaid, a veſſel ſhould arrive, the maſter of which had orders to meet them there, to convey them in ſafety to Holland, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, or ſome place of ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Fatigued, diſpirited, and ill, Iſabelle attended but little to the deſolate appearance of their habitation, or the few accommodations they were likely to meet with in this ſolitary place. A numerous aſſemblage of male domeſtics had attended them on their journey; but they ſaw only one female throughout the whole dreary manſion, and ſhe was almoſt inſenſible through age and infirmity, being quite deaf and nearly blind. However, ſhe performed the moſt menial offices, and Iſabelle was too intent on the miſeries of her ſituation, and the danger to which Columbia would be expoſed, ſhould they be diſcovered and forced back to the court of Mary, to feel any of thoſe inconveniencies, which in her more proſperous days would have appeared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.</p>
               <p>All hope of a departure from England during the winter ſeaſon ſoon vaniſhed; the weather became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly tempeſtuous, the ſnow fell in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, and the froſt was intenſe. Howard was the conſtant inmate of their gloomy manſion; for, under pretence that his life was in danger on account of his having aided their eſcape, he ſecluded himſelf with them, and declared his intention to accompany them, whenever the weather would permit them to depart.</p>
               <p>During the dreary months of December and Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he endeavoured, by amuſing converſation, and a diſplay of the various accompliſhments of which he was maſter, at once to divert the melancholy of the lady Iſabelle, and awaken the attention of Columbia. But he preſently perceived his endeavours were inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual;
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:034490_0112_0FFF0DDE46B51250"/>
the deſpondency of the mother daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, till it almoſt bordered on deſpair, and every tender emotion of the daughter's heart was excited by hope, fear, and conſtant anxiety for the fate of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Sir Egbert Gorges.</p>
               <p>This diſcovery once made, it became the buſineſs of Howard to undermine a paſſion which militated ſo powerfully againſt his ſucceſs. To this end, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently pretended to receive private news from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and amongſt other incidents, related one day, in a ſeemingly careleſs manner, that a number of heretics had been executed, naming ſeveral, and at laſt Sir Egbert.</p>
               <p>Columbia was preſent; he eyed her attentively. She did not ſhriek, ſhe did not faint; but the blood forſook her lips and cheeks, her heart beat violently, ſhe raiſed her ſweet eyes mournfully to his face, and attempted to aſk a confirmation of the fatal tidings. But the words died upon her tongue; ſhe ſtruggled in vain to give them utterance; her voice was inarticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. She claſped her hands, leaned her head on her mother's ſhoulder, and large tears rolled in ſlow and ſilent ſucceſſion down her cold cheeks. Such mute grief, ſuch ſigns of real anguiſh, moved the heart of Howard. He attempted to comfort her; but Iſabelle waved him from the apartment; when taking her daughter tenderly in her arms, ſhe ſoothed, conſoled, and ſympathized with her, till her tears flowed more freely, and by degrees ſhe became compoſed.</p>
               <p>Howard had always been open in his declaration of love for Columbia; it was therefore not ſurpriſing that he continued his ſuit, or that, being thus conſtantly in her ſociety, he ſhould plead his paſſion with more than common fervour. She in general heard him in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; but if preſſed to anſwer, her reply was always that her heart was dead to affection.</p>
               <p>He applied to Iſabelle; ſhe urged the difference of their religions, even was Columbia inclined to favour him. He promiſed ſhe ſhould never be diſturbed in the free exerciſe of her religious duties, according to what ſhe thought right; and Iſabelle, worn out by
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:034490_0113_0FFF0DE01581A168"/>
conſtant anxiety, feeling her health daily decline, firmly believing Sir Egbert Gorges dead, and wiſhing to ſecure for her child a noble and powerful protector, at length ſeemed inclined to liſten to him, and to plead his cauſe with Columbia.</p>
               <p>The advice and reaſonings of her mother ever had due weight with this amiable girl; and though when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever her parent mentioned, that in all human proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, a few months would put a period to her exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhe would mentally offer up a prayer, that her own life might terminate in the very ſame moment with that of her maternal friend. Yet as ſhe ſaw her mother ſecretly wiſhed to ſee her united to Howard, ſhe endeavoured to diſpoſe her mind for ſuch a union, tacitly conſented to liſten to his ſuit, and at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the enſuing ſummer, to give him her hand.</p>
               <p>With ſlow and tardy ſteps winter receded; and ſpring began to ſhow her ſmiling face, and wreath her modeſt brows with ſnow-drops, crocuſes, and prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſes. All nature ſeemed to wear a cheerful aſpect; but the heart of Columbia partook not of the hilarity the vernal ſeaſon was ever wont to inſpire. If at any time ſhe ſeemed to enjoy a gleam of ſatiſfaction, it was when ſhe was wandering through the woods, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking the daily increaſe of the foliage, or ſeated on a rock by the ſea-ſhore, liſtening to the ſullen murmur of the waves, or watching them as they conſtantly ſucceeded each other, daſhing againſt the rude crags that hung frowning over their ſource.</p>
               <p>It was about the middle of May; the lady Iſabelle had declined walking, though the evening was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably fine. Howard had been abſent from the Caſtle two days; his abſence was a relief to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſpirits of Columbia. She took her ſolitary ramble through the wood. The fragrance of the evening air, the ſerenity of the ſky, the melody of the feathered race who were chanting their veſper ſong of thankfulneſs, awakened in her boſom ſomething like cheerfulneſs. She ſtrayed to her uſual ſeat by the ſea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, and indulged in the pleaſurable ſenſations the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:034490_0114_0FFF0DE27704CEF0"/>
proſpect inſpired. Pleaſure had long been a ſtranger to her heart, and ſhe welcomed her return, though in ſo ſlight a degree, with an emanation of gratitude to the benignant Power, who had ordained that time ſhould weaken and meliorate the ſevereſt affliction.</p>
               <p>Entirely occupied by her own reflections, ſhe did not obſerve any perſon near her till a young woman addreſſed her, and inquired the way to the Caſtle. "I want to ſee our maſter," ſaid ſhe "for the young lady he put to live with mother be very ſick, and mother ſays ſhe do think ſhe will die."</p>
               <p>"I am going to the Caſtle," ſaid Columbia, riſing, "and will ſhew you the way."</p>
               <p>"Where does your mother live?" continued ſhe; "and how does it happen, that as you call Sir James Howard your maſter, you do not know the way to his dwelling?"</p>
               <p>"Why daiſy me," replied the young woman; "no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body never lived in that there old place ſince I can remember, till maſter cum'd here laſt winter; and to be ſure, mother ſaid, ſeeing as how Sir James was a ſingle man, and wildiſh or ſo, it was beſt for brother to go when the lady wanted to ſend for him; but brother never went only into the kitching, and ſo never know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether there was any ladies there; but mayhap you be cum'd here lately."</p>
               <p>"How far from the Caſtle do you live, my dear?" ſaid Columbia, planning in her mind a viſit to the ſick lady.</p>
               <p>"About two miles," replied her companion, "down in a valley near the ſea; it be but a poor place, full of rocks, and nobody lives there but fiſhermen. But father was afear'd to ſtay in town, cauſe as how queen Mary had ordered all the heretics to be burnt; and father and mother be both heretics, and ſo we cum'd and lived here; and we had like to a gotten into trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there. For Sir James be one of Mary's folks; but that's no matter now, ſeeing that ſhe be dead, and I hope ſhe repented of all her cruelty before ſhe died."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:034490_0115_0FFF0DE65B76F9B0"/>
"Before who died?" ſaid Columbia; "who are you talking about, my good girl?"</p>
               <p>"Why about queen Mary, madam."</p>
               <p>"Is queen Marry dead?"</p>
               <p>"Laws daiſy, yes; ſhe died laſt November; and then we ſhould have gone home, only father was took ſick and died, an ſo mother—"</p>
               <p>The girl might have run on for an hour. Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia would not have interrupted her. Mary dead—dead ſo long, and Howard ſtill detaining her mother and ſelf in that ſolitary place, gave her an idea that his deſigns were not laudable or honourable; and then a ray of hope darted into her mind, that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her in reporting the death of Gorges. She quickened her ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ps; ſhe longed to cheer her mother with this new-born hope. Beſides, if Mary was dead, no doubt her ſiſter Elizabeth filled the throne. She aſked the queſtion, and was anſwered in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Her heart bounded at the tidings; ſhe ſcarcely touched the ground, ſo light and ſwiftly did ſhe paſs over it. She left her young companion below with the old ſervant, and flying to her mother, imparted to her all ſhe had heard, all ſhe ſuſpected, and all ſhe fondly hoped.</p>

               <p>ISABELLE joined her daughter in ſeverely cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the conduct of Howard, by comparing the time of their departure from Hamſtead with that of the late queen's death.

               <p>"We are, I fear, in the power of a villain," ſaid Iſabelle, "but we muſt exert ourſelves to ſhake off this bondage in which he, contrary to the laws of his country, detains us. I will ſeek the protection of my ſovereign, nor longer perſuade my child to give her

hand oppoſed againſt her heart. Howard is ſtill ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nor do I think he will return to-night. We will leave his dreary priſon, and, conducted by the young woman you mention, ſeek an aſylum amongſt the poor fiſhermen; they may perhaps procure us a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance to ſome neighbouring town from whence we may get to London."</p>
               <p>"Alas! my dear mother," ſaid Columbia, "you forget that we have no money."</p>
               <p>"I have a trifle, my child," ſhe replied, "and we muſt ſummon all our fortitude to brave even hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and danger without ſhrinking. We are women, it is true, and ought never to forget the delicacy of our ſex; but real delicacy conſiſts in purity of thought, and chaſtity of words and actions; not in ſhuddering at an accidental blaſt of wind, or increaſing the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable evils of life by affected weakneſs and timidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. How many of our ſex are obliged by hard and daily labour, to procure for themſelves and children the bare means of exiſtence! How many brave the ſeverities of the moſt inclement ſeaſons, with hardly covering ſufficient to keep them from periſhing! I allow that you and I, my beloved child, have been accuſtomed to tenderer uſage; but we are particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called upon at this time, to exert the ſtrength and faculties of both mind and body, with which nature has bountifully endowed us."</p>
               <p>"Oh! my adored mother," ſaid Columbia, "taught by your bright precept and example, I feel myſelf equal to almoſt any trial. But ill as you are, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſo long, ſo fatiguing a journey, without the means of procuring either comforts or conveniencies, if you ſhould ſink under it, who then would adviſe, conſole and direct your orphan Columbia?"</p>
               <p>"Courage, my love," replied Iſabelle; "I am not ſo ill as your tender anxiety leads you to think I am. Believe me, the agitation of the mind weakens and enervates the whole ſyſtem. The heart, eaſed of a load of anguiſh, beats lighter, gives a freer play to the lungs, and a ſwifter circulation to the blood. What is more conducive to health than change of air
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:034490_0117_0FFF0DE9D30EB150"/>
and exerciſe? Beſides, I have now ſome object in view, which will give conſtant employment to my thoughts. Employment naturally begets cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Nothing is more pernicious to the health of mind or body, than indolence and inaction. The fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulties become torpid; even the chords of ſenſibility loſe their fine tone, and the heart itſelf grows cold and inanimate as marble. Keep the hands employed, and the mind occupied in ſome laudable purſuit, and a ſweet ſerenity will diffuſe itſelf over the ſoul. The day paſſes without our noticing the hours, the night brings peaceful and refreſhing ſlumbers, and by throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the golden chain of induſtry over the wings of pleaſure, we take the little fleeting phantom priſoner, and make it our own forever."</p>
               <p>Columbia felt the full force of her mother's argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for, being buſied in putting a few neceſſaries together for their journey, ſhe was ſo wholly occupied by the pleaſures of anticipation, that every obſtacle ſeemed to vaniſh. "Heaven in its mercy guard and ſupport my dear mother," ſaid ſhe mentally, "and for myſelf I have no fears."</p>
               <p>The young woman, whoſe name was Cicely, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to conduct them to the cottage of her mother. For the lady Iſabelle ſaid, as Sir James was not at home, ſhe would herſelf viſit the ſick lady, and admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter ſuch conſolation as ſhe might find needful. The laſt tints of day were fading in the weſtern ſky, and the moon, in full majeſtic ſplendour, tipped with her ſilver beams the lofty and antique trees that ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the manſion of Howard, when theſe two intereſting women, accompanied by Cicely, entered the wood through which they were obliged to paſs in their way to her mother's habitation.</p>
               <p>In ſilence they purſued their way. Columbia and her mother could converſe but on one ſubject, and on that one, prudence forbade them to ſpeak in the preſence of a third perſon; and Cicely, though ſo communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the daughter, was awed by the preſence of the mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="unknown:034490_0118_0FFF0DEE62108CF0"/>
At length they reached the cottage; it was ſmall and meanly furniſhed, but withal ſo clean and neat, that it ſeemed the habitation of comfort and content. A middle aged woman, decently clad in home-ſpun ſtuff, met them at the door, and looking at the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with an air of ſurpriſe, eagerly aſked for Sir James. Iſabelle did not give her little guide time to reply, but anſwered for her, that Sir James being from home, and ſhe being his particular friend and gueſt, had come to viſit the ſick lady, and ſee if any thing could be done to help he.</p>
               <p>"Alack a day, my lady," ſaid the woman, "I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſhe be paſt help; I did not think ſhe would have lived till now; but walk into the next room, I believe ſhe is quite ſenſible yet, and ſeems to have ſomething heavy on her mind. I do think the poor ſoul would die eaſier, if ſhe could tell ſomebody her troubles."</p>
               <p>As the loquacious landlady finiſhed ſpeaking, ſhe opened the door of the adjoining apartment, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbia, with trembling impatience, approached the bed, and ſoftly put ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k the curtain. The light, which ſtood on the table by the beſide, ſhed its rays full on the face of the invalid, and diſcovered the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Mina. A momentary ſlumber had lulled her in forgetfulneſs. Beſide her lay an infant, to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance but a few hours old.</p>
               <p>"My heart foreboded this," ſaid Iſabelle. Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia's eyes ſtreamed as ſhe hung over the pale form of her beloved Mina; ſhe ſobbed aloud, but was unable to ſpeak. The dying ſufferer uncloſed her eyes, ſhe ſaw, and inſtantly recollected her lady and dear bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factreſs.</p>
               <p>"Then my prayers are heard," ſaid ſhe, faintly; "I ſhall leave my child, the wretched offspring of ſhame and folly, to the care of an angel."</p>
               <p>"Oh! my poor Mina," cried Columbia, ſinking on her knees by the bedſide, and endeavouring to ſtifle her grief. "Unfortunate creature," ſaid the lady Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle, taking the cold, damp hand of her ſervant; "ſeverely haſt thou ſuffered for thy deviation from the path of rectitude; but do not deſpond, my child.
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:034490_0119_0FFF0DEFEB910F98"/>
Your preſent weak ſtate, and the depreſſion naturally attendant on your ſituation, makes you think yourſelf near your end; but we will hope—"</p>
               <p>"Hope!" ſaid Mina, raiſing her languid eyes; "yes, I do hope that my ſufferings are nearly at an end, and that they have in part made atonement for my errors. I did not, believe me, I did not leave your protection voluntarily. I was forced away and brought to this place; I was taught to believe that you had left En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. I have ſometimes, ſince my ſecluſion here, ſeen the author of my ruin; but could not learn from him, that he knew aught concerning you. I was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly anxious to ſee him to-night; for ſure I am, my dear lady, I ſhall never again view the light of day. And I wiſhed to have with my own hands com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his child to his care; but I can with more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence leave it to your protection."</p>
               <p>Here a ſudden faintneſs made her pauſe. A few drops adminiſtered, ſome what revived her, and ſhe proceeded:—"A few ſtruggles more, and I ſhall be at peace. My heart, my heart is broken. Yet truſt me, it is not my own ſufferings, the ſlights of the man for whom I ſacrificed all, or the ſcorn of a contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing world under which I have ſunk. No! it was the conſciouſneſs of loſt innocence; it was the reflection that my lapſe from virtue had involved my kindeſt, beſt friends in ruin, which penetrated deep into my ſoul. Sleeping or waking, you were preſent to my thoughts, and I have died a thouſand deaths, in daily anticipating yours."</p>
               <p>The lady Iſabelle endeavoured to ſoothe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the affectionate, penitent Mina; aſſured her that what was in her power ſhe would cheerfully promiſe to perform; that ſhe would look on her child as an infant given to her protection by the immediate agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Heaven; and though ſhe ſhould think it a duty to endeavour to awaken in the breaſt of Howard the feelings of a father towards the helpleſs innocent, yet it would be her care to ſee that his health and morals were in no ways neglected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:034490_0120_0FFF0DF172CD2468"/>
"Yes, my dear Mina," ſaid Columbia, "he ſhall be my charge. Come, compoſe yourſelf; endeavour to reſt. When you are better, we will nurſe the little rogue together, and I warrant I ſhall prove the better nurſe."</p>
               <p>"Bleſſed—bleſſed—" ſaid Mina, graſping the hand of Columbia (which from her firſt awaking, ſhe had held in her's). Her eyes were ardently turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; they gradually cloſed; her ſingers related their hold, and her head ſunk upon the pillow.</p>
               <p>"She is dropped aſleep," ſaid Columbia, "I hope it will refreſh her." "It will," replied her mother, drawing her from the bed-ſide; ſhe will awake relieved from all her pain."</p>
               <p>"Do you think ſo indeed! my dear mother."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my child, moſt aſſuredly; for in this world ſhe will awake no more."</p>
               <p>The feelings of ſuch a heart as Columbia's, on ſuch an occaſion, cannot be deſcribed. The ſoul alive to ſenſibility, can eaſily conceive them; and to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling, a repetition of her complaints and ſorrows would be tedious and unintereſting. She took the poor motherleſs infant in her arms, and ſitting down in one corner of the room, baptized it with her tears.</p>
               <p>The ſcene became too painful for the lady Iſabelle; and whilſt the landlady and her daughter, aſſiſted by a ſervant, prepared the body of the departed Mina for her laſt reſting place, ſhe walked in a little garden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the door, ſeeking, from the cool evening air, a relief from that oppreſſion on the heart, which the recent ſcene had occaſioned.</p>
               <p>The air in a ſlight degree had the deſired effect. She returned to the houſe, and approached the door that led to the apartment of death. The lifeleſs body was now ſtretched upon the bed, on the ſide of which ſat Columbia ſtill weeping, and claſping the infant to her boſom. Her ſorrow was too ſacred, the leſſon was too important, for her mother to interrupt her. The ſound of footſteps called the attention of Iſabelle from her daughter. She turned to ſee from whence
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:034490_0121_0FFF0DF30BA55A90"/>
the ſound proceeded, and beheld juſt entering the houſe, Howard.</p>
               <p>"The lady Iſabelle," ſaid he, with a look of aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, "by what miracle do I ſee you here? and where is my charming Columbia?"</p>
               <p>"She is here alſo," replied Iſabelle, with a ſolemn voice. "Follow me; I will lead you to her."</p>
               <p>They entered the apartment together. Columbia raiſed not her eyes. The heart of Howard beat quick, as, leading him toward the bed, Iſabelle drew the cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering from the death-ſtamped face of Mina, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her, ſaid emphatically, "Behold the works of thy hands, Howard! Here contemplate the fruits of ſeduction!"</p>
               <p>At the name of Howard, Columbia ſtarted; ſhe read the emotions of his ſoul in his expreſſive counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Riſing from her ſeat, ſhe preſented the infant to him, and laying her right hand on his arm, called his attention from the pale corſe of her lamented ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. "Gaze not there, Howard," ſaid ſhe; "the injuries of the mother are paſt redreſs; but behold your child, make reparation here!"</p>
               <p>Howard, the gay, the thoughtleſs, diſſipated How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard was ſtruck to the heart. He ſaw the once lovely, blooming, cheerful Mina, and inanimate maſs. Thoſe ſparkling eyes, that firſt awakened the licentious paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, were cloſed in death; that heart, that had but too much ſenſibility, too much ſincerity for its own peace, was cold and ſtill. His ſeductive powers had hurried an amiable creature out of the world, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into it a helpleſs being, who, ſhould he live, through life would bluſh for the frailty of his mother, and execrate the licentiouſneſs of his father. He took the infant from the arms of Columbia, preſſed the hand which ſhe had laid on his arm, attempted to ſpeak, but his voice died away in inarticulate ſounds. The bitter tears of ſelf accuſation ruſhed down his cheeks; he returned the child to her; and throwing himſelf beſide the lifeleſs Mina, gave a looſe to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of his heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:034490_0122_0FFF0DF642B64E30"/>
Iſabelle led her daughter from the room; but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole night Howard never left it for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſmall was the portion of repoſe which any of the inhabitants of the cottage taſted.</p>
               <p>By the dawn of day, Iſabelle wiſhed to begin her journey towards London. She ſent in a requeſt to Howard, that he would grant her a few moments au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. He complied. When he entered the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe thus addreſſed him. "I ſent for you not, Sir James, to irritate your ſenſibility by unſeaſonable reproaches, nor to inquire what injury I had ever done you, that you have thus wantonly heaped miſery on me and mine.

I ſhall immediately proceed towards London. I alſo wiſh to inform you, that the poor departed victim, in her dying moments, recommended her infant to my care, and died in the full confidence of my protection and tenderneſs being extended towards it during its years of helpleſs infancy. I am ſenſible of your prior right; the right of nature is incontrovertible; and I have ſtill ſo good an opinion of your heart (when left to the dictates of reaſon and religion) as to think you will diſcharge the duty of a parent with conſcientious ſtrictneſs. But I have to requeſt, you will ſuffer me to be informed where the child may be placed, that in caſe of indiſpoſition, I may have it in my power to viſit and ſee that he is properly nurſed and attended."</p>
               <p>Howard was for a moment ſilent. His proud ſpirit was humbled to the duſt. But Howard, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of an error, knew how to make atonement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſcending from the dignity of man.</p>

I have injured you, lady Arundel, I have wounded the heart of your lovely daughter, by a falſe tale of the death of her lover; but, thank Heaven, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration here is not beyond my power. My ſervants ſhall attend you; my horſes are at your command; depart when you pleaſe.

Your requeſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the hapleſs offspring of indiſcretion, ſhall glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be complied with; his infant wants I will take care ſhall be amply ſupplied; I will endeavour, by tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs toward him, to atone for the injuries I have done his mother. But your friendſhip and attention, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting my cares to a proper channel, will be a valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acquiſition to him, and an act of condeſcenſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me. I will ſee the loſt Mina repoſe on her laſt bed, and then conduct my child and his nurſe to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, where, making ample proviſion for his ſupport through life, I will leave him to your protection, and ſeek, in the claſh of arms and the purſuit of glory, to loſe the remembrance of circumſtances which tend at once to my diſhonour and diſquiet."</p>
               <p>Early in the day, Iſabelle and her daughter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced their journey toward the metropolis. Though the ſpirits of Columbia had received a ſevere ſhock from the death of her favourite Mina, yet the bright proſpects that opened to her, in her recovered liberty and the certainty of Sir Egbert's life and ſafety, contrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uted in a great degree to diſſipate her melancholy; and as they drew near the concluſion of their journey, her heart vibrated with the moſt pleaſurable ſenſations.</p>
               <p>A ſudden thunder ſhower, which obliged them to ſtop when within a few hours ride of London, imped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their journey, and they were neceſſitated unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſleep another night on the road. After an early repaſt, they retired to their apartment, when juſt as Columbia was going into bed, ſhe miſſed her ring from off her finger. "Oh! madam," ſaid ſhe, "I have loſt my ring; and yet I am ſure I ſaw it on my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:034490_0124_0FFF0DFAE52819A8"/>
juſt before we went to ſupper." Every part of the bed-chamber was now ſearched, every article of her attire carefully ſhaken, her pockets turned inſide out, but all in vain.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," ſaid Iſabelle, "you may have dropped it in the room below." The hoſteſs was ſummoned, and requeſted to look for it, whilſt Columbia, too anxious to think of reſting, had (almoſt unknown to herſelf) again put on her clothes. The hoſteſs return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. " I have been very fortunate," ſaid ſhe; "a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who has been ſeeking game in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, being overtaken by night ſooner than he expected, entered the houſe juſt as you came up ſtairs, and being ſhewn into the apartment you had left, has found the ring, and here it is."</p>
               <p>Columbia eagerly extended her hand to receive it; but overcome with joy and aſtoniſhment, ſhe gave a ſudden exclamation of pleaſure, and ſpringing toward the door, was inſtantly folded in the arms of Sir Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Gorges.</p>
               <p>It was he, who with Rawlins had been in purſuit of game in the adjacent woods. Entering the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Columbia had juſt left, he ſaw ſomething glitter on the floor, and ſtooping, picked up the identical ring which he had placed on her finger at parting. His ſurpriſe was exceſſive; he had heard that the lady Iſabelle and her daughter had been in the power of Mary, and it was univerſally believed they had, through Howard's means, eſcaped; that they were at that moment under the ſame roof with him, he had not the moſt diſtant idea; but the perſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>"I beg pardon," ſaid ſhe, "but I come to look for a ring which a lady thinks ſhe has dropped here; I hope if you have ſeen it, gentlemen, you will reſtore it; for indeed the poor young lady ſeems in a ſad ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king about it."</p>
               <p>"A young lady?" ſaid Sir Egbert.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="unknown:034490_0125_0FFF0DFCAE574030"/>
"Aye, a young lady," replied our loquacious hoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs; " and as ſweet a young lady as eye ever looked on. I warrant it is ſome love token. Oh! if you had but ſeen her earneſtneſs, when ſhe entreated me to come and look for it."</p>
               <p>"I have found the ring," ſaid Sir Egbert, his heart throbbing ſo violently as to render reſpiration diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; "here, take it to the young lady, and as you give it her, ſuffer me to ſee her; leave the door partly open as you go in." A golden argument, with which Sir Egbert enforced his requeſt, prevented objections, and taking the plain gold ring from his own finger, he ſent it to Columbia.</p>
               <p>It may eaſily be ſuppoſed, that ſo happy, ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a meeting, baniſhed ſleep effectually from the eyes of all. Iſabelle and her daughter returned to the parlour, where inquiry, recital, and unreſerved confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on both ſides, occupied the remainder of the night. They learnt that young Dudley was ſafe in the protection of Elizabeth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> had reſtored to him the title and eſtates of his father, and promiſed to be his friend and patroneſs.</p>
               <p>Nor was Mina forgot; Rawlins ſeized the firſt pauſe in their intereſting converſation to inquire after the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his ſincere affection.</p>
               <p>Iſabelle heſitated; ſhe read his tenderneſs in the emotions of his countenance. At length the fatal truth was diſcloſed, and the piece of ſilver which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbia had taken from around her neck after her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, was reſtored to him.</p>
               <p>He took it; he gazed on it in ſilence. His manly features were tinged with the pale hue of death. He raiſed his eyes to the face of Columbia. The look was expreſſive; it ſeemed to ſay, "You loved her la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; do you not lament her?" Columbia breathed a ſigh of commiſeration. His heartſtrings, which were drawn almoſt to breaking, were ſoftened by its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="123" facs="unknown:034490_0126_0FFF0DFF8D847AD0"/>
The ruddy morn peeped through the eaſtern gates, before this happy trio thought of ſeparating. Iſabelle and Columbia at length retired to their chamber; but Morpheus was flown beyond recall. Unfeeling deity! he makes his longeſt viſits to the ignorant and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The peaſant, whilſt he labours amongſt the corn he ſows, ſtrews the ſomnific poppy; and in return, the leaden-winged power collects its ſweets, and ſheds them on his pillow. From the couch bedewed with tears he takes his flight, and when ecſtatic joy has ſtrung each nerve, and the exhilarated ſpirits mount toward heaven, he ſtands aloof and ſhakes his heavy wings, nor for one moment will impede the tide of bliſs, though courted earneſtly by weary nature, who lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes for reſt from each extreme, whether of grief or pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Preſented at the court of Elizabeth, Columbia ſhone conſpicuous. Her beauty ſtruck the admiring eye; her affability, good ſenſe and virtue captivated the heart. Her delighted, happy mother beſtowed her hand on Sir Egbert Gorges with unfeigned ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and remaining in the capital till Columbia was mother to a ſon chriſtened Ferdinando, and a daughter named Elizabeth, ſhe retired to Auſtenbury Caſtle.</p>
               <p>Her old ſervant Cora was no more. Matthias was in his ſecond childhood; but he experienced all the pleaſure of which human nature in its laſt ſtage is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, in the return of his revered lady. The autumn following, he ſlept in peace; and before the enſuing ſpring had called forth the primroſe, or decked the almond tree in bluſhing ſweets, the lady Iſabelle, the deſcendant of the great Columbus, the daughter of the Peruvian princeſs <hi>Orrab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Columbia on this occaſion viſited the ſcene of her juvenile pleaſures. Her feelings on the departure of her mother were indeſcribable. Her tears again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated the memory of the unfortunate Mina; and having given orders that the court yard, the filbert walk, the tower and eaſtern wing of the Caſtle ſhould

be kept in conſtant repair, ſhe returned to London, where ſhe continued for many years to ſhine eminently in the characters of wife, mother, and miſtreſs of a family.</p>
               <p>She died in the fiftieth year of her age, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given birth to five children; Ferdinando, heir to his father's title and eſtate; Elizabeth, who was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to lord Henry Dudley; Jane, who died in her infancy; Edward, who, embracing the ſervice of his country in a nautical profeſſion, and in the year 1585 embarking with the brave and enterprizing Sir Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Drake, periſhed in the attack againſt St. Domingo; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eatina, who married into the ancient and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable family of the Penns.</p>
               <p>Sir Egbert Gorges himſelf lived to a good old age; and dying, bequeathed his title and eſtates to a ſon, who thought hereditary honour of little value to the poſſeſſor, unleſs ſupported by humanity, juſtice and mercy.</p>
               <p>Sir Ferdinando Gorges regarded the honour of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtry in no other light than as a ſtimulus to praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy actions. "My father," ſaid he, "was belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eſteemed for his virtue, honour and integrity; I will not fully the name I bear, by any action derog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory to the character of a MAN and a CHRIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIAN."</p>
               <p>Sir Ferdinando Gorges was a gentleman of the old world; ſhould the character appear unnatural to any of the preſent time, let them remember that they are reading a "tale of old times," and exculpate the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor from the charge of romance and improbability.</p>
               <p>A certain modern author, a noble author too, (if inheriting a title conſtitutes nobility) has been at infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite trouble to explain the requiſites neceſſary to form the character of a fine gentleman; unfortunately, he forgot humanity, truth and religion. Sir Ferdinando Gorges imagined, that to love and worſhip his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to ſcorn to aſſert a falſehood, and to do as he would be done by in the moſt minute particular, was to deſerve the diſtinguiſhed rank he inherited from
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:034490_0128_0FFF0E03E394D360"/>
his anceſtors; and it is a moral certainty, that Sir Ferdinando was perfectly right in his ideas of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a real gentleman.</p>

               <p>SIR Ferdinando Gorges took but a ſmall ſhare in the active ſcenes of life, till the unfortunate Earl of Eſſex, favourite to Elizabeth, incurred the cenſure of his ſovereign by neglecting her commands, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the impetuoſity of his paſſion, inſtigated the populace (ever eager for novelty) to arm in his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and defence, which called forth the aid of the loyal ſubject in behalf of the queen's diſputed power. It was then Sir Ferdinando ſtarted into notice; he aſſerted the prerogative of royalty, and enforced the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of his ſovereign, not as the will of a deſpotic tyrant, but as the laws of a well-regulated govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, neceſſary to be ſupported, for the peace, intereſt and ſecurity of millions who lived under their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
               <p>He was a man remarkable for public ſpirit; it was the main ſpring that actuated all his purſuits. Every wiſh of his heart, every undertaking in which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, was deſigned to promote the general welfare.</p>
               <p>About the year 1624, a number of perſons having formed themſelves into a company for planting and ſetting a colony in New England, North-America, Sir Ferdinando was appointed by royal authority one of the directors, and expended great part of his pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inheritance in promoting the deſign. The ſpirit of his great and enterpriſing anceſtor ſeemed to revive in him, and nothing but his advanced age prevented him from croſſing the Atlantic himſelf, in ſearch of diſcoveries that might enrich or enlighten the riſing generation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="unknown:034490_0129_0FFF0E0574C95228"/>
Sir Ferdinando had married, at an early age, a lady of family and fortune; but ſhe lived only to give birth to a daughter; and Sir Ferdinando was ſo firmly attached to her whilſt living, and ſo ſincerely regretted her untimely departure, that he thought no other woman could ſupply her place. His ſiſter Elizabeth was nearly at the ſame period left a widow, with only one child, a boy about five years old. To whom could Sir Ferdinando apply to take the charge of his infant daughter, ſo well as to lady Dudley? And where could the young, the lovely widow find herſelf ſo ſafe, ſo ſecure from reproach, as in the family and under the protection of her brother?</p>
               <p>As the children grew up, Henry regarded his little couſin Iſabelle with more than fraternal affection; but the tenets of the reformed religion forbidding a union between two perſons ſo nearly related by the ties of blood, neither Sir Ferdinando nor lady Dudley en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged an affection, which in their ideas was a crime; and with a deſign to prevent its progreſs, at the age of nineteen, Henry was ſent to travel, and finiſh his education by gaining a competent knowledge of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign courts and manners.</p>
               <p>Though Iſabelle Gorges, at the departure of her couſin for the continent, was ſcarcely fourteen years old, yet Henry was fully ſenſible of the nature of the emotions he felt in her favour; whilſt ſhe, the pure child of ſimplicity, had no idea but that ſhe might love him beyond all other terreſtrial beings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it with impunity. She hung upon his neck at taking leave, beſought him not to forget her, and ſpent the whole day in tears. Every enſuing day ſeemed ſtill to make his abſence more intolerable. She thought of him inceſſantly, ſpoke of him often, and when a letter arrived, would hang over her fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's ſhoulder with delighted attention whilſt he read the contents.</p>
               <p>Henry Dudley was a man exactly calculated to do honour to the noble race from whence he ſprang; the letters of his governor to his mother were filled with his praiſes. To a brave, undaunted ſpirit he united a
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:034490_0130_0FFF0E072BDFAC98"/>
ſoul alive to all the finer feelings of humanity. With an ardent thirſt for knowledge, he poſſeſſed an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that directed his ſtudies and reſearches to the moſt uſeful, laudable objects; from the gentleneſs of his nature liable to error, but open to conviction, and ever ready to make atonement.</p>
               <p>"He has but one fault," ſaid his governor in one of his letters, "and that is an impetuoſity of diſpoſition when in purſuit of any favourite object; his affections are ardent in the extreme, and his paſſions, or rather his exceſſive ſenſibility, hurry him often beyond the bounds of reaſon and diſcretion. But this error is like a ſpot on the ſun, which may be diſcernible whilſt his beams are weakened by the miſts of the morning, but when he ſhines in full meridian ſplendour will become imperceptible."</p>
               <p>"Dear, beloved Henry!" exclaimed Iſabelle, as ſhe liſtened to her aunt whilſt ſhe read the paſſage. "Oh! why is he not my brother? I am ſure though, if he were my brother, I could not love him better than I do now; and you, my charming aunt," ſhe continued, throwing her arms round the neck of lady Dudley, "I think I could not love you more than I do now, but yet I ſhould like to call you mother. I never knew my own mother; you have amply ſupplied her place. Let me call you mother, dear! dear! mother. Oh! there is ſomething ſo delightful in the word, that my heart overflows with tender tranſports as I utter it. What a happy girl I ſhould be if I could ſay, My father, my mother, and my brother Henry."</p>
               <p>The lady Dudley perceived that the innocence of Iſabelle was equal to her tenderneſs, and that in wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to call her mother, ſhe meant no more, than that by her being ſo, Henry would become her brother.</p>
               <p>Henry continued his travels till he had reached his twenty-third year; it was then thought neceſſary to call him home; and as in his letters he had never mentioned Iſabelle only as a relation, Sir Ferdinando hoped abſence, and a variety of ſcenes, had totally eradicated the youthful predilection he had conceived
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:034490_0131_0FFF0E0AC8BA5C18"/>
in her favour. But in this he was miſtaken; the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which began in childhood had increaſed with his years; and though during his travels various other purſuits had contributed to keep it dormant, it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in his heart, and waited only for a re-union with Iſabelle, to blaze anew with more than its former ardency.</p>
               <p>During his reſidence at the court of France, Henry Dudley formed an acquaintance with Howard Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Howard, grandſon to the unfortunate Mina.</p>
               <p>Sir James Howard had conſcientiouſly performed his promiſe, in providing ſplendidly for the education of his ſon, whom he had chriſtened James Fitz-How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard; but as he left him in charge with an eccleſiaſtic of the Romiſh religion, in order to his being brought up in that faith, the lady Arundel could do no more than ſometimes viſit him during his infancy. His father died abroad before he was fifteen. Leaving him a very large ſhare of his eſtates, ſoon after this event his governor removed him to Paris; and from that period, the family of Sir Egbert Gorges were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unacquainted with his welfare or purſuits.</p>
               <p>The prieſt to whoſe care he had been entruſted, was a man of ſtrict probity; he paid the utmoſt attention to his education, and, uniting the friend and compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with the inſtructor, made him love virtue for its own ſake; for, beholding its effects in the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and manners of his reſpected tutor, he grew em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulous to copy what appeared ſo amiable. His father had been well-known to ſome of the moſt noble fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in France, and Fitz-Howard, at an early age, found himſelf in very elevated circle, careſſed and eſteemed by all. He married the daughter of a rich farmer-general, and Howard Fitz-Howard was the only ſurviving fruit of the union.</p>
               <p>This young man was a character compoſed of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties, at one verſatile as the wind, and boiſterous as the waves. With ſcarcely a trait of his father's virtues, he inherited the vices of his grandfather, with all that imbecility of mind, that heedleſs credulity, which had been the cauſe of the ruin of his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother.
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:034490_0132_0FFF0E0D0A6D4408"/>
Eager in the purſuit of pleaſure, a paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate admirer of female beauty, and maſter of an afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fortune, uncontrolled by any, he laviſhed it with a profuſe hand on thoſe who flattered his follies, careleſs whether they were deſerving favour or contempt.</p>
               <p>It may be thought ſtrange, that a young man like Henry Dudley could form an intimacy with ſuch a character. But youth is ever unſuſpecting, and the generous nature of Dudley could not imagine the gaiety and vivacity of Fitz-Howard was almoſt the only recommendation he poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>At the time Henry was recalled home, Fitz-How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard expreſſed an wiſh to accompany him to England. Madame Fitz-Howard had never, from his infancy, ventured to contradict any wiſh of her darling; and, unwilling as ſhe was to part with him, ſhe at length conſented to his going, on condition that the viſit was limited to ſix months. Accordingly the two friends, attended by their reſpective governors, arrived in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland about the middle of November, and with all the ſpeed the mode of travelling then in uſe would allow, proceeded immediately to London. The laſt rays of daylight glimmered in the weſt as they croſſed the Thames, and before they reached the manſion of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, the family were quietly ſettled to the employments of the evening.</p>
               <p>Sir Ferdinando was reading to his wife and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who were employed in embroidering a dreſs, in which Iſabelle was to be preſented at the court of James the Firſt, who now filled the throne of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Elizabeth; uniting, by his acceſſion to the Britiſh crown, the two kingdoms of England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in one. (This monarch was ſon to the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Mary, queen of Scots, who was beheaded at Fotheringay Caſtle during the reign of Elizabeth, after having been detained a priſoner there upwards of fifteen years.)</p>
               <p>Iſabelle Gorges was now eighteen. Her features were regular, but not at firſt view ſtrikingly handſome. The radiance of her mild blue eyes did not dart at once upon the heart, taking the aſtoniſhed ſenſes cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:034490_0133_0FFF0E0F66994D48"/>
but through the ſoftening ſhade of long, dark, ſilken laſhes, ſtole imperceptibly on the ſoul, and made it all her own. Her ſtature was above the middle ſize, yet not ſo tall as to render her perſon maſculine. Her limbs were round, and finely proportioned. A chaſte dignity, tempered by the moſt winning ſoftneſs, informed her manners, and rendered her irreſiſtibly charming.</p>
               <p>It muſt be remembered, that Dudley had not ſeen her for above four years. Imagine, then, what muſt be his feelings, when he ſaw the lively, affectionate girl, tranſformed into the elegant, dignified woman!</p>
               <p>Iſabelle had been hourly expecting her couſin, and was too much occupied in anticipating the pleaſures of their meeting, to be very attentive to her father's reading; nay, even the work in which ſhe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, though it continued to employ her fingers, did not for a moment occupy her thoughts. Every noiſe in the court yard, every quick ſtep aſcending the ſtairs, made her heart beat quick, and her eyes would glance eagerly toward the door.</p>
               <p>A confuſed murmur in the great hall had made Sir Ferdinando pauſe. "He is come," ſaid Iſabelle, drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping her work and ſtarting from her ſeat. The door opened, and Dudley was in a moment at the feet of his mother. Releaſed from the maternal embrace, he turned toward his lovely couſin, and received a welcome, which filled the breaſt of Fitz-Howard with envy. Recovered from the momentary delirium that ever pervades the too ſenſible ſyſtem upon a re-union with beloved friends, Dudley preſented his new friend, who was received with cordiality, and immediately invited to take an apartment in the houſe of Sir Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando, during his reſidence in London.</p>
               <p>A very few days ſerved to convince the father of Iſabelle, that the abſence Henry had been obliged to ſubmit to, from his couſin, had acted in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as a ſmall quantity of water does when thrown on a fierce fire, gave a momentary damp to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, only that it might burſt forth with double vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:034490_0134_0FFF0E11B072AA08"/>
deſtroying every object that attempted to oppoſe its fury.</p>
               <p>Iſabelle, modeſt, timid, and tremblingly alive to feel the ſmalleſt infringement on the delicacy of her ſex, was yet ſuſceptible of a pure, ardent paſſion for her couſin. Fitz-Howard, an inmate in their family, read the workings in the minds of all; for each ſtrove to hide from the other real ſentiments. The lady Dudley, and her brother Sir Ferdinando, ſaw with concern the paſſion which conſumed their children; but they endeavoured to conceal that knowledge even from each other, ſtill labouring, by various ſchemes, to divert the attention of Iſabelle and Henry different ways.</p>
               <p>Henry, when converſing with Fitz-Howard, would ſpeak with rapturous eloquence in praiſe of his couſin; but if his friend at any time accuſed him of being too partial, he would ſay, "Is it not natural for brothers to be partial to their ſiſters?" "Surely," replied Fitz Howard, "but do you love Iſabelle Gorges no more than you would love a ſiſter?" "No more, on my honour." Dudley would reply, and immediately change the converſation.</p>
               <p>Lady Dudley, thinking to fathom the ſentiments of Iſabelle in regard to her ſon, would ſpeak of him in her preſence. At the ſmalleſt encomium beſtowed on Henry by his mother, the eyes of Iſabelle would beam with pleaſure; a brighter glow would ornament her cheeks; and her coral lips, half uncloſed by the ſmile of innate ſatiſfaction, diſplaying her pearly teeth, would give that chaſte animation to her whole counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as rendered it ſcarcely a degree below angelic. When on the contrary, ſhould ſhe hear a ſyllable of diſapprobation eſcape her aunt, her lips would trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, her cheek loſe its carnation hue; and her eyes half filled with tears, her brow contracted by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of her heart, would ſeem to ſay, "Do not ſpeak harſhly of him, I am certain he does not deſerve it."And when lady Dudley has remarked that Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was an uncommon favourite, ſhe would reply, "Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he is, and can you blame me? Is he not your
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:034490_0135_0FFF0E158BCF21E0"/>
ſon? Surely I may love him for your ſake, and you will not contemn me."</p>
               <p>Thus every perſon that compoſed the family of Sir Ferdinando, endeavoured to conceal their real feelings; but Fitz-Howard read them all. From his firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction, he had felt his heart ſtrongly drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Iſabelle. At firſt, he imagined an inſuperable objection would ariſe from the paſſion of Dudley; but when from various circumſtances he learnt that the parents of neither party approved that paſſion, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the idea of ingratiating himſelf with lady Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and leading her, by imperceptible degrees, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his own pretenſions. He foreſaw that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of religion would prove an almoſt inſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able obſtacle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> but Fitz-Howard had not been educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a manner, that would lead him to think either religion or morality was of any very great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, when oppoſed againſt his own inclinations.</p>
               <p>In order to accompliſh this deſired end, he in turn made himſelf the friend and confidant of all. He liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened attentively to Sir Ferdinando's account of new diſcoveries, and approved all the plans he had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the extending of the bleſſings of navigation and commerce over the whole habitable globe. With Dudley, he joined in extolling the beauty, virtue and accompliſhments of Iſabelle, and without pretending to perceive the extent of his attachment, encouraged the affection he ſeemed to diſapprove.</p>
               <p>To the lady Iſabelle he was another character; talked of the different opinions that were adopted by the people of England in regard to religious matters; mentioned his own faith, not as oppoſing it to the faith of the pious, enthuſiaſtic lady Elizabeth; but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to wiſh inſtruction In the right way, as deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have his own errors corrected. Nor was this conduct entirely the reſult of art; it was chiefly the effect of nature. For Fitz-Howard could never main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his own opinion againſt ſtrong argument. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he could hardly be ſaid to have an opinion of his own; and had he converſed four ſucceſſive days with perſons of four different religions, he would, at
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:034490_0136_0FFF0E1715C34230"/>
the end of that period, have been perſuaded that he with whom he converſed laſt, was certainly moſt right. Thus verſatile by nature, it cannot be wondered at, that, finding this verſatility likely to forward his moſt favourite views, he took no pains to correct it, but gave free indulgence to a diſpoſition, which, whilſt it rendered him agreeable to every ſeparate branch of the family, promiſed him ample gratification in the favour of the aunt of Iſabelle.</p>
               <p>To Iſabelle herſelf he was tender, aſſiduous; in ſhort, all that love could inſpire, or friendſhip wiſh. She rode, ſhe walked, ſhe danced and chatted with Fitz-Howard without reſtraint; though at the ſame time ſhe would have preferred the company of Dudley. But if his company gave her moſt pleaſure, it was a pleaſure ſo mixed with anxiety, ſuch fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of offending, ſuch trembling apprehenſion and embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it became no longer deſirable, and ſhe evidently avoided giving him any opportunities of entertaining her, except in the preſence of her father and lady Dudley.</p>
               <p>Fitz-Howard poſſeſſed but little penetration, but a very competent ſhare of vanity ſupplied its place. He imagined that the apparent preference Iſabelle ſhewed him, was the effect of real liking, and that ſhe was captivated by his perſon, manners and fortune. Buoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by theſe ideas, he made propoſals to her father, offered to become a proſelyte to the reformed religion, and in every other reſpect his alliance was unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.</p>
               <p>Sir Ferdinando, flattering himſelf that Iſabelle was not altogether averſe to the union, referred Fitz-How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to his ſiſter for a final anſwer; and lady Dudley, prepoſſeſſed in his favour by his ſpecious manners, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to confirm him a convert to the Proteſtant cauſe, and wiſhing to put an end at once to the hopes of her ſon, approved his ſuit; and that very evening, as they were ſitting converſing together in an unconſtrained, confidential manner, declared to her niece the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation ſhe had given to the propoſals of Fitz-Howard, and adviſed her ſeriouſly to think of him as the man deſtined to become her huſband.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:034490_0137_0FFF0E189FBA3140"/>
Aſtoniſhment for ſome moments kept her ſilent; at length ſhe told her aunt, that ſhe was by no means partial to the man ſhe ſo warmly recommended, nor did ſhe wiſh to alter her ſtate; ſhe was perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with her preſent condition. Happy in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of her father and lady Dudley, ſhe wiſhed not to quit their protection for that of a ſtranger, and begged leave to decline the propoſed union.</p>
               <p>"I am much afraid, Iſabelle," ſaid that lady, "that you nouriſh improper, nay, criminal wiſhes. I fear you indulge chimerical hopes of a future union with Henry Dudley. But do not deceive yourſelf, my child; whilſt I live, thoſe hopes can never be realized, without incurring the ſevereſt malediction of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended parent."</p>
               <p>"If I know my own heart, madam," ſaid Iſabelle, ſomewhat piqued by her aunt's peremptory prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. "it never yet has indulged improper hopes or criminal wiſhes. Its every emotion has been regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by your precepts, and I truſt it will never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour its noble inſtructreſs. But if to love and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your ſon above all other human beings conſtitutes guilt, I am in ſome meaſure guilty. I am ſenſible of the barrier cuſtom, and perhaps you will ſay, religion, has placed between us; I have no wiſh to break through that barrier; but whilſt I am ſatiſfied with loving him only as a brother, I ſee no reaſon why I ſhould be compelled to become the wife of another."</p>
               <p>"Nor ſhall you be compelled, my deareſt couſin,"ſaid Dudley, who being in the adjoining apartment (the door of which had been accidentally left ajar) had overheard the whole converſation; "no divine ordinance forbids our union; then why ſhould ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition impoſe ſuch ſhackles on us? Have we not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to direct us? Why then ſhould we ſubmit blindly and implicitly to the opinions of other? Madam, look not thus angry on me," continued he, turning toward his mother. "You have heard from her own lips the preference with which my charming couſin honours me; then give her to me freely, and with her beſtow your maternal benediction. For here, in

               <p>It was in vain lady Dudley attempted to interrupt him before the ſolemn vow had paſſed his lips; in vain ſhe entreated him to recal it. He repeated it with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence that made her tremble; and turning from him in diſpleaſure, ſhe took the hand of the affrighted Iſabelle, and led her from the apartment. Diſguiſe had now become uſeleſs to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> parties. Iſabelle, daily tormented by the aſſiduities of Fitz-Howard, admon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed by her aunt and threatened by her father, felt exiſtence a burthen. The time ſhe was obliged to paſs in company ſhe laboured under the moſt cruel conſtraint, and her hours of retirement were ſpent in ſighs, tears, and unavailing complaints.</p>
               <p>Dudley no longer made one of the family. He had removed to a houſe of his own, where he had ſolicited his mother to preſide; but her affection for her brother had prompted her at firſt to decline the propoſal, and the reaſon may eaſily be conceived, why Henry now ceaſed to urge his requeſt. Fitz-Howard too had quitted the houſe of Sir Ferdinando, for apartments where, being himſelf maſter, his actions were not ſo ſtrictly ſcrutinized as they were liable to be in the family of a man virtuous from principle, and ſincerely pious, without being either a bigot or an enthuſiaſt.</p>
               <p>Though Dudley was no longer an inmate in the family, he was a daily viſitant at the houſe of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and found ſufficient opportunities to forward his ſuit with Iſabelle; perſecuted on one ſide, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſolicited on the other, where is the wonder that ſhe ſhould liſten to the ſyren voice of honourable love, and, beſtowing her hand on him who had long poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed her heart, become the wife of Dudley? Secretly, and by his own chaplain, was the ceremony perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They wait<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="136" facs="unknown:034490_0139_0FFF0E1E931715C0"/>
with the utmoſt caution, and ſuſpicion was again lulled aſleep. But Fitz-Howard ſtill perſiſted in his addreſſes, though treated with the moſt contemptuous coldneſs by the object of his adoration.</p>
               <p>The ſpring was now rapidly advancing, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Dudley removed with her niece to an elegant ſeat ſhe poſſeſſed near Windſor. Sir Ferdinando, fully oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in the laudable deſign of extending the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings himſelf enjoyed, to diſtant, unenlightened nations, ſeldom quitted the capital, except for an hour or two, to breathe the freſh air, and enjoy the pleaſure of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his beloved child.</p>
               <p>In this retirement, Dudley often viſited his wife; and unfortunately, Fitz-Howard, who had taken up his ſummer reſidence at Windſor, ſaw him come from the garden of lady Dudley one morning at four o'clock. That a ſon ſhould be ſeen coming from the dwelling of his mother, was in itſelf nothing ſurpriſing; but Fitz-Howard knew there was a coolneſs between them, and ſhrewdly ſuſpected to whom theſe early viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its were paid. His chief knowledge of the ſex being formed from his acquaintance among the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy part, he had always affirmed that every wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may be won, however ſeemingly virtuous. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with this idea, he imagined Iſabelle had forgot the reſpect due to herſelf, and, whilſt his breaſt ſwelled with envy at the ſuppoſed good fortune of Dudley, he reſolved to ſhare her favours with him.</p>
               <p>To this end he became more aſſiduous in his viſits; and one evening having followed her into the garden, informing her firſt with his knowledge of Henry's viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, he addreſſed her in terms that made the chaſte ſoul of Iſabelle congeal to an icicle. Swelling reſentment for a moment kept her ſilent, and when her words found vent, that laudable reſentment added keenneſs to her reproof. Her pointed rebukes, which ſhould have effectually repulſed his paſſion, ſerved but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame it; he caught her in his arms; ſhe ſhrieked; her voice caught the ear of her huſband, who had juſt entered the garden by a private door, to keep an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had made with her the preceding day. Again
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:034490_0140_0FFF0E202ABEF288"/>
ſhe ſhrieked; he redoubled his ſpeed, and entering the arbour, ſtruck the aſſailer of his honour to the earth, before his ſtep had been heard approaching.</p>
               <p>Iſabelle was a woman poſſeſſed of ſtrong fortitude; but terror, joy, apprehenſion at once aſſailed her, and ſhe ſunk fainting upon the earth. Her huſband ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to raiſe her, and the cowardly Fitz-Howard, med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itating only revenge, recovered from the blow which had for a moment ſtunned his faculties, ſnatched a ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letto from his ſide, where he conſtantly wore it, and plunged it into the boſom of Dudley.</p>
               <p>The cries of Iſabelle had reached the ear of her aunt, and ſhe had ſent out ſervants in queſt of her. They approached the arbour with torches, at the very moment this bloody deed was perpetrated, and in the confuſion that enſued, Fitz-Howard eſcaped. The apparently lifeleſs bodies were raiſed, and borne into the houſe. Iſabelle in a few moments recovered, but the ſoul of Dudley was fled forever.</p>
               <p>The deſpair of his mother was great, yet was it not to be compared with the anguiſh of heart under which the unfortunate Iſabelle ſuffered; for to the loſs of the being ſhe prized moſt on earth, was added the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of her aunt, and the reſentment of her father. In the firſt moments of her ſorrow ſhe diſcloſed the ſecret of their marriage, and lady Dudley, far from blaming herſelf as the author of the fatal cataſtrophe, told the heart broken Iſabelle, it was a juſt puniſhment (no doubt ſent from Heaven) for her diſobedience and unlawful love.</p>
               <p>Sir Ferdinando forbade her his preſence, and ſhe was driven from the houſe of her aunt by repeated taunts and upbraidings. As the widow of Dudley, ſhe was in affluent circumſtances; but of what value is wealth to the poſſeſſor,
<q>

               </p>
               <p>She could not be ſaid to live; it was barely exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; exiſtence not worth preſerving, yet obliged to be endured.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="unknown:034490_0141_0FFF0E21C6291E30"/>
At length ſhe became a mother, and the tenderneſs, the cares and pleaſures naturally attendant on the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal character, awakened her dormant ſenſibility. Her feelings were not dead, only benumbed; as the limpid ſtream, arreſted in its courſe by the chilly hand of winter, becomes ſtagnant, nay, almoſt an impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable maſs, till the infant ſpring, with genial warmth, gradually diſſolves the frigid ſpell; when it again proceeds in its uſual meanders, beautifying and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilizing every meadow through which it paſſes. So the mind of Iſabelle, awakened from its torpid ſtate by her infant ſon, expanded to receive the new-born pleaſure of rearing and inſtructing him. Every fond affection of her ſoul centered in him, and if ſhe ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to improve her mind, it was ever with the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hope of tranſmitting that improvement to the mind of her child.</p>
               <p>From the day of Henry's death, the lady Dudley had declined, and ſhe died without forgiving Iſabelle.</p>
               <p>Sir Ferdinando's reſentment had been powerful, but his affection towards his daughter was greater; and when there was no longer any one to keep the former awake, it gradually <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

But ſhe was not a woman to complain for trifles, or, having once embarked in a cauſe, eaſily to be frighted from purſuing it.</p>
               <p>The inclemency of the winter was accordingly paſſed over with patience, and as ſoon as the enlivening ſun re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed the ſprings and called the tender herbage forth, two apartments in their new houſe being rendered hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itable, ſhe exerted her utmoſt endeavours to add a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of neatneſs and elegance to what was abſolutely neceſſary for comfort. All the accompliſhments ſhe poſſeſſed, were at her leiſure hours exerted to embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and render their dwelling pleaſant. It was ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated above ten miles from the ſea.</p>
               <p>Dudley had, on his firſt arrival, purchaſed a large tract of uncultivated land. Having got a ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it clear, immediately ſurrounding his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Arrabella, both by her taſte, and knowledge in agriculture, aſſiſted in rendering it at once pleaſant and ſerviceable. Part of it was converted into a kitchen garden, to the cultivation of which Arrabella was particularly attentive. With her own hands would ſhe weed, water, or tranſplant the young vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables; and having ſown a few flower ſeeds which ſhe had brought with her from Europe, the watching a plant as it advanced in growth, or a bud as it gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcloſed the opening flower, afforded her the moſt innocent ſatiſfaction; and from this conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to her garden, ſhe gleaned at once employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, health and amuſement.</p>
               <p>But Arrabella did not neglect her needle; and when the enſuing year produced them a ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of flax from their own land, with what exulting pride did ſhe purchaſe a wheel, and ſet about manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing it into linen for her family uſe!</p>
               <p>Delightful age of primitive ſimplicity, when the mother of a numerous family did not bluſh (though ſurrounded by affluence) to ſet the example of induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to her daughters; when ſhe would preſide amongſt

them, whilſt they were converting the produce of them father's flocks and fields into clothing for the family. And with what a laudable pride did ſhe look round on her huſband, her children and ſervants, and ſay, "That cloth, that linen, thoſe gowns, are all of our own manufacturing."</p>
               <p>Their wants were few, and thoſe few were amply ſupplied; plenty preſided at their board, and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was a conſtant inmate in their dwellings. But indolence introduced luxury with her innumerable train of artificial wants. Though at firſt repulſed, ſtill would the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>A few years rendered the habitation of Dudley and Arrabella extremely delightful, and, added to other numerous comforts and bleſſings which they enjoyed, was a riſing family of beautiful children.

               <p>It was in the ſummer of 1661, the eldeſt child of Dudley, a ſon named William, who was about fifteen

years old, and his youngeſt, a daughter called Rachel, ſcarcely two, when ſome diſagreements having fallen out between the native Indians and the Engliſh ſettlers, the former frequently made inroads on the latter, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and burning their habitations, and either maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacreing the inhabitants, or taking them priſoners and carrying them up the country, where they often exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed on them the moſt wanton barbarity; ſcalping, maiming and disfiguring them, if at laſt they ſuffered them to eſcape with life.

               <p>The morning was fine. Cheerful had Arrabella aroſe, and, ſurrounded by her little family, joined with their father in their morning adorations to the Giver of all good. This indiſpenſable duty performed, Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley went to ſuperintend his mowers; and his wife, calling her girls, to the number of five, together, began the uſual taſk of inſtruction. But the little Rachel was not inclined to be quiet; ſhe was more inclined for play than ſitting ſtill. She climbed up in her mother's lap, kiſſed her, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

William obeyed, and from the garden ſtrayed into an adjoining wood, where, intent on a book which his father had deſired him to peruſe with attention, he ſuffered the little prattler to play round, pluck flowers, and catch graſshoppers.</p>
               <p>Arrabella was purſuing her employment, with all the delight a fond mother can feel, who marks the daily improvement of her children, and ſees them ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly ſtriving who ſhould foremoſt reach the goal of
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:034490_0146_0FFF0E2D08FAA138"/>
perfection, when an old ſervant, the only male then about the houſe, ruſhed into the apartment, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with looks of horror, "The natives! the natives!" Starting from her ſeat with precipitation, ſhe turned towards the window, and ſaw a band of ſavages croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through a field of corn, not very far from the houſe. "Fly! fly! my children," ſhe cried, taking the two youngeſt by the hand; and followed by the eldeſt, they ruſhed out of a door that led a contrary way to the road the ſavages were coming.</p>
               <p>There was in the very wood where William had wandered with his infant ſiſter, a cavern formed by the cunning hand of nature, the receſſes of which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabella had in days of happineſs frequently explored. Her preſence of mind in this terrifying exigence did not forſake her. With haſty, yet trembling ſteps, ſhe led her children thither; nor was it till reſting on the ground in its remoteſt winding, when ſhe felt her five children hanging about her, that ſhe recollected Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iam and Rachel.</p>
               <p>"Oh! my children! my children!" exclaimed ſhe, ſuddenly ſtarting up. "We are all here, mother," they anſwered with united voices.</p>
               <p>"But where! Oh where!" cried ſhe franticly, "is your brother William, and your ſiſter Rachel?" "Oh! my poor brother, my dear, ſweet little ſiſter," ſaid the children ſeverally; "let us go back, mother, let us go back and look for them."</p>
               <p>"No, my darlings, no!" ſhe replied, ſinking again on the ground, and drawing them cloſer towards her; "that would indeed be to ſuffer you to run into the very claws of the deſtroyer. The great God of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and earth inſpired me with the thought of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you here for ſafety; he will, I truſt, protect us; and his power to protect and ſave, even from the jaws of death, is equal throughout this wide-extended uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. He can guard all your brothers, your ſiſter, and your father too. Let us kneel, my children, and implore his mercy."</p>
               <p>At the mention of their father, and the recollection of their brothers, Charles, James and Chriſtopher, who
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:034490_0147_0FFF0E301150CCE0"/>
were in the field with him, the girls wept aloud. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabella poured forth her ſoul in fervent prayer, and the kneeling innocents, in broken accents, ſobbed <hi>amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The female ſervants, terrified at the approach of the ſavages, in their eagerneſs to elude them ran di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly into their power, and inſtantly became victims to their fury. They diſpatched them with their toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks, and ſtripping off their ſcalps, kept them as proofs of their endeavours to extirpate the Engliſh from amongſt them. The man who had alarmed his miſtreſs ran out of the houſe by the ſame way ſhe had taken; but thinking it would be right to alarm his maſter, inſtead of following her, made the beſt of his way to the field where the mowers were at work.</p>
               <p>The ſavages having rifled the houſe of proviſions, wearing apparel, and every thing which they conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would be any ways ſerviceable to themſelves, ſet fire to it, and then departed, with horrid yells of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultation at having done all the miſchief in their power to an Engliſh family. William was, at the moment the flames burſt forth, juſt returning with his little ſiſter. His father's houſe on fire, and a band of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in frantic rage haſtening towards them, was a ſight that filled with the moſt horrid preſages the breaſt of William. He ſaw there would be no way to eſcape them; ſo, claſping the infant Rachel in his arms, he knelt on the ground, fear almoſt ſuſpending every faculty.</p>
               <p>One of the foremoſt of the ſavage troop had raiſed his tomahawk to diſpatch the boy; but the child, with one arm clinging to her brother's neck, extended the other little innocent hand as if to ward off the blow, and ſcreaming, cried, "Don'tee, don'tee." At that moment a ſquaw, who held a papouſe at her breaſt, threw herſelf before the ſuppliant children, and ſaid in their own language. "You ſhall not kill the infant."</p>
               <p>The attempt ſeemed to have been the impulſe of the moment, for it required but little perſuaſion to turn the Indian from his purpoſe; he dropped the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death; William ſtarted from the ground, ran to the kind hearted woman, kiſſed her hands, bathed
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:034490_0148_0FFF0E32408777B0"/>
them with his tears, and pointing to the ſky, gave her to underſtand, that the Power who dwelt above that azure firmament would reward her. Her own infant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to her back, (the mode in which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian women in general carry their children) ſhe took Rachel in her arms; and William being made to aſſiſt in carrying their plunder, they proceeded or their march; a weary march it was to the poor little captives.</p>
               <p>Otawee, for that was the name of their protectreſs, did all ſhe could to make little Rachel eaſy, but ſhe continued at intervals to cry for her mother; and William, his feet lacerated by the ſharp flints and thorns he encountered in the rugged paths through which he was obliged to paſs, his heart bleeding for what he thought muſt have been the fate of his belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parents, brothers and ſiſters, proceeded as well as he could till towards the evening of the ſecond day, when, overcome with fatigue, grief and long faſting, (for he could not eat the food they offered him) he fell fainting to the earth. Fortunately they were now near the end of their march, or it is more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the unfortunate boy would have been left to periſh in the woods. As it was, two young Indians bore him between them to the water-ſide, put him in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe, and Otawee ſitting down beſide him, threw wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on his face, raiſed his head on her knee, and forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſwallow a little ſpirits, he by degrees re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
               <p>This party of plunderers were natives of Narha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſet. Two or three unprincipled and licentious Europeans having made incurſions amongſt them, plundering their little ſettlements, burning their wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams, and practiſing other enormities, as muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly awaken a ſpirit of revenge in the boſom of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons better regulated than thoſe of untutored ſavages; ſeveral families who had beed particularly injured, formed themſelves into a party, and embarking in their canoes, proceeded up Connecticut river, landing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they thought there was no fear of oppoſition,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:034490_0149_0FFF0E33D68A37C8"/>
and wreaking their vengeance on the unguarded and innocent inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Dudley had, from his firſt ſettlement, been a man of <hi>peace;</hi> happy in his family, fully employed in cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating and improving his little domain, he ſtepped not out of his own domeſtic concerns, except it was to aſſiſt a neighbour, (for any European family, ſettled within twenty miles, was at that early period termed a neighbour) or to inſtruct a new ſettler in the beſt mode of clearing his lands; to which inſtructions he ever readily added any help his ſervants, horſes, oxen, or even himſelf could give.</p>
               <p>Such a man could hardly be ſuppoſed an object of enmity to any; but his habitation had been marked by an Indian who had ſtrayed from his companions. Its lonely ſituation, its flouriſhing appearance, which promiſed plenty of plunder without fear of oppoſition, determined them to attack it; but when they had committed this outrage on a quiet, inoffenſive family, they well knew it would not be long before they were purſued. They accordingly made all the haſte they could to the place where they had left their canoes, and embarking with the plunder they had obtained, proceeded immediately home. On their way thither, meeting with a party who came from the more eaſtern parts; and, fearful that the young captives they had, might, if ſeen, betray them to the Engliſh, they ſold them, and William, and Rachel were carried to a greater diſtance than it could hardly be believed poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Indians to proceed in their little birch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes. When being landed on a very wild and totally uncultivated place, they were marched three days journey from the ſea-ſhore, and preſented to the ſquaw of their ſachem for ſervants.</p>
               <p>Otooganoo was a man naturally gentle, fond of peace, and eager in his endeavours to promote the welfare of his people. He had ever recommended to them to treat the ſtrangers who were come to ſettle amongſt them with hoſpitality; but it was not in his power to reſtrain the impetuoſity of youth, or to curb the licentious hand of the rapacious. When the
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:034490_0150_0FFF0E35909D0958"/>
young captives were brought to his wigwam, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked thoſe who brought them, and bade William to baniſh all his fears; for he would be a father to him, and, if ever opportunity offered, reſtore him to his natural parent. His wife was particularly pleaſed with little Rachel, and the kindneſs of theſe two good Indians rendered the lives of the brother and ſiſter as comfortable as the nature of their ſituation would admit of.</p>

               <head>Real Afflictions.</head>
               <p>AT the alarm given by the ſervant mentioned in the preceding chapter, Mr. Dudley, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by his labourers and little ſons, made all poſſible haſte to the houſe; but who can deſcribe his feelings, when he beheld the manſion where he had taken his morning's repaſt in all the ſecurity of conſcious inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of heart, and in which he had left thoſe treaſures of his ſoul, his wife and ſeven children, a heap of ſmok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruins? When he beheld, ſtretched on the earth, the mangled bodies of his female ſervants, the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the man was loſt in the anguiſh of the huſband and father. He raiſed his hands and eyes in agony towards heaven, his heart was too much oppreſſed to allow even the relief of tears, and he fell lifeleſs to the ground. His three ſons endeavoured to raiſe him, they called repeatedly on his name, and finding he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained totally inſenſible, wrung their hands, and wept with convulſive violence.</p>
               <p>At length nature, which had been only ſtunned by the ſuddenneſs and greatneſs of the affliction, in ſome meaſure revived. He raiſed his eyes, he caſt them on his weeping boys, and as if, at the ſight of them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting that it was a ſignal mercy that they were ſaved from the general wreck, he endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the ſenſibility that had overpowered him, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reſolution to ſearch round the garden, fields and
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:034490_0151_0FFF0E392FBD38D0"/>
out-houſes, ſome of which had eſcaped the fury of the Indians.</p>
               <p>But in vain he ſought, in vain he repeatedly called on Arrabella and her children; not a veſtige of them could he find. That they eſcaped out of the houſe before the ſavages entered, the ſervant had informed him; but their weakneſs from age and ſex, he imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, would prevent their going far. They might be overtaken in their flight. They might be carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captivity. A thouſand conjectures preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his diſtracted thoughts, but none of them glanced towards the right. At length, weary and heart-broken, he was perſuaded by his ſervants to go, with the remains of his family, to the neareſt Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſettlement. Accordingly, they put the children in a cart, and Mr. Dudley mounting a horſe, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers followed in the beſt manner they were able, and late at night they arrived at Plymouth; where the relation of the ſad events of the day filled the whole ſettlement with alarm. Every one was ready to ſympathize with the reſpected Dudley, and their ſympathy was doubly cordial, as in pitying him, each father of a family felt in might have been his own caſe.</p>
               <p>But to return to the afflicted mother and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Never was a day and a night paſſed in more agony, never did day and night appear ſo tedious; the mother, trembling for the fate of her children, and in her own mind certain that her huſband and their father had fallen victims to their ſavage foe, ſhudder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at every blaſt of wind that howled through the dreary cavern, thinking it was the yell of the Indians. And if, during the long, long night, weary nature pauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in momentary forgetfulneſs, ſhe would ſtart with redoubled terror, and call on her children ſeverally, fearing, whilſt ſhe had ceaſed to watch, they might have been ſnatched from her.</p>
               <p>Several times did ſhe venture almoſt to the mouth of the receſs; but the raftling of the trees, the ſound of animals' feet, which ſhe miſtook for human, would make her run back; and nothing but the moſt preſſing
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:034490_0152_0FFF0E3AB6FF48E0"/>
calls of hunger, which her children began to expreſs by loud and impatient cries, could have driven her at laſt from her retreat.</p>
               <p>She ventured at laſt entirely to quit it, and with fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſteps led her almoſt famiſhed little group towards the place where their manſion had ſtood; but alas! no manſion was there. Faint and diſpirited, ſhe ſat down on a rock, and gave free vent to the agony of her ſoul.</p>
               <p>"Do not cry ſo, mother," ſaid the eldeſt girl, her own voice almoſt choked with ſobs. "I am very hungry," ſaid a younger one.</p>
               <p>"Oh! my children! my children!" cried the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted mother, "we muſt all periſh together. Your father is no more; your mother has neither bread to give you, or where to ſhelter you from the inclemency of the weather, unleſs we return to the cavern, and I fear we are too much exhauſted to reach even that aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum again to-night.</p>
               <p>"There is the corn-barn, mother," ſaid one of them, "let us go there." Arrabella conſented; they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and ſome few grains of Indian corn being ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered here and there, the children gathered them up, and ate them with avidity. But it was a kind of food, however faint and exhauſted, their mother could not ſwallow. From the ruins of the houſe they brought part of an earthen pan; this they took to the ſpring, waſhed it clean, and took it full of water to her. She drank, and was in ſome ſmall degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed.</p>
               <p>Arrabella had it in contemplation to go to Plym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>outh; but her own increaſing weakneſs, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme youth of two of her girls, made her reject the idea as impracticable; added to which, in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon was a heavy tempeſt of thunder, lightning, rain and wind, which would have made ſuch a journey almoſt impoſſible, even in the beſt circumſtances.</p>
               <p>During the whole night, the tempeſt continued; and in the morning this unfortunate mother was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by anguiſh of heart and continued faſting, added to the damp of the floor on which ſhe lay, which had
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:034490_0153_0FFF0E3D89D6EFA8"/>
given her a violent cold and ſtiffened all her limbs, as to find herſelf totally unable to riſe. She firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved her laſt hour was at hand, and recommending her children to the protection of the Almighty, ſhe lay in ſilent and uncomplaining expectation of termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating a life, in which ſhe had enjoyed a very large ſhare of happineſs, and which, deprived of its chief comfort in the choſen friend and partner of her heart, had now no longer any charms for her.</p>
               <p>The elder girls, by ſearching abroad, had procured ſome little ſuſtenance from the fields and hedges; and this they would have gladly ſhared with their ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but alas! poor innocents, they were too far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted to be revived by the participation. They lay on the floor beſide their mother, and a faint moan, expreſſive of their ſufferings, was the only ſign they gave of exiſtence.</p>
               <p>The third morning dawned from the time of the enemy's invaſion, and ſtill no hope of relief preſented itſelf to the mind of Arrabella; and indeed to ſuch a ſtate was ſhe reduced, that hope, fear, every lively ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent was extinct, and a torpid deſpair had taken en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire poſſeſſion of her ſoul.</p>
               <p>Dudley, from exceſſive anxiety, was ſo very ill as to be unable to leave his bed. The three boys were ſtationary in his chamber; they hung over him, they adminiſtered every nouriſhment or medicine the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor preſcribed. Whilſt he ſlept, they waited in trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſilence, and when he awoke, eagerly ſtrove who ſhould receive his firſt requeſt, and fly to comply with it.</p>
               <p>But the old ſervant and one of the labourers, after talking the matter over one evening, reſolved upon viſiting the ſcene of deſolation the enſuing morning, to ſee if any thing worth preſervation could be found amongſt the ruins. It need hardly be mentioned, that in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

During the walk of old Philip and his companion, from Plymouth to the domain of Dudley, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation had turned chiefly on ſpirits, haunted houſes, and ſupernatural appearances of every kind. Philip affirmed, that it was his belief, innocent blood was never ſpilt, but that the ſpirit of the departed, nightly viſited the ſpot where it had been driven from its earthly tabernacle, and called for vengeance on the murderer; nor would it be at peace till that vengeance was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. "And for my part,"continued he with great earneſtneſs, his aſtoniſhed auditor (who not knowing how to read and write his own name, looked upon Philip, who could, as a wonder of learning) liſtening with aſtoniſhment, "for my part, I would no more go to theſe ruins after ſunſet, than I would put my hand into a burning fire; for I have no doubt but my poor miſtreſs and her dear little ones—" And here he pauſed to give vent to a guſh of tears, and then, as if thinking ſuch weakneſs in a man required an excuſe, he added, "She was a good miſtreſs; we all loved her like a mother."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that we did," replied his companion; " I ſhall never ſee the likes of her."</p>
               <p>"Don't ſay that," replied Philip; "I hope there be many as good; but I am morally certain it be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility to find a better. But as I was ſaying, I dares to ſay, ſhe do walk over the ruins every night, and with her dear little girls. Oh! mercy on me, what's that? Only that it be noon-day, or I ſhould think—"</p>
               <p>"As I am a ſinner," ſaid the other, "I do ſee ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> as like little Eliza."</p>
               <p>They ſtopped, they gazed upon what at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they believed a viſion; it was the eldeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Dudley, who, having ſtrayed toward the road in the hope of ſeeing ſome human being, of whom ſhe might ſolicit help for her dying mother and ſiſters, ſhe ſaw Philip approaching, and inſtantly knew him. The exceſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> joy had nearly proved fatal to her, and ſhe ſunk down amongſt ſome buſhes, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneouſly
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:034490_0155_0FFF0E42CDE44E10"/>
concealing her, the ſimple clowns imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined ſhe had vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>"Well, could not you have ſworn you ſaw her?" ſaid Philip.</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed," replied the other, "I would take my bible oath of it."</p>
               <p>They had now got nearly oppoſite the ſhrubs which concealed her. The poor child had not entirely faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but her languid frame, overcome by the ſudden flood of tranſport that ruſhed on her heart at the ſight of a human creature, and one ſhe knew, had occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a momentary ſuſpenſion of her faculties. She heard their ſteps as they approached nearer, and raiſing her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on her knees, cried, "Philip, dear, good Philip!" at the ſome time extending her hand towards him.</p>
               <p>Philip trembled, ſtood aghaſt, and ſtruggled for breath. His companion covered his face with his hat, and fell on his knees. But Eliza ſoon diſſipated their fears, by coming feebly towards them, again repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "Philip, dear Philip!" Then earneſtly claſping her hands, ſhe added, "Come, come, and ſave my mother."</p>
               <p>Fearful conjecture was now loſt in joyful certainty. "It is Eliza herſelf," cried Philip, catching her up in his arms. "She is alive! Oh! thank God! thank God! And my miſtreſs too. How did you eſcape the Indians? Oh! this will cure my maſter; this will make him forget his other loſſes; they are noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A man may build another houſe, but where could he find another wife like my worthy madam Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley?"</p>
               <p>They now, directed by Eliza, had reached the place where, ſcarcely exiſting, lay the deſpairing Arrabella. One child lay on her left arm, its head reſting on her boſom; another lay at her feet, to all appearance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate; a third was ſeated at a little diſtance, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting in her feeble arms a younger ſiſter.</p>
               <p>"Oh merciful!" ſaid Philip; "good father, what's here? My miſtreſs and my ſweet little ladies all dying. Go run," turning to the labourer, "run back to town, tell them to ſend a cart, to ſend victuals and drink,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:034490_0156_0FFF0E44544D2C90"/>
and a nurſe and a doctor, with bed and a bedſtead, and every thing. Good Sirs, what ſhall I do? Why don't you run? What do you ſtand for?"</p>
               <p>In this manner did Philip exclaim, walking back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward in wild diſorder; one moment ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to gaze at the pale and almoſt inanimate form of Arrabella, and the next running from one child to the other, ſometimes weeping, ſometimes bidding them to be hearty, and frequently ſearching his pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, as though he could in them find ſomething to ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfy their hunger.</p>
               <p>Extreme ſenſibility is often not only painful to the poſſeſſor, but prejudicial to thoſe whom we may wiſh to ſerve. Philip, with a ſoul exquiſitely formed to dictate all the ſoft offices of humanity, was not ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of rendering a real ſervice to his diſtreſſed miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, as was the labourer, who, ſimply comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſity of immediate relief being obtained, exerted his utmoſt ſpeed to return to Plymouth, where, explaining the nature and urgency of his errand, a ſhort time only elapſed before, with an eaſy convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, reſtorative cordials, and ſeveral women, he again reached the deſolated manſion of Dudley.</p>
               <p>The meeting between Arrabella, her huſband and children, was too pathetic to admit of deſcription. The joy ſuch an unexpected meeting occaſioned, would have been too exquiſite for human nature to ſupport, had it not been allayed by the certainty that William and Rachel were loſt beyond hope of recovery. With hearts overflowing with tranſport, they bleſſed God that eight of their children were living; and though they acutely felt the loſs of two, yet gratitude tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered affliction, and prevented their repining at the decrees of Him, whoſe judgments ever go hand in hand with his mercies.</p>
               <p>When Dudley's health was in ſome meaſure reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he began to think of preparing another habitation before the approach of winter; but no perſuaſion could prevail on him to ſuffer another houſe to be erected on the ſpot where he had formerly lived. He even took a diſlike to the whole colony of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:034490_0157_0FFF0E4697832658"/>
and ſelling his lands, he joined a number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, at that time about to make a ſettlement at Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co-Bay.</p>
               <p>It was in vain Arrabella repreſented to him the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of clearing and cultivating a new ſpot; his mind had never regained its firmneſs after the ſhock it had received, and he perſiſted in removing, from the boſom of his friends, to an uncultivated wilderneſs. But Arrabella was no longer in her prime. The brilliant genius and induſtrious hands which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to improve and embelliſh their former dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, debilitated by ſickneſs and ſorrow, had ſunk into inanity.</p>
               <p>For fifteen years, Dudley and his wife ſuffered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every ſpecies of affliction which human nature can endure and live. The throat-diſtemper raged, and in ten days ſwept off all their children; the cold Arrabella had contracted in the cavern, and ſleeping on the damp floor of the corn-barn, had given her a rheumatic complaint, which often confined her eight months out of the twelve. Dudley ſought, in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of his neighbours, a relief from reflection; and his intellectual faculties were ſo weakened, that he eaſily became the dupe of the artful or avaricious, and his ſixtieth birth-day beheld him poor in purſe, depreſſed in ſpirit, and devoid of health.</p>
               <p>"And if virtue, piety and integrity are thus over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with miſery," (aſks the man who profeſſes infidelity) "who can believe in an over-ruling Power, who puniſhes the evil doer, and rewards the good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works?"</p>
               <p>"All muſt, all do, who do not wilfully harden their hearts, and ſhut their eyes againſt the light of Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en," replies the humbly hoping Chriſtian; "for as the manſion of an earthly king is adorned by gold ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en times tried, ſilver purified by fire, and precious ſtones, which, ere they attain a proper brilliancy, muſt ſubmit to the knife, the ſaw, or chiſſel of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt; ſo muſt thoſe ſouls, deſtined to ſhine in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting manſion of the King of kings, paſs through the

               <head>CHAP. XVIII.</head>
               <head>William and Rachel.</head>
               <p>IN the year 1674, the war between the native Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans and the European ſettlers raged with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common fury. William Dudley, who had, with his little ſiſter, been carried into captivity in 1661, had now become a perſonage of great conſequence amongſt them. Otooganoo, the ſachem to whom he had been preſented, poſſeſſing talents naturally good, and thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for knowledge, yet unable to attain it, ſoon learnt, from his converſations with William, that he could in ſome meaſure gratify this very laudable deſire to be inſtructed. William, though young, had, by atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the documents of his father and the milder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of his mother, obtained a very decent knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of reading, writing, arithmetic, geography and hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Otooganoo no ſooner made this diſcovery, than William became to him the moſt valuable thing he poſſeſſed. "I will certainly reſtore him to his Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean friends," ſaid he, "but he ſhall firſt teach me all he knows. In the mean time, I will be kind to him, nor ſhall his little ſiſter ever want a friend or protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; as ſoon as he has imparted to me his ſtock of knowledge, I will certainly ſend him to his friends."</p>
               <p>Thus argued Otooganoo. But, alas! human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will be human nature; and when the period ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived that he had gleaned all the knowledge poor William had to impart, his heart was ſo attached to him, his ſociety had afforded him ſo many days, months, years of real felicity, that he made to his own conſcience daily freſh excuſes for not ſending him from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="unknown:034490_0159_0FFF0E4B062E5620"/>
William himſelf, though he frequently ſpoke of them, and expreſſed a wiſh to ſee his parents, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger felt that ardent deſire to return to them, which he experienced in the early days of his captivity. He had become inſenſibly attached to Otooganoo; and as, from the effects of his inſtructions, his protector had made rapid advances towards civilization, had entirely loſt his natural ferocity, and attained ſuch a degree of rational information as made him a pleaſant compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, William felt that attachment daily increaſe.</p>
               <p>Otooganoo had a daughter. Oberea was full five years younger than William; ſhe was tall, ſtraight, and finely formed. She was, at the time of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival amongſt them, a lively girl of ten years old, wild as the rein-deer, that with fleet ſteps bounds over the frozen plains of Lapland, and untutored as it is poſſible for a human being to be. Her looks, her words, her actions, were the genuine impulſes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>As the little Rachel increaſed in years, it was the employment of her brother's leiſure hours, to inſtruct her in the Engliſh language in the beſt manner poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The book he had with him, on the morning of his capture, was of infinite aſſiſtance to him, as by looking at that, he was enabled to form a very tolerable alphabet upon bark, uſing ſome of their ſtrong dye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ink; and this alphabet ſerved alike, Otooga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noo, Rachel and Oberea, who delighted in partaking their leſſons, and profited daily by his inſtructions.</p>
               <p>Educated under the immediate eye of a woman like Arrabella, it may naturally be ſuppoſed, William, though young, had imbibed very ſtrong and juſt ideas of female delicacy and decorum, and theſe ideas he laboured inceſſantly to impreſs on the mind of his ſiſter. Oberea liſtened attentively, and treaſured every ſentence he uttered in her heart. She had heard him tell his ſiſter, that his country-women were the moſt charming women in the world, and Oberea early form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wiſh of being thought charming in the eyes of William. This wiſh was a powerful taliſman to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the bad effects of habit, and at the age of ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:034490_0160_0FFF0E4D552475D8"/>
ſhe was ſo much ſuperior in manner to her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilized aſſociates, that William, without being aware of it, adored the lovely ſtatue his art had animated.</p>
               <p>He was not ſenſible of the exceſs of his tenderneſs for the charming Indian, till an accident, by nearly depriving him of her, convinced him at once how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſhe was to his happineſs. Some Indians, who dwelt in the town with them, having by traffic with the Europeans, who inhabited the ſea-coaſts, procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two or three muſquets, one was brought and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to Otooganoo, who being mightily pleaſed with the preſent, loaded it, with a deſign of going out in purſuit of game; but not putting his deſign in imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate execution, it was left ſtanding in one corner of the wigwam. A young ſavage, particularly attached to Oberea, took it up to examine it, and not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding how to handle it properly, touched the trig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. It went off, and the contents were lodged in the right ſide of Oberea.</p>
               <p>William heard the report, and the inſtant cries of his ſiſter; he flew to them, and entering, ſaw both his ſiſter and her he now found he loved equal with her, lying on the ground, which was covered with blood. The young man, frantic at what had happened, told what he had done, and that he feared he had killed both the girls; but Rachel's fall was the effect of ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſurpriſe, and it was ſoon diſcovered ſhe was not in the leaſt hurt. But Oberea wounded, to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance dying, was an object diſtracting to William. He raiſed her in his arms, called aloud for help, and having aſſiſted his ſiſter and an old ſquaw, to ſtaunch the blood, and bind up the wounds, which were chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the fleſhy part of the arm, and having ſeen her open her eyes, and ſign to him that ſhe knew him, he walked backwards and forwards, watching her as ſhe dozed, ſometimes applying a feather to her mouth to be ſatiſfied ſhe ſtill breathed, and often kneeling down to kiſs her hand, which lay motionleſs on the outſide of the bed.</p>
               <p>Otooganoo, during the time ſhe was thought in danger, obſerved, the extreme ſolicitude of William,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:034490_0161_0FFF0E4FC95F0470"/>
and when ſhe was perfectly recovered, thus addreſſed him. "You have been to me, young Engliſhman, a friend, a companion, an inſtructor, now above eight years. I love you with ſincerity, and I believe you love me."</p>
               <p>"Do you doubt?" aſked William eagerly.</p>
               <p>"No, I do not for a moment doubt your ſincerity. But I have alſo diſcovered that you love my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Your counſels and inſtructions have rendered her unfit to match with any of her own countrymen; you are now almoſt become one of us; take her, then, to wife; and when age, infirmity or death ſhall occaſion me to ceaſe from the cares of life, ſupply my place, govern my people, direct them by your wiſdom, teach them the real value of well-conſtructed laws, encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age them in ſtudying the arts of war; yet lead them, by your example and forbearance, to cultivate a ſocial and commercial intercourſe, and to preſerve peace with your countrymen, who are become their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as long as they can preſerve it with honour."</p>
               <p>William, weaned from his natural friends, tenderly attached to Oberea, perhaps not altogether inſenſible to the charms of power, and harbouring a fond hope, that by this union with the family of a ſachem, he might promote the intereſts of his countrymen in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, and be the cement to bind them in bonds of laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amity, liſtened with delighted attention, plighted his vows of love and conſtancy to Otooganoo, and in a few days ratified thoſe vows, by binding himſelf, by the moſt ſacred of all ties, to protect and love through life his charming Oberea.</p>
               <p>Otooganoo lived to ſee his ſon-in-law equally belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reſpected with himſelf, to embrace a grandſon whom William called Reuben: "For," ſaid he, "I have been a bondman and a ſervant unto my wife's father, and this my firſt born ſhall pay my ranſom."</p>
               <p>As the old ſachem felt his hour approaching, he called his chiefs, and the oldeſt men of his tribe, about him; and taking the little Reuben in his arms, whilſt Oberea, William and Rachel ſtood on his right hand, thus addreſſed them:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="unknown:034490_0162_0FFF0E5174F63A40"/>
"Warriors and Chiefs, Natives and undoubted Lords of this vaſt country, liſten to your departing father. I have ruled over you now above forty years; I have ever found you obedient to my commands, and affectionate to my family. But the great Spirit whoſe throne is on the loftieſt mountain, and whoſe breath paſſing over the great lake, can make it rage even as the wild tyger, when, ſuddenly ſpringing from his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret hiding-place, he tears and mangles his defenceleſs prey; or ſoftly moving over its broad ſurface, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it ſmooth, beautiful and enticing as is the ſyren, who charms but to deſtroy; this wondrous, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Spirit, who gave me life and motion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals the precious gift, and in a ſhort time I ſhall be duſt."</p>
               <p>Otooganoo pauſed; his whole ſoul was filled with the ſublimity of the BEING of whom he had been ſpeaking, and a moment was given to feelings beyond expreſſion exquiſite. Recovering the firmneſs of his voice, he thus proceeded:</p>
               <p>"Friends, Countrymen, Children, had I a ſon, I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He is brave, he is wife, he is humane! alike competent to proſecute war with vigour, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve peace with honour. He is, you will ſay, a ſon of our invaders, of our common enemy. But conſider them as enemies no longer. Bury the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatchet twenty feet under ground, and ſmoke the great pipe of peace, whoſe fragrance may aſcend even to the heaven of heavens. Hail theſe Europeans as brethren, and follow henceforth their precept of doing as you would be done by."</p>
               <p>"We will! we will!" they all exclaimed; when Otooganoo thus continued:</p>
               <p>"Chiefs, Elders and brother Warriors, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending to your choice this young man, I mean not to relinquiſh the affection you have ever ſhown my family. No. Behold this child, the ſon of my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; in him you ſee your rightful ſachem. But I am
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:034490_0163_0FFF0E551CA1A6A0"/>
paſſing from this world to the land of ſpirits, and this infant is incompetent to ſupply my place. Who then ſo able, who ſo worthy as his father, to govern and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you, and inſtruct the young ſachem how to guard, your liberties, and preſerve your love inviolate."</p>
               <p>Otoogano ceaſed, and an old warrior thus replied: "The offspring of Otooganoo, the ſon of Oberea, will ever be honoured and reſpected. We are content to receive, during his childhood, the Engliſhman Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iam, and to adopt the new faith thou haſt lately taught and practiſed. As the Europeans deal by us, ſo deal we by them, and the great Spirit judge us both."</p>
               <p>Otooganoo ſurvived this conference but a few days; he paſſed (to uſe his own expreſſion) to the land of ſpirits, and William Dudley was choſen ſachem in his ſtead, by the unanimous voice of the whole tribe.</p>
               <p>"As the Europeans deal by us, ſo deal we by them, and the great Spirit judge us both." This was the oath they took, and moſt religiouſly did they keep it. But if the profeſſors of Chriſtianity practiſe not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what they would teach to others, who can blame the ſavage, who (in ſeeking his own gratification, or promoting his own intereſt, regards not the happineſs, or intereſt of a fellow creature) follows but the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſet him?</p>
               <p>The new ſettlers made daily encroachments on the native inhabitants, drove them from their lands, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them of their wives, and made their children priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners. Was it in human nature to bear theſe injuries tamely? No; they reſented them. And even Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iam himſelf, though his heart bled at what muſt be the conſequence, could not attempt to repel the ſpirit of juſt vengeance that actuated the minds of all. War was declared on both ſides, and purſued with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting fury.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the young warriors that lived under the government of William, was Yankoo. He was intrep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id, bold, and daring. He hated the Europeans; yet, ſpite of that hate which ſeemed inherent in his nature, his heart was ſuſceptible of tenderneſs for one of the race. The beauty of Rachel had penetrated his ſoul.
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:034490_0164_0FFF0E577863AF28"/>
He loved, revealed his love, and found it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.</p>
               <p>The war continuing to rage, it became neceſſary for the ſachem in perſon to quit his home, and head his warriors. The undaunted Oberea would follow her huſband to the field, and Rachel, though naturally more timid, yet having her nerves new-ſtrung by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, accompanied her. They encamped near the ſea-ſhore. By the morning's dawn they expected the enemy.</p>
               <p>Yankoo paſſed a few hours the preceding evening in the wigwam of Oberea. "Oh! my friend," ſaid Rachel, as ſhe was parting from him, "be careful of your own life for my ſake; and if at any time your tomahawk ſhould be raiſed againſt an ancient Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, pauſe for a moment, and think, perhaps it may be the father of Rachel, and let the idea diſarm your rage."</p>
               <p>"It would do ſo," replied Yankoo, "did I not at the ſame time remember, that every Engliſhman is the enemy of my country."</p>
               <p>"Would you not ſpare my father then?" ſaid Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel.</p>
               <p>"No! not even my own father in ſuch a cauſe," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the warrior, and broke from her embrace. Rachel retired to her bed, and paſſed the night in tears.</p>

               <head>Long looked for come at laſt—Reuben and Rachel born.</head>
               <p>THE ſituation or feelings of William Dudley were at this period by no means enviable. Ruler over a nation of ſavages, who by their attachment and fidelity had conciliated his affection, his principles would by no means ſuffer him to deſert their cauſe in the hour of danger; yet remembering that his natural parents were Europeans, and the tenderneſs he once
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:034490_0165_0FFF0E59338EEDC8"/>
experienced for them not being extinct in his boſom, he felt his heart divided between two ſeparate intereſts; and if at any time a ſkirmiſh took place, he would think that, perhaps, amongſt the killed or wounded of the enemy, he might have to lament a father or a brother. And whilſt he was publickly obliged to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear rejoiced at the ſucceſs of the Indians, he would privately lament the defeat of his own countrymen.</p>
               <p>The ſoul of Rachel was equally agitated. Alas! who can deſcribe the feelings of a heart thus divided? She dared not pray, for to which party could ſhe wiſh ſucceſs? "Oh! ſave, protect and ſupport my father," ſhe would cry; then in a moment recollecting, ſhe would wring her hands and cry, "Oh! poor Yan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koo." It is anguiſh only to be felt, it is impoſſible to convey the ſmalleſt idea of its excruciating tortures, to any who have not experienced the agonizing effects of divided affection.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh had been driven to the very borders of the ſea; the Indians had purſued them with unremit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fury, ravaging the habitations, and, giving the unoffending inmates a quick paſſport to eternal reſt with their tomahawks, nor command nor entreaty could reſtrain their impetuoſity.</p>
               <p>William had followed a party led by Yankoo, to a houſe ſituated in a deep wood. As they approached, a cry of terror iſſued from the dwelling. The heart of William throbbed with anxiety; he quickened his ſteps, and arrived at the door juſt as Yankoo had dragged forth by his venerable locks, a man, whom he no ſooner beheld than he recognized the features of his father. The arm was raiſed that was meant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him.</p>
               <p>"Hold, monſter! barbarian!" exclaimed William, and throwing himſelf on the body of his father, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the falling weapon on his own ſhoulder. It fell heavy, it ſunk deep, and the blood iſſued in a torrent from the wound.</p>
               <p>Yankoo recoiled with horror; he beheld his ruler, his friend, and more than thoſe, the brother of Rachel, weltering in gore, wounded even unto death, and by
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:034490_0166_0FFF0E5BC3765E28"/>
his hand. He knelt upon the ground, he took his hand. "Oh! brave warrior," ſaid he, "why did you throw yourſelf in my way?" William raiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and pointing to old Mr. Dudley, cried, "To ſave a father."</p>
               <p>The old gentleman, in ſome meaſure relieved from his fright, endeavoured to riſe from the earth; but hearing the expreſſion of father from the lips of one whom he ſuppoſed an Indian chief, the truth began to dawn upon his mind. He knelt beſide the dying ſachem, and taking his hand, looked earneſtly in his face, and cried, "Is it indeed poſſible? are you my ſon!"</p>
               <p>"Your own ſon William," replied the bleeding warrior.</p>
               <p>"But alas!" ſaid the old man, "you are, I fear, mortally wounded."</p>
               <p>"And if I am," replied the heroic William, "it is a glorious wound; for I give my life to preſerve the life of him from whom I received it."</p>
               <p>As he finiſhed theſe words, he fell back and his eyes cloſed. The whole party were now aſſembled round their wounded chief; they raiſed him from the earth, and bore him into his father's cottage, where, confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by infirmity, was the unfortunate patient Arrabella. She had heard the exclamations of her huſband; her heart had not yet become callous to miſery. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her long-loſt ſon, was double agony, ſince ſhe but beheld his cloſing ſcene. He recovered a moment after they had laid him on the bed, gazed on the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his mother, faintly articulated her name, and his laſt breath paſſed in imploring a bleſſing on her.</p>
               <p>The news of their ſachem's death, and by whom, ſoon reached the tribe William had governed, and they repaired to the place of his deceaſe, vowing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on his murderer; for in that light they looked upon Yankoo. But when they ruſhed furiouſly into the houſe, intending to wreak their vengeance on him, the mute ſorrow depicted on his face, as with his arms folded on his boſom he ſtood contemplating the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:034490_0167_0FFF0E5EC1E90B50"/>
form of his departed friend, for a moment diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed their rage. He ſaw them enter, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing intrepidly towards them,</p>
               <p>"Friends, Countrymen, and brother Warriors," ſaid he, with a firm voice, "that I have incurred your hatred, that your rage is juſtly excited, is a truth I pretend not to evade or deny. I have deſerved death at your hands, and behold, here I ſtand prepared to meet it. Strike; I will not flinch; or lead me forth, and let me experience the moſt cruel tortures, I will not complain; nor ſigh nor groan ſhall eſcape my lips. Alas! if torture could wring them from me, how loud would my lamentations now be! The chief whom we all loved, the man we all revered, is gone to the land of ſpirits; is gone to that Father, that great Firſt Cauſe, of whom we have ſo often heard him ſpeak. He is paſſed from us, and my hand gave the paſſport, ſigning it with his blood."</p>
               <p>He pauſed, and his untamed ſpirit ſwelled even to his eyes; but he repelled the tokens of his ſenſibility, that were almoſt burſting from the gliſtening orbits, and ſtruggling for a moment to recover the firmneſs of his voice, proceeded:</p>
               <p>"Thou art gone, brave chief! (turning as he ſpoke towards the body of his friend) thou art gone; and where ſhall thy equal be found to ſupply thy place? Thou wert bold and daring as the young lion, and like him, generous and noble, exerted not thy power againſt the feeble and defenceleſs. Firm and unſhaken in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the rights of innocence, as the mountain whoſe foundation is in the centre of the earth, and whoſe top reacheth unto the clouds; yet gentle as the ſouth-weſt breeze on an evening in the bloſſom ſeaſon, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying as the willow, that inclines its head as the breeze paſſes. Thy voice was the voice of wiſdom. Thy words taught leſſons, which thy example enforced. But thou art gone! and where ſhall thy equal be found to ſupply thy place? Thou wert glorious as the ſun at his upriſing, mild and beautiful as the beams of the moon, when it dances on the boſom of the lake which the wind gently agitates. In the chaſe, fleet
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:034490_0168_0FFF0E610A019988"/>
as the young ſtag, and the arrow from thy bow never miſſed its aim. Thou didſt ſpeak, and none could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to believe; thou didſt command, and none but were eager to obey. The bad loved, whilſt they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee; the good adored, and endeavoured to imitate thee. Under thy wiſe government we reſted in peace, on matts made of osiers; our wigwams were improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our bows better ſtrung, our corn was multiplied an hundred fold, and our ſkins dried with more care. In peace thou wert as the dew of the evening, refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and invigorating all who lived beneath thy influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and in war terrible as the tempeſt that breaks the tall pine, roots up the ſtubborn oak, and makes the foreſt tremble, as it ruſhes with tremendous fury through it. Thy enemies beheld thee, and fear ſhook their ſouls; thou wert the father of thy people, Oh! val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iant ſachem. But thou art gone—by my hand gone! and where ſhall thy equal be ſound to ſupply thy place?"</p>
               <p>The numerous affecting images he had called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whilſt ſpeaking the eulogium of the deceaſed, had now awakened feelings too powerful to be repreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The afflictions of his heart burſt forth in loud lamentations. The rage of his countrymen was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſubdued. They dropped their tomahawks, and joined him in piercing cries and groans, repeating at intervals, "Our chief, our warrior, our friend is gone, and who can ſupply his place?"</p>
               <p>Arrabella had not lived ſo many years in the very boſom of America, at different times obliged to have ſome kind of intercourſe with the natives, without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a conſiderable knowledge of their language. She liſtened whilſt Yankoo was ſpeaking, and as he enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated the virtues of her ſon, ſhe felt that, amongſt the tears of regret that fell for his death, were ſome of exultation that he had deſerved ſuch an eulogium, and her heart was conſoled.</p>
               <p>But who can paint the anguiſh, the diſtreſs of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel, or the diſtraction of Oberea? When they heard the fatal tidings, they ſought the body of their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Brother, Chief. But here nor tears, nor cries
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:034490_0169_0FFF0E63162A0E98"/>
declared their ſorrow. When the ſoul is too full, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is of little uſe. There are no words capable of expreſſing real affliction.</p>
               <p>Oberea led her ſon Reuben (now nearly ſix years old) to the bed on which lay the corſe of his father, and pointing to the body, pronounced in a tone deeply mournful, "Behold!"</p>
               <p>"My father!" ſaid the boy, and, terrified at his ghaſtly appearance, claſped his arms round his moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and hid his face in her boſom. She ſeated her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the ſide of the bed, folded her arms round her child, and reſting her head on his ſhoulder, appeared the mute image of deſpair.</p>
               <p>The feelings of Rachel would have been equally poignant, had they not been directed to another chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. She had, as ſhe entered the apartment, faintly articulated the word <hi>brother.</hi> Arrabella caught the ſound, and calling her daughter by name, Rachel was folded in a moment to her boſom, and in the embrace of a new found mother, felt a relief from her ſorrows. Dudley kiſſed his daughter with tenderneſs, but the lively affection he had once experienced towards his children was now almoſt extinct. It had indeed for a moment revived when he heard the voice of William, but the icy finger of death had ſilenced that voice for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and the heart of Dudley could no more vibrate with the exquiſite delights ſpringing from paternal love.</p>
               <p>By the united efforts of Rachel and Arrabella, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea was at laſt arouſed from that ſtate of apparent inſenſibility into which ſhe had fallen. Rachel releaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her arms from the neck of her child, and drew her gently towards her mother, who ſoothed, careſſed, and collect her her dear daughter, the relic of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved William.</p>
               <p>At the name of William, ſhe ſtarted. Arrabella, perceived ſhe had awakened her attention, and from her own ſon, made a quick tranſition to the ſon of Oberea. She begged her to call forth her fortitude, to exert the faculties of her mind, and as ſhe loved
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:034490_0170_0FFF0E66C2941478"/>
her huſband, for his ſake, live, to protect and inſtruct his ſon.</p>
               <p>"I am his mother," ſaid ſhe; "have I not reaſon to lament the loſs of a ſon ſo worthy? But that he was worthy is my comfort. Had he not a thouſand virtues? and will you not ſtrive to live, to teach his ſon to emulate his father, to be as good, as great, as wiſe as he was?"</p>
               <p>Oberea caſt her eyes on her child, then ſuddenly covering her face with part of her garments, ſhe wept aloud. The deſired end was now attained. Acute ſenſibility being relieved by the effuſion, Arrabella was ſilent, and leaving nature to its courſe, waited till the firſt rude ſhock was paſt before ſhe attempted, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, to convince her of the inutility of grieving. Alas! it was a leſſon (hard as it was) which Arrabella had long ſince learnt; but it is what the children of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all learn. Repeated diſappointment firſt blunts the keenneſs of our feelings; corroding ſorrow, from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining, weakens the chords of ſenſibility, and at length age and infirmity, creeping by chilling yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt imperceptible degrees through the whole ſyſtem, totally relaxes every fibre, whilſt the heart becomes cold and impenetrable as the ice on the higheſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the Andes.</p>
               <p>The Indians mourned with ſincerity for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſachem. The chiefs and elders aſſembled, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that Reuben, when of a proper age, ſhould fill the ſeat of government, till when they entreated Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley to take the charge of his education. In the mean time, they prepared to inter the remains of their chief, with every mark of reſpect and honour. But on the very day when the ſolemnity was to be performed, the Europeans made an unexpected ſally on them, routed the main body, killed many, and took the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder priſoners. Amongſt thoſe who fell was Yan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koo. He fought, defending the houſe where lay the body of William, and died exhorting his companions to conquer or die.</p>
               <p>Dudley, his wife and daughter, with Oberea and Reuben, were conducted to an Engliſh ſettlement,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:034490_0171_0FFF0E69191A9320"/>
where the former ſunk into a ſtate of debility nearly approaching ſecond childhood, and in a few months reſted from all his ſorrows. When this event took place, Arrabella determined to return to England, partly from the hope of her native air acting as a reſtorative to her health, and partly in the wiſh of ſecuring to Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben the eſtates of his great-grandfather, Sir Ferdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Gorges; beſides which, ſhe knew that in Europe ſhe could procure him to be properly educated, which the very imperfect ſtate of literature in America, at that early period, would not allow her to hope, ſhould ſhe continue there. Rachel of conſequence accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied her mother; and Oberea, attached to them by every tender tie, would not be left behind. "The mother and the ſon of my William," ſaid ſhe, "I will follow to the furthermoſt part of the earth."</p>
               <p>It was early in the ſpring of 1680, when the widow Arrabella Dudley, her daughter, daughter-in-law and grandſon arrived in England, from which ſhe had been abſent about thirty-four years. Internal feuds and diſcontents had driven herſelf and huſband at firſt from their native land, and theſe feuds in ſome meaſure ſtill continued.</p>
               <p>Arrabella found it would be in vain to ſolicit for any part of the property of Sir Ferdinando. Himſelf and family in general had been attached to the royal party, and during the years Dudley had been abſent from England, the eſtates had paſſed through ſo many different hands, that it was almoſt impoſſible to trace them; or could ſhe have done ſo, ſhe would have found it difficult to make Reuben be received as the heir. His dark complexion, the nature of his father's mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with Oberea, which in law would have been termed illegal, all militated againſt ſucceſs, ſhould any ſuit be commenced againſt the preſent poſſeſſors; and Arrabella wiſely determined to conſider them as inev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itably loſt.</p>
               <p>She herſelf inherited, from the bequeſt of an aunt, a ſmall eſtate in Lancaſhire, and thither ſhe retired, where, devoting one half of its produce to the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Reuben, ſhe made the other half ſerve all the
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:034490_0172_0FFF0E6B5B9D7928"/>
purpoſes of life; and this eſtate was worth but three hundred pounds per annum. Yet Arrabella was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and enjoyed not only the neceſſaries, but the comforts of life. Her own appearance and that of her daughters was always neat, always reſpectable; and their countenances ever ſerene, if not cheerful. But their hands were conſtantly employed, and indolence and luxury were alike ſtrangers in their dwelling.</p>
               <p>A return to her native climate, added to the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity ſhe enjoyed, in a great meaſure reſtored the health of the widow Arrabella.</p>
               <p>Rachel, true to the firſt impulſe of her heart, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to marry, though her beauty and ſweetneſs had attracted many ſuitors. "I may," ſhe would ſay, "find men more accompliſhed, who will talk with more eloquence, are more poliſhed in their manners; but where ſhall I find the equal to Yankoo for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity?" Rachel preferred a ſtate of "ſingle bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."</p>
               <p>Oberea lived to ſee her ſon attain his twenty-third year, to ſee him beloved and reſpected by all who know him; ſhe then fell a victim to an autumnal fever. She had lived beloved, and died univerſally lamented.</p>
               <p>About eighteen months after the deceaſe of his mother, Reuben became acquainted with Caſſiah Penn. Caſſiah was tall, well ſhaped, not ſo fair as to be pale, nor dark enough to be termed brown; it was a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful mixture of the white roſe and carnation that glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her forehead, tinted her cheeks, and gave ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to her dark hazel eyes. Her face, which was elegantly ſtriking, without being regularly beautiful, received much improvement from a few curls of bright cheſnut hair, which eſcaped, here and there, from the confinement of a pinched cap (for Caſſiah was a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.) Reuben ſaw and loved the fair maiden. An intimacy had taken place between their parents, and by converſation it was diſcovered, that the father of Caſſiah was a deſcendant from Beatina Gorges, the youngeſt daughter of Sir Egbert and Columbia. It was a kind of relationſhip that ſanctified friendſhip in
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:034490_0173_0FFF0E6D2E427BC8"/>
the elder branches of the family, and encouraged the affection of the younger.</p>
               <p>Reuben wooed, and was ſucceſsful. He threw aſide the habit of vanity, and aſſumed the dreſs and faith of his beloved. Their hands were joined in the face of the church, and Arrabella, about three months after this event which gave her much pleaſure, went to the manſions of the bleſt.</p>
               <p>Caſſiah was young. Reuben wiſhed his aunt Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel to ſtay in the family and manage his houſehold. It was the very thing her heart wiſhed for. "My ſiſter," ſaid ſhe, ſmiling, "will have enough to do to nurſe and educate her children." But, awelladay! aunt Rachel was wrong in her predictions; for Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben was married above ten years before he had the leaſt proſpect of a young family.</p>
               <p>At length his beloved Caſſiah bid fair to make him a father. Univerſal joy pervaded the whole family; but, alas! how tranſient! The eagerly wiſhed for, the long expected hour at length arrived. Caſſiah gave birth to two infants, a boy and a girl. She heard ſhe was a mother, bleſſed her children, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended them ſtrongly to the protection of their father, and the care of aunt Rachel.</p>
               <p>"Will you name them, my love?" ſaid her huſband, bending over the bed with affection.</p>
               <p>"They ſhall be called after the two beings I love moſt," ſaid ſhe, extending a hand to her aunt and huſband. "Call them Reuben and Rachel." A ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den faintneſs ſeized her as ſhe ſpoke. Gently, and without pain, her pure ſpirit paſſed from its earthly to its eternal manſion.</p>

               <p>TO loſe the partner of the heart, and not feel acutely, would be juſtly termed ſtupidity. To attempt to delineate thoſe feelings, might with equal juſtice be called preſumption. The firſt year of our hero and heroine's exiſtence muſt therefore be paſſed over in ſilence. At the end of that period we behold their father combating, by the efforts of reaſon and conſtant employment, the barbed ſhafts of affliction. The very attempt to repel them weakened their force; by repeated reſiſtance they became entirely harmleſs, and fell, totally bereaved of point or power, to the ground.</p>
               <p>Reuben Dudley regained his ſerenity; his affections, his hopes, his fondeſt wiſhes were now centred in his children. Regret for the mother was ſwallowed up in expectation of the children's future virtues and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Aunt Rachel preſided over the houſehold, and ſuperintended the nurſery.</p>
               <p>Reuben and Rachel were by no means ſuperior to the generality of children of their age and condition. Rachel was a lively brown girl, and both ſhe and her brother very ſoon diſcovered, that by crying vocife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly they could obtain almoſt any thing. Aunt
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:034490_0176_0FFF0E7487AE6E40"/>
Rachel would not ſuffer the dear creatures to be croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and papa thought them, without exception, the ſweeteſt, moſt charming children in the univerſe. Alas! cries affected wiſdom how fooliſh the ſuppoſition; but reaſon, unbiaſſed by prejudice, declares it is only nature, pure, undiſguiſed nature.</p>
               <p>Nature! dear goddeſs! how beautiful thou art, when, chaſte and unadorned, thou appeareſt in the veſtments of ſimplicity; when the undeviating fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures portray but the feelings of the heart; when the tongue, uncontaminated by vice, unverſed in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of deception, gives utterance only to what thoſe feelings dictate; then, who can reſiſt thy eloquence? then, who can liſten to thy voice, or behold thy beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties unmoved? The philoſopher gazes at thee with rapture; the ſtoic cannot inveſtigate thy charms and retain his apathy; forgetting his affected inſenſibility, he beholds with wonder, admiration and love, thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obtruſive excellence, and joins involuntarily in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of the enthuſiaſt, Oh Nature! dear god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs! how beautiful thou art.</p>
               <p>The children were neither ſtrikingly beautiful, or remarkably brilliant. Health, cheerfulneſs, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions naturally good, rendered them engaging; but their minds, like the minds of moſt infants, were perfect blanks, on which the hand of education might impreſs whatever characters the inſtructor pleaſed. As they were educated in the ſtricteſt principles of Quakeriſm, neither trouble nor expenſe was beſtowed on the ornamental parts, though every thing uſeful was attended to with the utmoſt care.</p>
               <p>As they advanced in years, their characters natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly developed themſelves. Reuben was open, gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, unſuſpecting, and poſſeſſed a firmneſs of temper, almoſt approaching to obſtinacy. Enthuſiaſtic in his attachment to his ſiſter, from earlieſt infancy his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had declared, that to ſee her contented and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, made him ſo.</p>
               <p>Rachel was modeſt, unaſſuming, meek, timid and affectionate. Poſſeſſed of a good underſtanding, a quick and clear perception, and a ſtrong memory, the
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:034490_0177_0FFF0E7683222B78"/>
taſk of inſtructing her was moſt delightful. Daily, nay, almoſt hourly did her mind unfold ſome new, ſome unexpected beauty. Her love of literature, and the rapid progreſs ſhe made in every ſtudy in which ſhe engaged, at once charmed and aſtoniſhed her aunt and father. But her extreme diffidence prevented her excellencies from being univerſally known, and it was only by a long and intimate acquaintance her intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic worth could be diſcovered. Yet Rachel was not faultleſs. The meekneſs of her temper was ſuch, that reſentment was a ſtranger to her boſom. An injury was no more remembered than as it had given pain to her heart, and that heart, moulded by the hand of pure innocence, was credulous in the extreme. Her exceſſive anxiety to ſee others happy, made her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive to the means of promoting or preſerving her own happineſs; and if any one profeſſed to love her, though but a moment before they had held a dagger to her breaſt, ſhe would have forgot the intended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and never doubting their ſincerity, admitted them to her confidence and friendſhip. Her affection for her brother was equal to his for her. To ſeparate them, though but for an hour, was to give them the ſevereſt uneaſineſs. They were parted with tears, and met again with ſuperlative ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Such were Reuben and Rachel at ten years of age. Their father doted on them with the tendereſt affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and aunt Rachel thought they were the moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior beings in the whole univerſe. She would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times talk to them about America, deſcribe the vaſt woods, boundleſs plains, majeſtic rivers, and extenſive lakes of that great continent. Reuben would liſten with rapture, and ſay, "When I am a man, aunt, I will go there." "I ſhould like to go too," Rachel would ſay, "but I am ſure I ſhould be afraid to go to ſea."</p>
               <p>It was on a winter's evening, as their father was overlooking ſome papers, old deeds, &amp;c. that had lain mouldy in an old trunk for many years, (intending to deſtroy thoſe that were uſeleſs) that Reuben eſpied a ſcarlet plume, or rather coronet of feathers, which had
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:034490_0178_0FFF0E7B48441E90"/>
been thrown with ſome other rubbiſh in a heap, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be burned. He ſeized it, examined it with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and at length, conceiving the purpoſe for which it had been made, tied it round his head, and marching up to his father, cried, "Look at me, Sir."</p>
               <p>"Upon my word, Sir," replied his father, ſmiling, "why you look like a ſachem indeed now."</p>
               <p>"Why, father, did the ſachems of the Indians wear ſuch things on their heads?" aſked Reuben.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied, his father, "that was your grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's coronet."</p>
               <p>"My grandfather, Sir!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, child; he became a ſachem by marrying the daughter of an Indian chief; but I thought your aunt had told you that long ago."</p>
               <p>"No indeed, Sir; will you tell us all about it, how it came to happen, now?"</p>
               <p>"No; it is a long ſtory, and I am buſy."</p>
               <p>Curioſity is perhaps the ſtrongeſt impulſe of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind. In extreme youth its power is irreſiſtible. The children felt theirs awakened, and ſoftly opening the door of their father's ſtudy, they ſlipped out, and ran into the parlour to aunt Rachel. Aunt Rachel was, it is true, an old maid.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Full fifty winters, as they paſs'd, had ſhed</l>
                  <l>Their ſilver honours on her rev'rend head;</l>
                  <l>But ſtill her heart its priſtine warmth retain'd;</l>
                  <l>The days were paſt, but mem'ry ſtill remain'd.</l>
                  <l>Still the lov'd form of the lamented youth,</l>
                  <l>His faith, his love, his conſtancy, his truth,</l>
                  <l>Were treaſur'd there.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>The coronet that bound the brows of Reuben, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called a thouſand tender recollections. Her dear broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er William ſeemed to ſtand in miniature before her. The form of Yankoo aroſe to her remembrance. Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea too ſeemed preſent; and when the boy aſked her if ſhe knew whoſe crown that was, her feelings were ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful as for a moment to ſuſpend her anſwer.</p>
               <p>"It was my brother's," ſaid ſhe in a mournful tone, taking it from the child's head and laying it on her own knee; "I have ſeen him wear it often."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="unknown:034490_0179_0FFF0E7D91F628E8"/>
"He was a great man in America, aunt," ſaid Reuben.</p>
               <p>"He was more than great, my love, he was good."</p>
               <p>"Pray, aunt," ſaid Rachel, "do you remember my grandmother?"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly."</p>
               <p>"Was ſhe an Indian?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"What, quite a wild ſavage?"</p>
               <p>"No, my dear, ſhe was what is in general errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly termed ſo; but her heart was as gentle, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, as full of virtue and piety, as that of the moſt enlightened Chriſtian."</p>
               <p>"Was ſhe black, aunt?"</p>
               <p>"No; dark brown, or rather copper. But the complexion of her face was like that of her mind. Its charms and imperfections were diſcoverable at one glance, and it was ever beautiful, becauſe invariable."</p>
               <p>"But was my grandfather a ſachem?"</p>
               <p>"He was."</p>
               <p>"What is a ſachem?"</p>
               <p>"It is a title given to a chief amongſt the Indians, and is the ſame as governor with us."</p>
               <p>"How came he to be a chief of the ſavages, aunt?"</p>
               <p>"I will tell you," replied aunt Rachel.</p>
               <p>It was a ſubject on which ſhe delighted to expatiate. She ſtirred up the fire, folded up her work, and placing the attentive children on each ſide of her, began.—But my readers already know the whole ſtory, and repetitions are ever tedious and unintereſting. Aunt Rachel was minute in her recital. At the account of her capture, Rachel wept; but Reuben ſtarted from his ſeat, his countenance glowing with reſentment, and cried, "I wiſh I had been there."</p>
               <p>"And what could you have done, my love?" ſaid his aunt.</p>
               <p>"Have reſcued you, or died," replied our hero.</p>
               <p>"Charming, undaunted ſpirit," exclaimed his aunt, and then continued her narrative.</p>
               <p>When ſhe recounted the death of Otooganoo, and the ſolemn manner in which he recommended their
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:034490_0180_0FFF0E7F27C342A0"/>
father (then an infant) to the care of the chiefs, "Good old man," ſaid Rachel, in the moſt expreſſive accent of affection, "what a pity he ſhould die."</p>
               <p>"Then my father is a ſachem," ſaid Reuben; and the ſeeds of ambition which nature had implanted, but which till that moment had lain dormant in his boſom, ſtarted into life. At the account of their grandfather's death, the children both ſobbed audibly.</p>
               <p>"I will! I am determined I will! go to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca," ſaid Reuben, firſt ſuppreſſing his emotions.</p>
               <p>"What, without me, brother?" aſked Rachel, in a mournful voice.</p>
               <p>"No, no," he replied, "not without you, but when I am a man we will go together; we will find out our grandfather's government, and diſcover ourſelves to his people; I dare ſay they would be glad to ſee us, ſince they loved him ſo well."</p>
               <p>"But what ſhould we go there for, brother? I am ſure we are very happy here, and papa would not be willing to part with us, and aunt Rachel too would miſs us."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, I will go, and leave you with them, and when I have ſettled myſelf in my government, I will ſend for you all. Oh! what a fine houſe I will have, and then what a number of ſervants, and horſes, and coaches."</p>
               <p>Aunt Rachel ſmiled, to hear how eagerly the fancy of youth catches at the hope of future greatneſs, and how readily they connect the ideas of grandeur, afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and numerous attendants, to the poſſeſſion of a title. She gazed for a moment with pleaſure on his intelligent countenance, which the emotions of his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſwelling heart had lighted up with uncommon ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and pauſed, unwilling to throw a damp on thoſe delightful ſenſations he appeared to enjoy. At length, "What would you ſay," cried ſhe, "if I were to tell you that your grandfather had no attendants except a few warriors, who, from voluntary attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his perſon, followed to protect him from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; that he had neither horſe nor carriage; that his palace was chiefly compoſed of the bark of trees; that
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:034490_0181_0FFF0E83568FDD18"/>
his bed was the ſkins of wild beaſts, and his ſeat of ſtate the trunk of an old tree, hewn into ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a chair, covered with beaver and other ſkins, and its ornaments the teeth of tygers, poliſhed ſhells and fiſh bones!"</p>
               <p>"But he was good," ſaid Rachel, "and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy."</p>
               <p>"And he was brave and wiſe," ſaid Reuben exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, "and every body loved him."</p>
               <p>"Sweet children," ſaid aunt Rachel, "thoſe are conſequences which ought ever to follow goodneſs, bravery and wiſdom. But, alas! they are not always certain.</p>
               <p>"What, then are not all good perſons happy?"</p>
               <p>"Not always in their outward circumſtances; but they enjoy internal peace."</p>
               <p>"And are not the brave and the wiſe always eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed?"</p>
               <p>"By thoſe who have ſenſe and diſcernment they in general are; but unfortunately, great and ſhining qualifications, of either mind or perſon, excite in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral more envy than love."</p>
               <p>"What is envy, aunt?"</p>
               <p>"A paſſion, my dear Rachel, to which I hope you will ever remain a ſtranger." With this wiſh the good old lady kiſſed the children, and diſmiſſed them to bed.</p>

               <p>THOUGH the father of our hero and heroine was a man moderate in his wiſhes, and of that reaſonable caſt of mind that preferred mediocrity to affluence; yet he conceived it an indiſpenſable duty to endeavour to improve his fortune for the ſake of his children. He had retained ſome faint idea of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fertility of the American continent; he alſo
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:034490_0182_0FFF0E850DC285A0"/>
felt an irreſiſtible impulſe to viſit once more the place of his nativity; and a number of families, of his own perſuaſion, about this period emigrating to the colony of Pennſylvania, amongſt whom were ſome of his wife's neareſt relations, he collected together all the ready money he was maſter of, and turning it into ſuch merchandize as was moſt likely to be productive of emolument, embarked with a deſign of purchaſing land, building a houſe, and putting the whole in ſuch a ſtate of cultivation, as might render it at once a pleaſant and profitable habitation for his children, when arrived to the age of maturity.</p>
               <p>How naturally do we expect our children, or thoſe in whoſe welfare we are intereſted, to adopt the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments moſt congenial to our own feelings, without conſidering that nature is as various in the formation of the minds of men, as of their faces; and thoſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits and acquirements, which to one will give the moſt ſuperlative delight, to another would bring only miſery. Thus the father of Rachel and Reuben, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf a man of peace, fond of retirement and the ſtudy of agriculture, thought he could not render them a more acceptable ſervice, than to prepare them a habitation, where they might enjoy uninterrupted quiet; where plenty would preſide at the board, and the ſtudy of nature, in all her varieties and beauties, enliven ſolitude.</p>
               <p>He placed his ſon at a public ſchool to finiſh his education, and making proper arrangements for the ſupport of his family during his abſence (which he imagined would be about two years) he entruſted Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel to the care of her aunt, with inſtructions, that in caſe of death ſhe ſhould remove to the houſe, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the direction of her maternal uncle, Hezekiah Penn.</p>
               <p>Reuben and Rachel were in their thirteenth year when this ſeparation took place. Their tears fell at the idea of being parted from their father; but when the brother and ſiſter were informed that, during a period of two years, they muſt not expect to meet on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:034490_0183_0FFF0E88D7E42A48"/>
at each returning Chriſtmas, their grief was beyond expreſſion.</p>
               <p>When the carriage came to the door that was to convey Reuben from her, Rachel burſt into an agony of tears. "My brother! my dear, dear brother!" ſhe cried, hanging round his neck.</p>
               <p>"God bleſs you, my charming ſiſter! my dear, amiable ſiſter!" cried he.</p>
               <p>Aunt Rachel drew her niece from the door, from the parting embrace of her brother (who was led to the carriage by his father) and by degrees compoſed and conſoled her.</p>
               <p>It cannot be ſuppoſed that their father was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved ſpectator of this affecting ſcene. No! he felt and compaſſionated their ſufferings; but he knew that a maiden aunt and ſequeſtered manſion, would in no wiſe prepare his ſon for the active ſcenes of life in which (however contrary to his own wiſhes) he would moſt likely hereafter engage.</p>
               <p>His family concerns being now ſettled to his ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; he embarked for Pennſylvania. His commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial plans were executed with great ſucceſs, his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed purchaſe made on very advantageous terms, and at the cloſe of the third year from his firſt arrival, he prepared again to viſit England. Mr. Dudley had taken from Europe with him a diſtant relation of his wife's, a young man, of whom, as he will make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable figure in the enſuing pages, it may not be thought an unneceſſary digreſſion to give ſome account.</p>
               <p>The mother of Jacob Holmes was niece to the fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Caſſiah Penn. She had been left an orphan in early infancy; but the loſs of parents was amply ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by her benevolent uncle and aunt. She was nearly of the ſame age with their own daughter, and, brought up with her, received the ſame benefit of ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation. When Caſſiah married the father of our he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro and heroine, Mary Holmes continued with her aunt, and by tender aſſiduity endeavoured to prevent her feeling too acutely the privation of her daughter's ſociety. Mary was naturally ſincere and artleſs; but Mary was handſome, and loved to be told of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:034490_0184_0FFF0CDE14682AB8"/>
She poſſeſſed what is in general termed one of the beſt diſpoſitions in the world, becauſe ſhe ſeldom took the trouble to contradict any one. Her eaſineſs might, without much exaggeration, have been termed indolence; and her extreme good-nature, folly and want of feeling. To praiſe her beauty, was to win her heart; and being often extolled for her ſweetneſs and evenneſs of temper, ſhe conceived, that to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly paſſive was to be perfectly amiable; and Mary, with a face extremely lovely, and a form captivating, poſſeſſed neither expreſſion of countenance, nor ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of heart; but like ſome kinds of tropical fruits, which, when ripe, are ſo ſweet as to be inſipid, and, though beautiful to the eye, have neither poignancy or flavour to delight the taſte. She had loved her couſin Caſſiah with as much tenderneſs as her nature was capable of; ſhe thought her the moſt perfect of human beings; and whilſt Caſſiah was her conſtant companion, Mary was free from error.</p>
               <p>In the neighbourhood of the dwelling of Obadiah Penn, was the ancient ſeat of the family of the Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geralds. Arthur Fitzgerald was an only child; his father had been dead many years; his mother's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence had been unbounded; and at the age of twenty-five, Arthur had ſcarcely ever known what it was to be contradicted. Heir at once to the eſtates of his father and the hereditary honours of his mother; a deſcendant of the houſe of Aumerle, of which he was the laſt male branch, Arthur thought the chief end of his exiſtence was pleaſure; and though poſſeſſed of a good underſtanding, and a not naturally corrupt heart, he often performed actions which did honour to humanity; yet unlimited indulgence and unclouded proſperity, by degrees rendered thoſe divine impulſes of nature, compaſſion and benevolence, weaker and weaker, till at length his heart ceaſed to be influenced by either.</p>
               <p>His mother, lady Allida, chiefly reſided at the Pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the name the ſeat had taken from its being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by a deep wood of pine trees. Mrs. Pinup was lady Allida's chief attendant, and ſuperintendant
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:034490_0185_0FFF0E8D04B323E8"/>
of her houſehold in general. Though it might be ſuppoſed, that the vaſt diſtance pride places between the family of a woman of quality in actual poſſeſſion of eight thouſand pounds a year, and expectant of twice the ſum, and that of a ſimple country gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe whole annual income did not exceed eight hundred, did not allow of any intercourſe between la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Allida Fitzgerald, and the wife of Obadiah Penn; but the ſervants of thoſe families ſometimes met, and Mrs. Pinup, in the extreme condeſcenſion of her heart, and likewiſe having her mind fixed on ſome excellent raſpberry brandy (which the old lady kept as a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſtomachic) ſometimes paid a viſit to dame Prue, upper ſervant in Mr. Penn's family.</p>
               <p>In ſome of theſe viſits, Mrs. Pinup had often ſeen both Caſſiah and Mary; but there was always a mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt dignity in the manner of the former, that repelled any approach to familiarity from perſons whoſe edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, manners and ſtation rendered them unfit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; yet it was a dignity no ways tinctured with haughtineſs. She was ever gentle and affable, ſo much ſo as to be a univerſal favourite, from the higheſt to the loweſt.</p>
               <p>But Mary would laugh with the maids; and though reſpect for her as their maſter's niece, kept the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervants in ſome awe, ſhe endured from them familiar praiſes of her beauty, not only without reſentment, but even with ſuch an apparent degree of ſatisfaction as encouraged, rather than repelled their freedom. Sometimes, when Mrs. Pinup was there, ſhe would go down ſtairs purpoſely to chat with her, aſk a thouſand queſtions about lady Allida, the houſe, the pleaſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounds, and other more inſignificant ſubjects, ſuch as her dreſs, the faſhion of it; for Mary Holmes was no Quaker in her heart, and would often pull off her cloſe mob, and let her hair, which was very fine, fall looſely over her ſhoulders. But if the more ſedate Caſſiah ever beheld any of theſe ſigns of vanity, ſhe would mildly reprove them, and as Mary feared to offend her, ſhe would ever reſtrain them in her preſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="unknown:034490_0186_0FFF0E8F5301F780"/>
Mrs. Pinup, ever communicative, and wonderfully eloquent in the praiſe of lady Allida, would expatiate for hours on her grandeur, her rich clothes, her houſe, her plate, and jewels; nay, ſhe often aſked dame Prue to come and bring the young ladies to ſee all theſe fine things. Caſſiah uniformly refuſed theſe invitations, but Mary, though ſubmiſſive to the ſuperior wiſdom of her couſin, ſecretly wiſhed to accept them.</p>
               <p>On the marriage of Caſſiah, her mother accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied her home, and remained with her as a viſitor near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a month. During this time, the heedleſs Mary, unable to combat her inclinations, though ſhe knew they were wrong, yielded to the ſolicitations of dame Prue, and accompanied her to the Pinery. Lady Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lida was abſent for the day. Mrs. Pinup led her gueſts through the antique and ſuperbly furniſhed apartments. The rich velvet canopies, the ſtately beds, the maſſy ſilver cups, large marble tables with burniſhed ſupporters, China vaſes, large looking-glaſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and beautiful tapeſtry, were gazed on by Mary with wonder and delight. Plenty, unreſtrained by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimony, preſided over every department of the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold economy of Obadiah Penn. His furniture was excellent in its kind, but it was plain.</p>
               <p>The wardrobe was next diſplayed. The rich tiſſue, brocaded or velvet ſuits were in turns the object of her admiration and deſire. The fine lace pinners, the diamond earnings, necklace, and other ornaments—Oh! how fine! how beautiful! how elegant! was repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a hundred times.</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid Mary, "I wonder how I ſhould look, dreſſed in ſome of this finery?"</p>
               <p>"Look! why like an angel, I'm ſure," ſaid Mrs. Pinup. "Oh! there is nothing like dreſs, to ſet off a pretty face; and if you look ſo handſome in that brown paduſuoy gown and plain muſlin cap, how do you think you would look in a full dreſs ſuit?"</p>
               <p>Mary was holding a rich blue ſilk robe in her hand at the moment; ſhe held it up againſt her ſide. The delicacy of the colour was exactly ſuited to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; the effect it had gave an additional fluſh to
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:034490_0187_0FFF0E93387BBF50"/>
her cheek. It was a looſe robe, made with open ſleeves, and faſtened at the boſom with a diamond claſp. The ground was blue, but it was ſuperbly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with ſilver, and round the neck and ſleeves was a net of ſilver thread.</p>
               <p>"Put it on," ſaid Mrs. Pinup.</p>
               <p>The faſhion of the dreſs was ſuch as partly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the neck. The neck of Mary was covered with a fine cambrick handkerchief. Mrs. Pinup took it off; and then, ſlipping the robe over her other clothes, faſtened it at the boſom, releaſed her luxurious flaxen hair from the confinement of the cap, and turning her to the glaſs, ſaid, "What do you think of yourſelf now?"</p>
               <p>Dame Prue ſat by, a ſilent ſpectatreſs of this ſcene. She was too good-natured to condemn, and too wiſe wholly to approve. Mary gazed and ſmiled, walked along the room to admire herſelf at full length in the glaſs, and ſaid, in a tone expreſſive of mortification, "Well, I ſhall never like myſelf in my Quaker dreſs again."</p>

He ſtopped for a moment; he looked unutterable admiration; then exclaimed, in an accent of wonder, "Angel! goddeſs! bright divinity!" Covered with confuſion, Mary would have eſcaped through the oppoſite door; but he ſaw her deſign, and ſeizing her hand, beſought her not to be alarmed. "Compoſe yourſelf, lovely creature," ſaid he, "I meant not to frighten you."</p>

form be disfigured by their puritanical, formal dreſs? Forbid it, all ye loves and graces."</p>
               <p>Mary had neither ſenſibility nor diſcernment ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to comprehend the inſult to which ſhe had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed herſelf, in thus aſſociating with the ſervants of a family, who, if her ſuperior in point of fortune, was not of a more elevated deſcent. But the feelings of Mary were never very troubleſome to her, and the Lethean draught of flattery her ears had drank, intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icated her ſenſes and perverted her underſtanding. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reſenting the freedom of Fitzgerald's addreſs, ſhe was ſilent, and her heart ſecretly exulted at having excited his admiration. Inſtead of inſiſting on going immediately home, ſhe threw aſide her ſumptuous and imprudently aſſumed ornaments, and in her own ſimple attire deſcended to the houſekeeper's apartment, where refreſhments were ſerved, of which Arthur partook.</p>
               <p>The evening approached. Dame Prue aroſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. "I will ſee you ſafe through the Pinery," ſaid Arthur. The moon was riſing in full, unclouded ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. The evening was calm, mild and inviting.</p>
               <p>"My lady will not return till late," ſaid Pinup; "I think I will go a little way with them myſelf, and not trouble you, Sir."</p>
               <p>"I thought you knew, Pinup," ſaid Arthur, "that I never do any thing that I conceive a trouble. You ſhall accompany the old gentlewoman, and I will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my arm to the young divinity."</p>
               <p>"How ſilver-ſweet ſound lovers' tongues by night,' ſays our immortal Shakeſpeare; and who ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood human nature, its weakneſs, its virtues, its paſſions; who ſo well delineate?"</p>
               <p>The extent of the Pinery was a mile and a half; yet the meadow, the ſtream that watered it, and the hill on the ſide of which ſtood the manſion of Obadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, appeared to view before they thought they had walked half way. For Arthur Fitzgerald talked of love, and Mary Holmes, though incapable of ſeeling a real paſſion, liſtened in delighted ſilence to the voice of adulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="unknown:034490_0189_0FFF0CE8C64BB1C0"/>
Dame Prue was confident Mrs. Dudley would not greatly approve her own viſit to the Pinery, much more, that ſhe ſhould have taken her niece with her. She therefore deſired Mary to be ſilent on the ſubject. Mary was not inclined to ſpeak upon it to any one. Had Arthur taken no methods to ſee this weak girl again, in all probability, the tranſient liking ſhe had conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him would have died away; but Arthur, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed to put any reſtraint on his paſſions, and being greatly charmed with the beauty of the fair Quaker, without once conſidering the conſequence of ſeducing ſo young, ſo lovely a creature from the paths of rectitude, wrote to her in a ſtyle of ſubmiſſive ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and implored her, if ſhe wiſhed to ſave him from deſpair, to meet him at the margin of the brook in the meadow. Mary complied; repeated inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views enſued, and ſhe fell a victim, not to ſenſibility or paſſion—No; Mary Holmes was the victim of van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and too great pliability of temper. Conſcious of her deviation from virtue, the preſence of her virtuous aunt became painful to her; yet did ſhe not experience the laudable kind of uneaſineſs which leads to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and amendment.</p>
               <p>Indifference is the lethargy of the ſoul; it is the grave of virtue and excellence. Indifference acts upon the mental faculties, as indolence does on the body; for as the man who indulges in inactivity can never expect to riſe into notice, ſecure or amend his fortune, ſo the ſoul incruſted in indifference is incapable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing one great or glorious action. It conceives not the beauty of virtue, nor the real deformity of vice. Its affections are cold; its pleaſures ſo languid, they ſcarce deſerve the name. Its pains are ſew indeed. But then what ſatiſfaction does the poſſeſſor loſe! The beauties of creation are unfolded to him in vain; in vain the gorgeous canopy of heaven diſplays ten thouſand thouſand moving worlds, that, as they roll in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſe of ether, contribute to embelliſh, cheer and warm the globe which we inhabit; in vain the teeming earth brings forth her fruit; nor field of ripened grain, nor opening flower, nor flock, nor herd, afford one joy for

him. He gazes at them all with ſtupid vacuity of thought, and wonders at the grateful tear that ſprings to the eye from the heart of ſenſibility.</p>
               <p>The hiſtory of poor Mary is ſoon finiſhed. She left the protection of her uncle, and accompanied Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerald to London. Diſſipation of every kind was ruſhed into with avidity. Her purſe was liberally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by her ſeducer; her houſe was elegant; her equipage gay; her dreſs always ſplendid, and not ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom capriciouſly extravagant. But though beauty may faſcinate the ſenſes, prudence, virtue, and a good underſtanding, are neceſſary to make the charm pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and laſting. Fitzgerald grew weary of her folly and profuſion; he forſook her; yet not ungenerouſly. He ſettled ſufficient on her to procure all the comforts and ſome of the elegancies of life. But, alas! Mary was ſtill young, ſtill lovely, and ſtill indifferent. The opinion of the world was of little conſequence to her; nor ſcarcely one individual in it was more regarded than another. Adulation ſhe ſought, and it was poured in upon her from every quarter. She regretted not the deſertion of Fitzgerald; another and another ſpoiler came; and Mary Holmes ſunk into the loweſt abyſs of guilt and ſhame.</p>

               <p>THAT miſery is ever the certain concomitant of guilt, is univerſally allowed an incontrovertible fact. Mary Holmes, with as little reflection or feeling as it is poſſible for a rational being to poſſeſs, was a proof of the truth of this aſſertion. Diſſipation, whilſt it had the charms of novelty, intoxicated her ſenſes, and kept her mind in ſuch continued employment, that her generous uncle Obadiah, her affectionate couſin Caſſiah, home, the brook, the meadow, and the Pinery,
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:034490_0191_0FFF0EEB1F012DF8"/>
were all forgotten in the conſtant vortex of folly. But the ſame ſcene, however faſcinating at firſt, by continual rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etition loſes its charms, and becomes inſipid and diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So Mary, often in the midſt of noiſy mirth and tumultuous pleaſure, would caſt a wiſhful, though tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient thought, towards her uncle's quiet parlour, and the tranquil happineſs that was ever her companion there.</p>
               <p>Seven years had paſſed, and Mary was no longer followed, courted and admired. She had loſt her moſt powerful charm. Her cheek was no longer ſuffuſed with the crimſon of timidity, nor her manners attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive from that feminine baſhfulneſs, which renders even a plain woman agreeable; and a beautiful woman on whoſe brow ſits modeſt baſhfulneſs, enthroned in native purity, ever is, ever will be, irreſiſtible. But, alas! when virtue has forſaken the heart, the vermillion of chaſtity ceaſes to viſit the cheek, and beauty without it, however exquiſite, can catch even the eye but for a moment. Charmed with the moſt finiſhed workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of nature, we look for the ſoul that ſhould inform it. But we find it blotted! diſgraced! loſt! Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ceaſes; pity ſucceeds; and whilſt we wiſh to reform, we cannot but deſpiſe.</p>
               <p>Mary had arrived at this laſt ſtage. Forſaken by the men, her vanity was no longer gratified; and to enliven her home, where could ſhe find, amongſt the unhappy females with whom ſhe had been accuſtomed to aſſociate, one whoſe converſation could either amuſe or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The life of Mary was a continued blank; unloving, unloved. Joyleſs paſſed her days; nor wiſh, nor hope, nor fear diverſified it; all was inanimation.</p>
               <p>At this period ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ound herſelf in the moſt intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſituation a female can experience. She was about to become a mother. If Mary ever was ſenſible of any thing like remorſe, it was on this occaſion. She wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe had not ſwerved from the path of rectitude; ſhe wiſhed her child had not been the offspring of ſhame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="unknown:034490_0192_0FFF213C9C408B40"/>
It was about the middle of April. The meadows began to aſſume a cheerful appearance; the fruit trees, rich in bluſhing ſweets, ſcented the air with perfume, more grateful to the ſenſe than the moſt coſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of art. Mary's health had been impaired, by midnight vigils, riot and intemperance. She ſought, from the freſhneſs of the country air, a reinſtatement of it, and a relief from that laſſitude and inanity which weighed upon her ſpirits; a neat cottage but a few miles from London became her reſidence.</p>
               <p>Late one evening, as ſhe was preparing to retire to reſt, the ſound of a carriage driving haſtily by, attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her attention. In a moment the noiſe of the wheels ceaſed; a ſudden ſhriek was heard, and then all was ſilent.</p>
               <p>"Why, as ſure as can be, ma'am," ſaid the ſervant who was helping her to undreſs, "the carriage is either broke down or overſet."</p>
               <p>"I hope not, Dolly," ſhe replied, going to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to liſten. Before ſhe had time to unbar the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and raiſe the ſaſh, a loud ring at the gate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced an unexpected viſitor. It was the perſon who drove the carriage; it had been overturned; a lady in it was hurt, and her huſband had ſent him to requeſt they might be permitted to repoſe for the night in her houſe, as the carriage had been ſo dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged as to render it impoſſible for them to proceed on their journey.</p>
               <p>Mary was not deficient in the knowledge, nor back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the performance of the rites of hoſpitality.</p>
               <p>"The ſtrangers ſhall be welcome, "ſaid ſhe, "to every accommodation my humble manſion affords."</p>
               <p>The lady had ſainted; for her arm was diſlocated, and the pain had overcome her natural fortitude. A gentleman, aſſiſted by his ſervant, bore her into the houſe; their dreſs ſtruck on the heart of Mary. She went to the ſofa on which the fair inſenſible was laid, with a deſign of adminiſtering volatiles and a reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive cordial. She raiſed her head, which was reclined on her huſband's ſhoulder, and beheld the features of Caſſiah. Her hands trembled, her check turned pale.
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:034490_0193_0FFF213E2870AD28"/>
"My couſin!" ſaid ſhe. Mr. Dudley looked at her with attention, and, though decorated in the habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vanity, recognized the conntenance of Mary Holmes.</p>
               <p>But little now remains to be told. The hurt Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah had received, confined her above a week, during which time Mary was delivered of a ſon. The advice and admonitions of her friends determined her to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure a way of life, into which ſhe had been firſt ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by want of reſolution, and in which, want of reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution alone could have induced her to continue.</p>
               <p>Buſineſs of importance had brought Dudley from the country; and, prompted at once by affection for her huſband, and a wiſh to ſee the capital, Caſſiah was induced to accompany him. The deſired ends fully accompliſhed, they prepared to return.</p>
               <p>"Come, Mary," ſaid Caſſiah, "thrown off theſe trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of vanity; they become not the penitent. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the dreſs of ſimplicity and purity, in which thou wert wont to appear. Return with a noble firmneſs, to the man who ſeduced thee, the wages of thy guilt, the price of thy diſhonour. I pray thee, Mary Holmes, return to the boſom of thy friends, to the paths of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and virtue. Albeit thy good uncle Obadiah is no more, yet I and my brother Hezekiah are his repreſentatives. Had he been living, and thou hadſt returned repentant, he would have exceedingly rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; would have killed the fatted calf, and have bid his friends and neighbours to come and welcome thee. And ſhall not we perform the will of our deceaſed father? Yea, verily will we, ſince in ſo doing we ſhall alſo perform the will of our Father who is in heaven. Dear Mary, turn not a deaf ear to my prayer; for the ways of truth are the ways of pleaſantneſs, and where innocence dwells, dwells alſo peace forever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
               <p>Mary muſt have been inſenſible indeed to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the earneſt ſolicitations of her amiable relation. Every feeling of the force and beauty of virtue was now powerfully awakened and called into action. She returned the ſettlement ſhe had received from Fitzger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ald,
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:034490_0194_0FFF214026B69948"/>
and accompanied Dudley and Caſſiah into Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire, where a few years put a period to her exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Mr. Dudley had from his birth adopted her ſon Jacob Holmes; and when he embarked for Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, Jacob accompanied him, was witneſs to every tranſaction on that ſide the Atlantic, enjoyed his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited confidence, and when he propoſed returning to Europe, Jacob was entruſted with a copy of his will, the title-deeds of the newly purchaſed eſtate, and left in poſſeſſion of it, with directions to ſpare neither coſt nor pains to improve, cultivate and beautify it.</p>

                     <p>REUBEN and Rachel had, during the abſence of their father, increaſed in ſtature, and improved in mental acquirements. Their perſons were much altered for the better. Rachel was now approaching womanhood; tall, ſtraight, and well-proportioned. An intelligent animation lighted up her countenance, which prepoſſeſſed the beholder, at firſt ſight, in her favour. It was that kind of honeſt countenance in which you might read every emotion of the heart, and ſeemed to ſay, "I cannot deceive you, if I would."</p>
                     <p>Reuben almoſt idolized his ſiſter, and when the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidays permitted his annual viſit, never were three hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings more ſuperlatively happy, than the brother, ſiſter, and aunt Rachel. It was in one of theſe viſits, as they were ſocially ſeated round their fire, their fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily party enlivened by the company of a Miſs Oliver, who was paſſing the winter with her grandmother, in the neighbourhood, when a letter was brought.

               <p>"But brother," ſaid Rachel, "look at the date of my father's letter, and remember what he ſaid about ſailing in October: why, my dear brother, he will be home very ſoon."</p>
               <p>"He may arrive in a few days," ſaid aunt Rachel.</p>
               <p>"A few days!" cried Reuben eagerly, "why he may arrive this very night."</p>
               <p>"Oh dear! dear Reuben, do you think ſo?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and perhaps in ſix weeks or two months time we may be all on the Atlantic ocean. Bleſs me! Miſs Oliver, are you not well?"</p>
               <p>This queſtion and exclamation, which Reuben ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to their fair viſitor, was extorted by ſudden ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. He had caſually glanced his eye towards her as he was ſpeaking, and beheld her intereſting counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance pale as aſhes.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Jeſſy Oliver?" ſaid Rachel, whoſe attention was awakened by her brother's queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; "is the room too warm?"</p>
               <p>"No! no! my dear," ſaid Jeſſy in tremulous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents; "only! only! indeed I don't know what ails me; but I was ſeized—</p>
               <p>"With a ſudden ſickneſs at the mention of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic ocean," ſaid Hezekiah Penn, who had been ſmoking his pipe in one corner of the room.</p>
               <p>The dry manner in which he ſpoke, the look he caſt towards her, recalled the roſes to the cheeks of Jeſſy.
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:034490_0197_0FFF21489B30D0C0"/>
She affected to laugh at the idea; but it was not the laugh of nature. Her heart was full, and her eyes had nearly betrayed its feelings. Reuben was at firſt ſurpriſed; but he looked on the confuſed fair one, and an idea croſſed his mind which gave birth to a ſentiment which could not be extinguiſhed but with life.</p>
               <p>Jeſſy Oliver was two years older than our hero and heroine; extremely lovely in her perſon, accompliſhed in her manners, and endowed with an underſtanding far ſuperior to the generality of her ſex. She was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date beyond her years; but that ſedateneſs was the offspring of ſorrow, occaſioned by the loſs of her moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er when ſhe was about twelve years old; ſoon after which, her father unthinkingly united himſelf with a young, volatile woman of quality, who, though ſhe brought him a very ample fortune, yet by her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, threatened him with ruin, and by her lev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with diſhonour.</p>
               <p>Jeſſy had a brother, one year younger than herſelf. Archibald Oliver was claſſmate with Reuben, and had twice invited him to his father's country-houſe, which was in Oxfordſhire, to paſs a few days in the midſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vacation. This friendſhip between the young men naturally led to an intimacy with the ſiſter; and Jeſſy, without a thought which ſhe would bluſh to own, was tenderly attached to Reuben.</p>
               <p>Her ſituation at home became diſagreeable in the extreme. Fond of reading, drawing, needle-work, and every elegant domeſtic employment; without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation; delicate in her manners and converſation, and ſincerely pious; it cannot be imagined that Jeſſy could find pleaſure in the ſociety of a woman, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, diſſipated and irreligious.</p>
               <p>To her maternal grandmother ſhe wrote, in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the miſeries of her ſituation, and received from her an invitation to paſs the winter with her in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire. Perhaps the viſit was not anticipated with leſs ſatisfaction becauſe in the neighbourhood of the family of Reuben Dudley. Not that Jeſſy was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of being too partial to him; but that ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

much pleaſure from the ſociety of his ſiſter and aunt, of whom ſhe had often heard him ſpeak with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm.</p>
               <p>She was charmed with the unaffected <hi>nai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ette</hi> of Rachel, and the more ſhe knew of her the more ſhe loved her; and though unperceived by herſelf, the friendſhip ſhe conceived for the ſiſter ſtrengthened her partiality for the brother. Their perſons were alike, as much ſo as it was poſſible for a face truly feminine, ſtrikingly to reſemble one whoſe features are more marked, more manly, more expreſſive of character.</p>
               <p>Jeſſy looked at Rachel with admiration. "How much you are like your brother," ſhe would ſay. Alas! poor Jeſſy; ſhe was unconſcious, that it was that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance which chiefly drew her heart, with irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power, towards her new friend. The mind of Jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy was as pure as the chaſte dew which glitters in an April morn upon the boſom of a half-blown ſnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drop; and when undiſſembled joy ſhe flew to meet him on his arrival in Lancaſhire, and preſented her hand and ſmiling mouth to greet him, it was with the ſenſations of a ſeraph who welcomes a kindred ſpirit to the manſions of the bleſt.</p>
               <p>Oh why! why! is this pure, this unimpaſſioned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe between the ſexes, ſo rare, as to be almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible? Alas! it is a humiliating truth to own; but human nature is ſo weak, ſo liable to error, that its pureſt emotions may be conſtrued into guilt, and, conſcious of our own imbecility, we tremble for the firmneſs of another. Beſides, wherever beauty, ſenſe, or merit dwells, there envy hovers round, with hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard eye, and pale, diſtorted brow; the poiſon falling from her baleful tongue diſcolours every object, and caſts on even innocence itſelf a ſallow, doubtful hue. Oh! how happy, how ſuperlatively happy, is the youthful, inexperienced, yet ſuſceptible boſom!

               <p>Thus pure, thus ſuſceptible, thus fearleſs of evil, were the hearts of Reuben, Rachel, and their fair friend Jeſſy Oliver; when on the evening juſt mentioned, the reception of the letter, the eagerneſs Reuben expreſſed to embark for America, and the remark uncle Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah made on the ſudden ſickneſs of Jeſſy, awakened new ideas in the breaſts of all.</p>
               <p>Reuben had folded up his father's letter, returned it to his aunt, and ſeated himſelf beſide Jeſſy, took her paſſive hand, and ſeemed for a moment buſied in counting over and over again, the beautifully white and finely tapering fingers. Rachel ſeated herſelf on the other ſide, and aſked, with innocent earneſtneſs, "if ſhe was not better now."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Jeſſy, almoſt unconſcious that ſhe ſpoke at all.</p>
               <p>"I thought you were," ſaid Rachel, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſimplicity; "for the colour is returned to your lips and cheeks."</p>
               <p>The remark did not make her paler. And when uncle Hezekiah, adjuſting his broad-brimmed beaver, and putting on his great coat, bade Reuben talk no more of the Atlantic ocean, America, and ſuch fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things, the lily was entirely exchanged for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Hezekiah went to the door, with a deſign to go home; his horſe had been previouſly brought out. But he opened the door, and ordering the poor beaſt back to the ſtable, returned to the parlour, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted that it ſtormed tremendouſly.</p>
               <p>"Does the wind blow very hard uncle?" ſaid Rachel.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Hezekiah, deliberately ſeating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and filling another pipe.</p>
               <p>"And does it blow on ſhore?" ſaid aunt Rachel, who, having experienced the dangers of the ſea her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, felt more ſenſibly the perils to which her nephew
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:034490_0200_0FFF215287975048"/>
might be expoſed, ſhould he be coming near the land on ſuch a ſtormy night.</p>
               <p>"It blows ſtrongly from the ſea," ſaid Hezekiah, drawing in a vaſt quantity of ſmoke, and then ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it gradually to evaporate, as it eſcaped in ſmall curling clouds from his mouth.</p>
               <p>As he ſpoke, a ſudden guſt ruſhed impetuouſly by the houſe, and ſhook the apartment in which they were ſitting.</p>
               <p>"Does it ſnow or rain, brother?" ſaid Rachel.</p>
               <p>"It ſnows," ſaid Hezekiah, not giving Reuben time to reply; "it ſnows, and is very dark indeed."</p>
               <p>At that moment, the diſcharge of a diſtant cannon was heard; and Hezekiah, daſhing his pipe on the hearth, ſtarted from his ſeat, and exclaimed, "There is ſome ſhip in diſtreſs." Before any one could reply, another and another gun was heard, and the ſervant and carriage arriving for Miſs Oliver, they were informed that a ſhip had been ſeen in the offing, before dark, as it was ſuppoſed, endeavouring to make the port of Liverpool; but that ſhe appeared much diſabled in her maſts, yards and rigging, and it was imagined ſhe was now on ſhore, or in imminent danger.</p>
               <p>It was not the remonſtrances or entreaties of his friends, that could now reſtrain the impetuoſity of Reuben. He was prepoſſeſſed with the idea that his father was in the veſſel, and he would ſet off immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately for Liverpool. He might be enabled to ſend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to the diſtreſſed mariners.</p>
               <p>"Oh! my dear brother, it is impoſſible," ſaid Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel; "only hear how the wind roars."</p>
               <p>"I do hear it," he replied mournfully, "and every blaſt ſeems to ſay, Reuben, thy father is periſhing."</p>
               <p>A momentary ſilence now enſued, when Hezekiah propoſed going with his nephew. "I do not think," ſaid he, "that we can render them any ſervice; but ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe is painful, and we may at leaſt learn earlier in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the fate of the veſſel and her unfortunate crew; diſcover from whence ſhe came, and what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers were on board."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="unknown:034490_0201_0FFF21542CEE3E38"/>
"Then promiſe you will not attempt to go off in a boat, my dear Reuben," ſaid Rachel.</p>
               <p>"Oh heavens! he will not ſurely think of ſuch a thing," exclaimed Miſs Oliver.</p>
               <p>"Silly children," ſaid Hezekiah, "do not raiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginary miſeries to afflict yourſelves with. If he was ſo mad as to wiſh to do ſo, he would not find any one mad enough to carry him."</p>
               <p>The horſes were now at the door. Reuben handed Miſs Oliver to her carriage, and then, accompanied by Hezekiah, made all poſſible ſpeed to Liverpool; whilſt aunt Rachel and her niece paſſed the night in traverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the apartment, liſtening to the ſtorm, and ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating fervent prayers for the preſervation of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſailors, whoſe perils (they were aſſured by the repeated diſcharge of guns) ſtill continued. Neither of them attempted to reſt; they ſpoke but little, but each in ſilence indulged her own melancholy thoughts.</p>
               <p>Aunt Rachel had, added to the anxiety ſhe felt for her nephew's ſafety, a preſentiment that, ſhould any thing happen to him, his children would be involved in very diſagreeable circumſtances. Mr. Dudley had not entruſted her with the exact ſituation of his affairs previous to his leaving England. He had told her ſhe might draw on his agent, Atkins, for two hundred pounds each year, and that Atkins had alſo orders to pay for Reuben's education, and defray all his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes; but ſhe knew that the laſt half year of Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben's board remained unpaid, and ſhe had herſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a letter, recommending prudence to her, and hinting, ſhould Mr. Dudley extend his ſtay abroad another ſix months, he, Atkins, ſhould not be able to ſupply the money neceſſary for houſe-keeping.</p>
               <p>This had previouſly given birth to many uneaſy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections; and now that ſhe found he had drawn for ſo large a ſum, and given Atkins unlimited power to ſell or mortgage part of the Lancaſhire eſtate, ſhe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould any fatal accident prevent his reaching England, Reuben and Rachel might be ſevere ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in more ways than the loſs of a father.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="unknown:034490_0202_0FFF21566BFDC7A0"/>
For herſelf, ſhe had no fears; and though the half of that eſtate conſtituted the whole of her worldly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, yet ſuch was the native philanthropy of her mind, ſo little was ſelf regarded, and with ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm did ſhe regard the offspring of her lamented brother William, that to ſupply the ſmalleſt of their wants, ſhe would have cheerfully diveſted herſelf of even the common neceſſaries of life.</p>
               <p>Aunt Rachel was now nearly approaching her ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-fifth year; but temperance, cheerfulneſs, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent competence, joined to a conſtitution firm by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, had given even to this advanced period, ſtrength of intellect, hilarity of ſpirits, and uncommon perſonal vigour.</p>
               <p>In reflections like thoſe juſt mentioned on her part, and earneſt prayers for her father's ſafety and her brother's return on the part of Rachel, was the weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome night paſſed. Towards morning the ſtorm aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the ſun aroſe in a clear, unclouded horizon; but the ravages of the tempeſt were to be ſeen; ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral trees were lying on the ground, torn from their roots by the violence of the wind. A barn had been unroofed during the night, and the chimney of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring cottage blown down.</p>
               <p>"I wonder my brother don't return," ſaid Rachel.</p>
               <p>"I wiſh he may bring us good news when he does come," replied her aunt.</p>
               <p>From the riſing of the ſun, till it paſſed the meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Rachel ſcarcely for a moment quitted the window that looked towards the road. At length, about three o'clock, ſhe ſaw her brother ſlowly winding down the hill.</p>
               <p>"Ah! my dear aunt, here comes Reuben," cried ſhe.</p>
               <p>"But he comes not like the meſſenger of joy," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied aunt Rachel.</p>
               <p>"He is weary, aunt." The affectionate ſiſter ran to open the door, and receive her brother.</p>
               <p>"What news, my dear Reuben?" ſaid ſhe eagerly, as he led her into the parlour.</p>
               <p>"The veſſel is loſt!" he replied.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="unknown:034490_0203_0FFF215BDB0FCBA0"/>
"And the crow?"</p>
               <p>"All periſhed."</p>
               <p>"Did you learn where ſhe is ſuppoſed to be from?" ſaid aunt Rachel.</p>
               <p>"A pilot boat, that paſſed her yeſterday morning, brought intelligence ſhe was from America, but not what particular port."</p>
               <p>"Had they no pilot on board?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and he has periſhed with them."</p>
               <p>The tears ſtarted into Reuben's eyes as he ſpoke; Rachel wept audibly. Their aunt took a hand from each.</p>
               <p>"Weep not, my children," ſaid ſhe, "but truſt in God. If it has pleaſed him to deprive you of your father, he is able to ſupply his place. Look up to him, my children; worſhip him, ſerve him, obey him, in ſincerity of heart. He may of his infinite wiſdom afflict; but remember, and let it fill your ſouls with humble hope and comfort, that his chaſtiſements are but temporal, but his rewards to thoſe who love him, eternal."</p>
               <p>"Then you think we are orphans?" ſaid Rachel.</p>
               <p>"I think," replied her aunt, "that it is more than probable your father was in the ſhip which was laſt night loſt."</p>
               <p>Two days from this paſſed, and no certain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence could be procured. Sometimes they encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged a dawn of hope, and then again relapſed into deſpair. Rachel was the earlieſt riſer in the family; ſhe had been up above an hour when the newſpaper was brought, as it was cuſtomary twice a week from Liverpool. She took it from the ſervant, and as ſhe held it to the fire to dry, the following paragraph met her eyes.—"We are at length certain, that the large ſhip which was loſt on Monday night laſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to get into this harbour, was the Aurora, of London, from Philadelphia. Two men, who prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>identially eſcaped, brought the melancholy intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the captain, mate, ten hands and fourteen paſſengers having periſhed; amongſt the latter was Mr. Reuben Dudley."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="unknown:034490_0204_0FFF215E341315D0"/>
Rachel read no more. The paper ſell from her hands, and ſenſe, feeling, almoſt life itſelf, was for a while ſuſpended. She ſunk on the floor, her head reſted on the elbow of her aunt's eaſy chair, her eyes were open, but ſhe was as devoid of ſpeech and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as a ſtatue. In this ſituation her brother found her. "My ſiſter! my dear Rachel!" he exclaimed, eagerly raiſing her. His voice recalled her fleeting ſenſes. She threw her arms round his neck, faintly articulated, "Our father! our beloved father!" and nature relieved her burſting heart by a violent guſh of tears.</p>
               <p>Aunt Rachel was prepared for the intelligence; her heart had preſaged it from the firſt. She bore it with the fortitude of a Chriſtian, though ſhe felt it as acutely as her niece. But ſhe had learnt to repreſs her feelings, and to bow with reſignation to the will of an all-wiſe Providence.</p>

               <p>IT may naturally be ſuppoſed, that when the heavy misfortune Reuben and Rachel had ſuſtained was univerſally known, condolements of form and faſhion poured in upon them, and ſome few offered conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ſincerity, and participated in their afflictions with feelings truly philanthropic. Amongſt the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter claſs was Miſs Oliver. She was ſo ſenſibly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the loſs they had experienced in the death of their father, that nearly a week elapſed before ſhe could ſummon fortitude ſufficient to enable her to pay them a viſit. At length, her wiſh to adminiſter comfort tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over the fear ſhe had entertained of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh ſhe muſt neceſſarily encounter in the interview.
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:034490_0205_0FFF215FCC6C30E8"/>
She aroſe with a reſolution of paſſing the day with Rachel, took an early breakfast, and by nine o'clock was at her habitation.</p>
               <p>Anguiſh of heart had ſo enervated the mental facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our heroine, that ſhe no longer aroſe with the lark, ſought employment with avidity, or purſued it with alacrity. "Why ſhould I work?" ſhe would ſay; "I have no expectation now to cheer me; no fond hope of a returning father's ſmiles and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rewarding my labours." Her mind occupied by reflections ſuch as theſe, Rachel gave more hours to her pillow than was her uſual cuſtom; not that ſhe found there the reſt ſhe ſought; but there ſhe could weep unreſtrained, there ſhe could uninterruptedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge in contemplation. And if haply ſleep for a few hours ſteeped her ſenſes in forgetfulneſs, ſhe bleſſed the ſweet oblivion, and courted its return. She was ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the breakfaſt table when Miſs Oliver entered.</p>
               <p>"Jeſſy!" ſaid ſhe mournfully, and half riſing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent her hand; but overcome by the ſenſations which ruſhed on her ſoul, ſhe ſunk again on her ſeat.</p>
               <p>Miſs Oliver took the proffered hand, preſſed it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, ſeated herſelf beſide her, but was ſilent. Yet her ſpeaking eye met the glance of Rachel's; its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion conveyed more than was in the power of words; it ſaid, in the moſt intelligent language, Dear Rachel, I feel, I participate your ſorrows.</p>
               <p>It was the conſolation moſt congenial to the ſoul it meant to addreſs. Rachel felt its ſincerity, its ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and was relieved. Oh! ſaid ſhe mentally, how far preferable is this to the profuſion of words, with which the unfeeling attempt to conſole me. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the preſſure of Jeſſy's hand; a few tears eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her eyes; Reuben kiſſed them off, and ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf oppoſite the two charming young women, contemplated them till his own eyes were ſuffuſed; and the ſuffuſion did honour to his heart, to nature, to reaſon, to manhood!</p>
               <p>How long this ſilence might have continued; is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; but it was abruptly interrupted by aunt Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel, who entered the apartment, followed by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:034490_0206_0FFF21616B82E698"/>
figure habited in a grey coat, black waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat and breeches, an immenſe and not very faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble peruke, high boots, a very deep pair of ruffles, and a long neckcloth twiſted through the fourth button<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole of his waiſtcoat.</p>
               <p>This extraordinary perſonage appeared to be about fifty years old. His black eyes, which were not the leſs penetrating for being extremely ſmall, darted their glances at the three intereſting figures that preſented themſelves in the perſons of Reuben, Rachel, and Miſs Oliver.</p>
               <p>He bowed profoundly on entering. Rachel roſe from her ſeat. Her ſorrows ſeemed to retire within her heart, and a dignified compoſure took poſſeſſion of her features, as ſhe received and returned his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>"This gentleman comes from Mr. Atkins," ſaid aunt Rachel, as pointing to the ſofa on which Reuben had ſat, ſhe motioned for him to be ſeated. "His name, I underſtand, is —"</p>
               <p>"Allibi, at your ſervice," ſaid he, bowing again, and recovering himſelf with an air of conſequence; as if he had ſaid, I believe I am pretty univerſally known. "Mr. Dudley, I preſume," turning toward Reuben, "and Miſs Dudley, his charming ſiſter, (bowing to Rachel) if I may judge from your mourning habits. Give me leave to condole with you on the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate cataſtrophe of our mutual friend. But man is born to die; ſo regret is uſeleſs. Permit me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to congratulate you on your acceſſion to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune."</p>
               <p>The mention of her father had called forth the ſmothered ſenſibility of Rachel; but the concluſion repelled it by rouſing her indignation.</p>
               <p>"Congratulate?" ſaid ſhe, in a voice ſcarcely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate.</p>
               <p>"Congratulate?" echoed Reuben, and his fine countenance glowed, his eyes darted reſentment. "Sir, we are the children of Mr. Dudley, his natural off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, reared by his care, nurtured by his love, and
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:034490_0207_0FFF2166990C3370"/>
taught by his wiſdom. Who then ſhall dare inſult us?" And he roſe from his ſeat, laid one hand on his breaſt, and with the other motioned as though brandiſhing a weapon. "Who ſhall dare inſult us by congratulation for his death? Oh! my father!"</p>
               <p>"My dear, loſt father!" repeated Rachel.</p>
               <p>"My afflicted friends," ſaid Miſs Oliver, ſoftly.</p>
               <p>It was a ſcene ſo new, the manners and ſentiments of the young trio were ſo elevated, as to be almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible to Allibi. He figetted on his ſeat, hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at leaſt half a dozen times, and at length he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with heſitation—</p>
               <p>"I beg pardon. I proteſt I did not mean—that is, I did not know. But as I was ſaying, young Mr. Reuben Dudley, and his ſiſter Miſs Rachel Dudley, being twin brother and ſiſter, and in the eye of the law joint heirs of the poſſeſſions and eſtates, of what kind ſoever, that is to ſay, of money, plate, jewels, landed property, houſes, merchandize, or what not, belonging or appertaining to their late father, Reuben Dudley, deceaſed—"</p>
               <p>"Oh heavens!" ſaid Rachel, folding her hands acroſs her breaſt, as if to accelerate her breathing, which was evidently laboured.</p>
               <p>"My dear creature!" ſaid Miſs Oliver, in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of commiſeration.</p>
               <p>"Good Sir, be expeditious in explaining the nature of your buſineſs," ſaid Reuben; and he walked to the other end of the room to conceal his own emotions.</p>
               <p>Allibi with the ſame <hi>ſang froid</hi> proceeded.—"You being, as I have before ſaid, co-heirs, do thereby ſtand anſwerable for all debts contracted by, or owing from the ſaid Reuben Dudley, deceaſed."</p>
               <p>"Granted," ſaid Reuben, haſtily. "Pray come to your concluſion.</p>
               <p>"The concluſion is," ſaid Allibi, deliberately draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his pocket-book, "that you muſt of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence pay this bill of five hundred pounds, which your father drew previous to his leaving America, on my client Andrew Atkins. Now he, Andrew Atkins, having no property whatever in his hands wherewith
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:034490_0208_0FFF216825BDC228"/>
to diſcharge this demand, and being empowered by your father before the late fatal cataſtrophe to ſell, mortgage, or otherwiſe diſpoſe of the Lancaſhire eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, in order to liquidate this and other debts he had contracted, I am ſent by him, my client, the ſaid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Atkins, to inquire when it will be convenient for you to diſcharge the bill; or in caſe of non-ability on your part, I am empowered to take poſſeſſion of the ſaid eſtates on the part of my client, the ſaid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Atkins, in order that he may mortgage, ſell, or otherwiſe diſpoſe of it, to enable him to anſwer this and other demands which may be made on him."</p>
               <p>"I ſuppoſe," ſaid aunt Rachel, "you know that half the eſtate is mine."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, madam." ſaid the man of law, "I know no ſuch thing. The late Mr. Reuben Dudley inherited from his grandmother, the lady Arrabella Ruthven, wife to Edward Dudley, who went to Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica in the year 1645; and as the ſaid Reuben was the only male deſcendant of the ſaid Arrabella, and ſhe dying inteſtate—"</p>
               <p>"Sir," ſaid Reuben haſtily, "the eſtate is half my aunt's; we wiſh not to conteſt it. It is, it muſt be her's, by all the rules of juſtice."</p>
               <p>"I know nothing of juſtice," ſaid Allibi; "the law, the law, Sir, is my profeſſion."</p>
               <p>I thought, Sir, law and equity were ſynonimous terms."</p>
               <p>"You are a very young man, Mr. Dudley, very young, very inexperienced; when you are older, you will be wiſer."</p>
               <p>Reuben could not anſwer; a look of pointed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt fully expreſſed his ſentiments. Allibi continued:</p>
               <p>"And ſo, Sir, yourſelf and ſiſter being minors, it is neceſſary to throw the eſtate into Chancery, when, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your father's debts are diſcharged, the reſidue will be paid to you when of age."</p>
               <p>"And in the mean time how are we to live," ſaid Rachel.</p>
               <p>"Oh! my dear young lady, you have friends, wealthy relations. You have alſo youth, beauty, and
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:034490_0209_0FFF2169E025C838"/>
may command a home in twenty different families, and in ſo doing confer a favour. Well, Mr. Dudley, I preſume from your ſilence that you cannot pay theſe five hundred pounds?"</p>
               <p>Reuben bowed his head.</p>
               <p>"I imagined it would be ſo, and have brought down people to take poſſeſſion of the houſe, plate, ſtock, farming utenſils, &amp;c. and muſt beg you will remove as ſoon as may be convenient. With your leave, (riſing and putting on his hat) I will take an invento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the family plate which I ſaw in the beaufet in the next room."</p>
               <p>He drew forth his pen, ink, and folded paper, and without waiting for the leave he had requeſted, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the adjoining apartment.</p>
               <p>"Alas! alas!" cried Rachel, "whither ſhall we go? Who will receive us? Where ſhall we find either home or ſupport?"</p>
               <p>"Had I a home I could call my own," ſaid Jeſſy Oliver, "you ſhould not have occaſion to repeat the queſtion."</p>
               <p>"And poor aunt Rachel too, what will become of her?" ſaid Rachel, tenderly taking her hand, which hung paſſively over the arm of her chair, as loſt in painful thought ſhe leaned her head againſt the ſide of it.</p>
               <p>"What will become of her?" ſaid Reuben with energy, "why I will labour to ſupport you both. Yes," continued he, fervently claſping his hands, and dropping on his knees before them; "yes, here in the ſight of Heaven, I vow to dedicate my life to her and you. I will cheerfully work to procure you ſuſtenance. Induſtry ſhall ſupply our wants, innocence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent make our dwelling, however humble, the abode of pleaſure; and I will protect you from the ſcorn and inſults of the world at the hazard of my life."</p>
               <p>As Reuben aroſe and folded his ſiſter in his arms, Hezekiah Penn entered the room. He was ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of their diſagreeable ſituation. But Hezekiah knew ſo very little of the world and its concerns, that
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:034490_0210_0FFF216E16B3D420"/>
he could not offer advice; all he could do was to bid them cheer up, and hope for better times.</p>
               <p>"In truth, my dear kinſman, ſaid he, "I do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate your ſufferings much; but I know not how, young as you are, you can extricate yourſelves from your preſent difficulty. Come, then, home to my houſe; abide there till we can fix on ſome feaſible plan for your future well-doing. I am not overcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the good things of this world; but come and partake of ſuch as I have, and take with it a hearty welcome. I pray thee, Rachel Dudley, be not down hearted, but come to my manſion; bring theſe children with thee, and He who feedeth the young ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens will provide the means of ſubſiſtence."</p>
               <p>The heart of Hezekiah overflowed with the "milk of human kindneſs;" he meant all he ſaid, and felt more, much more, than he could find words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. His friendly offers, and the endearing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Miſs Oliver, healed the bleeding hearts of Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben and Rachel, and even aunt Rachel was revived by their influence. That very night they removed from their own habitation to that of the benevolent Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, and leſt the loquacious Mr. Allibi in full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the premiſes, in behalf of his client Mr. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Atkins.</p>

               <p>SOON after this arrangement took place, Miſs Oliver was recalled home. With many tears ſhe took leave of our heroine, told her, if ever fortune ſhould put it in her power to offer her an aſylum, ſhe might freely command her purſe, her houſe, her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded friendſhip in every particular. When ſhe had again embraced Rachel, ſhe turned towards Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="unknown:034490_0211_0FFF216FA3820EB0"/>
"Mr. Dudley," ſaid ſhe, "the friendſhip of a girl like me is an offering of ſo trifling a nature, I hardly know whether you will think it worth accepting. You are adviſed by your friends to viſit America, to look after and ſecure the property your father poſſeſſed there. It will probably be many years before we meet again; and what changes may take place during this ſeparation, it is impoſſible now to determine. Accept my moſt ardent wiſhes for your proſperity. I know you will often write to my brother; in thoſe letters perhaps you will ſometimes remember me."</p>
               <p>"Oh! doubt it not, charming Miſs Oliver," ſaid he, preſſing her hand to his lips; while ſhe, fearful that ſhe had ſaid more than the exact line of propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety ſhe had preſcribed to herſelf rendered allowable, hurried to her carriage, to hide emotions ſhe found it impoſſible to ſtifle.</p>
               <p>Atkins having now taken the management of the eſtate eutirely into his own hands, pretended to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance money himſelf for the liquidation of Mr. Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's debts, and at the end of three months laid before Hezekiah Penn, Reuben and aunt Rachel, a ſtatement of accounts, which, to the minds of theſe three inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, honeſt children of ſimplicity, made it appear as ſo involved, that it would be a long term of years before it could even clear itſelf. In the mean time, how were the orphans and their venerable relation to be ſupported?</p>
               <p>Letters were written to Jacob Holmes, a proper time allowed, and no anſwer being returned, Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah perſuaded Reuben, who was now nearly eighteen, to viſit that continent and make inquiry himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his father's effects.</p>
               <p>"Your ſiſter," ſaid Hezekiah, "ſhall ſtay with me till you return. She ſhall not want a home nor a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whilſt I live."</p>
               <p>A voyage to the weſtern continent had ever been the primary wiſh of Reuben's heart; he hoped he knew not what, but that hope led him on; and even to part with his ſiſter was thought of with more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, ſince, if he amended his own fortune, ſhe was
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:034490_0212_0FFF21720CAB9B48"/>
to be the partaker of it. Jeſſy Oliver too was foremoſt in the happy group his ſanguine imagination portray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as eagerly flying to welcome his return to England. Nay, fancy would ſo powerfully take poſſeſſion of his mind, that ſhe would ſometimes carry him a ſecond time acroſs the Atlantic ocean, and place him tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilly in the habitation his father had deſcribed, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him with a blooming offſpring, and give them Jeſſy Oliver for a mother, his ſiſter too heightening by partaking their felicity; and even provide a ſnug corner and eaſy chair for aunt Rachel.</p>
               <p>"Uncle Hezekiah," he would ſay, "will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to quit Old England, or elſe what a charming family party we ſhould make."</p>
               <p>Oh! how delightful are thoſe day-dreams of youth; like the ſhadows of a magic lantern, that paſs before the admiring eye in quick ſucceſſion, each one as it comes forward more pleaſing than the laſt. But ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, diſappointment, poverty, throw a damp upon the fire of youth, which had given brightneſs to the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the brilliant tints grow pale; the figures are ſcarcely perceptible; they paſs before us almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed; when age entirely extinguiſhes the flame, and all is darkneſs, undiſtinguiſhable cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s.</p>
               <p>Spurred on by the native impulſe of his mind, which incited him to activity, and inſpired him with the moſt ſanguine preſentiments of future proſperity, Reuben took leave of his friends in Lancaſhire, and embarked for Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>Previous to his departure, he had thrown off both the habit and manners of a Quaker. Hezekiah remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, but Reuben would reply, "Nay, uncle, can you believe it is of any conſequence to out eternal welfare, whether we wear a plain drab coat or a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let one? or do you not think I ſhould commit more ſin in continuing the habit, when I cannot ſubmit to the tenets of the Friendly ſyſtem? I admire their primitive manners, and the ſimplicity of their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; but I am a young man, uncle, and have to make my way through the world. Beſides, I feel that within <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

my aſſiſtance. I ſhould readily draw a ſword in their defence. What, my dear uncle, if we were all men of peace, who would protect us from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of our enemies? No; you ſhall pray for peace, and if the haughty foe is not inclined to grant it, I will aſſiſt my brave countrymen to force them to it."</p>
               <p>Perhaps Hezekiah did not ſay ſo much as he might have done, had he not recollected that Reuben's father had only become one of the ſect in compliance with the wiſh of his wife; and Hezekiah had charity enough to think that a man might be a very good Chriſtian, though he wore a button to his hat, and ruffles to his ſhirt.</p>
               <p>From the time of Mr. Dudley's unfortunate death, aunt Rachel's ſpirits flagged. She was no longer the life of every ſociety in which ſhe mixed. The loſs of her little independence, the being obliged to the hand of charity for her daily bread, depreſſed her generous mind. The deſtitute ſituation too of her darlings, Reuben and Rachel, was a heavy affliction. Reſt and appetite forſook her. Reuben's departure for Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica was the finiſhing blow. The anxiety ſhe ſuffered for his ſafety brought on a ſlow nervous fever, and gradually undermined her conſtitution. Rachel watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over her with unremitting tenderneſs and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; adminiſtered every medicine; read to her, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her; endeavoured to cheer her by affected ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity when ſhe was awake, and wept over her with agony when ſhe ſlept.</p>
               <p>But care, affection, prayers and tears were alike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual. Aunt Rachel departed this life, and our heroine felt, as the laſt breath lingered on the lips of her maternal friend, that in loſing her ſhe ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come forlorn, unconnected, and be left to ſtruggle through a world with which ſhe was totally unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, without a comforter, adviſer, or protector. Reuben ſtill lived, to be ſure, but Reuben was far, very far from her; and ſhould ſhe ſtand in need of advice or protection, ſhe might be loſt, and Reuben
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:034490_0214_0FFF21753A04D438"/>
not even hear of her diſtreſs till ſhe was paſt the reach of relief or aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Occupied by reflections ſuch as theſe, Rachel would often ſtray into the rural church-yard, where, reſting on the "lap of earth," lay the remains of her mother and her lamented aunt.</p>
               <p>It was midſummer. The days were extremely long, and at half-paſt eight o'clock in the evening, juſt enough of the twilight remained, as threw over the face of nature that modeſt, duſky veil, ſo congenial to the contemplative mind. Rachel ſeated herſelf on the fragment of a broken tomb-ſtone, and caſting her eyes upon a new-made grave, where that very after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon a youth had been interred, the only ſon of a farmer in the neighbourhood, ſhe, almoſt unknown to herſelf, audibly repeated the following ſtanzas.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Reſt, gentle-youth, here reſt in peace,</l>
                  <l>Secure from vanity and noiſe;</l>
                  <l>For here thy earthly ſorrows ceaſe,</l>
                  <l>From hence commence thy heavenly joys.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Short was thy ſpan; 'tis paſt! 'tis gone!</l>
                  <l>Early thou'ſt reach'd the appointed goal;</l>
                  <l>Freed from its clog, and upwards flown,</l>
                  <l>Angels receiv'd thy ſpotleſs ſoul.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Here in thy quiet manſion reſt,</l>
                  <l>Safe from all anguiſh, pain or care;</l>
                  <l>Light fit the turf upon thy breaſt,</l>
                  <l>Nor weed nor briar flouriſh there.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And when the chilling arms of death</l>
                  <l>Shall fold this fragile frame of mine,</l>
                  <l>May my laſt ſigh of parting breath</l>
                  <l>Paſs tranquil and reſign'd as thine.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>"My lovely moraliſt," ſaid a voice, as Rachel fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed the laſt ſentence, "if you ſit here much longer, you will ſtand a chance of ſoon being as tranquil as that poor youth. His diſorder was a cold, and you are taking the right method to catch one."</p>
               <p>Rachel roſe, turned her head, and beheld the apoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecary of the village. Dr. Lenient was a man nearly
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:034490_0215_0FFF2177B0FBA088"/>
fifty years old, very humane, very learned, very ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his profeſſion; but with regret it muſt be added, not very rich. For if he attended a family whoſe wants were great and means ſmall, when the journey, man inquired if he ſhould make out the bill, as was cuſtomary, at Chriſtmas, he would ſay, Pho, pho, tear out the account and burn it; if I ſend it in, they can't pay it. It is only my own time loſt; and the few drugs—what did they coſt me? Nothing worth talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of. Oh! burn it! burn it! If the poor man has got a trifle beforehand, why he wants it, in this ſeaſon of hilarity, to provide a good large plumb-pudding for his little ones."</p>
               <p>With ſentiments ſuch as theſe, though the Doctor's practice daily increaſed, yet it did not greatly augment his revenue. However, he ſupported his family with comfort and ſomething more than decency.</p>
               <p>Our heroine was a great favourite with the good man. Studious from her infancy, of an inquiring genius, eager in the purſuit of knowledge, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the converſation of thoſe who had the power to impart it, Rachel at the age of twelve had prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a converſation with the doctor, to a ride or a ramble with her young companions. Charmed by her ardent thirſt for inſtruction, the old gentleman would anſwer her queſtions, correct her errors, direct her ſtudies, and labour to give her an unaffected turn for litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the polite arts.</p>
               <p>When Rachel painted or worked flowers, the Doctor would aſſiſt her in arranging her ſhades with proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; deſcribing, as he ſat beſide her while ſhe worked, the natures, properties and uſe of every plant, ſhrub or flower. If ſhe read, he corrected her pronunciation, and taught her how to convey the full ſenſe of what ſhe read to her auditors, by a pleaſing modulation of voice. If ſhe wrote, he would point out the errors in her ſtyle, and often has been heard to ſay, It was a great pity ſhe could not ſpeak and read Latin.</p>
               <p>"Come, my good girl," ſaid he, "you ſhall go home with me. You are too melancholy of late, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge too much in ſolitary walks and gloomy contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations.
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:034490_0216_0FFF217A23F7DAF0"/>
And let me tell you, my young friend, you are inſenſibly falling into an error, which, if indulged, will increaſe and grow upon you, till it becomes guilt."</p>
               <p>Rachel ſtarted. "What mean you, Sir?" ſaid ſhe.</p>
               <p>"I mean," replied the Doctor, "that you are ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into torpor and inactivity; you are ſuffering the functions of your ſoul to be entirely lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ked up by grief, and you are diſtruſting the power of a Divine Providence, in giving way to immoderate affliction."</p>
               <p>"Alas! my dear Sir," ſaid Rachel, "have I not cauſe to be afflicted? am I not a moſt unhappy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? My parents dead, my brother at an immenſe diſtance from me, my good uncle Hezekiah in a very infirm ſtate, and the only ſource from whence I could look for ſupport entangled in the law!"</p>
               <p>"All this is true, I muſt allow," ſaid the Doctor gravely, "but yet, Miſs Dudley, you have a firm, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable friend, who has ſaid, (and his word is truth itſelf) "Though thy father and thy mother forſake thee, yet will not I forſake thee." And this friend, my dear, has endowed you with wonderful qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of both mind and perſon; he has given you good ſenſe, genius, and the benefit of improving thoſe qualities by education; and all he requires of you is, not ungratefully to bury the talent entruſted to your keeping, but exert yourſelf to improve it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, depending on him to ſecond your endeavours, and he will amply reward your faith, patience and induſtry."</p>
               <p>Cheered and comforted by converſation ſuch as this, the melancholy cloud began to diſperſe from the brow of Rachel. Her features aſſumed a ſweet, an intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compoſure; and, arrived at the dwelling of the good Doctor, ſhe conſented to go in and partake of his ſupper. For the houſe of Hezekiah Penn was within five minute's walk of the Doctor's, and a lad was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to inform him that Rachel was ſafe, but would ſup out.</p>
               <p>This little neceſſary buſineſs was ſettled in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that fronted the houſe, where the lad was buſied,
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:034490_0217_0FFF217DE66DEBD0"/>
in watering ſome pots of curious flowers; and the Doctor then led his fair companion through the ſhop into a back parlour, where they uſually ſat.</p>
               <p>"I have brought you a welcome viſitor, ſiſter," ſaid he, as he opened the door. Mrs. Auberry roſe from her ſeat, and taking the hand of Rachel, cried, "Welcome indeed." Then turning to an elegant young man in military uniform, ſhe continued, "My dear Hamden, give me leave to preſent you to Miſs Dudley. This, Miſs Dudley, is my ſon Hamden Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry, of whom you have often heard me ſpeak."</p>
               <p>The majectic figure, the ſoft, melancholy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Rachel, rendered more ſtriking by her deep mourning habit. (for Rachel was not Quaker enough to neglect that outward token of reſpect to the memory of departed friends) made her appear in the eyes of the young ſoldier almoſt divine. She bowed her head, and preſented her hand with a grace peculiar to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. There was ſomething in the action <hi>nouvelle,</hi> and irreſiſtibly charming in the eyes of Hamden. He took the ſnowy pledge of amity, and bowed low upon it; and if his fingers did contract cloſer than the frigid rules of politeneſs render admiſſible, ſurpriſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration muſt plead his excuſe. Rachel was ſenſible of the preſſure, and life's warm fluid, ruſhing impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to her heart, from thence ſprang to her cheeks, and gave uncommon animation to her expreſſive coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
               <p>Dr. Lenient was an old bachelor. Himſelf and ſiſter were nearly of an age. She had, in her youth, united herſelf to a young man, who, being a younger ſon though of the united families of Hamden and Auberry, had nothing but a commiſſion and the intereſt of his father to depend on. Joanna Lenient was poor in every thing, ſave perſonal beauty and a good heart. Young Auberry ſaw her, loved her, and bidding defiance to every ſuggeſtion of prudence, in direct oppoſition to the will of his father, married her. His father renounced him, and he never roſe above the rank of captain. He ſought preferment in the field of action, fought bravely under the gallant Marlborough,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:034490_0218_0FFF217FA00718C0"/>
and fell in the memorable battle on the plains of Blein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</p>
               <p>His wife had never been acknowledged by his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and after his death ſhe retired, with her infant ſon, then only fifteen months old, to the village where her brother reſided. He had juſt entered upon the buſy ſcenes of life, had a pleaſant houſe, a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of employment; but no ſocial companion to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fireſide cheerful, or preſide at the temperate meal. He invited his ſiſter to come and increaſe his comforts by ſharing them. She complied, and his home from that hour became her's. Her penſion was devoted to the education of young Hamden, and the ſupply of her own pocket expenſes; and the Doctor found himſelf ſo happy in her ſiſterly affection, her economy in managing his family, her good humour, ſincerity, and ſtudy to pleaſe, that every other woman of his acquaintance loſt ſomething in his opinion, when compared with his ſiſter Auberry.</p>
               <p>It happened that when Hamden was about ſeven years old, the maid-ſervant of Dr. Lenient requeſted leave to go to a neighbouring fair, and take little maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with her. Hamden joined his ſolicitations with Suſan's, and was permitted to go. The brother of Suſan was the head-waiter of an inn, in the town to which they went, and thither the girl (after having paraded through the fair with ſome of her companions, and purchaſed for Maſter Auberry a gun and a drum) repaired, in order to procure ſome refreſhment. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſatiated with cakes, fruit and ſugar-plumbs, left her to take her repaſt in quiet, whilſt, taking his little muſket on his ſhoulder, and ſlinging his drum before him, he paraded in the court before the front of the houſe, ſupporting his gun with his left hand, and beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the drum with his right.</p>
               <p>Hamden was a remarkably handſome boy; his complexion at once fair and florid, his eyes large and expreſſive, of the fineſt ſapphire hue, and his forehead ſhaded by innumerable ringlets of beautiful flaxen hair; tall of his age, and ſufficiently robuſt to prevent an appearance of effeminacy. Such a boy ſo employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:034490_0219_0FFF218326CAC558"/>
could not fail to attract notice. A lady, who in paſſing to her country-ſeat had ſtopped to take dinner in this place, had obſerved his martial air and ſtep, as he marched before the windows, and throwing up the ſaſh, called him to her.</p>
               <p>"So you have been to the fair, I ſee, my pretty boy," ſaid ſhe.</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am, and Suſan gave me this gun; a'nt it a pretty one? and the drum too; only hear how loud I can beat it. She wanted to give me a fiddle and a coach, but I choſe the gun, and next fair I will have a ſword."</p>
               <p>"You ſhall have a ſword now, my ſweet boy; here is a ſhilling to buy one."</p>
               <p>"No, thank you, ma'am," ſaid Hamden; "mamma gave me money enough, and ſhe would be angry if I took any from ſtrangers."</p>
               <p>"You are a charming fellow; will you go with me?"</p>
               <p>"If mamma pleaſes, and you will promiſe to make me a ſoldier."</p>
               <p>"Why do you wiſh to be a ſoldier?"</p>
               <p>"Becauſe papa was a ſoldier. He was killed at the battle of Bleinhem, and I ſhould like to know how to fight, that I might kill the man that killed my father."</p>
               <p>The lady felt her eyes fill with tears; the undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit of the boy delighted her.</p>
               <p>"What is your name, my love?" ſaid ſhe.</p>
               <p>"Hamden Auberry," he replied; "'tis a great name, my mamma ſays, and for the ſake of my father's relations I muſt be careful not to diſgrace it, though they never owned me, nor noticed me."</p>
               <p>At the name of Auberry, the lady had funk agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated on the window-ſeat. "Come into the room, my dear." ſaid ſhe. Hamden obeyed, and was inſtantly folded in her arms, while her tears bedewed his face, as ſhe tenderly ſaluted him.</p>
               <p>It was lady Anne Auberry, the eldeſt ſiſter of Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den's father. Struck by the innocent reproach his natural and ſpirited replies had given, not only to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but all the family, for their wilful neglect of ſo
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:034490_0220_0FFF218676F8CCB8"/>
promiſing a branch of it, ſhe made inquiries concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſituation of his mother, ordered her carriage, took the child home, and from that moment adopted him as her own ſon. At that period ſhe was verging upon forty, was ſtill unmarried, and remained ſo at the time Hamden, returned from a tour he had been making on the continent, was introduced to our he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine.</p>
               <p>Lady Anne had ſpared no coſt in completing his education. She never forgot the promiſe he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently extorted from her at the moment ſhe firſt converſed with him, and before he was ſixteen pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for him an enſigncy in a regiment upon the home eſtabliſhment. He was now only twenty-two, but what cannot intereſt and money procure? Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Auberry, without once having been in actual ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, was advanced to the rank of Major.</p>
               <p>When lady Anne thus laviſhly poured upon her nephew every advantage which wealth could beſtow, ſhe in her mind purpoſed making him her heir; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſhe looked upon him as the heir of the family. Her eldeſt brother's children were all puny beings, and her ſecond brother had never married. She therefore looked forward with the hope of one day ſeeing Hamden one of the firſt men in the kingdom. One of the preliminaries ſhe had ſettled for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement was a marriage with ſome woman of ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did rank and fortune. Perhaps lady Anne was not quite ſo anxious about beauty, grace, good ſenſe, and good humour, as Hamden himſelf thought was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary; for ſhe had pointed out three ſeveral women of quality, who, ſhe aſſured him, would be happy to receive his devoirs, and whoſe alliance would do him infinite honour. But unfortunately one was upwards of forty years old, another had a hump on her back, coarſe, unmeaning features, and a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was the very counterpart of her form; and the third, though formed by the tendereſt care of young love, yet ſo vacant, ſo totally devoid of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal endowments,
<q>
                     <pb n="219" facs="unknown:034490_0221_0FFF21881CE629B0"/>
                     <l>And when the beauteous idiot ſpoke,</l>
                     <l>Forth from her coral lips ſuch nonſenſe broke,</l>
                  </q>
That Hamden, though an enthuſiaſt in his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of female beauty, could ſcarcely command pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience ſufficient to liſten with an appearance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon civility.</p>
               <p>His heart had remained untouched, and it was for our heroine alone to call its tender ſentiments into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The artleſs, unaffected manner of Rachel, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him the moſt delicate pleaſure, whilſt behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and converſing with her; for it was ſo apparent in every word, look, ſmile of her's, that ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious of her own charms, that thoſe charms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the more ſtriking, the more faſcinating. About half paſt ten, he waited on Rachel to the door of her uncle's manſion, and then returned to tell his mother ſhe was the only woman he had ever ſeen, who in the leaſt appeared to him in every particular what a wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought to be.</p>
               <p>Hezekiah had been married very early in life, but his wife lived only a few years; and from the time of her deceaſe, his houſehold concerns had been ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intended by a diſtant relation of his mother's, whoſe tall, thin figure, and auſtere viſage, attired in the cloſe mob black hood, and other plain habiliments uſually worn by the ſect, looked, as much as it is poſſible to conceive any thing to look, like formality perſonified. Nor was her dreſs and perſon more ſtiff and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding than was her manners. Ignorant in the higheſt degree, ſhe valued herſelf on that ignorance; ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood nothing of polite literature; and whenever ſhe ſaw our heroine engaged in any book, whether of inſtruction or amuſement it mattered not, by her they were all termed vanity and vexation of ſpirit. The productions of the beſt poets were called blaſphemy. Hiſtory was of no uſe; for of what conſequence was it to her what was done in the world before ſhe was born? And works of fancy, however excellent in their kind, were all a pack of nonſenſe, and ſerved on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fill young people's heads with proclamations.
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:034490_0222_0FFF218BA33EFAD0"/>
To be ſeen with a book on any day except Sunday, was highly againſt her creed. For in her opinion needle-work, ſpinning, and attending to the culinary concerns of the family, were ſufficient to occupy every hour of the day. Her pickles and preſerves were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in their kind, and for good ſubſtantial roaſt and boiled diſhes, with ſolid plumb-puddings, and large family mince-pies, Tabitha would not give place to any woman in England. Hezekiah thought, with all her oddities, ſhe had his intereſt ſincerely at heart, and therefore continued paſſive, and ſuffered Tabitha to rule the family as ſhe pleaſed. But the maidens of the houſehold unanimouſly declared, that ſhe ruled with a rod of iron.</p>

               <p>WHEN Hamden Auberry had ſeen Rachel to her uncle's door and rapped at it, politeneſs obliged him to wait till it was opened, which it was by Tabitha herſelf. She glanced her eye at the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let coat and the lace which decorated it, nor did ſhe entirely overlook the handſome form and face of him who wore it. But when, without noticing Tabitha, Hamden bowed to our heroine, and kiſſing her hand with an air of gallantry, wiſhed her a good night, ſhe became troubled in ſpirit that Rachel ſhould have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſuch an abomination quietly.</p>
               <p>With upright head, her long, ſcraggy neck ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its utmoſt extent, from a conſciouſneſs of her own purity, in ſilent ſolemnity Tabitha ſtalked into the parlour; where ſat Hezekiah almoſt dozing in his eaſy chair. She depoſited the candle on the table, and ſeated herſelf on his right hand. Rachel ſat down on the other ſide, and affectionately bending over the chair, aſked her uncle how he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="unknown:034490_0223_0FFF218E0D8D40E8"/>
"Why tired almoſt to death, thou mayeſt be ſure," ſaid Tabitha, not giving Hezekiah time to reply.</p>
               <p>"Then it was a pity my uncle did not go to bed," ſaid Rachel innocently.</p>
               <p>"Thou art both an unthinking and an unfeeling girl, Rachel Dudley, elſe wouldeſt thou know that anxiety for thy ſafety kept him up. But he has had ſo many of thoſe uneaſy hours ſince thou haſt been in his dwelling, that I can foreſee it will hurry him to his grave. Oh! Rachel! Rachel! thou art turned to vanity, to folly, to abomination. Thou art wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly running into the ſnares of the wicked one. Thou doſt love to conſort with the children of diſobedience; thou delighteſt to behold their veſtments, ſhining with gold, and red in the blood of Jezebel."</p>
               <p>"Bleſs me," ſaid Rachel, "what can you mean? Uncle, pray ſpeak to me. I hope I have not given you any cauſe for uneaſineſs. I ſent word that I ſhould ſup at Dr. Lenient's; had you ſent by the boy for me to come home, I ſhould have returned inſtantly."</p>
               <p>Hezekiah had taken her hand, which in her ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs ſhe had laid on his knee, gave it a gentle preſſure, and was beginning to ſpeak; but Tabitha in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted him, and he knew it would be in vain to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt being heard, when ſhe was inclined to talk. So he relinquiſhed his intention, leaned back in his chair, ſhut his eyes, and inwardly wiſhed he could ſhut his ears alſo.</p>
               <p>"Thou didſt ſend word, it is true," ſaid the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Tabitha, "but thou didſt not ſend word that a ſtranger would walk with thee; that thou wouldeſt lean on his arm, and ſuffer him to kiſs thy hand, in a manner not becoming a maiden who wiſheth to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her reputation. And this ſtranger was clothed in ſcarlet and gold, and eats the bread that is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by murdering his fellow-creatures. Verily, I ſay, my ſpirit waxeth wroth when I think the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Caſſiah Penn turneth from the worſhip of her father's houſe, and runneth after ſtrange gods, and delighteth to dwell in the tents of idolaters."</p>

                  <pb n="222" facs="unknown:034490_0224_0FFF21906F75FE70"/>
"I beg your pardon," ſaid Rachel tartly; "my father deſpiſed both formality and hypocriſy."</p>
               <p>"Oh thou offſpring of a generation of vipers," cried Tabitha, "doſt thou call our pure and undefiled faith hypocriſy?"</p>
               <p>"No! Heaven forbid I ſhould," replied our hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine mildly; "it is only the uncharitable and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate wretch, who, having neither heart to conceive, nor underſtanding to enjoy, the innocent pleaſures with which a bountiful Creator has enriched the world, proudly arrogate to themſelves the right to judge and contemn their fellow-creatures; and ſurely it is the height of hypocriſy to pretend to deſerve the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appellation of Chriſtian, and yet harbour in the boſom envy, hatred and malice."</p>
               <p>"Rachel! Rachel! child of folly, daughter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience," exclaimed Tabitha vociferouſly, her mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre features flaming with rage, as though the fire within ſhone through her ſkinny cheeks and hollow eyes; "child of darkneſs, hear me; thou art going blindfold into the pit; thou art walking barefoot over burning ploughſhares; but the ſoles of thy feet, like thine eternal ſoul, is callous and inſenſible to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that ſurrounds thee. Had thy mother lived unto this day—"</p>
               <p>"Oh! would to Heaven ſhe had!" cried Rachel, her ſpirits no longer able to ſupport her againſt the abſurd accuſations of Tabitha. "Oh that ſhe were alive at this moment; ſhe would not ſuffer her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent child to be thus groſſly inſulted."</p>
               <p>Here ſhe gave way to an involuntary guſh of tears; but ſuppreſſing them as quick as ſhe could, ſhe kiſſed her uncle with affection, "Good-night! God bleſs you, my dear Sir," ſaid ſhe; "the unhappy Rachel will not long be a trouble to you."</p>
               <p>"God bleſs you, my love," ſaid Hezekiah, "and grant us both patience according to the burthens it may pleaſe him to lay upon us."</p>
               <p>"Amen," ſaid Rachel fervently, darting an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant look at Tabitha; then riſing and taking the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle from the table, ſhe went towards the door; but
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:034490_0225_0FFF2192F27914E0"/>
the natural philanthropy of her mind would not ſuffer her to part in enmity with any one. She turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Tabitha. "Good-night," ſaid ſhe in a ſoftened accent, "and Heaven forgive us both as we forgive each other." Tabitha was ſullenly ſilent, and Rachel retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her ſolitary apartment, wept a few moments, knelt, and commended herſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the protection of Heaven; was compoſed and comforted by the action, retired to bed, and ſunk into the arms of repoſe.</p>
               <p>Sweet, heavenly ſweet, are the ſlumbers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. Rachel's heart was uncontaminated; envy, hatred, jealouſy, were equal ſtrangers to it. Her ſleep was undiſturbed and refreſhing; her dreams the viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation of miniſtering angels.</p>
               <p>When Rachel left the parlour, Tabitha began ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Hezekiah, but he aroſe from his ſeat. "My head aches," ſaid he, "I can ſit up no longer." Then taking his own candle, which ſtood ready on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he bade Tabby good-night and retired to his apartment.</p>
               <p>"I will alter my will to-morrow," ſaid Hezekiah, as he laid his head on the pillow; (for, ſome years previous to the death of Mr. Dudley, this will had been made highly in Tabitha's favour) "I will alter my will," ſaid he, "it will not be right to leave my fair and good kinswoman Rachel, dependent on a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whoſe underſtanding is weak, and whoſe heart is contracted."</p>
               <p>In the morning he aroſe with the ſame determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſpatched a perſon for the moſt eminent attorney of the neighbouring market town. He walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to Dr. Lenient's, wiſhing to conſult with him, and to have him a witneſs to his new will. But unfortunately the attorney was gone to London on particular buſineſs, and Dr. Lenient had been called to Liverpool to viſit a patient, who, having found benefit from his preſcriptions whilſt on a viſit in the country, wiſhed to have thoſe preſcriptions continued.</p>
               <p>At dinner, Hezekiah ate leſs than uſual, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of an acute pain acroſs his temples, and a coldneſs down the ſpine of his back.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="unknown:034490_0226_0FFF2195724CA9C8"/>
"Why doſt thou not partake of that boiled ſoul?" ſaid Tabitha; "the ſhrimp ſauce is good, I can aſſure thee, for I made it myſelf."</p>
               <p>"I have no appetite for fiſh," he replied, puſhing the plate gently from him.</p>
               <p>"Let me change your plate, dear uncle," ſaid Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel, removing the one before him and ſetting one in its place on which ſhe had previouſly laid the wing of a chicken.</p>
               <p>Hezekiah drew the plate towards him, cut a mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and raiſed it to his lips. But the effort was vain; his countenance changed; he ſunk back. It was a kind of paralytic affection. He ſtruggled to ſpeak, but could not articulate. By the order of Tabitha, he was put into a warm bed, and Dr. Lenient being juſt returned, attended on the firſt ſummons. He or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the uſual applications, and waited to obſerve their effects. All the night he continued ſpeechleſs; but towards morning, by a violent exertion, he ſpoke ſo as to be underſtood. Deſiring to be raiſed in the bed, he in faltering accents thus began:</p>
               <p>"I called on you, my good friend, this morning, to aſk your advice and opinion."</p>
               <p>"I wiſh I had been at home," ſaid the Doctor, "we might perhaps have prevented this ſevere attack."</p>
               <p>"That is not my meaning," ſaid Hezekiah. "My time is come, and, ſkilful as you are, my good Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, I do not think you can ward off the ſtroke of death."</p>
               <p>"I do not think I could," ſaid the Doctor gravely.</p>
               <p>"Tabitha," ſaid the ſick man, reaching out his hand towards her, "I am much indebted to you for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied attention you have for many years ſhewn me, and the care you have taken of my temporal intereſt. It has grieved me to ſee the little diſſenſions which have of late taken place between you and my niece Rachel, who, though younger, livelier, more free from prejudice than yourſelf, is nevertheleſs one of the beſt and moſt unoffending creatures in the world. Let me ſee you friends." continued he, taking Rachel's hand and joining it with Tabitha's.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="unknown:034490_0227_0FFF2197D4F835B8"/>
Rachel could not ſpeak, Tabitha would not, and Hezekiah continued:</p>
               <p>"You will find on the opening of my will, Dr. Lenient, that I have not forgot the ſervices I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from my ancient kinſwoman; but I am ſorry—I meant to alter—I wiſh her to give—" His voice again faultered—"to give her—" ſaid he with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme difficulty.</p>
               <p>"Fifty or ſixty guineas," cried Tabitha, interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him.</p>
               <p>"No," exclaimed the dying man; then ſtruggling violently, he at length articulated, "Give her half." They were his laſt words. In a few moments he ſunk again into inſenſibility, and before evening expired.</p>
               <p>Now the good-hearted Doctor fully comprehended what Hezekiah meant when he ſaid, "Give her half." But Tabitha wilfully miſconſtrued the expreſſion; and when the will was read, which gave the houſe, land, cattle, plate, furniture, &amp;c. to Tabitha Holdfaſt, in conſideration of her more than ſiſterly kindneſs," Dr. Lenient intimating, that he expected ſhe would make a fair and equitable diviſion of the whole with Rachel, in compliance with what he underſtood to be the intention of the teſtator from his laſt words, ſhe calmly replied:</p>
               <p>"Friend Lenient, I am not accountable for what thou mayeſt have underſtood. I am certain our dear departed brother Hezekiah—" And here the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief viſited her eyes; but it returned
<q>

                  </q>
"I am certain," ſhe continued, "he meant not the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation thou wouldeſt inſinuate; for when (ever ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to interpret and prevent his wiſhes) I mentioned giving her fifty or ſixty guineas, he ſaid, "Give her half;" and by his dying words I ſhall moſt ſurely abide."</p>

"He meant to ſay," cried the Doctor vehemently, "that you ſhould give her half of all he died poſſeſſed of."</p>
               <p>"It may be to thy advantage, friend, (ſaid ſhe ſneer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly) to have his laſt will ſo underſtood. The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular attentions of one of thy relatives to Rachel has not paſſed unnoticed; and I think thy family is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for promoting its own intereſt at the expenſe of others."</p>
               <p>It was a reproach too pointed to be miſunderſtood; but it ſprung from a mind ſo debaſed, that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath notice. The Doctor took his hat, and wiſhed Tabitha a good night. Rachel aroſe to light him to the door.</p>
               <p>"My good, dear girl," ſaid he, "I would fain have procured from this woman a ſmall independence for you; but it is in vain to flatter you with the idea. But this give me leave to ſay, Should you not hear from your brother, and your reſidence with dame Tabitha becomes painful, I have a home. My ſiſter and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf both poſſeſs hearts, which I thank God are not yet quite petrified." Saying which, he ſhook her hand and left her.</p>
               <p>Rachel ſoon perceived the full extent of her unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſituation. The morning after the interment of her uncle, Tabitha paid her thirty guineas, and from that moment ſhe found that ſhe was looked upon as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder in the family.</p>
               <p>Rachel was not of a ſpirit to brook the cold hauteur of Tabitha. Nor could ſhe think of availing herſelf of the kind offer of Dr. Lenient. For, beſides that ſhe ſhrunk from the weight of obligation, ſhe alſo felt there would be an impropriety in her ſeeking an aſylum in the family of Hamden Auberry. She was not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to his merit, nor had ſhe liſtened unmoved to the expreſſions of attachment that had ſometimes acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally eſcaped his lips. For Hamden knew he ſhould have many obſtacles to encounter, ſhould he give way to a paſſion for a woman in the ſtate of life in which fortune had placed Rachel. Lady Anne would never
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:034490_0229_0FFF219D90454880"/>
be brought to approve of his allying himſelf to a perſon, who had neither rank or wealth to recommend her.</p>
               <p>Rachel ſaw the ſtruggle of his mind, and, attributing that to pride which was only the effect of caution, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to intrude herſelf into a family which would look upon her connexion as degrading to its principal branch.</p>
               <p>Having therefore formed a plan for her future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, Rachel took an affectionate leave of the worthy Doctor and his ſiſter, and a very cool one of Tabitha, and departed in the ſtage-coach for London, reſolving to conſult and adviſe with her friend Jeſſy Oliver, in regard to her executing the ſcheme ſhe had thought of for her ſubſiſtence till ſhe ſhould hear from Reuben.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Auberry gave her a letter to a reputable family, with whom ſhe propoſed to board. Hamden was abſent at the time of Rachel's departure on a fiſhing party, and on his return, his mother merely informed him that Miſs Dudley was gone to London; but wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to put a ſtop to any further intimacy between them, ſhe did not mention with whom ſhe would reſide, or how long her ſtay might probably be in the metrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olis; and as he was engaged to paſs the autumn with lady Anne in Scotland, he was not ſo inquiſitive as he might otherwiſe have been.</p>
               <p>Rachel got ſafe to the end of her journey without meeting with any adventure on the road. But unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to travelling, ſhe was greatly fatigued; and when ſhe entered the buſy ſtreets of London, the noiſe, confuſion and hurry made her head giddy; the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable effluvia too, which aſſailed her olfactory nerves as ſhe alighted from the coach in a very cloſe lane in the city, turned her extremely ſick, and ſhe would have fallen, had not a ſpruce young man, who was waiting for another coach to arrive, caught her by the arm, and led her into the houſe, where a few drops and water revived her, and ſhe began to inquire for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance in which ſhe might proceed to her lodgings. A hackney-coach was ſent for, and while ſhe waited for it, the young man re-entered the parlour where ſhe
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:034490_0230_0FFF219F3501C748"/>
was ſitting, introducing a middle-aged woman, dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the extremity of the faſhion.</p>
               <p>"Walk in and ſit down, Miſs La Varone," ſaid he, "I will order the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>egus immediately." Then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our heroine, he continued, "And how do you find yourſelf now, ma'am?"</p>
               <p>"Much better, Sir, I thank you," ſaid Rachel.</p>
               <p>"Have you been ſick, ma'am?" ſaid Miſs La Varone.</p>
               <p>"I am not uſed to travelling, and was rather faint when I firſt alighted; but it was only fatigue, and the air of London is not quite ſo pure as that I have been accuſtomed to from my infancy."</p>
               <p>"Oh dear me! I don't wonder, ma'am, if you nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er were in London before, that it made you ſick. Then this lane is ſo cloſe; and I proteſt it made me as ſick as could be. But pray, ma'am, to what part of the town are you going? Perhaps one coach will ſerve us both."</p>
               <p>Rachel looked at the direction in her memorandum book, and Miſs La Varone exclaimed, "Well, as I'm alive, we are both going to the ſame place. Mr. Spriggins, this young lady is going to your aunt's."</p>
               <p>Rachel knew but little of the world in general, and leſs of London than almoſt any other place; yet there was a ſomething within her, a kind of native rectitude, that told her not to be too eaſy in agreeing to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the ſtrangers who ſaid they would all go to Mrs. Webſter's together. Yet her politeneſs and good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was ſuch, as would not ſuffer her to repulſe them rudely. Beſides, there was ſomething in the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of La Varone, however familiar her addreſs had been, that prepoſſeſſed her in her favour. She was a ſmall, delicate woman; her pale countenance, the features of which were extremely regular, was orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by an animated pair of black eyes, and long, dark eye-laſhes. Her dreſs, it is true, was in Rachel's opinion rather too gay; but ſhe was totally unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſtyle of dreſs that might be faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in London, and therefore paſſed this circumſtance the more eaſily over.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="unknown:034490_0231_0FFF21A352ECE110"/>
Finding it impoſſible to ſeparate herſelf from her new acquaintances, ſhe contented herſelf with giving the hackney-coachman particular inſtructions where to carry her, and in leſs than half an hour found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at Mrs. Webſter's, in Dartmouth-ſtreet, Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Mr. Spriggins, (who was ſhopman to a ſilk mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in the vicinity of St. James's Park) boarded with his aunt, and Miſs La Varone occupied the ſecond door of the houſe.</p>
               <p>Rachel begged an early cup of tea, and then retired to the apartment prepared for her; where wearied na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was refreſhed by ſeveral hours of profound ſleep. But the fatigue which had accelerated her repoſe, gradually giving way to its effects, her ſlumbers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came lighter, and about three o'clock, ſhe became ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the (to her) unuſual noiſes that ſurrounded her. The hollow voices of the watchmen, the rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of coaches and carts, the riotous mirth of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate wretches of both ſexes, who, under the black veil of night, prowled through the ſtreets in ſearch of prey; all together ſtruck on the aſtoniſhed ears of our heroine, who, not immediately recollecting where ſhe was, ſprang out of bed, exclaiming, "Heavens! what is the matter?" However, as Rachel was not troubled with weak nerves, and had in general great preſence of mind, ſhe preſently grew collected, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered ſhe was in London, returned to her bed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to obtain another viſit from the leaden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winged god. He liſtened, and was propitious to her entreaties, and at eight o'clock the following morning ſhe continued ſtill locked in his embraces.</p>

               <p>THE ſcene of life into which Rachel had now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered was every way new to her. Her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in avoiding the family of Dr. Lenient on account
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:034490_0232_0FFF21A4DFB0A3F0"/>
of young Auberry were laudable; but her open and ingenuous nature, fearleſs of guile, becauſe intending none, was not competent to the taſk ſhe had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Humane, generous, and credulous in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, ſhe felt that every human being had a claim upon her affection; and willingly allowing that claim to others, ſhe readily believed every profeſſion of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip made to herſelf.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Webſter was a woman of moderate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, devoid of knowledge, and with a very ſmall ſhare of curioſity, and being a widow with three girls, the eldeſt of which was but ſixteen, ſhe had to work extremely hard at her buſineſs, which was that of a hoop-petticoat maker, to ſupport her family. From ſuch a woman, Rachel had nothing either to hope or apprehend. She enjoyed from the effects of her care a very neat apartment, and regular decent meals; but as to any idea of a companion, it was entirely out of the queſtion. The daughters were young, and their minds totally uninformed; they were of conſequence unfit ſociety for her. To whom therefore could ſhe look to enliven her ſolitude by cheerful converſation? Miſs La Varone had read a great deal, though not in moſt inſtructive authors. She had a conſiderable degree of ſuperficial knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, was chatty, good-humoured, and ſtudious to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der herſelf agreeable. She became the conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of Rachel, and was unfortunately the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper companion ſhe could have choſen.</p>
               <p>Miſs La Varone was the daughter of a Swiſs valet, who, having ſaved a conſiderable ſum of money in the ſervice of a nobleman, and received a legacy at his death, married the lady's maid, and opened a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumery and toy-ſhop, in which he ſucceeded extremely well; eſpecially when his daughter grew old enough to attend the cuſtomers, her pretty face and lively manner acting as a taliſman to draw young men of faſhion thither.</p>
               <p>But human happineſs is futile! A fire broke out in the neighbourhood, and their houſe was conſumed amongſt a number of others, and as their property
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:034490_0233_0FFF21A739325D50"/>
was not inſured, a few hours reduced them from a ſtate of competence to abſolute beggary. The old man received a hurt, in endeavouring to ſave part of his ſtock, which he did not long ſurvive. The moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er again went to ſervice, and procured employment for her daughter in the ſame family. The eldeſt ſon of this family was pleaſed with her; offered her a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement; and at the age of eighteen, La Varone quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the protection of her mother, to accept that of a libertine. Her mother had perhaps a higher ſenſe of virtue than perſons in her ſituation are in general ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to poſſeſs. She remonſtrated, entreated, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by every poſſible means to reclaim her; but finding all equally ineffectual, renounced her. And though ſhe had, without murmuring, returned to her original way of life, and ſubmitted patiently to the privation of thoſe comforts ſhe had many years en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, and which had been the fruits of her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, yet ſhe could not meet ſhame without repin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Her child's diſhonour ſunk deep into her heart, and in a very ſhort time put a period to her exiſtence.</p>
               <p>La Varone continued with her admirer till he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; ſhe then removed from all her former connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, into the houſe where our heroine was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an inmate. She had been an eaſy conqueſt; her ſettlement was conſequently not large. However, ſhe kept up a genteel appearance, and frequently received viſits from an elderly gentleman, a couſin, who was a member of parliament. She ſaw but little company beſides; but ſhe would expatiate for an hour on the charms of retirement; ſo her living ſo recluſe was not ſurpriſing. Her favourite amuſement was a play, and ſometimes little excurſions in the country, where ſhe would ſtay four or five days at a time.</p>
               <p>The day after Rachel's arrival in London was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to reſt. Miſs La Varone was extremely atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, invited her to take tea in her apartment, where Mr. Spriggins alſo attended, and the elder Miſs Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Here they talked of the many curioſities to be ſeen in London. Weſtminſter Abbey, St. Paul's Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral, the Monument, the Tower, the Palace; all
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:034490_0234_0FFF21A8CA334848"/>
which Miſs La Varone ſaid they muſt poſitively viſit, and the gentleman offered very politely to be their gallant.</p>
               <p>Rachel was not devoid of curioſity. She had come up to the metropolis with the beſt reſolutions in the world, and Mrs. Auberry, when ſhe recommended her to Mrs. Webſter's to board, thought ſhe had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her young friend a very acceptable piece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But ſhe never reflected, that twenty-five years make a moſt amazing difference in the manners and diſpoſition of a perſon, eſpecially if in that period they have ſuffered much affliction, and from narrow cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances being unavoidably thrown into the ſociety of people, whoſe educations having been circumſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are often the ſlaves of contracted, low ideas and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberal prejudices; and it frequently happens, that thoſe who are obliged to work inceſſantly for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their families, being wholly occupied in the hope of bettering their fortune, become inattentive to appearances, and overlook actions, which earlier in life would have ſtruck them with horror. This was literally the caſe with Mrs. Webſter. The Mrs. Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter whom Mrs. Auberry knew ſo many years ſince, and ſhe to whoſe care ſhe now recommended her young friend, were as oppoſite in perſon, manner, and way of thinking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if it had not been the ſame, but two diſtinct people.</p>
               <p>The ſecond morning, Rachel took a hackney-coach, and drove to the houſe of Mr. Oliver, in the vicinity of St. James's. She was ſtill in mourning; a grey tabby night-gown, with black cuffs and robins, a plain lawn cap, apron, handkerchief, and ruffles, was the dreſs in which ſhe prepared to viſit her friend Jeſſy. But a woman thus habited and in a hackney-coach was not likely to challenge much attention from the gay lackeys who waited in the hall of Mr. Oliver.</p>
               <p>"Is Miſs Oliver at home, friend?" ſaid ſhe to the footman who came to the door. A ſurly <hi>No!</hi> was all the anſwer ſhe received, and the man was again ſhutting the door.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="unknown:034490_0235_0FFF21AB378BDD28"/>
"Is ſhe expected home ſoon?" ſaid ſhe, putting her hand out to prevent it from clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing.</p>
               <p>"I know nothing about it," ſaid the fellow.</p>
               <p>Rachel had deſcended from the carriage before the coachman had knocked for admittance, and was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the upper ſtep of a flight of ſtone ſtairs which led up on each ſide from the ſtreet. Her figure had attracted the eyes of Archibald, who was at home at this time, and ſeated in a front parlour window, killing time with a political pamphlet. Hearing her voice at the door, and underſtanding from the tone of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's voice that he was not anſwering in a very civil manner, he opened the parlour door juſt as ſhe was turning to deſcend the ſteps.</p>
               <p>"You were inquiring for Miſs Oliver, madam," ſaid he; "ſhe is at preſent out of town, but I expect to ſee her to-morrow. Who ſhall I tell her did her the honour to call?"</p>
               <p>"My name is Dudley," ſaid Rachel.</p>
               <p>"Dudley! is it poſſible; the ſiſter of my friend Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben?"</p>
               <p>"The ſame!"</p>
               <p>"How happy I am, Miſs Dudley! Give me leave to wait on you to your place of reſidence. I wiſh to aſk after your brother; I have alſo ſome intereſting intelligence to communicate to you concerning my ſiſter." He ſaid this as he handed her to the coach. Then calling for his hat, before Rachel could collect herſelf ſufficiently to refuſe or accept his propoſal, he was ſeated in the carriage beſide her, and inquired where he ſhould order it to be driven.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps, my dear Miſs," ſaid young Oliver as the coach drove off, "you may think it particular that I did not preſs you to enter my father's houſe. But to confeſs a mortifying truth, neither Jeſſy nor myſelf are allowed to take any more liberties there than we ſhould be in the houſe of an entire ſtranger. My poor father is ruled entirely by Mrs. Oliver, and his children have but a ſecondary place in his affections."</p>
               <p>"Pray make no apologies, Mr. Oliver," ſaid Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel, having a little recovered from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="234" facs="unknown:034490_0236_0FFF21ADBB052180"/>
which his apparently odd conduct had thrown her; "apologies are quite needleſs. I had no wiſh to enter the houſe except my dear Jeſſy had been an inmate of it. But you ſaid you had ſome intereſting intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence."</p>
               <p>"True, but before I enter on it, tell me, when did you hear from your brother?"</p>
               <p>"I have not received the leaſt intelligence from him ſince he left England; and ſometimes I fear—" Rachel's eyes filled; her boſom heaved.</p>
               <p>"Oh do not fear," ſaid Oliver, reſpectfully taking her hand: "Letters may miſcarry; you will no doubt hear ſoon. But apropos of Jeſſy; has ſhe not written to you lately? I underſtood you correſponded."</p>
               <p>"We did; but I have not received a letter from her for nearly two months paſt."</p>
               <p>"Poor Jeſſy, ſhe had nothing pleaſant to employ her pen, and ſhe always had an averſion to endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to lighten her own ſorrows by impoſing a recital of them on the attention of others."</p>
               <p>He then proceeded to inform her, that his ſiſter had unfortunately (as it proved) been ſingled out by a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman of elevated rank and ſplendid fortune, as the perſon with whom he wiſhed to ſhare thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. He ſolicited her hand, was encouraged by both Mr. and Mrs. Oliver, but reſolutely rejected by Jeſſy herſelf.</p>
               <p>"My father," continued he, "who (as I mentioned before) has no will but his wife's, has ſent the poor girl into the country, debarring her of all ſociety, and declaring ſhe ſhall ſtay there till ſhe accepts his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and I, who know her diſpoſition, think that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is tantamount to ſaying ſhe ſhall ſtay there as long as ſhe lives."</p>
               <p>"She is right to perſevere in rejecting him," ſaid Rachel, "if ſhe does not feel her heart ſufficiently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to him to incline her to ſhare his pains and pleaſures through life. For of all the miſeries that can be endured by a human being, ſure none can be ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere as being obliged to ſubmit to the whims and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prices
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:034490_0237_0FFF21AF511E9950"/>
prices (for we all have them) of a perſon to whom we are perfectly indifferent."</p>
               <p>Oliver gazed at her, as ſhe thus, with unaffected freedom, delivered her ſentiments on a ſubject, which the generality of thoſe young women with whom he was acquainted would have bluſhed only to have heard mentioned. But Rachel was entirely free from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of every kind; ſhe had no idea, but that a woman might ſpeak on the ſubjects of love and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, without ſimpering, bluſhing, and fifty other lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fooliſh prettineſſes. Nor did ſhe feel the leaſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed in converſing with a perſon of the oppoſite ſex; for it had never entered her head, that every man who ſaw her muſt fall in love with her, or that they could not paſs an hour in her company without entertaining her with praiſes of he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> wit and beauty, and complaints of their own hopeleſs paſſion.</p>
               <p>When the coach therefore ſtopped, and Rachel aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to walk in, he eagerly availed himſelf of the invitation; and after ſitting with her till ſhe was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to dinner, left her, impreſſed with ſo high an opinion of her underſtanding, that he thought her the moſt ſuperior woman he had ever known. She had promiſed to entruſt him with a letter to her friend Jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and he was determined to call for it himſelf, that he might enjoy another half hour of her ſociety. But in this he was diſappointed; for immediately after dinner, Rachel wrote her letter, and leaving it with Mrs. Webſter in caſe it ſhould be ſent for before her return, ſhe took one of the little girls with her, and walked to the houſe of Mr. Andrew Atkins, in Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln's-Inn, hoping to hear ſome tidings of Reuben, and alſo to inquire how long it would be before ſhe might expect to receive any money on account of the eſtate in Lancaſhire.</p>
               <p>Being ſhewn into a parlour, and having ſent up her name, ſhe was deſired to wait till Mr. Atkins had din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he would wait on her immediately. In about an hour, he appeared, accompanied by the identical
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:034490_0238_0FFF222DC39E0680"/>
Mr. Allibi who had viſited herſelf and brother in the country.</p>
               <p>Rachel roſe from her ſeat.</p>
               <p>"Servant, Miſs," ſaid Mr. Atkins, ſlightly bowing, and without aſking her to reſume her ſeat. "Pray what may be your commands with me?"</p>
               <p>"I wiſh to know whether you have had any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from my brother ſince his departure from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland."</p>
               <p>"Intelligence? No indeed! I wonder you ſhould think of my hearing from him; his going to America was a wild-gooſe ſcheme. What does he expect to get there?"</p>
               <p>"He expects to take poſſeſſion of his father's eſtate, which he purchaſed in Pennſylvania."</p>
               <p>"Pſhaw! pſhaw! Dudley made no purchaſe there worth inquiring after. An uncultivated tract of land, with a paltry houſe upon it, which my very good friend and correſpondent, Mr. Jacob Holmes, has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me is entirely fallen down."</p>
               <p>"Jacob Holmes, did you ſay?" cried Rachel in breathleſs agitation. "Why that is the very man my father mentions in his letter to have left in charge of his eſtate. He was brought up in my father's houſe. Can he advance ſuch an untruth, when he muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious—?"</p>
               <p>"Come, come, Miſs Dudley, don't ſpeak againſt Mr. Holmes; he is a very worthy, honeſt man. Your father lived in a very expenſive ſtyle in Philadelphia, ſpent a great deal of money, more a great deal than he ought. Even the trifling purchaſe he did make of land was not half paid for."</p>
               <p>"Sir! Sir!" cried Rachel, waving her hand with dignity, "I muſt not hear the memory of my father treated with diſreſpect. You may have been taught to believe what you now aſſert; or, perhaps, (darting an indignant look at him) your profeſſion accuſtoms you confidently to aſſert what you do not believe to be true. Be that as it may, I ſee my brother and myſelf are two unprotected orphans." Here her cheeks aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a pallid hue, her lips trembled, and ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:034490_0239_0FFF21B2C8AD0220"/>
to proceed; and though the unfeeling Atkins had kept her ſtanding while he ſpoke to her, agitation was now ſo great, that ſhe was obliged to ſit down, or ſhe would have fallen.</p>
               <p>"As I would wiſh to ſave you the unneceſſary trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of calling on me again, I have brought Mr. Allibi, who fortunately was dining with me, to give you any information you may require concerning the Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire buſineſs."</p>
               <p>"I am ſorry, my fair lady." ſaid Allibi, "that it is not in my power to give you ſuch information as you may perhaps expect; but ſo many unexpected de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands have been made, that I hardly think the eſtate will ever be able to recover itſelf. I have here (draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a memorandum book from his pocket) ſome few memorandums of the ſtate of the affairs at preſent. Whenever you ſhall require it, Miſs Dudley, I will lay a regular ſtatement of the accounts before you, and ſubmit the whole of our proceedings to your inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation."</p>
               <p>Rachel felt that this ſeeming integrity was an inſult to her underſtanding. Aſſuming, therefore, an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of fortitude that ſhe was far from feeling, ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted herſelf to riſe from her ſeat.</p>
               <p>"Good Mr. Allibi," ſaid ſhe, conveying as much acrimony into her looks and manner, as it was poſſible for her voice and features to expreſs, "of what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice will it be for me to examine or inveſtigate thoſe accounts? Did you, or your reſpectable client, Mr. Andrew Atkins, imagine me competent to the taſk, you would never have ſo readily offered it. But I am a woman—an orphan; young, inexperienced, unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected; and even ſuppoſing I could diſcover errors, who is there to ſupport my aſſertions? I am poor, and I can plainly perceive, you have inclination as well as reaſons for keeping me ſo. Oh that my injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed brother were but here!"</p>
               <p>"You ſpeak pointedly, Miſs Dudley," ſaid Atkins.</p>
               <p>"I ſpeak as I feel," replied Rachel.</p>
               <p>"But you are too warm, my fair lady," ſaid Allibi.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="unknown:034490_0240_0FFF21B534AB90F8"/>
"Pardon me," cried Rachel, "I do not think I am warm enough. Oh! that I could find words ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the indignation of my ſoul! Do not miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand me; for myſelf I am but little concerned. I have an innocent mind that can be humble when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and hands that are not uſeleſs. But my broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is in a ſtrange land; for him I feel a thouſand fears. My father's memory has been traduced; on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, my feelings are too powerful for utterance. If my raſh judgment wrongs you, gentlemen, Heaven pardon the error. For I leave you in the full perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that on whichever ſide the wrong is, the great Redreſſer of injuries, the righteous Father of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, will impartially judge between us. By his ſentence we muſt abide, and to him in humble confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I ſubmit my cauſe."</p>
               <p>As ſhe finiſhed ſpeaking, ſhe hurried out of the houſe, to prevent their being witneſs to emotions which ſhe was unable longer to ſuppreſs; and ſhe found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the ſquare oppoſite Newcaſtle-houſe, before ſhe was ſufficiently collected to remember to what part of the town ſhe was going. Polly Webſter, who had ſhewn her the way to Atkins's, had left her at the door, as ſhe had ſome errands to execute for her moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Strand. Our heroine had imagined ſhe ſhould eaſily find her way home again; but when ſhe found herſelf in a place with which ſhe was wholly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, and endeavoured in vain to recover recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſufficient to guide her to the right road, ſhe began to be uneaſy. She wiſhed for a coach, but there was not one came near her but what was previouſly occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied. She walked ſtraight forward through a narrow paſſage, which ſhe imagined ſhe had paſſed through before; it took her into High-Holborn. The throng of people, the multitude of carriages, and appearance of the ſhops, led her to think ſhe was in the Strand; and turning to the right hand, ſhe purſued her way, expecting every moment to reach Charing-Croſs. But as ſhe proceeded, ſhe began to perceive the difference of the ſurrounding objects, and became ſeriouſly alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A heavy ſhower appeared threatening in the air,
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:034490_0241_0FFF21B8750D3CE0"/>
and even at Holborn-Bars, Rachel could not procure a coach. The lightning had for ſome time gleamed in the horizon; the thunder which had rolled diſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now came nearer, and an univerſal war of elements ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>med approaching. Rachel looked round with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing apprehenſion. The tempeſt now burſt forth at once; wind, thunder, hail, and ſheets of liquid fire, rendered the ſcene tremendous. To avoid the fury of the ſtorm, Rachel ran up an entry which led to a large old-faſhioned manſion, and though not eaſily terrified, the late incidents had ſo oppreſſed her ſpirits, that ſhe ſat down on the ſteps, and burſt into an hyſterical flood of tears.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, woman?" ſaid a man who was coming from the houſe.</p>
               <p>The brutal tone of this addreſs, the ferocious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the fellow that uttered it, was an additional cauſe of terror. She roſe, endeavoured to ſpeak, but could not; and when ſhe attempted to walk, her limbs failed her, and ſhe ſunk again upon the ſtep.</p>
               <p>"Why, miſtreſs, you have taken a little too much cordial to-day," ſaid the ſame man; "but come, I'll lead you down the paſſage, and then you muſt go on as well as you can; for you can't ſtay here."</p>
               <p>Rachel, though overcome with terror, was perfectly ſenſible. She heard the remark made on her apparent helpleſſneſs, endeavoured to repel the violence of her emotions, and exert that fortitude of which ſhe was poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>"I merely came here for ſhelter from the ſtorm," ſaid ſhe; "and if I could procure a coach—"</p>
               <p>"Well, miſtreſs," ſaid a dirty, ragged boy, "if you will give me a ſhilling, I will call you one."</p>
               <p>Rachel readily agreed to the propoſal, and was put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her hand to her pocket, when there was a cry in the crowd that was now gathered, that a pick-pocket was amongſt them. A young naval officer ſaid he had loſt his watch and purſe. 'Keep all in, keep all in,' was the cry, and the throng ruſhed up the paſſage, ſo that Rachel found herſelf in an inſtant ſurrounded by a motley group of people, the chief part of which but
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:034490_0242_0FFF21BA3290C360"/>
to have been obliged to ſpeak to, would have filled her at once with terror and diſguſt. But what were her ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when, putting her hand again to her pocket, ſhe found a ſtrange purſe hanging partly out, and felt a watch actually within it. Before ſhe could ſpeak, a wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſeized her arm, and holding her hand ſo that ſhe could not withdraw it, ſhe cried that ſhe had found the thief. Rachel's ſtrength and ſpirits now at once forſook her; ſhe fetched a deep ſigh, and fell ſenſeleſs into the arms of the perſon who had been robbed.</p>
               <p>"The poor creature is ill," ſaid he; "ſtand away, ruffians, and let her have air." Then carrying her to the entrance of the paſſage, he puſhed back her hat, and untied her cloak. Her extreme youth, her beauty, the neatneſs of her apparel, all conſpired to prepoſſeſs him in her favour.</p>
               <p>"Had you not better ſend for a conſtable?" ſaid the wretch who had pretended to detect her.</p>
               <p>"No," ſaid the officer; "I do not think ſhe can be guilty; or if ſhe is, extreme neceſſity alone could have driven her to ſuch an expedient. How are you, ma'am?" ſeeing Rachel begin to revive.</p>
               <p>She looked wildly round her, put her hand to her head as though endeavouring to recollect why or how ſhe came there. At length the circumſtances recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to her memory, ſhe looked ſtedfaſtly on the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and then on her accuſer.</p>
               <p>"You have been robbed, Sir," ſaid ſhe, "and your property found in my poſſeſſion. How it came there, Heaven knows; but as I ſtand in the ſight of Him who rules the heavens, I do proteſt I am innocent."</p>
               <p>The ſolemnity of the appeal, the conſcious innocence of her heart, which beamed from her eyes and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every feature of her face, rendered the truth of her aſſertion indiſputable.</p>
               <p>"I do believe you," ſaid the officer; "but even had I thought you guilty, what is the inſignificant value of theſe trifles, when put in competition with the life of a fellow-creature, whom diſtreſs urges to actions from which the ſoul recoils."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="unknown:034490_0243_0FFF21BCB6DA7718"/>
The ſtorm was by this time much abated, and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel having ſent again to procure a coach, the officer ſaid he would not leave her till he delivered her in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to her friends. He was ſtanding at the entrance of the paſſage, holding the hand of our heroine, when a poſt chariot, that was driving haſtily through Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, being for a moment impeded by a number of carts and carriages, ſtopped directly oppoſite where they ſtood. The glaſs was let down, and Rachel ſaw diſtinctly Hamden Auberry, ſeated beſide an elderly lady. She alſo was certain, that he both ſaw and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized her. The blood for a moment forſook her cheeks, and then returned with impetuoſity, dying them of the deepeſt crimſon. Scarcely was there time to exchange the glance of recognition, before the chariot moved forward again, and a hackney-coach drawing up to the door, ſhe ſtepped into it, and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by her protector, drove towards Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth-ſtreet.</p>
               <p>On their arrival at Mrs. Webſters, Rachel found the family in great conſternation at her long abſence (for Polly having returned without her, had been diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again by her mother, who feared Rachel might loſe her way; and learning that ſhe had been gone ſome time from Atkins's, had returned as quick as ſhe could, in the hope of finding her ſafe at home).</p>
               <p>Miſs La Varone welcomed her with tears of joy, and Mrs. Webſter ſaid ſhe was glad to ſee her ſafe. Courtney, (the name of the young officer) without particularly mentioning the circumſtances, ſaid ſhe had been diſagreeably ſituated, and he had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate enough to be of ſervice to her. But Rachel would explain the whole; her new friend, Miſs La Varone, ſympathized with her, trembled with terror, glowed with indignation, or melted with gratitude, as the recital proceeded; and in the end, ſaid ſo many obliging things to Lieutenant Courtney, that he began to think her more than agreeable; and overlooking the charms of our heroine, which had nothing but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſimplicity to recommend them, he was pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:034490_0244_0FFF21BFDF3AFEC0"/>
attracted by the artful lures thrown out by La Varone.</p>
               <p>The ſituation of Rachel, in regard to reputation, was now as dangerous as it was poſſible; for Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney claimed the privilege of viſiting her; and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chibald Oliver, when he returned from the country, and his ſiſter, called to deliver the anſwer to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had taken, and one viſit led to another, till ſcarcely a day elapſed without his paſſing ſome hours in her company.</p>
               <p>Rachel's intentions, when ſhe firſt came to London, were to apprentice herſelf to ſome perſon who could inſtruct her in ſome laudable employment, whereby ſhe might render herſelf independent. For in her opinion, the perſon who by the exertion of any talent, or the exerciſe of induſtry, could ſupport themſelves, was in every ſenſe of the word as independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as they who inherited wealth or titles from their anceſtors. But theſe praiſeworthy reſolutions were from time to time put off, and her attention diverted to other objects, till ſhe began to perceive the ſmall ſum of money ſhe brought with her to London was very viſibly diminiſhed, and yet no plan put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which it could be repleniſhed. 'I muſt do ſomething to-morrow,' ſaid Rachel every night as ſhe laid her head on her pillow. But to-morrow came, and La Varone had ever ſome new ſcheme of pleaſure to propoſe. Juvenile indiſcretion united with curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, and a love of amuſement, natural to youth, led her on from one day to another, till the laſt ten pound note was broken in upon.</p>
               <p>Forbear, ye rigid, ye experienced matrons, to blame our heroine; it is the particular bleſſing of youth to be enabled to enjoy the preſent moment, forgetful of the paſt, nor fearing the future. Then cenſure not thoſe who eagerly gather the roſes, unmindful of the briars that ſurround them, or who, delighted with their beauty and fragrance, forget, in the enjoyment of their ſweets, the pain they ſuffered in gathering them.</p>
               <p>Jeſſy Oliver had written to her, had endeavoured to adviſe and comfort her; but Jeſſy ſtood in need of
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:034490_0245_0FFF21C238491E60"/>
advice and comfort herſelf; and our heroine, though conſcious that ſhe was not acting exactly right, could not ſummon reſolution ſufficient to combat inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but one party of pleaſure ſucceeded another, till ſhe almoſt loſt the deſire of employment, or the wiſh for independence.</p>

               <p>WHEN Hamden Auberry firſt ſaw Rachel at the entrance of the paſſage in Holborn, he hardly could truſt his ſenſes; but on letting down the glaſs and looking intently, he perceived it was no illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but in reality the woman whom he had thought the moſt faultleſs, the moſt perfect of her ſex. His heart ſhuddered; he dared not ſtop the chariot in which was his aunt, or he would have immediately jumped out, and learnt from her own lips the reaſon of her being in ſuch a place; but before he could form any plauſible pretext for quitting the carriage, it mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forward again with rapidity; and looking out of the open window, he ſaw her go into the hackney-coach, accompanied by Courtney.</p>
               <p>If he at firſt had imagined Rachel had voluntarily deviated from the path of rectitude, a moment's ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reflection made him reject the idea; and he began to be apprehenſive that her innocence and inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence might have betrayed her into ſociety and places, not altogether proper for a woman of character.</p>
               <p>But how could he ſatiſfy himſelf? Or ſhould ſhe be ſurrounded with danger, how could he diſcover her? how adviſe, or, if neceſſity required, protect her? Had he known where to find her, he would have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured even to entreat his aunt to take her under her protection; but he had not the leaſt clue by which to trace-her place of reſidence. He thought of writing to his mother, for information; but lady Anne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:034490_0246_0FFF21C4A4F0C1B0"/>
staying in London but two days, and it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to obtain an anſwer in that time. However, he did write, mentioning what he had ſeen, and requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be informed under whoſe protection Miſs Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley was, hinting that he feared it was not what it ought to be, or ſhe could never have been in the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in which he ſaw her.</p>
               <p>On the day appointed, he accompanied his aunt into Scotland; where, ſituated on the fertile banks of the Clyde, was an antique family manſion of lord Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morill, her elder brother. Whilſt there, he received a letter from his mother, which ſlightly mentioned that our heroine was well, and that the circumſtance he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, proceeded from her ſtanding up to avoid a ſhower.</p>
               <p>She hurried over the ſubject as lightly as poſſible; for ſhe ſaw the growing paſſion of Hamden, and knowing from experience the implacable tempers of the family, wiſhed to diſcourage hopes which ſhe ſaw he entertained, though againſt his own better reaſon.</p>
               <p>Rachel herſelf was far from being eaſy when ſhe thought of the incident, on the firſt night after ſeeing Hamden; (for ſhe ſeldom was allowed a moment for thought, except in the hours devoted to reſt) ſhe felt a pleaſure in reflecting he was in town. "I can ſee him now," ſaid ſhe, without incurring the illiberal reproofs of Tabitha."</p>
               <p>The heart of Rachel harboured not a wiſh or thought but what might have been made public to the whole world; and while ſhe was conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ious of its rectitude, ſhe felt proudly ſuperior to the little prejudices of vulgar minds. She could not underſtand why ſhe might not converſe with or entertain a friendſhip for perſons of an oppoſite ſex, as well as with thoſe of her own. She therefore indulged the hope, that Hamden would viſit her during his ſtay in London; but when day after day paſſed on, and he did not appear, ſhe again thought pride had prompted the neglect, and calling all her own ſelf-conſequence to her aid, ſhe endeavoured to think as little of him as he apparently thought of her.</p>
               <p>Young Courtney, the officer who under ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable circumſtances was introduced to the reader
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:034490_0247_0FFF21C63A539460"/>
in the preceding chapter, was the only ſon of his moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſhe was a widow. He had two ſiſters alſo, lovely, innocent and helpleſs; their father had been a veteran ſailor, commander of a firſt-rate man of war, in defending which from the enemy he loſt his life. The penſion of a captain's widow at that period was very precarious, and at the beſt but trifling, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain three women who had been accuſtomed to eaſe and elegance.</p>
               <p>Courtney gave them all the aſſiſtance in his power, and had often thought he would never marry until his ſiſters were ſettled in the world; and then if he could meet with a woman who could and would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their place in attention to his mother. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately, a few days acquaintance with Miſs La Varone, made him waver in his reſolutions. She could aſſume any character ſhe pleaſed. She diſcovered that her perſonal charms had attracted the inexperienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſailor. She wiſhed to marry, that ſhe might with impunity launch into extravagancies, which at preſent the fear of a jail alone debarred her from.</p>
               <p>La Varone, with a heart extremely depraved, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed one virtue in an eminent degree. She was what the world in general calls extremely <hi>prudent,</hi> careful to preſerve appearances, and where her own perſonal ſafety or intereſt was concerned, cautious not to incur the ſmalleſt degree of danger. By nature fond of luxury, ſhow, and expenſive pleaſures, ſhe had the art to <hi>ſeem</hi> frugal, retired, and ſtudious. She was ſenſible that at thirty years old, the ſeaſon for conqueſt was paſt, and though ſhe did not own to more than five and twenty, and by particular attention to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and dreſs, was not ſuſpected to be more; yet ſhe thought if ſhe could ſecure a permanent eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for herſelf before old age and neglect overtook her, it would be the wiſeſt ſtep ſhe could poſſibly take.</p>
               <p>The name of Courtney was honourable, his perſon handſome, his manners agreeable, and his family un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable. It was a conqueſt worth ſome pains. La Varone artfully drew forth his ſentiments in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the woman he might prefer for a wife, and
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:034490_0248_0FFF21C8AC5D96F8"/>
appeared the very character his warm imagination and unadulterated heart had conceived as moſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. She ſpoke of his mother with reſpectful affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of his ſiſters with all the fervour of enthuſiaſtic friendſhip; but if he mentioned her viſiting them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to their marriage, ſhe contrived to evade his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations; yet with ſuch modeſty, alleging ſuch deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate motives for her refuſal, that whilſt it oppoſed his wiſhes increaſed his love.</p>
               <p>Our heroine was equally with Courtney the dupe of La Varone, and rejoiced in the affection that ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between them; looking forward to their union, as a period that would at once inſure their felicity, and ſecure to herſelf two ſincere friends, in whoſe protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe ſhould feel herſelf perfectly ſafe till the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of her brother.</p>
               <p>During this interval of time, Rachel was frequently viſited by Archibald Oliver. He had at firſt beheld her with admiration, liſtened to her with delight, and every enſuing interview had heightened thoſe ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a degree which almoſt might be termed ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But Archibald poſſeſſed not a doit independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of his father, and that father he knew was, by his wife's extravagance, nearly ruined.</p>
               <p>Though volatile in his temper, eccentric in his ideas, and violent in his paſſions, young Oliver was ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly honourable; and he would have deemed it the height of cruelty to engage the affections of a woman he could not with prudence marry, or to marry her when he could neither provide for her ſupport, or for thoſe helpleſs innocents of which he might become the father. And fearing to forfeit the highly valued priv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilege of viſiting her, he confined his feelings within his own boſom. "She loves me now," he would ſay, "like a brother; ſhall I then, by claiming more, loſe even the affection I poſſeſs? No; I will adore her in ſilence, and pray that her felicity may be complete, though at the expenſe of my own."</p>
               <p>One morning he entered the parlour (where La Varone and our heroine uſually ſat at work) and ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf beſide the latter, told her he came to make
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:034490_0249_0FFF21CBFA2ECE50"/>
her a partaker of his own uneaſineſs. "Our dear Jeſſy," continued he, "has left her father's protection, nor have we any idea whither the beloved fugitive is fled. Here is a note ſhe left for me; incloſed is a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for you, Miſs Dudley. The perſecutions the ſweet girl has lately undergone, I have concealed from you, becauſe, as you could not alleviate them, I wiſhed not to make you participate. But diſguiſe muſt now be at an end. This was to have been her wedding day; but early in the morning it was diſcovered ſhe was not in her apartment. The confuſion this diſcovery occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, reached me as I was preparing, with a deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart, to accompany the devoted victim to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar; and as I was ruſhing out to inquire the cauſe (for my mind foreboded ſomething fatal) the girl who uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attended on Jeſſy, came into my dreſſing-room, and in agitated ſilence put theſe papers into my hand, retiring the inſtant ſhe delivered them. I haſtily tore my letter open; but it contained, as you will ſee, noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfactory. I learnt that a note had been deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to my father, and wiſhing equally to avoid him, Mrs. Oliver, and the diſappointed bridegroom, I took a coach and drove directly here." The letter to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chibald was as follows.</p>

Deareſt Archibald, though I am driven to the dreadful alternative of marrying the man I deſpiſe, or quitting the paternal roof, do not you forſake our fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. I ſolicit, I conjure you, my brother, in the name of our ſainted mother, forſake not our only remaining parent. I fear he will ſoon, very ſoon, ſtand in need of a comforter. I will be conſtant in my inquiries concerning his welfare, and whenever I find my preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence neceſſary to his peace or comfort, I will appear. Any thing but truth I would have ſacrificed for his ſake. Could you ſee my heart at this moment, you would pity the anguiſh I feel in bidding you adieu, perhaps forever.</p>

                     <head>To Miſs DUDLEY.</head>
                     <p>WILL my dear friend pardon me that I intrude myſelf upon her, and by explaining my ſorrows, make her a party in my concerns? I have ſuffered much perſecution, dear Rachel, ſince we parted; and to avoid ruſhing at once into guilt and miſery, I have taken a ſtep for which the world will cenſure me. But what is the world to me? Had I voluntarily aſſumed the ſplendid ſhackles prepared for me, had I become a titled wretch, and promiſed faith and truth to one man, whilſt every wiſh, every tender thought of my heart was devoted to another, would the approving ſmiles of that miſjudging world, the adulation it is ever ready to pay to ſplendor and nobility, have compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated for the ſacrifice I ſhould have made of internal peace, of conſcious integrity? No.—Admired, court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, envied, I ſhould ſtill have been miſerable. The baſeneſs of my conduct would be my daily reproach; I ſhould have ſought to baniſh reflection by diſſipation, and who can tell where the career of guilt and folly might have ſtopped?</p>
                     <p>I have endured both ſtern commands and ſoft en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties; I have been ſoothed and threatened alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately. That I might with more ſecurity follow the
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:034490_0251_0FFF222B53195010"/>

plan I had previouſly adopted for my future conduct. I pretended (Heaven pardon the deceit) to accept the huſband my diſſolute and ambitious mother-in-law had provided for me, and to-morrow morning I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to put on the Hymeneal yoke, and become a counteſs. But before the appointed hour arrives, I ſhall be far, far out of the reach of their tyranny. Let not my ſweet friend, whoſe boſom is the ſacred temple of purity, fear that I ſhall forget what is due to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. That I am ſtrongly attached to a worthy youth, I ſcruple not to confeſs; but he is a ſtranger to my paſſion, and in all human probability will ever remain ſo; for never will Jeſſy Oliver offer herſelf unſolicited to the acceptance of any man. My affections are pure as they are ardent; but the name of the object of them ſhall never paſs my lips, or eſcape my pen. I fly from proffered wealth and grandeur, to obſcurity; even from you, my dear Rachel, I will ſeclude myſelf. Were I happy or affluent, you ſhould be my choſen companion, the partner of my heart. But I am the reverſe, and will ſuffer alone. If you will condeſcend to receive and anſwer the letters of a fugitive, I have formed a plan by which we may regularly correſpond; but do not flatter yourſelf that by that means you can trace me; nor do not, I entreat you, ſuffer my brother to know the means by which my letters are conveyed.</p>
                     <p>And now, my deareſt Rachel, adieu! Fear not for me. I will never diſhonour the name of my father, or forget the virtue of my ſainted mother. Perhaps (my heart ſinks at the idea, but perhaps) I ſhall never ſee you again. If ſo, may Heaven ſhower its choiceſt bleſſings on you, and inſpire <hi>me</hi> with patience and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to ſubmit, without repining, to an affliction which would lacerate the heart of</p>

               <p>When Rachel had finished this letter, ſhe imparted to Archibald as much of the contents as ſhe thought neceſſary; but to all his entreaties of being permitted to peruſe it ſhe continued inexorable. She admired the reſolution of Jeſſy, and had ſo good an opinion of
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:034490_0252_0FFF21D135E184A0"/>
her heart and underſtanding, that ſhe felt confident of her ſtrict adherence to truth and rectitude.</p>
               <p>In all their paſt hours of friendly confidence, Miſs Oliver had never ſuffered a ſyllable to eſcape her lips by which Rachel could gueſs at her partiality to Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben; and at the time when they were moſt together, our heroine was too inexperienced to diſcover the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her friend by looks and geſtures. Perhaps, had ſhe converſed much with Jeſſy after her own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Hamden Auberry, ſhe might have been more clear-ſighted.</p>
               <p>Soon after this circumſtance, young Oliver, weary of home, diſſatisfied with himſelf, and more than ever in love with Rachel, felt there was a neceſſity for tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf from her ſociety. Beſides, he hoped, in travelling through the northern counties of England, to be enabled to learn ſome tidings of his ſiſter. A diſtant relation of his mother's reſided in the beautiful little town of Alnwick, in Northumberland; thither he repaired on a viſit. Its romantic ſituation pleaſed him; the ſociety of ſeveral agreeable families in its vicinity delighted him; and if we add that a lovely and intereſting woman, whoſe fortune was large and independent, beheld him with affection, and ſuffered that affection to become manifeſt, it is to be hoped the fair reader will not blame him, if he lengthened his ſtay at Alnwick, and every day thought leſs and leſs of Rachel.</p>
               <p>After the marriage of Lieutenant Courtney with Miſs La Varone, our heroine felt ſomewhat diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that ſhe had not been preſſed to accompany the new Mrs. Courtney into the country. The Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant had, to be ſure, ſolicited her company; but the bride did not, even by a ſingle monoſyllable, ſecond thoſe ſolicitations; ſo Rachel ſaw them depart fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently wiſhed them hourly increaſe of felicity, and then ſat down to reflect on her own ſituation in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, without friends, without employment, and with only eight guineas in her pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="unknown:034490_0253_0FFF21D534DD9990"/>
"I have done wrong, (ſaid ſhe mentally) very wrong. I muſt take more care, muſt endeavour to be more prudent for the future."</p>
               <p>As ſhe ruminated on the paſt, felt no ſatisfaction in the preſent, and looked with fear and deſpondency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the future, ſhe heard a confuſion in the adjoining apartment, and the voice of Polly Webſter, who was her favourite, entreating a woman to have patience, who by her expreſſions and manner ſeemed a total ſtranger to that virtue. She opened the door, and learnt that Mrs. Webſter was indebted to this woman for tea, ſugar, &amp;c. (for ſhe kept a chandler's ſhop in the neighbourhood) nearly five pounds.</p>
               <p>Now five pounds, to a perſon in abject circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is a debt of as much conſequence as five thouſand would be to one who keeps high company, a carriage, horſes, ſervants, dreſſes gay, and, as it is generally termed, lives in ſtyle; nay, perhaps, ten times more. For the poor being, who for the abſolute neceſſaries of life has incurred a ſmall debt, may be dragged by a remorſeleſs creditor to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a priſon, unknown, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitied; while he who, to indulge in luxury and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, had deceived the expectations of honeſt induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, deprived the laborious mechanic of his due, or duped the unwary tradeſman, is ſuffered to proceed with impunity. Nay, even thoſe who criminate his conduct, will flatter his vices, eat at his table, take him by the hand, and ſmile in his face, whilſt in their hearts they laugh at his abſurdity, pity his weakneſs, or condemn his depravity. Not but there are thoſe, who, diſcriminating between the embarraſſments of neceſſity, and thoſe of wilful extravagance, pity the one and deſpiſe and execrate the other. Yes, there are in this world hearts to commiſerate miſfortune, whilſt they dictate to the tongue comfort, and to the hands relief to the ſufferer. And thoſe choſen, thoſe ſuperlatively happy few, muſt ſurely be the favourites of Heaven. For the bleſſing they delight to confer on others, will return a thouſand-fold into their own boſoms.</p>
               <p>But I digreſs. To return to Mrs. Webſter: She could not pay the demand, and was threatened with
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:034490_0254_0FFF21D7A07C96E0"/>
the law. Rachel had but eight guineas; but ſhe could pay this demand and have three left. She ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to inquire what was prudent; ſhe felt what would be humane. She followed the heavenly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of "doing as ſhe would be done by;" ſhe paid the money.</p>
               <p>The heart of Mrs. Webſter dilated with gratitude; and the pain Rachel had endured from the departure and coldneſs of Mrs. Courtney, was forgot in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the preſent moment; ſo true is it, that real happineſs muſt be the reſult of the knowledge and practice of virtue.</p>
               <p>Mr. Spriggins, the nephew of Mrs. Webſter, though awed by her ſuperior ſenſe and the dignity of her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, was an ardent admirer of our heroine; but he had never yet breathed a word that could lead her to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his paſſion. La Varone, young Oliver, and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Courtney, had contributed to impoſe ſilence on him, and keep him at a diſtance. But now they were gone, he could offer any civility to her without the fear of having his endeavours to pleaſe entirely fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, by officiouſneſs or rivalry.</p>
               <p>The ſecond day after their departure, he came, and requeſted the Miſs Webſters and Rachel would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him to the play. He foreſaw that the young ladies would not be permitted to go without Miſs Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and alſo that her good-nature would not ſuffer her to decline his invitation, as by ſo doing ſhe would deprive the juvenile party of a rational and (to them) rare amuſement. His expectations were realized; and at an early hour they were all at the pit door of Drury-Lane Theatre. The performance was a trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and pantomime, both excellent in their kind.</p>
               <p>Rachel, whoſe ſenſibility often uſurped dominion over her rational faculties, baniſhing the mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er reign of reaſon, was, during the tragedy, ſo entirely abſorbed by the ſufferings of the hero and heroine, that the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did circle that ſurrounded her in the boxes was totally unnoticed. But between the play and entertainment, ſhe looked round on the glittering throng; and in the ſtage-box, converſing with attentive earneſtneſs with
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:034490_0255_0FFF21D92CF80A08"/>
an elegant and very young lady, ſhe ſaw Hamden Auberry.</p>
               <p>The lady laid her hand on his ſhoulder. Rachel diſcovered that her ſeat was uncomfortable. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as he converſed; twiſted a curl of her luxuriant auburn treſſes round his fingers.</p>
               <p>"I declare I am out of patience," cried Rachel.</p>
               <p>"At what, ma'am?" cried the officious Mr. Sprig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</p>
               <p>"At the players," ſaid ſhe; "they are ſo tedious."</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am," replied Spriggins, "they are to be ſure a long while."</p>
               <p>At that moment Hamden had taken the hand of his fair companion and preſſed it to his lips.</p>
               <p>"I cannot endure it any longer," cried Rachel, "the pit is ſo crowded, and it is ſo hot." Rachel was not eaſily overcome; but her heart was more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached in Hamden Auberry than ſhe was aware of. "It is ſo oppreſſive," repeated ſhe, unwilling to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge even to herſelf the cauſe of her uneaſy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. "I muſt really quit the houſe," ſaid ſhe, gaſping for breath. And then, before any effort could be made to get her through the crowd, a ſudden miſt came over her eyes, and ſhe fainted.</p>
               <p>The young Webſters were frightened, and Spriggins was entirely occupied in ſupporting her, ſo that no method was taken to recover her. But an elderly gentleman, who ſat near them, obſerved if they could lift her up, ſo that ſhe might be above the crowd, it would accelerate her return to life. Accordingly, he humanely ſtepped up on the ſeat, and raiſed her in his arms. A ſmelling bottle was now applied, and ſome lavender rubbed on her temples.</p>
               <p>The buſtle this incident had occaſioned in the pit, attracted the notice of the company in the boxes; and as the old gentleman raiſed the declining head of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel that ſhe might receive the more benefit from the air of ſeveral fans, Auberry ſaw and knew her. Like lightning he ſprang over the front of the box, and ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the company, was by the ſide of our he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine, when returning life began to animate her lips
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:034490_0256_0FFF21DBE6DF8DA8"/>
and cheeks; and when ſhe opened her eyes, Auberry was the firſt object that met them. The tender ſolic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude of his looks and manner, whilſt he inquired into the cauſe of her diſorder, contributed to reſtore her entirely; and having thanked the old gentleman for his care, and made room for Auberry to ſit between herſelf and Polly Webſter, as he held her hand, and ſpoke to her of his mother, Dr. Lenient, and the reſt of their acquaintance in Lancaſhire, ſhe entirely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got both her indiſpoſition and its cauſe.</p>
               <p>Though the impulſe of the moment had urged Hamden Auberry, in direct oppoſition to every rule of politeneſs or even propriety, to quit his company and ſpring into the pit, when he beheld the lifeleſs form of Rachel, yet when he now ſaw her perfectly recovered, he remembered the neceſſity of immediately returning to them, and apologizing for the abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his conduct.</p>
               <p>"I do not feel altogether ſatisfied, my charming Miſs Dudley," ſaid he in a low voice, "that the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in which, perhaps, you are obliged to mix, is prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or congenial to your feelings. Who are theſe young women, and the young man who attends them?"</p>
               <p>"I am not indeed," ſaid Rachel, "ſituated exactly as I could wiſh; but I know not how to better my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf."</p>
               <p>"Where ſhall I call on you," ſaid Hamden; "I cannot now ſtay to ſay all I think. I muſt return to my couſin, lady Lucy."</p>
               <p>"Is that your couſin?" ſaid Rachel, glancing her eye upon the young lady in the box.</p>
               <p>"Yes; I came to town by my aunt's deſire merely to accompany her; ſhe is come upon a viſit to a friend of her mother's, and is going with her to make a ſhort tour on the continent."</p>
               <p>"And do you accompany her?" ſaid Rachel; but ſhe dared not raiſe her eyes to his face as ſhe made the interrogation; for ſhe felt that her own was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed with a bluſh.</p>
               <p>"No; I ſhall only go with them as far as Dover. But as we do not ſet forward till Saturday, I ſhall
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:034490_0257_0FFF21DFD0E1CED0"/>
hope to paſs a few delightful hours in your ſociety previous to my journey. At what time will you be at leiſure to-morrow morning?"</p>
               <p>"I am always at leiſure to ſee my friends," replied Rachel, with a faſcinating ſmile.</p>
               <p>Hamden's countenance expreſſed his gratitude, and the pleaſure her frankneſs gave him, and preſſing her hand, he wiſhed her a good night, returned to the box, and a few moments afterwards, the whole party in which he was engaged left the theatre.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the performance was entirely loſt upon our heroine. Her perſon was preſent, and ſhe ſaw the figures that paſſed and repaſſed before her; but her mind was totally abſent, and ſhe might as well have gazed upon vacancy. She was diſſatisfied with herſelf; ſhe had diſcovered that ſhe was too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in whatever concerned Hamden Auberry; ſhe feared too that he had diſcovered her weakneſs. Theſe reflections entirely employed her thoughts.</p>
               <p>When the performance was ended, ſhe mechanically followed her party out of the houſe. When freed from the hurry of coaches, chairs, orange-women, link-boys, and the crowd that had juſt immerged from the play-houſe, ſhe took hold of Polly's arm, and in ſilence purſued her walk home. When ſhe entered the parlour ſhe aſked for a candle, and would have retired to her chamber; but Mrs. Webſter had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ſome little delicacy for her ſupper, and ſhe had too much good-nature and politeneſs to refuſe ſitting up to partake of it.</p>
               <p>The curioſity of Spriggins and the two elder Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters was excited by the behaviour of Hamden Auber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. They had talked it over as they walked home to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and all agreed that he was certainly a lover. The company he was with declared he was of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior rank in life; but they had not been quite pleaſed that our heroine had neglected to introduce them.</p>
               <p>"He is a monſtrous handſome man," ſaid Belle, the ſecond daughter.</p>
               <p>"He is well enough," ſaid the eldeſt, "but he ſeems ſo proud and ſelf conceited."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="unknown:034490_0258_0FFF21E15BCD7E20"/>
"We'll joke Miſs Rachel a little about him at ſupper time," ſaid Spriggins.</p>
               <p>"I wonder what made her faint," ſaid Belle.</p>
               <p>"Why lawk, Belle!" replied the ſiſter, "you know ſhe has always lived in the country, and ſo I ſuppoſe the lights, and the noiſe, and the beat—"</p>
               <p>Juſt then they arrived at home, and in a few min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes they were all ſeated round the ſupper table.</p>
               <p>Miſs Dudley has been very ill at the play, mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma," ſaid Polly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed," cried the eldeſt, "ſhe fainted quite away, and there was ſuch a fine gentleman jumped out of the box and came to her, I believe he is an old acquaintance."</p>
               <p>"I believe ſo too," ſaid Belle, laughing; "for he ſeemed monſtrous anxious, and looked ſo happy when ſhe began to recover."</p>
               <p>"He is an old acquaintance," ſaid Rachel, at once diſtreſſed and flattered by the manner in which his anxiety and aſſiduity was mentioned; "it was Major Auberry, madam," addreſſing herſelf to Mrs. Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; "the ſon of our reſpected friend."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! Well, I have not ſeen him ſince he was an infant; and beſides, if he even remembered me, he is ſo much amongſt the great folks, it would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath him to notice me, or any of my family, though his mother and I, when girls, were juſt like ſiſters."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," cried Spriggins, whoſe ſelf-conſequence had been lowered by his being entirely overlooked by the Major; "yes! when folks get up in the world, they generally forget their poor friends."</p>
               <p>"But I dare affirm Major Auberry is not one of thoſe kind of people," ſaid Rachel; "he intends calling on me to-morrow, and I have no doubt but he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in being introduced to Mrs. Webſter and her family."</p>
               <p>"Well, we ſhall ſee!" cried Spriggins; "but I am ſure he is not overburthened with good manners, or he would have ſaid good-night, or your ſervant, or ſome ſuch like, to me, when he went away; for though mayhap I am not ſo grand, nor ſo fine, nor ſo learned, I thinks I underſtands good-breeding as well as any
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:034490_0259_0FFF21E3B83052B8"/>
body. And for the matter of that, a man is but a man, and I don't ſee why wearing a laced coat, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called Sir, or My Lord, or Your Grace, makes one man a bit better than another."</p>
               <p>Rachel found that it would be in vain to attempt defending Hamden againſt the complaints and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of Spriggins, whoſe contracted mind, and very ſmall portion of underſtanding, would not ſuffer him to comprehend thoſe nice diſtinctions which, allowing for the natural equality of man, ſtill preſerves that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that neceſſary ſubordination, due from inferiors to perſons of ſhining abilities, liberal education, and ſuperior underſtanding; and the ignorant, ſelf-opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionated being who prates of equality, never once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the cauſe of the diſtinction, which education (more than any other cauſe) makes between man and man. Perſons of large fortunes are enabled to enjoy the benefits of inſtruction in its moſt extended ſenſe; and they who have cultivated their minds with care, whoſe taſtes and manners are highly poliſhed, feel as great a repugnance to the ſociety of the vulgar ignorant, in whom mean pride, obſtinacy and vanity in general combine, as the pure and uncontaminated mind would feel in being forced into an intercourſe with the vicious. But Rachel knew theſe arguments, if advanced, would have no effect on Spriggins; ſhe therefore liſtened in ſilence to the end of his harangue, then wiſhing them all a good night, retired to her apartment.</p>

               <p>Polly ſaid ſhe hoped, if he was going to marry dear Miſs Dudley, that he was as good as he was hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. For if he was a king, he could not be too good for her.</p>
               <p>"Marry," ſaid the eldeſt, putting up her lip, "I dare ſay he would be frightened to hear you ſay ſuch a thing. No! no! young men of his rank and faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion don't often marry poor girls; if they did, I don't ſee why ſome folks might not ſtand as good a chance as others." And ſhe caſt a ſly glance at the looking-glaſs, which hung directly oppoſite to where ſhe was fitting.</p>
               <p>Hamden, in this interview with our heroine, felt his admiration increaſe. Every circumſtance that had taken place during her reſidence in London, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulated to him, with an ingenuous freedom that captivated his heart, whilſt his reaſon applauded the involuntary tribute of admiration and reſpect, her manners and ſentiments exacted.</p>
               <p>When ſhe had finiſhed her artleſs recital, (which was drawn forth by his inquiries, not voluntarily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded on his attention) "You are, I fear, improperly, as well as uncomfortably ſituated," ſaid he with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy.</p>
               <p>"I acknowledge it," replied Rachel, "but I muſt bear it with patience; there is no remedy."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, my dear Miſs Dudley? You ſurely have friends."</p>
               <p>"I dare ſay I have, Sir, many friends; but I ſhould be ſorry to treſpaſs on their goodneſs."</p>
               <p>"Is it poſſible Miſs Dudley can imagine—" He was proceeding, but ſhe ſtopped him.</p>
               <p>"Do not miſunderſtand me, Major Auberry; I do not think meanly of my friends, but I am conſcious of my own defects; I am too proud to live in a ſtate of ſervile dependence."</p>
               <p>"Good heavens! what do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing very extraordinary. My brother is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; my late dear father's agent, I greatly fear, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt;
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:034490_0261_0FFF21E89F2C83B8"/>
and perhaps I ſhall find it neceſſary to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, in order to continue in ſome degree reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able."</p>
               <p>She ſaid this without embarraſſment, and with a cheerful ſmile. She felt no degradation in the idea of exerting her talents to procure ſupport.</p>
               <p>Hamden was ſilent; a certain ſomething ſtruck cold upon his heart. No wonder; it was the cold, hard drop that turns whatever it falls upon to ſtone. Pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty has a moſt unaccountable petrifying quality; many a heart has it rendered impenetrable as adamant; many a boſom has it incaſed in marble, or enveloped in ice, ſo firmly congealed, that only the ſun of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, riding in full meridian, could ſoften or relax it. Hamden felt the cold chill run trembling through every nerve; but his heart defied its frigid power, and glowed with more fervour. He ſaid but little after this explanation, and ſoon took his leave.</p>
               <p>On his return to his lodgings, he thus inquired of himſelf. Do I love Rachel Dudley? Moſt aſſuredly, beyond all other women. Does ſhe return my paſſion? That is a queſtion yet to be determined. If I might judge from the intelligence of her eyes.—But hope may be preſumptions. Would I marry her? Yes, with delight and tranſport, if ſhe would accept me. What? in defiance of my aunt's wiſhes and injunctions?</p>
               <p>Here was a moment's pauſe. At length he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his queſtions. Would I be willing to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh all hope of future affluence, honour, title, and devote my life to obſcurity and Rachel Dudley? I fear not. I ſhould repine at the advantages I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed, and embitter her life by my own fruitleſs regret. Then is it honourable, by indirect attentions, to lead her to ſuppoſe ſhe has an excluſive preference in my boſom, or to awaken expectations, which will end only in diſappointment? Certainly no.</p>
               <p>After thus cloſely interrogating his own heart, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den determined to avoid viſiting Rachel again; but on the morning following, he received a letter from his mother; it would be but kind to call and let Miſs Dudley know her friend Dr. Lenient was well, and that Tabitha
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:034490_0262_0FFF21ECE7B4FA60"/>
Holdfaſt had taken to herſelf a help-mate of one of the faithful.</p>
               <p>He accordingly went; one viſit produced another. Prudence on one ſide, and pride on the other, were for a while forgotten. Hamden talked of love, and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel liſtened with complacency.</p>
               <p>It was on a fine evening in the beginning of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as wandering on the banks of the Thames, where a row of young willows drooped their pendent branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es over the ſoftly gliding ſtream, that Hamden (on whoſe arm Rachel reclined with the confidence of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal affection) ſpoke of the happy intercourſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial minds.</p>
               <p>"Dear, charming Rachel!" ſaid he, "it ſeems as though our ſouls were formed at the ſame moment, and partake of congenial particles."</p>
               <p>"Our ſentiments are certainly much alike in moſt things," ſaid Rachel.</p>
               <p>"And why not in every thing," cried Hamden ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly. "Way, my lovely friend, loving as we love each other, (for you do not deny though you heſitate to avow your affection) why do we not ſanctify that affection by the moſt ſolemn vows?"</p>
               <p>"You have an aunt, Hamden Auberry," ſaid Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel with firmneſs, "and on her depends your future fortune. She will not approve of the untitled, unpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Rachel for your wife."</p>
               <p>"Do not name her. I will renounce her favour. I will henceforth live but for you."</p>
               <p>"Hamden," ſaid Rachel, and her features aſſumed a ſerene ſolemnity that was almoſt celeſtial, "Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, I have not expreſſed the feelings of my ſoul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was ſenſible of the impoſſibility of our ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united with the conſent of your aunt; and know, though you were dearer to me than life itſelf, I will never intrude myſelf into a family, who would think themſelves degraded by the alliance. That I am an unconnected being, is certain; no one has a right to ſay, Rachel, why doſt thou ſo? But I have a heart that tells me when I err. To the reproaches of this truſty, ſilent monitor, I will never ſubject myſelf; to
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:034490_0263_0FFF21EE771610E8"/>
the contumely and cenſures of the world I am invul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable; they too often misjudge and condemn the innocent unheard."</p>
               <p>"Sweet, charming moraliſt, whither wouldſt thou lead me?" ſaid Hamden.</p>
               <p>"To happineſs, I hope," ſaid Rachel ſmiling. "That I feel my heart glow with eſteem to you," continued ſhe, "is a truth I wiſh not to deny; but that eſteem is pure; nor perſonal intereſt, nor hope of future aggrandizement, will ever bias me. You aſk me for a wiſe; here is my hand; let us ſanctify our loves in the face of Heaven. Enable me to ſatisfy my dear Reuben, when he returns, that I have not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured the name of Dudley; and for the indiſcrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inating, curious, idle multitude, let them think as they may. Happy in your affection, their ſmile or their frown will be alike inconſequential."</p>
               <p>The gratitude of Hamden was manifeſted in wild, enthuſiaſtic expreſſions of everlaſting love. But Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den's pride ſtill predominated, and he accepted the title of huſband to an amiable woman, whoſe virtue and underſtanding would have done honour to a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem; yet, fearing to forfeit the paltry diſtinctions of wealth and title, he ſuffered her to bear the ignominy of ſuſpicion, and the bitterneſs of reproach, from thoſe who neither comprehended or could eſtimate her merit.</p>
               <p>They were married in St. John's Church, Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and Rachel removed to a lodging provided for her by her huſband in the neighbourhood of Mary-le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.</p>
               <p>When Rachel propoſed removing from Mrs. Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's, ſhe found no ſmall difficulty in ſatisfying her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries reſpecting the cauſe of her removed. She had imprudently acquainted Mrs. Webſter with the dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed ſtate of her finances; when therefore on the morning of her marriage, which took place a little after eight o'clock; for Rachel, though ſhe had now been ſome months in London, continued the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving cuſtom of early riſing, and frequently walked before breakfaſt, ſo that it was nothing extraordinary for her to be abroad ſo early; when, in conſequence
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:034490_0264_0FFF21F0526EC000"/>
of this union, ſhe prepared to quit her lodging, and gave Mrs. Webſter a bank bill for forty pounds, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting her to get it changed, the old lady looked at her with a ſcrutinizing eye; and though not apt to make remarks, could not avoid ſpeaking to our hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine in the following words:</p>
               <p>"It is no buſineſs of mine, to be ſure, Miſs Dudley; but I am afraid you are going to do a very impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thing. To your family and connexions I am a total ſtranger; but for the ſake of my friend, Mrs. Auberry, I could wiſh you had conducted yourſelf with more circumſpection."</p>
               <p>"In what, madam?" ſaid Rachel indignantly, "have I tranſgreſſed the laws of prudence?"</p>
               <p>"You have received the viſits of ſeveral young men. Mr. Oliver, I concluded, was your lover for ſome time; but after viſiting, taking you on parties of pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, and being as attentive as man could be, whisk he goes off into the country, and there's an end of the matter."</p>
               <p>Rachel could not help ſmiling as ſhe replied—"Mr. Oliver, I believe, madam, never thought of me in any other light than as a friend. I am ſo happy as to be eſteemed by his ſiſter, and for her ſake he ſhewed me, whilſt he ſtayed in town, more than common reſpect."</p>
               <p>"<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it may be ſo; but it had a very odd appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance though. Then came Mr. Courtney. I made quite certain that he would be the happy man, when, behold! inſtead of you, he marries Miſs La Varone. To be certain, ſhe was a clever ſort of a body; but then one would have thought a young man would not be at a loſs to chooſe between you and her."</p>
               <p>"Well, you find he was not at a loſs," anſwered Rachel rather petulantly.</p>
               <p>"And now," continued Mrs. Webſter, not noticing her reply, "now here has been Major Auberry, danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attendance above a month paſt. I am afraid he means no good; he is, as one may ſay, one of the quality folks; and his aunt, lady Anne, would no more agree to his marrying a poor girl, than ſhe would to his going to Jeruſalem. What then does he deſign?
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:034490_0265_0FFF21F2B593D5E8"/>
Take care, Miſs Dudley, do not let him make you his dupe. You are going from me; for what purpoſe, or into whoſe protection, you have not thought proper to tell me; however, that is neither here nor there. As I ſaid before, it is no buſineſs of mine. But when I think, that not a fortnight ſince you ſhewed me the contents of your purſe, which were very trifling, and declared it was all you poſſeſſed in the world, and that I now ſee you in poſſeſſion of forty pounds, I cannot help thinking all is not as it ſhould be."</p>
               <p>"I thank you, madam, for your care and anxiety on my account," ſaid Rachel, who perceived, in Mrs. Webſter's manner, more of curioſity than real ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for her welfare, "but to quiet your apprehenſions, permit me to aſſure you, I ſhall be careful never to offend againſt virtue and morality. My conduct may incur cenſure, but ſhall never be criminal. Whilſt my dear brother is from England, I hold myſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to no one for my actions; and whilſt my own heart acquits me of any breach of my duties either moral or religious, I am perfectly indifferent as to what opinion the world in general may form con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me."</p>
               <p>Thus argued Rachel; but her ideas were erroneous, and ſhe found, when too late, it is not only neceſſary to be virtuous, but to appear ſo. Alas! pity it is, but the ſemblance is often more reſpected than the reality.</p>
               <p>"I ſuppoſe we ſhall ſee you ſometimes, Miſs Dad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley?" ſaid Mrs. Webſter with a ſneer, as ſhe took leave of her.</p>
               <p>Rachel ſlightly anſwered in the affirmative, ſhook hands with her and Belle, kiſſed the affectionate little Polly (who ſtood ſobbing by the window) and put a guinea into her hand; then ordering her trunk to be placed in a hackney-coach that waited at the door, ſhe ſtepped in, drew up the glaſs, and a few moments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed her to her new lodgings, where her huſband was ready to receive her.</p>
               <p>The attachment of our heroine to Major Auberry was pure as it was ardent. Accuſtomed from infancy to confine her affections within a narrow circle, ſhe
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:034490_0266_0FFF0CE683717458"/>
would have felt no repugnance to ſeclude herſelf from all other ſociety, could ſhe have been certain by ſo doing to inſure his eternal love and fidelity. She had aſked leave of Hamden to inform Jeſſy Oliver, with whom ſhe regularly correſponded, of the change in her circumſtances; but he forbade her. She acquieſced in ſilence.</p>
               <p>It had never entered her mind, that an unknown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual like herſelf, could excite the curioſity of her neighbours. She was the leaſt inquiſitive of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being. "Of what conſequence," ſhe would oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſay, "is the buſineſs, pleaſures or purſuits of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to me. I harbour no ill will towards any; and have I a right to ſcrutinize their actions? No."</p>
               <p>Hamden Auberry, ſtill the ſlave of pride, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to forfeit the favour of lady Anne, ſuffered his wiſe to go by the aſſumed name of Dacres. Our he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine too was equally the ſlave of the ſame paſſion, but it was of a more laudable kind. He ſacrificed the reputation of a virtuous woman, rather than relinquiſh the inſignificant diſtinction wealth and power could give; and ſhe nobly (though romantically) braved the cenſures of the world, to evince her thorough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of both.</p>

               <p>A poor ſubſtitute, you ſay. I acknowledge the truth of the obſervation, and therefore return to my hero.</p>
               <p>After a paſſage of thirty days, Reuben Dudley ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſafe in the Delaware, and on the thirty-ſecond day after his departure from Liverpool, landed in the city of Philadelphia. He had with him ſeveral letters of, what is called, recommendation from merchants in Liverpool, to their tranſ-atlantic correſpondents; but they contained nothing more than a general mention of his family, and that his character and morals had been hitherto unimpeached.</p>
               <p>"I will not inquire out the gentlemen to whom theſe letters are directed, till I have ſeen my good friend Jacob Holmes," ſaid Reuben to himſelf, as he walked up the main ſtreet. "He will, without doubt,
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:034490_0268_0FFF21F8A921C130"/>
accompany me, when I wiſh to viſit them. How glad will he be to ſee me," continued he mentally. "His natural love to my ſiſter and ſelf, his gratitude to my father—"</p>
               <p>At the remembrance of his father, Reuben's heart became full; and when he ſeated himſelf in the tavern to which he had been recommended, and began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect ſeriouſly upon where he was, and that it was more than probable his father might have been in that very houſe, in that very room, nay, he might have reſted on the identical chair he was now ſeated on, the fulneſs of his heart overflowed at his eyes, and he indulged in the effuſion without reſtraint.</p>
               <p>He had ordered ſome ſupper. As the maſter of the houſe came in with it, Reuben aſked him if he had ever known one Mr. Dudley, who had reſided in Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adelphia between two and three years.</p>
               <p>The landlord had, previous to the queſtion being aſked, drawn a chair to the oppoſite ſide of the table to that where our hero was ſeated, and when he heard the interrogation, anſwered it by another.</p>
               <p>"I expect he is ſome relative of yours, by your being ſo inquiſitive about him."</p>
               <p>"He was," ſaid Reuben mournfully, "a very near and dear relative,"</p>
               <p>"So I expect," replied the landlord. "Pray where is he now?"</p>
               <p>"In heaven," ſaid Reuben, raiſing his eyes, whilſt every pulſation vibrated in exulting confidence of his father's worth.</p>
               <p>"You muſt not be too ſure of that," ſaid the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord.</p>
               <p>"Had you known him, Sir," ſaid Reuben with a firm and earneſt manner, "you would have no more doubt of his preſent happineſs than I have."</p>
               <p>"I did know him," replied the hoſt.</p>
               <p>"Then you knew one of the beſt men that ever liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed."</p>
               <p>"Yea, he was good in the worldly acceptation of the word; he did alms, told no lies, hated no one, paid every man, yea, more than his due; but all this
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:034490_0269_0FFF21FA4F7801B8"/>
is vanity, filthy rags, unclean veſtments. He was not one of the choſen; he was in a loſt ſtate."</p>
               <p>Here a diſpute enſued, in which Reuben evidently loſt ground with his antagoniſt; for Reuben argued with coolneſs, and took reaſon for his monitor; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his opponent was wild, enthuſiaſtic, and extremely ignorant. He had adopted ſome eccentric ideas in regard to religion, and he aſſerted that his opinions were right, "becauſe they were," and that all who did not think exactly as he did, were in the high road to deſtruction, for the ſame unanſwerable reaſon, "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were."</p>
               <p>Before Reuben had finiſhed his ſupper, the landlord left him, to impart to his ſpouſe all he had learnt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſtranger. The curioſity of Jael was not ſatiſfied with this intelligence of her helpmate's.</p>
               <p>"Thou haſt learned nothing, Zekell," ſaid ſhe; "I will go and queſtion the young man myſelf."</p>
               <p>Jael entered the parlour.</p>
               <p>"You are juſt arrived," ſaid ſhe, ſitting down in the place her huſband had juſt left.</p>
               <p>"Yes, juſt landed."</p>
               <p>"From England?"</p>

               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"I expect you have got ſome kinsfolks in the city."</p>
               <p>"Not that I know of."</p>
               <p>"No friends, no acquaintances?"</p>
               <p>"Oh yes! Do you know Jacob Holmes?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, to be ſure I do. Maſter has reaſon to know him; he is a dire hard man to deal with."</p>
               <p>"What buſineſs does he follow?"</p>
               <p>"Buſineſs! Well, I expect you don't know much about him, to aſk that queſtion. Why Jacob Holmes is one of our grandeſt men, for all he be a Quaker. And then he married ſuch a grand woman; why I expect ſhe had a matter of five hundred pounds to her fortin."</p>

                  <pb n="268" facs="unknown:034490_0270_0FFF21FD73C8D600"/>
"Mr. Holmes is married then?"</p>
               <p>"What, did not you know that? Well, I thought you were a boaſting ſort of fellow, pretending to know folks who you never ſaw'd."</p>
               <p>"How long has he been married?" ſaid Reuben.</p>
               <p>"Why I expect it is about a year and a half ago."</p>
               <p>"So long?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, ſo long; and madam Holmes has got a ſweet little baby, about three months old."</p>
               <p>Reuben pauſed a moment, and then without reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion exclaimed, "Why he muſt have married imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after my father's departure for England."</p>
               <p>"And pray what may be your name?" ſaid Jael, placing both her elbows on the table, and reſting her chin on her hands, whilſt her large blue glaſs eyes were fixed on the face of our hero with a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning ſtare.</p>
               <p>"My name is Dudley," replied Reuben.</p>
               <p>"So I expected," ſaid ſhe, and ſomething like low cunning informed her broad and inexpreſſive features. "And ſo you are cum'd to look after the fortin ſquire Dudley left?"</p>
               <p>"Even ſo," replied Reuben, puſhing from him the plate that contained his almoſt untaſted ſupper. "How far from Philadelphia does the late Mr. Dudley's eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate lay, and which is my neareſt road to it?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, young man!" ſaid Jael, "I expect you be cum'd on a fool's errant. It matters not to you where it lies; he never paid for it; and cording to counts that we have heard, the ſquire owed a pretty deal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cum'd from home."</p>
               <p>Reuben ſtarted. "Of whom are you ſpeaking?" ſaid he.</p>
               <p>"Of ſquire Dudley."</p>
               <p>"What Dudley? what was his Chriſtian name?"</p>
               <p>"Name! name! I can't juſt now ſay; but I expect it was a bible name."</p>
               <p>"Was it Reuben?" aſked our hero eagerly.</p>
               <p>"I do expect it was," ſaid the woman, riſing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt emotion, and beginning to remove the ſupper from the table.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="unknown:034490_0271_0FFF2200A5DF1D38"/>
"Oh! my dear father!" exclaimed Reuben, and his reſpiration became ſo difficult that he was obliged to walk to the window and throw up the ſaſh.</p>
               <p>Jael replaced the diſh upon the table, and with a look and manner to which no deſcription can do juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, thus addreſſed him:—</p>
               <p>"If ſquire Dudley was your father, I wonder how you got ſafe over ſea. Nobody was ſurpriſed when they heard he was caſt away and drownded; for he was as great a reprobate as ever lived."</p>
               <p>"Reprobate!" repeated Reuben with vehemence, and his eyes flaſhed reſentment, whilſt his heart ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt to burſting.</p>
               <p>"Yes, reprobate," repeated Jael, "and I expect you will find a pretty many folks in Philidelphy that will tell you as how here he comed over ſea, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a vaſt rich man."</p>
               <p>"'Tis falſe!" cried Reuben; "I would ſtake my exiſtence upon his probity. My father would have ſcorned to pretend to any thing more than he could make appear reality."</p>
               <p>"But I ſay he did though," ſaid Jael; "giving away his intereſt as a body may ſay, ſelling his goods at half-price, that, as he ſaid, the poor might buy as well as the rich. Then if he ſaw a man that wanted, he never inquired whether he was a Chriſtian or a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, but lent or gav'd him what he axed."</p>
               <p>"And a juſt and beneficent God will reward him for it," ſaid Reuben, raiſing his eyes fervently. "He is now, I truſt, reaping the reward of his philanthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py."</p>
               <p>"It mought a been all very well," continued Jael, not noticing the ejaculation of our hero, "had he only given away his own; but to deal ſo hardly as he did by that pious young man, Jacob Holmes—Oh! it was a wicked thing."</p>
               <p>Reuben approached a few ſteps towards his hoſteſs, and then ſtopped, fixed in curioſity and amazement; amazed at the malignity with which this ignorant woman endeavoured to aſperſe the memory of his father, (whilſt every ſentence till the laſt, muſt appear
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:034490_0272_0FFF220230B55C40"/>
in the eye of pure religion and candour as his higheſt eulogium) and curious to know from what ſource this malignity proceeded; whilſt Jael, leaning over the back of the chair from which ſhe had ariſen, her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſtill fixed and without expreſſion, in the ſame monotonous tone of voice proceeded:—</p>
               <p>"It is a ſerious thing, young man, a very ſerious thing, for one to be left gardeen to a wealthy child. Oh! it is a trying matter, a grand ſnare, laid by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the mighty tempter, the great deceiver. Money is the root and ſpring of all evil; it is the bait the wicked one makes uſe of to draw the children of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty aſtray, as he did thy father. Oh! it was an abom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination for him to keep Jacob Holmes as he did, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out even pocket money, whilſt he was throwing away his intereſt by handfuls."</p>
               <p>"I do not underſtand you," ſaid Reuben; "Jacob Holmes was an orphan child, adopted, brought up and educated by the charity of my father."</p>
               <p>"Ah! that was the ſtory ſquire Dudley told, when he firſt comed here; but we knows better things now. It was the money of the good Jacob Holmes on which he was living; for I expect if it had been his own he would a been more careful of it. But thy father, young man, has wronged the orphan of his right, and made himſelf rich at the expenſe of the ſon of the widow, and the curſes of the widow and the orphan will reſt upon him and his children."</p>
               <p>"So be it," cried Reuben; "I fear no judgment for my father's actions. Oh that I may be enabled to emulate his virtues, to tread his footſteps—But I feel I am to blame in liſtening to one, whoſe aim is to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate the memory of him who gave me being. What could he have done to deſerve thy hatred, that even his ſacred duſt cannot reſt in peace? Did he ever wrong thee or thy family?"</p>
               <p>"No, not he; I expect he was the means of my getting a matter a twenty pounds or ſo, that I ſhould a loſt; but then, though it did me a kindneſs, it did not tell much to his credit, though (as maſter ſaid)
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:034490_0273_0FFF22041823D328"/>
we got our money, and what matter was it to us who paid it?"</p>
               <p>"True," cried Reuben, "that could be of but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſequence indeed; but pray tell me, how came my father to render you this ſervice?"</p>
               <p>"Why I expect it is ſo long a ſtory, you will be tired."</p>
               <p>"Tell it as conciſely as poſſible," ſaid Reuben; "I will anſwer for my patience; and even ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> more lengthy than I expect, when a father's good deeds are the theme, what ſon could be weary or feel his attention flag?"</p>
               <p>Jael looked at him, with mouth and eyes extended. She comprehended nothing more than that he deſired to hear how his father happened to pay her twenty pounds; ſo, ſtill leaning over the back of the chair, ſhe began:—</p>
               <p>"I expect it's a matter a three years agone, a wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an comed over in a ſhip from London, an ſhe ſaid as how ſhe comed ater her huſband. She was as pretty a body, I expect, as one mought ſee in a hundred. Maſter and I was juſt married, and got into this here houſe. So ſhe comed an wanted to board with us, an ſhe had a baby with her about ſix months old. So ſhe had plenty of money, an a golden watch, an a power of fine clothes; ſo we let her have our beſt room, an hired a girl to wait on her."</p>
               <p>"Plenty of money, a gold watch, and fine clothes," ſaid Reuben mentally, and he turned from the ſelfiſh narrator to hide his indignation and contempt.</p>
               <p>"Well, ater a while," ſhe continued, "we found as how the parſon ſhe cum'd ater was not her huſband; he had kept her company, and I expect, promiſed to marry her; but he would neither own her nor her child when he ſaw'd her here. So ſhe did nothing but cry, and cry, and kiſſ her little girl; ſhe was too proud to work, and ſo, when her money was ſpent, and her golden watch ſold, ſhe ſaid ſhe wiſhed to die."</p>
               <p>"Poor, unfortunate girl," ſaid Reuben in a tone of commiſeration, "how I pity her!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="unknown:034490_0274_0FFF22088F3E2150"/>
"Pity her indeed," ſaid Jael, "a creeter! When I told her ſhe mought get a good living by going out to ſarvice, ſhe ſaid ſhe knew not how to labour for bread; them was her very words, an ſo ſhe would not eat nor drink, an uſed to go night ater night with her clothes on, ſitting on the floor, and reſting her head on a chair or the window-ſeat. She at laſt grew ſo weak, that ſhe was not able to walk; ſo I went and axed her what ſhe meant by going on ſo; for ſhe know'd as how ſhe owed me above twelve pound; ſo ſhe only anſwered me, 'ſhe meant and wiſhed to die, and at once releaſe me and herſelf.' But then ſhe would hug her baby, and cry, 'Poor little wretch! what will become of you? It were better we both died to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether."</p>
               <p>Reuben's eyes gliſtened with the dew of ſenſibility, but he was ſilent.</p>
               <p>"So at laſt ſhe fell into a conſumption; I expect it was all owing to her pride that was ſo humbled and mortified. So ſeeing as how ſhe was like to become a trouble to maſter, I told her how ſhe muſt go about her buſineſs; for I wanted my room to let to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body elſe."</p>
               <p>"Did you tell the poor dying creature ſo?" ſaid Reuben, in a tone expreſſive at once of anger and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration; "did you tell her ſo?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I did," ſaid Jael; "for you knows ſelf-preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ervation is the firſt law in nature, and 'tis but right one ſhould chriſten their own child firſt. So madam got up, and with her child in her hand crawled down ſtairs; and when ſhe got into the kitchen, ſhe fainted away. So ſquire Dudley was in the next room, and he heard the buſtle in the kitchen, and came out to axe what was the matter; ſo when I told him, he threw me the money ſhe owed me; but he called me a very bad name. Then he got two men to carry the ſick body to his own lodging in an arm chair, an there he had her tended and doctored; but that did no good, for ſhe died. An there he took the child, and had it put out to nurſe, though every body ſaid he ought to
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:034490_0275_0FFF220B0629DD98"/>
be aſhamed of himſelf for doing any thing for ſuch a ſort of woman."</p>
               <p>"Oh my father! my father!" exclaimed Reuben, "ought not thy ſon to exult that thy character was ſuch, that even the aſperſions of thy enemies are thy higheſt praiſe?—And where is the poor child?" ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to the woman.</p>
               <p>"Dead; for ater the ſquire went away, Jacob Holmes would not pay for its being nurſed; and who can blame him? There had been enough of his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt waſted already."</p>
               <p>"I tell thee, woman," ſaid Reuben, "Jacob Holmes never had any property whatever but what he enjoyed from the beneficence of my father."</p>
               <p>"I expect that ſtory won't do you much good here," ſaid Jael; "but howſoever, you axed about the child, an ſo as I was ſaying, it went to the poor-houſe, and there it died."</p>
               <p>As Jael finiſhed this hiſtory, ſhe took the diſh and plate from the table, and left the room, and Reuben ſhortly after retired to bed, but not to reſt. To find his father's memory traduced, to find Jacob Holmes in actual poſſeſſion of his eſtate, and believed univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally the lawful owner of it, was a ſhock he had never dreamed of receiving, and knew not how to ſupport.</p>
               <p>As he had imagined he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hould, without the leaſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, take immediate poſſeſſion of the effects his father had left in Holmes's care, and as he knew there muſt be conſiderable money in his hands, ariſing from the ſale of merchandize with which he had been entruſted, our hero had taken but a very ſmall ſum of money with him from England. Indeed his finances in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral were in ſo confined a ſtate, that he could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a ſum of any conſequence. It was therefore no ſmall addition to his uneaſy ſenſations, that he was in a ſtrange land, with very little money, and without a ſingle friend. However, he determined the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to viſit Jacob Holmes; for, ſtill unwilling to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve human nature could be guilty of ſuch depravity, or that a man, adding diſhoneſty to ingratitude, would return the benevolence of the father by wronging the
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:034490_0276_0FFF220D610B9840"/>
ſon, he indulged a feeble hope, that his reception would be better than from what he had heard he had a right to expect.</p>
               <p>After a reſtleſs and perturbated night, he aroſe with the earlieſt dawn, and having inquired for a horſe, was preparing to viſit Jacob, when, as he went to the door with the deſign of mounting, he ſaw the identical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he was going in ſearch of juſt alighting. Spite of the intelligence he had received from Jael, Reuben's heart warmed with affection, when he beheld a perſon who had been ſo dear to his father, and who had borne himſelf and ſiſter in his arms a thouſand times. He darted forward, and took his hand. "Jacob," ſaid he, in a tone of fraternal tenderneſs, "Jacob, how are you?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I thank thee, young man," replied Jacob, coldly withdrawing his hand, and ſtalking with up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right formality into the houſe.</p>
               <p>Though chilled by his frigid manner, Reuben felt his heart contract, yet he followed him into the parlour, and laying his hand upon his ſhoulder, cried, "Don't you know me, Jacob?"</p>
               <p>"No, really, young man, thou haſt greatly the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of me; I do not recollect ever to have ſeen thee before."</p>
               <p>Nearly ſix years had elapſed ſince Jacob had left England, and a period of that length might naturally be ſuppoſed to make a material alteration in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a youth, whom it had transformed, as it paſt, from a cheerful, blooming boy, to the graceful, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed man. But ſtill there was ſufficient in his manner, voice and features, to inform Jacob Holmes, at one glance, who it was addreſſed him. But Jacob had found a ſhort memory very uſeful on many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and was determined to try its efficacy on this; and therefore boldly aſſerted he had never, to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, ſeen Reuben before.</p>
               <p>"Look at me again, friend Jacob," ſaid our hero, "you ſurely cannot totally forget the face of Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben Dudley, the ſon of your friend, Mr. Dudley, of Lancaſhire."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="unknown:034490_0277_0FFF2210022F8260"/>
"I do remember thee now," ſaid Jacob; "but how is it, young man, that I ſee thee in the garb of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of vanity? thy father wore it not."</p>
               <p>Reuben was now ſtruck by obſerving the very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and primitive appearance of Jacob. "I hope I am not the leſs pious," ſaid Reuben with a ſmile, "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my coat is not cut in the ſame faſhion as thine, or my hat quite ſo large. I am come to inquire after my father's effects, and to releaſe you from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you have ſo long had, of attending to concerns which may interfere with your own buſineſs and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits."</p>
               <p>"Thou art welcome to Philadelphia, friend Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben," ſaid Jacob, aſſuming ſome ſmall degree of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diality; "I ſhall be ready to give an account of my ſtewardſhip whenever thou ſhalt demand it. In the mean time, go home with me, and ſojourn till thou canſt ſuit thyſelf better. I am going acroſs the river on ſome little matter of buſineſs; when I return, we will go together to my houſe."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" ſaid Reuben, after Jacob had left him, "I fear this man has a diſhoneſt heart; but I will not judge too haſtily."</p>
               <p>Towards evening, Jacob returned, and with our hero proceeded to the houſe of Mr. Dudley, which he now claimed as his own. It was ſituated on the declivity of a hill, that, riſing gradually behind it, ſheltered it from the wintry blaſts, and whoſe ſides were covered with a variegated wood; the ſpreading pine, the cedar, the wild walnut, the hiccory, the birch, the oak, were intermingled, and beautifully diverſified the foliage, whilſt here and there the parſimon tree diſplayed its tempting but deceitful fruit, which, like the frivolous pleaſures of the world, are lovely to the eye when viewed at a diſtance; but when taſted, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint the expectation, and its harſh acidity is reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with diſguſt. Here too, in native beauty, bloomed the laureſtinus, and here innumerable wild flowering ſhrubs, gave richneſs and faſcination to the ſcene, whilſt the mild ſouth-weſt breeze wafted their delicious odours to the ſenſes, refreſhing and invigorating na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:034490_0278_0FFF22140566B890"/>
From the front of the manſion, the green banks ſloped gently to the margin of the Schuylkill, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the advantages of cultivation. Here were fields of ripened grain; here were paſtures, where the ſheep and cattle repoſed in ſafety, and feaſted on lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriant verdure. To a mind ſo pure, ſo every way formed to conceive and enjoy the beauties of nature as was that of our hero, the ſcene was enchanting; he rode on, wrapt in contemplation and delight. At length perceiving the houſe, which juſt peeped from between the ſurrounding trees, he aſked, "Is that my father's houſe?"</p>
               <p>"That is my houſe," ſaid Jacob.</p>
               <p>"And how far from hence is my father's place?"</p>
               <p>"This is the place he deſigned to purchaſe."</p>
               <p>"Deſigned?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, but he went away before he concluded the bargain, and I have ſince made it mine."</p>
               <p>They had now reached the houſe, entered a large gate and diſmounted, when Jacob, with affected ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity and humility, welcomed Reuben to his home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dwelling, and preſented him to his wife Dinah, a pretty Quaker, whoſe heart was naturally good, but whoſe underſtanding was ſcarcely above mediocrity, and had been cramped by prejudice, and whoſe knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the world extended not beyond her own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate family concerns. She loved Jacob ſincerely; he was in her eyes the firſt of human beings; and when ſhe preſented her hand to welcome Reuben, it was with an air of friendly cordiality; for he was the friend of her huſband ſhe thought, and as ſuch, claimed the firſt place in her eſteem, and was entitled to every mark of reſpect and attention. She was more than commonly careful that her ſupper ſhould be good in its kind, and ſerved with neatneſs. A chamber was prepared for him by her orders, and thither he retired at an early hour, to reflect on his own uncomfortable ſituation, and lament the ingratitude and diſhoneſty of Jacob Holmes.</p>

               <head>Settlement of Accounts—A Campaign.</head>
               <p>THE next morning after breakfaſt, Reuben re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to ſee a ſtatement of his accounts, that he might be a judge of what he ought to do; but Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob told him he expected his wife's father the enſuing day, and as he had been confidentially entruſted with the mutual concerns between Mr. Dudley and himſelf, he thought he would be a proper perſon to be preſent at the final adjuſtment of their accounts.</p>
               <p>To this delay Reuben with reluctance conſented, and the day paſſed on heavily enough; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the novelty, beauty and variety of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding objects, his mind was too much occupied in reflections on his own forlorn ſituation, and from thence reverted to the inconveniencies and misfortunes to which his beloved ſiſter might be ſubject, ſhould he be detained from England, and by the fraud of Jacob Holmes rendered incapable of remitting her any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>On the following morning, Jacob's father-in-law ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and he, with great formality bringing out a heap of papers, began to read over to our hero long accounts of money paid.</p>
               <p>"And pray," ſaid Reuben, "where is the account of the ſales of the merchandize from whence this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey aroſe? My father left very conſiderable property in your hands, and I have every reaſon to imagine the eſtate he purchaſed here was entirely paid for, as he drew large ſums from his agent in England for that purpoſe."</p>
               <p>"Thou canſt not prove what thou doſt aſſert," ſaid Jacob, with a look of malignant ſatiſfaction; "and I believe thou wilt find it difficult to diſpoſſeſs me of an eſtate, the title deeds of which are all made out in my name; and to prove my right thereto, I have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts given to me for various ſums of money, paid by me at different times, till the whole was paid for."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="unknown:034490_0280_0FFF22171E9335A0"/>
"But tell me," ſaid Reuben, "whoſe property was the money with which you made theſe payments? Was it not my father's."</p>
               <p>Reuben fixed his penetrating eyes on the face of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, as he made this interrogation, whoſe eye fell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the ſcrutinizing glance; he dared not meet the honeſt look; his cheek turned pale, his lips trembled, and his tongue faltered, as ſtooping, with a pretence of replacing ſome papers in a box, but in reality to hide emotions he could not ſuppreſs, he replied, that the money was his own.</p>
               <p>"Oh Jacob!" ſaid Reuben, "how canſt thou aſſert ſuch a falſehood? Does not thy heart ſmite thee whilſt thou art thus deliberately planning to rob the orphans of their juſt due?" His heart ſwelled; he could not proceed.</p>
               <p>Friend Simcox, the father-in-law of Jacob, took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to anſwer:</p>
               <p>"It was thy father, young man, who endeavoured to wrong the orphan of his juſt due; it is thou haſt occaſion to bluſh for his evil deeds. This worthy young man has improved the trifle of property Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben Dudley left behind him, and all demands againſt him diſcharged, there remains a ſum amounting to about fifty or ſixty guineas, which Jacob is ready to pay whenever thou ſhalt demand it; and I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe thee to return home in the firſt ſhip that goes."</p>
               <p>A converſation now enſued, which convinced our hero that he had little hope of ever obtaining his right; for was he even to apply to the law, money would be wanting to proſecute his ſuit, or to prove his right to the eſtate, which was called Mount Pleaſant. Mr. Dudley had with him, at the time he was loſt, all the original papers neceſſary to be produced, the dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of which were in the hands of Jacob. That all the papers were irrecoverably loſt, Reuben had inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this unworthy ſteward of by letter, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fatal cataſtrophe.</p>
               <p>There was another circumſtance, which militated much againſt him, and with which he was not inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till that hour. Mr. Dudley had ever placed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded

confidence in Jacob Holmes; he was a man of eaſy diſpoſition, fond of agriculture, and ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits as might ultimately tend to benefit the country of which he was about to become an inhabitant, and to render his new purchaſe at once beautiful and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eficial. He had therefore, after having ſurveyed the land, and had one converſation with the perſon of whom he was about to purchaſe it, entruſted the whole management of the buſineſs to Jacob. The whole of the payment not having been made before he left Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adelphia, he had never had the deeds properly execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the news of his being drowned arriving before they were completed, Jacob conceived the idea of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them filled up in his own name. He had, from their firſt arrival in Philadelphia, been artfully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the reputation of his benefactor, by repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf as a youth of fortune entruſted to his guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianſhip; and whenever he made a payment, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways gave the perſon to underſtand that it was his own money that he was advancing to ſerve his friend Dudley. This idea having been artfully propagated, and univerſally credited, and Mr. Dudley and himſelf being equally ſtrangers in the place, Jacob found no difficulty in procuring the eſtate to be ſecured to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He found it much more difficult to ſilence the admonitions of his conſcience. But the heart natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ungrateful, by eaſy gradations may be habituated to admit, and even approve, every other vice. Grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude is the foundation and ſource of all the moral vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. For if we receive the many great and good gifts of our beneficent Creator without a grateful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, we no longer love him; and whom we do not love, we become indifferent, whether we obey or ſerve.</p>
               <p>Jacob ſtifled the remonſtrances of conſcience; and even when he ſaw our hero, could he have done it without fear of the law, would ſcarcely have heſitated to give him a quick paſſport from this to a better world.</p>
               <p>The accounts adjuſted according to the plan Jacob had concerted, and which old friend Simcox never
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:034490_0282_0FFF0CE44B3308F0"/>
ſcrutinized, becauſe he wiſhed not to be undeceived, the paltry ſum of fifty-ſeven guineas was offered to our hero, for which he was requeſted to give a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral acquittal of all demands whatever, on the perſon or property of Jacob Holmes.</p>
               <p>When this money and this curious acquittal were preſented to Reuben, the one for his acceptance, the other for his ſignature, his indignation aroſe beyond the bounds within which, he had endeavoured to confine it. He roſe from his feat, puſhing, with an indignant motion, the proffered money from him.</p>
               <p>"Add not inſult to injury," ſaid he, "Jacob Holmes; I would recapitulate who and what you are; but there are ſeveral forcible reaſons that oblige me to ſilence. And firſt—You, Jacob, are not anſwerable for the faults of thoſe, whoſe memories the grave has conſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eternal oblivion; nor dare I ſpeak of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for well I know he who conferred them, ever made it a rule to fix the ſeal of ſilence on his own good deeds, and the faults of his fellow-creatures. As to taking the money you offer and ſigning this acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, they are alike repugnant to my feelings. I have no demand on your property, Jacob; I aſk but for my own; the property of my late dear father is mine and my ſiſter's. For myſelf, I value it not. I am young, unencumbered, have hands to labour, or an arm to ſight. I cannot want bread. But my ſiſter, lovely, innocent, unacquainted with the world, muſt ſhe be dependent? Muſt ſhe court the ſmiles of that world? Muſt ſhe ſubmit to the contumely of the haughty, the ſlights of the unfeeling, or the more humiliating pity of affected ſenſibility, and in return procure the ſcanty means of bare exiſtence? No! I cannot tamely give up her right, however I might relinquiſh my own. I do aſſert, Jacob Holmes, and you, friend Simcox, bear witneſs to the aſſertion, that this eſtate, this houſe, this land, the ſtock and all appertaining to it, is the joint property of myſelf and ſiſter Rachel, inherited from our father, Reuben Dudley; nor will I relinquiſh the claim whilſt I have exiſtence."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="unknown:034490_0283_0FFF221F53DD0D70"/>
He took his hat, and walked towards the door; then turning, he added—</p>
               <p>"Jacob, poor as thou haſt, by thy diſhoneſty, made me, I pity thee. Yes, Jacob Holmes, I pity thee. Thou haſt reduced me to poverty, and thyſelf to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery."</p>
               <p>Dinah, Jacob's wife, had overheard the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not at firſt intentionally, but paſſing through the parlour that adjoined the room in which they were, and catching a word that awakened her curioſity, ſtopped. Curioſity, when once awakened, is hard to be repelled, at leaſt in women, ſay the oppoſite ſex. Whether we are more troubled with the impulſe than our fathers, brothers, or huſbands, I will not now diſpute; it is a certainty Dinah ſtopped to liſten to a converſation which had powerfully excited her's.</p>
               <p>It has been remarked, that Dinah's underſtanding was not of the moſt brilliant kind; but ſhe poſſeſſed that plain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> natural ſenſe which enabled her to have a full and clear perception of right and wrong. Her wiſhes were moderate, her wants few. She was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſtranger to avarice, luxury and ambition. She liſtened to the accuſation of Reuben, and all that ſhe poſſeſſed of ſenſibility was awakened; not that ſhe ſeared to be deprived of part of the comforts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies ſhe at preſent enjoyed; but the man whom ſhe thought the firſt and beſt of all God's creatures, had been accuſed of fraud; if innocently, her indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation would fall on his accuſer; if juſtly, then Jacob Holmes was no longer the perfect being ſhe had ever believed him; and if guilty of diſhoneſty, Dinah felt ſhe could no longer reſpect him. Yet ſhe was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to believe aught to his prejudice; ſhe therefore approached our hero as he left the apartment.</p>
               <p>"Thou muſt not leave us in anger, Reuben Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley," ſaid ſhe, laying her hand on his arm as he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to paſs her; "if Jacob has done thee wrong, I dare affirm it was not wilfully; and if thou canſt make it appear, he will make thee ample reſtitution."</p>
               <p>"Do not detain me, madam," ſaid he, gently free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf from her hold; "I am in haſte to depart;
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:034490_0284_0FFF2220E1816480"/>
but I part not in diſpleaſure with you. God bleſs you, and make you as happy as you are innocent." Then kiſſing the child, which ſhe held in her arms, he went haſtily to the ſtable; ſaddled his horſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any oppoſition, mounted and proceeded to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia.</p>
               <p>Dinah entered the room where her father and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band were ſitting. "Good Jacob," ſaid ſhe, "let not the young man leave us in anger. I do remember his father; I have heard him ſpeak of thee with affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as though thou hadſt been his own child. I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe he did love thee, Jacob; for his ſake, let me call back the young man."</p>
               <p>"No," cried Jacob, with a ſtern look, "ſtay where you are (for ſhe was about to quit the room); the youth has behaved unſeemly, refuſes the money which I have tendered him; and lays claim to my whole eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate."</p>
               <p>"And art thou ſure, quite ſure, Jacob Holmes," ſaid ſhe, and her countenance expreſſed fear and doubt, "art thou quite ſure that he has no lawful claim upon thy property? In good truth, I thought he ſpoke as though he were aſſured of his right."</p>
               <p>"Dinah," ſaid Jacob, "thou art a good woman; thou doſt underſtand thy houſehold concerns; they are ſufficient for the extent of thy capacity. I pray thee, Dinah, trouble not thyſelf with what is beyond thy comprehenſion. Thou art a ſtranger to the world, totally unacquainted with the arts and decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with which it abounds."</p>
               <p>"Verily thou ſayeſt right," ſhe replied mildly, "but as I could not aſſert a falſehood without heſitating, nor claim what was the right of another, without bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I judged by the firm voice and unembarraſſed manner of the young man."</p>
               <p>"If thou didſt judge of him by thyſelf, Dinah," ſaid her father, "thou didſt wrong."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps ſo, father; I am ſimple, and uninſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But I hope I am not equally wrong in judging of my huſband's heart by my own; for I think, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob," continued ſhe, and ſhe laid her hand affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:034490_0285_0FFF222377D3BF80"/>
on his arm, "I think I would rather be poor and honeſt, than rich at the coſt of another; wouldſt not thou, Jacob?"</p>
               <p>Jacob could not reply, nor even lift his eyes to the face of his wife; he rather unkindly ſhook off the hand ſhe had laid on his arm, and the child juſt then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to cry, he bade her take away the noiſy boy, for it diſturbed him. Dinah obeyed in ſilence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to a diſtant apartment, and as the infant drew from her boſom life's nouriſhing fluid, ſhe hung fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over him and wept.</p>
               <p>Our hero in the mean time returned to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. His mind was haraſſed, his ſpirits depreſſed; he endeavoured to compoſe himſelf, and to form ſome plan for his future conduct; but, inexperienced as he was, he wanted a friend to adviſe and direct him. "To-morrow," ſaid he, "I will deliver the letters I brought with me."</p>
               <p>Reuben was elegant in his appearance, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly plain in his dreſs; but there was an air of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, not pride or ſelf-conſequence; it was that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive dignity of manner, which is ever inſpired by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious rectitude of heart and unimpeached integrity. His perſon was ſtriking, and what would in general be termed handſome. It will naturally be ſuppoſed he was therefore received with politeneſs, and would have prepoſſeſſed almoſt every one in his favour, but that almoſt all whom he converſed with were prejudiced perſons, who conceived that Jacob Holmes's intereſt had been much injured by the extravagance and folly of his father.</p>
               <p>From ſeveral to whom he delivered letters, (which letters were nothing more than a ſimple annunciation of his name and family) he received invitations to their houſes; but when his circumſtances began to be ſuſpected, and indeed the openneſs of his diſpoſition led him rather to expoſe than endeavour to conceal them; when it was diſcovered he wanted friends who would be farther ſerviceable than merely giving him a dinner, or a bed for a few nights; he found, by their diſtant, frigid manner, that he was no longer
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:034490_0286_0FFF22275AE2D000"/>
welcome, that he was thought an intruder. His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent ſpirit took fire; he no longer viſited, he ſhut himſelf in his apartment, lived ſparingly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved a thouſand different plans by which he hoped to immerge from obſcurity, and reſcue from oblivion the name of Dudley. He had applied to ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the law to give him advice and aſſiſtance for the recovery of his right; but his poverty was known to be certain, his claims were ſuppoſed very doubtful; no one would undertake the cauſe.</p>
               <p>Can any ſituation be more diſtreſſing, than that of a young man, of brilliant underſtanding, aſpiring ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, laudable ambition and uncorrupted heart, thus deprived of every means of improving his fortune, or exerting his talents, in ſuch a manner as might at once be advantageous to himſelf and ſociety in gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al? In a large and flouriſhing town, without a friend, without even an aſſociate towards whom he felt the ſmalleſt degree of affection, how forlorn, how totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of comfort were his days! A ſolitary individual, who looked on the ſurrounding multitude, whom buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or pleaſure had drawn together, and ſaw not one with whom the feelings of his ſoul could claim kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, not one who conceived or commiſerated his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or, ſhould ſickneſs overtake him, would feel intereſted for his recovery, or drop a tear of regret over his bier, ſhould it pleaſe Heaven to put a period to his exiſtence.</p>
               <p>Depreſſed by his own ſituation, and tortured by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on what might poſſibly be the diſtreſſes of his ſiſter, Reuben had not courage even to write to her. "Why ſhould I torment her," he would ſay, "by an account of my ill ſucceſs? Why write, when I have not one comfortable idea to tranſmit? No, I will ſuffer her to ſuppoſe I am no more; my ſilence will lead her to imagine I have paid the debt of nature. She will grieve, but time will ſoothe and leſſen her affliction, which even at the firſt will not be half ſo poignant, as the knowledge of my exiſting in a ſtate of obſcurity, without money, without credit, without friends would occaſion."</p>

Jeſſy Oliver too, would ſometimes intrude on his thoughts; but he endeavoured to baniſh hopes, which, ſpite of reaſon, would often ariſe.

               <p>Rachel and Jeſſy were the objects of his dreams. Sometimes he ſaw his ſiſter on the brink of a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, from the edge of which a horrid ſpectre ſtrove to precipitate her, when, as ſhe fell, Jeſſy appeared with arms extended to catch and ſave her from plunging into the dreadful abyſs that yawned beneath.

Then in a moment he ſaw the fair form of Jeſſy leading his fainting ſiſter up the beach, when, as they ſtrove to avoid the encroaching tide, their feet would ſlip, and ſucceeding waves again immerſe them in the foaming flood; and then again an inſtantaneous change (for the viſions of ſleep are wild and unconnected) would repreſent thoſe dear ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his fondeſt ſolicitude ſeated in an arbour of evergreens, twined round with myrtle flowers and roſes.

ſuddenly ſome new terror would ariſe; he ſtarted, awoke, and all the faſcinating viſion fled. Sleep thus agitated and diſturbed afforded but little refreſhment, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> a few weeks our hero was but the ſhadow of his former ſelf.</p>
               <p>About this period the natives, who had been driven back into the Allegany Mountains, and who had pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their habitation, in different tribes, upon the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt banks of the Suſquehannah, Allegany and Mohawk rivers, made frequent deſcents into the new ſettled parts of the country, plundering, burning and deſtroying with impunity every European ſettlement within their reach.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of the treachery and rapacity of theſe ſavages, it became neceſſary to ſend a military force to repel them, and guard the lives and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the inoffenſive ſettlers; and Patrick Gordon, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> who at that time governed the colony, propoſed raiſing a volunteer company for this ſervice. Proper officers were accordingly appointed, and the company increaſed daily.</p>
               <p>The noiſe this occaſioned in the city awakened Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben from his lethargy of deſpondency. The native ſpark of ambition, which had ſo long lain dormant; was fanned to a flame, and with the ſanguine ardour ever inſeparable from youth, vainly imagining to deſerve was to inſure preferment, he offered himſelf to the Governor, and was accepted.</p>
               <p>His candour in ſpeaking of himſelf and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; his youth, his manners, his open, unembar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed air, and intelligent, manly countenance, ſpoke volumes in his favour, and procured him the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appointment of ſtandard bearer.</p>
               <p>Early in the ſpring, they began their plan of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and marched towards the margin of the Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quehannah. During the ſpring and ſummer months, they had ſeveral rencounters with the Indians, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in general victorious, they had driven and purſued them a farther diſtance into the country than they imagined, and the weather began to grow cold before they thought of returning. At length the officers
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:034490_0289_0FFF0CF04AEA99F8"/>
having unanimouſly agreed that it would be hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as well as of little uſe, to purſue their retreating foe any farther, preparations were made for their gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good quarters before the inclement ſeaſon ſhould be too far advanced. The main body had began their march, and our hero, (who was now promoted to the rank of lieutenant) with a ſmall party, was left to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the next morning with the baggage.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the party of which Reuben was ſecond in command, was an Iriſh youth, who particularly attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to our hero. O'Neil was ignorant, but hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Like an unpoliſhed diamond, his outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was uncouth and rough; but within was a jewel of ineſtimable price. Simplicity, integrity and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity were the characteriſtics of his ſoul. This young man was ſo pointed in his attentions to our hero, that it could not paſs unnoticed. One day, when he had been voluntarily performing ſome little menial office, Reuben thus addreſſed him:</p>
               <p>"By what good fortune, O'Neil, is it, that I am ſo particularly favoured with your kind offices?"</p>
               <p>"Arrah, my ſwate maſter," ſaid O'Neil, "by no great matter of good fortune, only that your Honour happened to have a father."</p>
               <p>"Did you know my father, O'Neil?"</p>
               <p>"Och! and did you think I did not know him? Many is the time I havent ſerved him, to be ſure; and while Pat O'Neil lives, he will ſerve any that wears the name of Dudley, for his ſake; aye, by night or by day, fair weather or foul, all's one for that. And did you think now I could ever forget how he paid the money for that ſwate crater, Madam Juliana, and how he had her nurſed, and—"</p>
               <p>It now ſtruck Reuben that he might, through O'Neil, learn ſome further intelligence concerning a circumſtance, which he had often thought of ſince the information he received from Jael, on the firſt day of his arrival; for he naturally ſuppoſed that the Juliana he talked of was the unfortunate woman, whoſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows his father had alleviated. He put ſeveral queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to his humble friend, and gleaned from him a
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:034490_0290_0FFF0CF1D309C398"/>
tale which cannot be better related than in his own ſimple language.</p>
               <p>"It was in dear Ireland," ſaid he, "about fifteen miles from Dublin's ſwate city, that my honoured maſter had a houſe; I would tell you his name, but that I can't, becauſe, you ſee, I promiſed Madam Juliana never to breathe a ſyllable of the matter. She was all the child he had; and he thought ſhe was too good for the ſun to ſhine on, and ſo ſhe was; but ſhe was not quite ſo good neither, that is to ſay, ſhe might a done better than to liſten to a ſpallpeen of a lord that was an Engliſhman, only that he was born in Dublin. So he ſaw her one day when ſhe was riding out, and he ſpoke to her, and rode home with her; and when my maſter ſaw who he was, he turned him out of the houſe, and never aſked him into it; and I heard him tell Madam Juliana at ſupper-time, that he was no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he ſhould be, an if he had ſaid not half ſo good, he would have ſaid more in his favour than he deſerved. I was a boy, pleaſe your Honour, then, and half a guinea tempted me to take a letter and give it to her. Och! The remembrance of that makes my heart ache very often; for if I had not been ſo eaſily perſuaded, my good maſter and my ſwate lady might a been alive and happy together now. So ſhe did not mind what her father ſaid, but wrote to him, and met him; and one evening he brought a chaiſe and four horſes. It was after ſunſet, and the new moon gave but little light; ſo ſhe ſaid, "Patrick, will you walk with me as far as the Mill-Bridge?"</p>
               <p>"Now it was October, and the wind was ſharp. So ſays I, 'It is cold, my lady,' ſays I."</p>
               <p>"A little or ſo," ſaid ſhe, and her voice ſeemed to tremble. "It is a little cold, Patrick, but here is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to keep you warm;" ſo ſhe put a crown piece into my hand. So we went out together, and as I opened the gate, ſhe turned and looked up at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of her father's ſtudy; for there was a big row of trees from the houſe to the gate, and his ſtudy win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows were right oppoſite. So ſhe looked at them,
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:034490_0291_0FFF2231269BCDE8"/>
and lifted up her hands and wrung them, and I heard her ſob."</p>
               <p>"You had better go back, Miſs," ſaid I; but ſhe made me no anſwer, only walked very faſt forward; and when I ſaw the lord and the chaiſe, my mind miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave me, and I ſaid, "Och! Miſs July, what are you going to be after doing?"</p>
               <p>"Do not be frightened, my good lad," ſaid ſhe, "but go back and take this letter to my father."</p>
               <p>"Go back?" ſaid I, "no! no! Pat O'Neil does no ſuch thing; I could not bear to ſee my poor old maſter die of the heart-break, or go crazy for your loſs."</p>
               <p>"But you muſt go back," ſaid the lord.</p>
               <p>"But I won't," ſaid I; "I will follow my miſtreſs to the end of the world, and farther too if needs muſt."</p>
               <p>"Och! your Honour, I cannot tell how I felt when I thought they were going away without me. He had lifted my poor lady in, who ſeemed almoſt dying; ſo I caught hold of her gown, and hung upon the ſtep of the chaiſe, and ſwore never to quit my hold till my hands were cut off."</p>
               <p>"Let him go with us, poor fellow," ſaid my lady.</p>
               <p>"He will betray us," ſaid the lord.</p>
               <p>"No, I will not," ſaid I; "let me go with my miſtreſs, and I will not ſpeak a word to nobody; but I will protect her, fight for her, die for her."</p>
               <p>"Get up behind," ſaid he.</p>
               <p>"I ſprung up in a giffey, and away we went. Well, that night we went aboard a packet, and ſailed away to England, and there a Roman Catholic prieſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them; but the falſe-hearted lord never meant the thing that was right all this while; for in a week or two he grew cool, and at laſt told her he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

So a captain uſed to come with him, and I don't know how they managed; but Madam Juliana was married to him, and I thought the next day ſhe

would have gone diſtracted. She tore her beautiful flaxen hair, and wrung her hands, and cried and ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. So then, in a little while her huſband went away over ſea, and then after Madam lay in, ſhe followed him, and when ſhe came to Philadelphia, he would not own her, and ſhe pined and pined, till at laſt—"</p>
               <p>Here the voice of poor O'Neil failed. His honeſt heart burſt forth at his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Spare yourſelf, Patrick," ſaid Reuben, "for I think I know the reſt."</p>
               <p>"Not quite all, your Honour," ſaid Patrick; "for on the day before ſhe died, your good father, Heaven bleſs him for it, let me ſee her. She was almoſt gone, and ſpoke ſo low, I could ſcarce hear her."</p>
               <p>"Patrick," ſaid ſhe, "I want to thank you for your ſteady attachment to me. I would fain leave you ſomething as a remembrance; but I have nothing left of any value."</p>
               <p>"My dear, ſwate, angel lady," ſaid I, "you will leave me the remembrance of your precious ſelf. I never! no, never! ſhall forget you."</p>
               <p>"I ſent for you," ſaid ſhe, "to tell you, Patrick, that, ſhould you ever ſee my father, he may know from you that I have been puniſhed, juſtly, I own, though very ſeverely, for my diſobedience to the beſt of parents. I leave my child an orphan, in a ſtrange land; but my benefactor has promiſed to take care of it. You, I know, will, to the utmoſt of your power, protect it."</p>
               <p>She fainted before ſhe had finiſhed; they took me out of the room, and I never ſaw her again. Och! your Honour, ſhe is ſurely in heaven; for to die heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken, and in poverty, in a ſtrange land, without any friends—Do you not think ſhe is in heaven? do you not think her ſins were pardoned?"</p>
               <p>"We will hope ſo," ſaid Reuben; "but diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to parents is certainly a deep offence againſt the commandments of our Creator."</p>
               <p>"But ſhe was very penitent," ſaid O'Neil. Reuben was ſilent.</p>
               <p>After this converſation, there ſeemed a kind of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial bond formed between Reuben and the young Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:034490_0293_0FFF22361EB651E8"/>
the latter performing all the offices of a ſervant, the other practiſing all the kindneſs and benevolence of the beſt of maſters. The autumn nights were cold; O'Neil would watch till he ſaw our hero in a ſlumber, then, adding his own blanket to the ſlight covering of Reuben's bed, he would wrap himſelf as well as he could in his great coat, and lie down on the ground beſide him.</p>
               <p>The baggage being placed in order ready for an early march, the ſoldiers and officers were retired to reſt. O'Neil had, as uſual, thrown his blanket over his maſter (as he delighted to call him) and the air being more than uſually ſharp, he found it impoſſible to ſleep. He aroſe, and raking together the dying em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a fire by which they had dreſſed their ſupper, began to re-kindle it. As he was thus employed, he thought he heard a ruſtling amongſt the trees; and turning half round, perceived, by the faint light the fire caſt around, the faces of two Indians peeping from behind a large tree. He gave a loud cry; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians uttered the war whoop; a ſcene of confuſion and horror enſued, and in a few moments part of the little corps were ſlain, the reſt wounded and made priſoners. Amongſt the latter was our hero, and his faithful adherent, Patrick O'Neil.</p>

               <head>Another Viſit to ſavage Habitations.</head>
               <p>THERE had, ſome little time previous to this event, been ſeveral of the Indian chiefs taken priſoners by the Europeans, and it was to this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thoſe, who were taken priſoners by the natives, owed the preſervation of their lives, as the ſavages en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained hopes that by means of theſe they might procure the liberty of their captured brethren.</p>
               <p>Their route lay acroſs the country, and before they had reached their place of deſtination, a very heavy
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:034490_0294_0FFF2237D3671A20"/>
fall of ſnow rendered the woods almoſt impenetrable; but the Indians, inured from their infancy to cold, hunger, every ſpecies of hardſhip, felt little or no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience from the ſeverity of the ſeason, whilſt the Europeans funk under their accumulated ſufferings; and of twelve who were taken priſoners, ſeven died by the way.</p>
               <p>Reuben had been ſlightly wounded, and O'Neil had received a ſcratch, as he called it, in endeavouring to preſerve his maſter, from the tomahawk of an Indian. But Reuben was by nature intrepid, and O'Neil was callous to every calamity that affected only himſelf. They mutually comforted and ſupported each other, and were amongſt the few who ſurvived at the end of their weariſome, pedeſtrian journey.</p>
               <p>The morning after their arrival at the Indian ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the five ſurviving captives were preſented to the ſachem, Wampoogohoon. His wigwam was larger and more commodious than thoſe of his ſubjects. It was well lined with ſkins of various wild beaſts, and on a kind of throne, covered with the ſame materials, ſat the ſachem. At his left hand ſat a woman, whoſe complexion ſpoke her of European deſcent, and behind them ſtood a young female, in appearance about ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteen years old. Her ſkin was a ſhade darker than that of the woman's; her eyes were of that kind of dark grey, which may almoſt be termed blue, and yet, from the ſhade of long black eyelaſhes, may ſometimes be miſtaken for black. Their expreſſion was at once ſoft and animated, and her dark auburn hair, which did not really curl, but hung in waves down her back and over her ſhoulders, was ornamented with a few glaſs beads, and a tuft of ſcarlet feathers, fancifully arranged, and not entirely devoid of taſte. The reſt of her dreſs, though greatly ſimilar to the other wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, had a ſomething of delicacy, in its formation and method of being put on, that was particularly pleaſing to Europeans. Her figure was above the middle ſize, yet not robuſt enough to be thought maſculine, though every feature glowed with ruddy health, every limb diſplayed the ſtrength and firmneſs of her frame.
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:034490_0295_0FFF223AE2D4D308"/>
She ſtood with her right hand leaning on the ſachem's ſhoulder, in her left ſhe held an unbraced bow, and a quiver full of arrows was ſlung acroſs her back.</p>
               <p>Wampoogohoon received the captives with a kind of ſullen dignity. He ſpoke to them in very bad En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, but they underſtood ſufficient to comprehend that he mean to detain them till the captured Indians were returned in ſafety.</p>
               <p>During the time he was ſpeaking, Reuben looked attentively at the two women, who from their places, and the univerſal reſpect paid them, he concluded were the wife and daughter of the chief. The penſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs manifeſt in the countenance of the elder, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and majeſty of the younger, awakened in his boſom a wiſh to be acquainted with their ſtory; for he was certain they were of European extraction, though of what nation he could not determine, as they had neither of them ſpoke.</p>
               <p>At length, when the conference was ended, and the ſachem waved his hand for them to depart, his wife aroſe, and ſpoke to him in the Mohawk tongue. Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben perceived, from the ſoft tone of her voice and her earneſt manner, that it was a ſupplication. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, but not with the gentleſt accent; ſhe laid her hand on his arm, and repeated her requeſt, in which ſhe was joined by Eumea, his daughter. He looked irreſolute for a moment, then ſeeming to acquieſce in their demands, aroſe from his ſeat, and taking his bow and arrows, was followed by his attendants out of the wigwam.</p>
               <p>The two intereſting females now came forward, and the eldeſt, whoſe name was Victoire, addreſſed our hero in very tolerable French:</p>
               <p>"Stranger, I am ſorry for your captivity, though my ſituation amongſt theſe Indians makes me appear your enemy. Yourſelf and companions are no doubt ſurpriſed, to ſee a perſon of my complexion ſo inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately connected with one of theirs; my ſtory may be told in a few words. My mother, a native of France, being of a proteſtant family, and apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſecution, emigrated to this new-found world,
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:034490_0296_0FFF223E16157CF8"/>
in company with her huſband, a man of ſtrict piety and principles. Their portion of worldly goods was not large; they purchaſed a wild, uncultivated ſpot upon the borders of the Allegany, and by five years of indefatigable labour, rendered their little hut and ſurrounding garden, together with one field, tolerably comfortable; but juſt when they began to taſte ſome ſmall degree of happineſs, which would ſcarcely have deſerved the name, but by being contraſted with the exceſs of hardſhip they had endured in clearing and rendering their little demeſne fit for cultivation; then, at the moment when they hoped to reap the reward of their labours, a party of Mohawks came down upon them, rifled and deſtroyed their dwelling, murdered my father and two little brothers, and carried my wretched mother and myſelf, then only a year old, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captivity."</p>
               <p>Victoire pauſed; ſhe ſeemed affected; a tear gliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened in the expreſſive eyes of Eumea. At length the former proceeded:—</p>
               <p>"My mother was a convincing proof of the exceſs of miſery the human mind can ſuffer; ſhe ſurvived the loſs of a huſband tenderly beloved, and two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. I was her comfort, her ſtay, which held her to this world; for my ſake ſhe bore captivity without murmuring, for my ſake ſhe wiſhed and ſtrove to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her exiſtence; ſhe lived till I was fourteen years old, and gave me every inſtruction which memory fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, for ſhe had no aſſiſtance from books. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled into my young mind a knowledge and love of a ſupreme, benignant Being, and taught me to place my whole dependence on him, whoſe goodneſs was equal to his power.</p>
               <p>"Wampoogohoon was the youngeſt ſon of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem, who at that time governed this tribe; he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me his protection. My mother, in a dying ſtate, rather than leave me expoſed to inſult, adviſed me to accede to his propoſal, and I became his wife. His father and brothers are ſince dead, and you behold him a chief of the Mohawks. He is not unkind to me, and as the father of my children, I feel an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:034490_0297_0FFF223FEB2ABC48"/>
for him. Eumea is the only ſurviving child I have of ſix; for her ſake, I wiſh for ſome intercourſe with the Europeans, that her mind, which is not a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ſoil, may receive the culture of education. To this end, I have requeſted my huſband to permit you to have a wigwam to yourſelves, where you may dwell in quiet, till we hear of the ſafety of thoſe Indians who have been detained by your party. In return, I only requeſt you to exert your abilities to inſtruct, in your language, cuſtoms, manners and religion, my child Eumea."</p>
               <p>Saying this, ſhe preſented the Indian maid to Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben, who aſſured Victoire he would do all in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to return the obligation ſhe had conferred.</p>
               <p>He was then, with his companions, ſhewn to a hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation that wore a trifling appearance of comfort; in it were three or four bear ſkins, a quantity of clean dry ſtraw, ſome dried fiſh, veniſon and maize, and without was plenty of fuel.</p>
               <p>Here our hero indulged himſelf in reflection; and often would his thoughts revert to his grandfather, William Dudley, who was for many years in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſomewhat ſimilar. But Reuben had ſeen too much of ſavage men and manners to have a wiſh to remain amongſt them, even though he might have been ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to the higheſt ſeat of dignity.</p>
               <p>It was at once a comfort and amuſement to Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben, that he was obliged, for ſeveral hours every day, to employ his mind, in order to cultivate that of his pupil Eumea. He contrived, by boiling the ſhumak berries, to make a liquid with which he could write on white birch bark. In this manner, he made an alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, which ſhe preſently learnt; and ſeeming to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in attending to his inſtructions, he experienced a double ſatisfaction in endeavouring to expand and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her underſtanding. She was ſoon able to read ſhort ſentences, which he compoſed for her; his hand being generally employed, and his mind often totally occupied in ſtriving to recollect what might be of the moſt ſervice to his lovely ſcholar, he had little time for reflection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="unknown:034490_0298_0FFF2241A07C6030"/>
O'Neil laboured inceſſantly to keep their dwelling warm and tight; and ſometimes he went out with his gun, and brought home ſome kind of game which ſerved to diverſify their ſcanty repaſts; and often Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toire would accompany her daughter to their wigwam, and on thoſe occaſions generally carried ſomething which they thought a delicacy, ſuch as noa-cake, omanny, or ſuccataſh, viands compoſed of maize and dried beans; and thus wore away a very long and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſely ſevere winter. Reuben had been a priſoner above ſix months, and yet no news had arrived that could raiſe his hopes of ſpeedy liberation; and we must leave him amongſt theſe children of nature, and return to our heroine, whom we left married to Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Auberry, but living in the vicinity of Mary-le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, under the aſſumed name of Dacres.</p>

               <p>IT has been already remarked, that Rachel had as little curioſity in her compoſition as any woman exiſting: ſhe was alſo by nature of a retired, quiet turn of mind, though eaſily led into ſcenes of diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which, as ſhe generally mixed to gratify oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſhe took but little ſatisfaction. She therefore ſpent the chief of her time at home, either employed at her needle, or reading. Hamden was fond of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic; he had procured her a ſpinnet and a maſter. She had a conſiderable taſte for drawing; Hamden was a proficient in the art; he directed and improved her judgment; pointed out proper ſubjects for the exerciſe of her genius, and with her book, her pencil, her nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, muſic, and ſome few domeſtic concerns, ſhe ſo ſweetly diverſified her time, that not one moment hung heavy on her hands. Indeed, Rachel had, from her childhood, been taught that moſt uſeful, and to thoſe who practiſe it, that moſt pleaſant of all leſſons,
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:034490_0299_0FFF224673CBC018"/>
conſtant employment; that it is better to be engaged in trifling purſuits (if innocent) than ſuffer the mind to ſink into inanity for want of exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Hamden remained in London about a month or ſix weeks after their marriage. He then left her to return to his aunt, who was ſtill in Scotland; and at the time he bade his dear Rachel adieu, he purpoſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to her within the ſpace of two months.</p>
               <p>After the departure of her huſband, our heroine continued the ſame regular courſe of life. But calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who has a hundred ears, a thouſand eyes, and ten thouſand tongues, not one of which is ever ſuffered to ſlumber for an inſtant, could not permit her to enjoy her favourite and inoffenſive employment unmoleſted.</p>
               <p>Though Rachel had imagined that the uniform ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of her conduct was ſuch, as might defy even the prying eyes of malice and envy, yet ſhe felt there was ſomething wrong in her appearance. She went by an aſſumed name; yet, confident that ſhe was in reality the wife of Auberry, ſhe alſo felt that though ſhe had tranſgreſſed the bounds of prudence, ſhe had ſtrictly adhered to the rules of virtue and morality; and this internal aſſurance gave her great comfort. And when retiring for the night, ſhe would reflect that her heart was in univerſal charity with all her fellow-creatures, that her purſuits were altogether harmleſs, and in ſome degree laudable; a ſweet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity would diffuſe itſelf through her boſom, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up her prayers for the ſafety of her beloved Reuben, and her almoſt adored huſband, ſhe would ſink into a ſlumber, as compoſed and refreſhing as her own mind was pure and uncontaminated.</p>
               <p>The heart that is itſelf a ſtranger to guilt ſuſpects it not in another. Such was the heart of Rachel; without enthuſiaſm pious, without oſtentation charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and innately virtuous, without an idea that there was any particular merit in being ſo; ſince, without being inſenſible to the inevitable miſery that muſt and ever will follow the forfeiture of that ineſtimable jewel, chaſtity, ſhe wondered how ſo many heedleſs women fell into an error ſo repugnant to her own feelings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="unknown:034490_0300_0FFF2248020E90C8"/>
As Major Auberry was certain he could not remain long with his wife, when he ſecured her a handſome and convenient place of reſidence, he was not forgetful of the pleaſure that would naturally reſult from a companion of her own ſex being under the ſame roof with her. In his ſearch after lodgings or a ready furniſhed houſe, chance directed him to Mrs. Varnice, the widow of an attorney, whoſe pride would not ſuffer her to leave the houſe her huſband had engaged but a ſhort time before his death, and who would, to ſupport that pride, (the real origin of which was meanneſs, not real dignity of ſoul) ſubmit to any thing but labour.</p>
               <p>At the time Major Auberry applied for the upper part of her houſe, ſhe knew him, and that his name was not Dacres. "But he will pay me well," ſaid ſhe mentally; ſo ſhe concealed her knowledge, and agreed to our heroine's becoming the miſtreſs of the apartments.</p>
               <p>When Rachel was firſt introduced to her, ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved her lovely, majeſtic form, and ſweetly intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing countenance. Mrs. Varnice was ſhort, rather too much <hi>em bon point,</hi> dark complexioned, and on the wrong ſide of forty; but her eyes, which were of jetty hue, and whoſe brilliancy ſhe endeavoured to increaſe by an artful tinge of rouge on her high cheek-bones, were animated and expreſſive, and ſhe was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope that ſome future conqueſt might ſecure to her a ſecond matrimonial eſtabliſhment. To ſuch a wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, the firſt appearance of our heroine was by no means prepoſſeſſing.</p>
               <p>"She is certainly handſome (ſaid ſhe, on the day Rachel took poſſeſſion of her new lodgings) ſhe is handſome, I muſt own; but your pretty women have ſeldom much to recommend them beſides their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty." This remark was made to a poor relation, who was dependent on Mrs. Varnice for bread; an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate being, who, from want of education, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme poverty, poſſeſſed a mind as abject as her cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
               <p>Education, ſpirit of light, being of the firſt order, who in thy right hand doſt hold a magic mirror, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:034490_0301_0FFF224A581CBEA8"/>
playing to the aſtoniſhed ſenſe of youth the wondrous, faſcinating charms of nature; who, ſtill receding as we purſue, yet ſtill diſplaying ſomething ſtrange and charming, inviteſt the admiring pupil ſtill to follow; whoſe left hand holds a tablet, on which is written all that was learnt from thy inſtructive mirror; who as thou paſſeſt, giving place to age, who hangs his head and droops that thou canſt charm no more, preſenteſt the tablets, whence fond memory gleans ſomething to cheer the laſt cold eve of life, and being tranſmitted to the riſing age, incite them to attend thy earlieſt call, follow thee through thy moſt intricate labyrinths, that, as thou doſt aſcend the hill of fame, holding before them ſtill the inſtructive glaſs, each riſing age may take a higher ſtep, till frail humanity ſtands on thy ſummit:—Education, thou firſt, beſt gift that mortals can receive; thoſe who know thee not, conceiving not thy intrinſic value, ſlight thee, condemn thee, treat thee with contempt; but they who feel thy influence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignant power, will revere thee, worſhip thee, and court thy ſmiles, humbly entreating that the riſing age might fully comprehend and taſte thy beauties.</p>
               <p>Rachel had received a good, though not a brilliant education; her mind was therefore free from preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. Mrs. Varnice and her couſin Lettuce were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally uncultivated, and ſuperſtition and prejudice were eaſily admitted and encouraged. The former of theſe women, therefore, concluded our heroine to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded victim to inexperience and affection. She thought the infatuation (as ſhe called it) of Hamden would not laſt long, and wiſely imagined, by paying the moſt marked attention to him, by giving up her own opinion whenever it was in oppoſition to his, and in a hundred different forms, which ſhe conceived to be the height of complaiſance, but which to Auberry himſelf appeared to have partook more of abject ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, to ſupplant her in his good opinion; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as he imagined her, in the main, a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured, inoffenſive woman, he encouraged her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to an intimacy with Rachel. He knew the purity of our heroine's mind, and native good ſenſe
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:034490_0302_0FFF224D00429AC8"/>
would prevent her receiving any ill impreſſions, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting any low ideas from converſing with a woman every way ſo infinitely her inferior, and at the ſame time thought her knowledge of the world might guard the inexperienced Rachel from impoſitions.</p>
               <p>If the firſt ſight of our heroine awakened in the boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om of Mrs. Varnice the malignant fiend envy, her manners and converſation aſſiſted to heighten it, and in leſs than a fortnight Mrs. Varnice pronounced her to be proud, conceited, fooliſh, in ſhort, every thing that was the direct oppoſite to her real diſpoſition. Yet ſhe concealed her opinion, and would take oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to admire her underſtanding, praiſe her ſhape, her complexion, even the tone of her voice. Rachel was not greedy of flattery; but where is the human being that can at all times turn a deaf ear to its adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating voice, or ſteel their hearts to its inſinuating qualities?</p>
               <p>When Auberry left his wife to go to his aunt in Scotland, Mrs. Varnice had not an idea that he meant to return, and felt ſomewhat mortified that all her arts to attract his notice had proved ineffectual; but as ſhe found it would be to no uſe to repine, ſhe turned her thoughts to what advantage might be made of our heroine.</p>
               <p>The parting between Major Auberry and his lady had been extremely painful on both ſides. Rachel's heart ſunk within her, and as the chaiſe drove from the door, her emotions became ſo violent, that Mrs. Varnice was obliged to lead her into her own parlour, and give her a glaſs of drops and water.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, my dear Madam," ſaid ſhe, as Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel endeavoured to ſuppreſs her tears, "you muſt not give way to this immoderate ſorrow; Mr. Dacres, I dare ſay, will ſoon come back again; I ſuppoſe he is not gone very far."</p>
               <p>"Four hundred miles," ſaid Rachel, "appears to me an immenſe diſtance; and I know not how to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it, but I feel ſuch an oppreſſion at my heart, it ſeems as though I had beheld him for the laſt time, and yet I know he will return as early as poſſible."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="unknown:034490_0303_0FFF224F52638500"/>
"O! to be ſure he will; he promiſed to come back ſoon, did not he?"</p>
               <p>"He will come as ſoon as he can, I know; but the length of his ſtay does not depend entirely on himſelf. However, he has promiſed I ſhould hear from him very often, and I ſhall count the moments with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience till I can hope to receive a letter. I have been very troubleſome to you, Madam," continued ſhe, riſing to quit the parlour; "pray pardon my childiſh behaviour; I will retire and endeavour to attain for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to bear this firſt (and I hope in Heaven it will be the laſt) ſeparation."</p>
               <p>Her eyes filled again as ſhe ſpoke, and courteſying haſtily, ſhe repaired to her own apartment; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſburthened her heart by giving a free courſe to her tears, ſhe compoſed her ſpirits; and aſſerting that underſtanding which was ever ready at her call, ſhe began to employ herſelf on a piece of embroidery, the pattern for which was drawn by Hamden; from that ſhe went to her ſpinnet, and played as well as ſhe could a triffing air which he had taught her. Theſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments amuſed and ſoothed her. She became com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and determined, during this enforced and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful abſence, to occupy herſelf in acquiring thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments which ſhe knew would be moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her huſband. Every trace of the primitive pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan was now entirely aboliſhed, except that ſhe was extremely neat in her dreſs, and ſimple in her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. She followed faſhion as far as ſhe thought it conſiſtent with propriety, but no farther; and though ſtrangers would pronounce her perfectly elegant at the firſt glance, were they to ſcrutinize the ſeveral ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles that compoſed her apparel, they would be at a loſs to ſay what particularly conſtituted that elegance. In ſhort, Rachel was the kind of woman who gives taſte and faſhion to every thing ſhe wears, however plain its formation, however common the materials of which it is made.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of her mind after the departure of her huſband was ſuch, as precluded every idea of ſeeking ſociety during the day. She attempted, but the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:034490_0304_0FFF2251A11C7C78"/>
was vain, to partake of a meal which the care of Lettuce had provided (for Lettuce had performed the office of attendant on the perſon of our heroine from the firſt day of her reſidence in the houſe of Mrs. Varnice); but towards evening ſhe began to reflect, that the ſolicitude and attention of her hoſteſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſome return; ſhe therefore requeſted ſhe would come and take tea in her apartment.</p>
               <p>It was now the middle of October, and the twilight at that period ſoon cloſes; it was ſix o'clock, when the tea things were placed on the table; a cheerful fire illumined the hearth, two wax candles lent their rays to enliven the ſcene, the windows were cloſed, the curtains let down, and perfect ſilence reigned in the apartments. The houſe was as retired as though twenty miles from London, and not a ſound interupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tranquillity of the ſurrounding ſcene, ſave now and then the rattle of a ſolitary carriage paſſing to and from the environs of the city.</p>
               <p>If there is a moment in which the human mind is more inclined to unbend, and place an unlimited con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in thoſe who profeſs a friendſhip, it is, when fully comprehending the charms of ſolitude, we find that ſolitude may be enlivened by being participated by one who enters into all our feelings, and ſmiles or weeps as the colour of our fate or expreſſion of our ſentiments excites the oppoſite emotions. Such was the moment we have juſt deſcribed, nor was our hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine inſenſible to its influence.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to ſee you ſo much recovered," ſaid Mrs. Varnice, ſeating herſelf at the tea-table, and drawing the tea-board towards her, which Lettuce had juſt brought in; "ſhall I ſave you the trouble and make the tea?"</p>
               <p>Rachel acknowledged her goodneſs, and acquieſced in the propoſal.</p>
               <p>"I ſuppoſe Mr. Dacres," ſaid ſhe with a ſigh, "is now many miles diſtant from me; and ſuppoſe he writes at the firſt poſt town, when may I expect to hear from him?"</p>
               <p>"That I cannot tell," ſaid the artful Mrs. Varnice, "unleſs I knew what road he took."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="303" facs="unknown:034490_0305_0FFF225330922888"/>
"The High North-road."</p>
               <p>"Well, you may hear from him ſooner, but I do not imagine he will write till he gets to York. He is a beautiful man," taking a miniature in her hand that hung by a ribbon round Rachel's neck, "a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome man indeed; and I think there is ſomething in your countenances very much alike, very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, juſt about the eyes and the mouth; that pretty dimple, juſt at the left corner. Well, you were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly relations."</p>
               <p>"No indeed, we were not, I never ſaw him till within eight months of our union."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! Well, I could have ſworn you had been couſins. Where were you married, in London?"</p>
               <p>"In Weſtminſter."</p>
               <p>"In Weſtminſter? what at the Abbey?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"At St. James's Church?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"Oh! you were married at St. Margaret's?"</p>
               <p>"No, I was not."</p>
               <p>"Bleſs me, then what church was it?"</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, I am not at liberty to ſay."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Varnice ſmiled. "Ah! I underſtand now; it was a ſtolen match?"</p>
               <p>"Not entirely ſo."</p>
               <p>"What, I ſuppoſe your friends knew it?"</p>
               <p>"I have no friends in England."</p>
               <p>"None?"</p>
               <p>"No, not one. I have a brother, a dear, reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, worthy brother; but he is in America."</p>
               <p>"In America? Dear me; what all amongſt the blacks and the wild Indians?"</p>
               <p>Rachel could not ſuppreſs an inclination to ſmile, whilſt ſhe anſwered, "No, Madam, amongſt the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean ſettlers, who have, within the laſt century, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated into the new world, which I underſtand is a fertile continent extending from north to ſouth, and conſtituting one entire quarter of the habitable globe."</p>
               <p>"And ſo, your brother is gone over ſea to thoſe ſtrange parts. And what could tempt him to leave dear little England?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="unknown:034490_0306_0FFF2255E42956E8"/>
"To inquire after property my father left there."</p>
               <p>"Dear well, how odd! And ſo your father died abroad."</p>
               <p>"No, he was loſt on his paſſage home, even when in fight of his native ſhores."</p>
               <p>"Oh dear! how unfortunate! So you have no friends in London?"</p>
               <p>"In London? No, nor in England, except my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band."</p>
               <p>"Dear me! Well, I hope he will prove a faithful, good huſband to you."</p>
               <p>"I have no doubt of his faith or tenderneſs."</p>
               <p>"Oh dear no! I dare ſay not; though men are ſtrange, inconſtant beings, will profeſs much without meaning any thing, marry women under aſſumed names, and never care for them after a little while."</p>
               <p>"There may have been ſuch things," ſaid Rachel; "but for the honour of human nature, I could wiſh not to believe them poſſible till my ſenſes convince me."</p>
               <p>"Sweet innocent! I wiſh you may never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced," ſaid Mrs. Varnice pointedly.</p>
               <p>This exclamation awakened ſomething in the boſom of Rachel, that could not rightly be termed either jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſy or curioſity, but it was a mixture of both; and the artful Varnice led her on, till ſhe had gleaned from Rachel (only that names were concealed) every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance relating to herſelf, her brother and her huſband.</p>
               <p>After a day or two paſt in that kind of uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, unconnected manner, which every perſon of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility muſt have experienced when ſeparated from the choſen friend of their hearts, Rachel began again to reſume her uſual avocations. Her needle employed the earlieſt hours of morning, after which ſhe dreſſed, and walked into the fields for air and exerciſe. Her dinner paſt, ſhe employed the intermediate hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and evening with a book, her pencil, or a leſſon on her ſpinnet; and the evenings were uſually paſſed in reading to, converſing and working, or play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing picquet with, Mrs. Varnice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="unknown:034490_0307_0FFF2259D2054BE8"/>
But during this period, it muſt not be imagined that ſhe was entirely forgotten by her quondam friends, the Webſters. They had been indefatigable in their inquiries, till they found out her lodgings, and hearing that ſhe went by the name of Dacres, they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that ſhe had forgot the reſpect due to herſelf, and become the miſtreſs of Hamden Auberry.</p>
               <p>Mr. Spriggins, though at firſt mortified and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by her ſudden departure from his aunt's houſe, ſoon found conſolation, by tranſferring his devoirs to his eldeſt couſin, by whom they were very favourably received; and an old uncle having left him a decent houſe, ſhop and ſtock in trade, in a market town in Northumberland, he ſoon obtained the aſſent of Mrs. Webſter, and took her fair daughter, to ſhine forth in all the airs and finery of a London bride, and to ſet the faſhions for three months to come, to all the tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's wives and daughters in a little country town. His ſhop too was newly painted and decorated in the London ſtyle, and Mr. Spriggins himſelf was ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, ſo obliging, that he ſoon attracted a large num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of cuſtomers.</p>
               <p>Beginning the world thus, not only without embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſments, but with a ſmall ſum of ready money in hand, this young couple found, in a very ſhort time, that they were in a fair way to accumulate a fortune. The wife, though proud, vain, and fond of finery, was meanly parſimonious, and would ſtint her family in neceſſaries, in order to buy a finer gown, or give a more expenſive treat than her neighbours. Belle Webſter was ſent for to be her companion, and ſet her cap at ſome of the ſmart young men, in hopes of an eſtabliſhment for life; while little Polly was left to aſſiſt and conſole her mother for the loſs of her two eldeſt daughters.</p>
               <p>When Hamden Auberry reached his uncle's ſeat, he was received with ſuch affectionate tokens of joy by lady Anne, that he was almoſt tempted, in that moment of tenderneſs, to throw himſelf on her mercy, and confeſs his marriage. Happy had it been, both for himſelf and our heroine, had he followed the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe;
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:034490_0308_0FFF225B5BC2CBD8"/>
but he took time to conſider, and that falſe pride, which was his only foible, repreſented to him, that he was ſecure of the perſon and heart of Rachel, bound to her by the moſt irrevocable vows; he haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arded nothing, therefore, by longer concealment. But to avow his engagements with a woman in reſpect to rank and fortune ſo diametrically oppoſite to what la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Anne deſired, might forfeit her regard forever; nay, this very pride flattered him that it was for the ſake of his wife he ſtill wiſhed to conceal their union, and that the wealth and conſequence in lady Anne's power to beſtow were only valued by him, as, by poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing them, he could elevate the woman of his choice to a rank ſhe was born to adorn. Alas! this was falſe reaſoning; it was in reality an unwillingneſs to give up the reſpect, the parade, the eaſe and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, wealth is ever certain to inſure.</p>
               <p>Two days after his arrival in Scotland, the family were ſurpriſed by the ſudden and unexpected appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of lady Lucy. The tour to the continent had been ſhortened by an untoward incident, and ſhe hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on her return, landed at Harwich, ſhe proceeded immediately north, without going to London. Lady Anne was not diſpleaſed by the return of her niece; ſhe looked upon Hamden as the certain ſucceſſor to the title and eſtates of his late grandfather, but ſhe thought a union with lady Lucy might by no means retard the completion of her wiſhes, which were to ſee him at the head of her family.</p>
               <p>It was the evening after the arrival of this lady, that, ſitting in a family way with only her aunt and couſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and diverting them with her vivacity and innocent prattle, when, turning ſuddenly to Hamden, ſhe cried, "Oh! by the bye, Coz, how does your pretty Quaker girl do?"</p>
               <p>Hamden's face was but a trifle paler than his coat. He heſitated, attempted to anſwer; but finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at a loſs for words, affected a laugh.</p>
               <p>"You may laugh," cried ſhe, "but I declare I thought her very pretty."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="unknown:034490_0309_0FFF225EAF66A8A8"/>
"Who are you ſpeaking of?" ſaid lady Anne, fixing her eyes on the glowing face of Hamden.</p>
               <p>"Oh! he knows," continued the thoughtleſs girl, "and now I have the ſcene full in my mind, I'll tell you, aunt. You muſt know we went to the play.—"</p>
               <p>"Nay, dear Lucy," ſaid Hamden, gaily catching her hand, "how can you remember ſuch ridiculous trifles?"</p>
               <p>"Your ſervant, couſin Hamden; it was no trifle at the time. Now, aunt, I'll tell you how it was. Between the play and farce, I had obſerved a very pretty, intereſting Quaker, who ſat in the pit looking very earneſtly at Mr. Hamden. I ſuppoſe ſhe had ſeen him before. Eh, couſin?—Well, dear aunt, the houſe was very full, and the pretty Quaker fainted; when behold ye, my gentleman here takes a leap over the front of the box, and ruſhing through the crowd, flew to her aſſiſtance. But if you had ſeen when ſhe recovered—"</p>
               <p>"A little moderation, if you pleaſe, lady Lucy," cried Hamden, eagerly interrupting her; "you paint the ſcene in ſuch lively colours, that my aunt will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the bagatelle of conſequence."</p>
               <p>"And your manner, Hamden, does not contradict the ſuppoſition," ſaid lady Anne pointedly. "Pray who was this fainting damſel?"</p>
               <p>"It was a Miſs Dudley." ſaid Hamden, in a hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried accent; "I was introduced to her when I laſt viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited my mother."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" ſaid lady Anne, ſarcaſtically.</p>
               <p>"Yes, ſhe was a great favourite of my mother's; but I underſtand ſhe is lately married to an old crony of mine, one Dacres. I am ſure, aunt, you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what friends Tom Dacres and I were when boys."</p>
               <p>"And are you friends now?" ſaid Lucy with a half ſmile and a ſly glance at her aunt.</p>
               <p>Lady Anne was ſtruck with the evident embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Hamden; ſhe therefore put an end to the converſation by riſing and deſiring him to attend her to her cloſet. Here a converſation enſued, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:034490_0310_0FFF2260400FA3E8"/>
Auberry, that the moment his aunt ſhould be aſſured of his having formed a family connexion with our heroine, would be the laſt of her favour.</p>
               <p>"I muſt diſſemble longer," ſaid he. Alas! diſſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation is ſeldom neceſſary, can never be laudable, and was in this caſe deſpicable.—But we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our heroine.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſix weeks of her huſband's abſence ſhe bore with tolerable patience; when a month more paſſed over, and no hope of his return, ſhe murmured at the delay; but when, at laſt week after week glided on, and Auberry did not appear, ſhe began to deſpond.</p>
               <p>Mrs Varnice was not ſurpriſed; it was what ſhe had expected. She by ſlow and almoſt imperceptible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees endeavoured to undermine the principles of our heroine; but Rachel, though not quick at diſcerning evil (becauſe almoſt a ſtranger to its baneful qualities) at laſt diſcovered her aim, and repulſed her with the ſcorn ſhe merited.</p>
               <p>But innocence is ever inadequate to oppoſe, with any degree of ſucceſs, the united powers of envy and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. In revenge for the contempt with which ſhe had been treated, Mrs. Varnice ſuppreſſed the next letter with which Lettuce was entruſted to carry to the poſt, opened, read it, and committed it to the fire. By the tenor of this letter, ſhe comprehended that Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel fully believed herſelf the wife of Auberry; but this ſhe knew before, and inwardly laughed at what ſhe ſuppoſed to be the credulity of a fond, unſuſpecting girl.</p>
               <p>Having once began to interrupt the correſpondence, ſhe did not heſitate the next poſt-night to make Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce keep watch at the ſtreet door, and prevent the rap of the poſt-man, which would have immediately called our heroine down ſtairs. The ſtratagem ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; ſhe took the expected letter from the poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's hand, paid the poſtage, and retired to her own apartment to read it.</p>
               <p>It has often been ſaid, that envy is its own puniſher, and in this caſe the adage was completely verified; for when from this letter ſhe diſcovered that Hamden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:034490_0311_0FFF226289807EC0"/>
was, and freely acknowledged himſelf, the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of our heroine, her heart overflowed with ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and ſhe determined to heſitate at nothing which might be likely to poiſon the happineſs of one ſhe at once envied and hated.</p>
               <p>One act of guilt leads but to the commiſſion of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; it is in vain the human heart may think only this one little deviation, and I will ſtop. As the ball precipitated from the ſummit of a hill pauſes not, but ruſhes with amazing velocity till it reaches the very loweſt part of the vale beneath, ſo the human ſoul, giving way to temptation, ſinks from error into guilt, nor pauſes till plunged in the loweſt abyſs of depravity.</p>
               <p>Another and another letter from Hamden was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mrs. Varnice, whilſt thoſe from Rachel (whoſe heart now began to throb with fear, doubt, and a thouſand anxieties, which none but thoſe who are united to, and ſuffering an early ſeparation from, the man of their choice can conceive) ſuffered the ſame fate. At length one arrived incloſing a bank bill for a hundred pounds. At the ſight of it, Mrs. Varnice turned pale; fear was the fiſt emotion of her boſom. But not even Lettuce was privy to the receipt of this letter. Mrs. Varnice was not very economical; a hundred pounds would relieve her from ſome few em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſments. She looked at it, pauſed for a moment, at length, committing the letter to the fire, ſhe depoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited the note in her pocket-book, and on the enſuing morning exchanged it at a ſilk mercer's where ſhe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a gown of roſe-coloured tabby.</p>
               <p>This note would have been very acceptable to Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel; for ſhe began to be ſenſible of the decrease of her finances, and to experience the ſolicitude and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cares of maternal tenderneſs; and to prepare for the reception of a little ſtranger, ſhe had nearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted the whole of the money Hamden had given her at parting.</p>
               <p>It cannot be ſuppoſed that the mind of Hamden was in a much eaſier ſtate than that of our heroine; but as he was now on a party of pleaſure with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, lady Anne and lady Lucy, making excurſions
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:034490_0312_0FFF2265A5A03B90"/>
from one part of Scotland to another, and ſtaying but a few days in each place, he reconciled himſelf to not hearing from his wife, under the idea that her letters might not follow him as he directed, and that he ſhould get them all together when he returned to Glaſgow. But when he returned, and found not a ſingle letter waiting for him, he felt the utmoſt impatience, and would have ſet off immediately for London, but that his aunt was attacked with an alarming fever, and to leave her at ſuch a period, would be the height of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. She lingered long, and even when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced out of danger, ſtill hovered as it were on the brink of the grave for many weeks, and at length change of climate was ordered as the only chance of perfect reſtoration.</p>
               <p>Hamden, whoſe mind was now tortured almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ſufferance, finding that he ſhould be obliged to attend his aunt to Liſbon, whilſt preparations were making for the voyage, diſpatched his confidential ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to London, to make inquiries for and bear remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances to our heroine. Though this man may juſtly be termed confidential, yet ſo fearful had Hamden been of having his marriage known, that even he was not entruſted with the ſecret, and Rachel was humil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iated even in the eyes of her huſband's ſervant. But her manners were ſuch as had ever ſecured reſpect from James, and the honeſt fellow, often when he thought of her ſituation, pitied her, and blamed his maſter.</p>
               <p>Nearly ſeven months had now elapſed ſince the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of our heroine, above five of which ſhe had been ſeparated from her huſband, and half of that period had paſſed in the continual diſtreſs of alternate expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and diſappointment.</p>
               <p>"I have been deceived," ſhe would ſay, whilſt tears of anguiſh ſtole down her cheeks; "Hamden no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er loves, no longer thinks of me, and, forſaken of him, who is there in this vaſt univerſe, (for Heaven alone can tell whether my dear brother is in exiſtence) who then is there that cares for the unhappy Rachel? And forlorn, forſaken, wretched as I am, I ſhall give life to
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:034490_0313_0FFF226846353008"/>
a helpleſs innocent, whoſe father will perhaps bluſh to own him."</p>
               <p>Rachel's days were joyleſs, and the tear of anguiſh fell nightly on her pillow. The roſe no longer bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her cheeks, nor did the animated beam of health and internal peace dance in her expreſſive eyes; pale, languid, heart-broken, ſhe ſuffered in ſilence; for to whom could ſhe complain?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Varnice had expoſed to her, her true charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Rachel would not hold communication with a woman ſhe deſpiſed. She nurſed her grief in ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. If ſhe endeavoured to amuſe the heavy hour, by her pencil or muſic, every flower ſhe drew was moiſtened by her tears, and the chords of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reverberated but the ſtrains of melancholy.</p>
               <p>It was a fine morning in the beginning of March, that, ſtill conſidering it a duty to uſe every method to preſerve health, (though life was no longer valuable) Rachel walked to the green park. It was an early hour; ſhe did not fear being met by any one who knew her; there were but few by whom ſhe would be recognized, and thoſe few ſeldom viſited the park except on a Sunday evening, to ſee and be ſeen. As with ſlow ſtep ſhe paced along the margin of Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's Pond, ſhe was ſtartled by a voice which ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly exclaimed, "Heavens and earth! Miſs Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley!" She raiſed her eyes, and beheld Archibald Oliver. A ſudden emotion, ſomething like ſhame, ruſhed upon her heart; ſhe juſt articulated his name, extended her hand towards him, and, tottering to a ſeat that was near, ſhe ſunk on it almoſt fainting.</p>
               <p>"Good God! my dear Miſs Dudley, to what am I to attribute theſe emotions?"</p>
               <p>"My name is Dacres, Sir," ſaid Rachel; but her voice faltered, and the carnation viſited her cheeks as ſhe remembered her very apparent ſituation.</p>
               <p>"You are married then?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"May you be happy, happy as you deſerve. But why thus alone? it is not ſurely proper. Where is Mr. Dacres?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="unknown:034490_0314_0FFF2269DEB8DE40"/>
The former intimacy that had ſubſiſted between Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iver and our heroine could alone have excuſed theſe abrupt interrogations; but Rachel had ever conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as a brother, and new ties, new affections, had made him behold her now only in the endearing light of a ſiſter.</p>
               <p>"My huſband is in Scotland," ſaid Rachel, "whith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he was called by buſineſs of conſequence; but come (continued ſhe, forcing a ſmile) if you are diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, walk home with me, and I will tell you all you wiſh to know, and in return be very inquiſitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your happineſs."</p>
               <p>Then, with that innocent freedom that gave a charm to all her actions, ſhe paſſed her hand through his arm, and they purſued their way to her lodgings, engaged in ſuch intereſting chat, that they had reached the door before either imagined they were half way.</p>
               <p>During their walk, Rachel told as much of her own ſtory as could be done without infringing the vow ſhe had voluntarily made to Auberry never to divulge his real name and family till authorized by him; and in return, ſhe learnt that Oliver had experienced a very tolerable ſhare of happineſs in his matrimonial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, that his wife was then in town, and had juſt made him a father. Of Jeſſy he could give her no information, and ſince our heroine's marriage, that young lady had declined the correſpondence of Rachel, alleging, as ſhe no longer ſhared her confidence, ſhe would not intrude her letters where ſhe muſt ſuppoſe them unwelcome. This had at the time given Rachel much pain; but as Hamden would not allow her to explain her ſituation to her friend, ſhe was forced to relinquiſh a correſpondence ſo dear to her heart, and with it all intercourſe with the only woman ſhe had ever known whom ſhe thought really deſerved the name of friend.</p>
               <p>Oliver could not on that morning ſet above half an hour with our heroine; but on the enſuing day he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and drank tea with her. After this, ſcarce a day paſſed but he inquired after her health. He ſaw there was ſomething of myſtery enveloped her; he ſaw ſhe
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:034490_0315_0FFF226DCC8108D8"/>
was not happy; and though his knowledge of her heart, underſtanding and principles made him reject the idea whenever it intruded itſelf, he ſometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt feared ſhe had been imprudent.</p>
               <p>To the afflicted heart, the voice of friendſhip is a ſoothing cordial. Rachel had not heard its adulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſound for ſeveral months previous to her meeting with Oliver. She dreamt not of impropriety, and, unconſcious of evil, dreaded not cenſure. His viſits were always welcome, and the day paſſed drearily in which ſhe ſaw him not.</p>
               <p>It has been already remarked, that the greateſt and almoſt only fault of our heroine was a too great open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſpoſition, in regard to her own circumſtances or buſineſs; ſhe never thought of concealment, and nothing but the moſt unbounded affection for Auberry could have prompted her to enter into engagements which would involve her conduct in apparent myſtery, and oblige her to wear for a while the veil of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To Oliver, therefore, only concealing his real name and family, ſhe was explicit in regard to her fears for the health and life of her huſband; ſhe alſo, without heſitation, mentioned the embarraſſed ſtate of her finances. Oliver offered her money; but, though ſhe ſought conſolation from the ſoothings of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, her ſpirit roſe above pecuniary obligation. She was grateful for the offer, but firm in her refuſal to avail herſelf of it.</p>
               <p>On the evening when this explanation took place, Oliver had ſupped with Rachel, and the hoarſe voice of the watchmen proclaiming half paſt eleven o'clock, was the firſt thing that reminded them it was time to break off their intereſting converſation. They had talked of Reuben, of Jeſſy, and the doubtful fate of thoſe dear relatives had drawn tears from both their eyes.</p>
               <p>"I muſt leave you, Mrs. Dacres," ſaid he, riſing and taking his hat.</p>
               <p>Rachel rang the bell; but no one anſwering, ſhe took one of the candles from the table, and deſcended the ſtairs to light him out.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="unknown:034490_0316_0FFF227015AB9798"/>
"Good night, my dear Madam," ſaid he; "do not come to the door, you will take cold."</p>
               <p>"Good night, Mr. Oliver," ſaid Rachel; and as he pulled the door after him, ſhe turned the key, put the chain acroſs, and turned to re-aſcend the ſtairs, when, to her ſurpriſe, the parlour door opened, and Mrs. Varnice appeared.</p>
               <p>"Bleſs me," ſaid Rachel, "I thought you were all in bed."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I dare ſay you did, and hoped it too."</p>
               <p>"Hoped, Madam! I neither hoped, nor cared; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I rang the bell for Lettuce to light Mr. Oliver out, and as ſhe did not anſwer it—"</p>
               <p>"I would not let her anſwer it; and let me tell you, Mrs. Dacres, (if that is your name) I think your conduct very unwarrantable; and if you muſt have gentlemen viſiting you in your huſband's abſence, and ſtaying till twelve or one o'clock, you muſt get an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other lodging; for I will have no ſuch goings on in my houſe. Mr. Dacres, (as you call him) if he is your huſband, will have no great reaſon to be pleaſed with your conduct; and if he is not, why, my houſe is a houſe of good repute, and the ſooner you quit it the better."</p>
               <p>Petrified with aſtoniſhment, Rachel could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the ſpace of a minute; at length, reſentment conquering her ſenſibility, ſhe replied:</p>
               <p>"Had I ſuppoſed you entertained ſuch humiliating ideas of me, Madam, I would not ſo long have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained an inmate in your habitation; but, painful as it is to me, I ſhall be neceſſitated to ſtay ſome little time longer till I can diſcharge my account with you. I ſhall not leave a houſe whilſt I am indebted to the miſtreſs of it."</p>
               <p>"No, I'll take care of that," ſaid Mrs. Varnice, with a malicious grin; "I ſhall hardly let you go in my debt when I can detain any valuable property to the amount. But I ſhall ſay no more to-night, to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row you muſt look out for another place, and pay me how you can, for paid I will be, or you muſt take the conſequence, and ſo good-night."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="unknown:034490_0317_0FFF2272688AD090"/>
Rachel would have ſaid good-night, but the words ſtuck in her throat; ſhe ſlightly inclined her head, and paſſing haſtily up ſtairs, ſunk almoſt fainting on the neareſt ſeat. Lettuce, who had been tutored by Mrs. Varnice, followed her up, pretended to blame her couſin, and take the part of our heroine.</p>
               <p>"I will not ſtay in the houſe," ſaid Rachel, "but how to raiſe money to pay her."</p>
               <p>"Dear! that would be no difficult matter," ſaid Lettuce, "ſo many pretty trinkets as you have! Thoſe bracelets now—"</p>
               <p>Rachel looked on them and ſighed.</p>
               <p>"I cannot part with them," ſaid ſhe, "they were the firſt preſent I received from my huſband."</p>
               <p>Well, but you have ſuch a vaſt number of pretty things, your watch and your etwee!—"</p>
               <p>This converſation let our heroine into a ſecret with which ſhe was before entirely unacquainted—that ſhe could raiſe a ſum of money on theſe baubles without entirely parting with them; and ſhe went to bed with a full determination to quit the manſion where ſhe had been ſo much inſulted, the enſuing morning. It may well be ſuppoſed ſhe ſlept but little; ſhort mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of forgetfulneſs, and thoſe interrupted by hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid viſions, were all ſhe could obtain.</p>
               <p>At the dawn ſhe aroſe, and ſo earneſtly did ſhe ſet about a removal, that by twelve o'clock, ſhe had paid the exorbitant demands of Mrs. Varnice, and was ſeated in her new lodgings; though to accompliſh this point ſhe had diſpoſed of almoſt every thing of val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſhe poſſeſſed, not excepting the bracelets, for which ſhe had expreſſed ſo much regard.</p>
               <p>Two days after this removal, James arrived, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned by his maſter to make inquiry after our he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine. The tale told by the arch-fiend, Mrs. Varnice, filled his honeſt heart with horror.</p>
               <p>"Receive the viſits of gentlemen, obliged to leave the lodgings in which his maſter had placed her, and go into others, on account of keeping bad hours, and other diſorderly behaviour. Good Sirs," ſaid James, I can hardly believe it; ſhe was ſo good, ſo modeſt,
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:034490_0318_0FFF2273F3D30B48"/>
ſo mild. It made one's heart glad to look at her; and to hear her talk, would a made an old man young again. Body o' me! there muſt a been ſome witchcraft uſed to make her change ſo all of a ſudden."</p>
               <p>But to all James's inquiries of where ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to, they pleaded ignorance; and he being reſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the time allowed him to make the journey, could not ſtay ſo long as he wiſhed to make inquiries in the neighbourhood. With a heavy heart, he ſet forward on his return to his maſter; but near Berwick, the carriage was overſet in which he was travelling, and his right arm broken.</p>
               <p>Hamden, agonized almoſt to diſtraction by his long abſence, the cauſe of which he was not acquainted with, (as a fever and delirium, which immediately ſucceeded the accident, prevented James from taking any method to let his maſter know his ſituation) was obliged to embark with his aunt, without receiving the leaſt intelligence of the fate of Rachel.</p>
               <p>'She has forgotten me, ſhe repents her union with me.' he would ſay, 'and ſeeks for an opportunity to break thoſe engagements which I have heſitated to announce to the world.'</p>
               <p>In theſe moments he would be ready to reveal all to his aunt; but the fear that Rachel no longer loved him, or perhaps was no longer worthy of his affection for her, always withheld him; and the voyage to Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, though in itſelf extremely pleaſant, ſeemed to the unhappy Hamden to teem only with vexation, and when landed, and the firſt buſtle of ſeeking a lodging, &amp;c. was over, he walked through the ſtreets like a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented ſhade; indeed, it was but the ſhadow of Hamden Auberry, for his better part was flown to the ſhores of Albion, where it hovered round the manſion in which he imagined ſtill dwelt the object of his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affection.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV.</head>
               <head>Sorrows of the Heart—</head>
               <p>IN the mean time, the afflictions of our heroine dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſed. Oliver had left London; ſhe was without friends and without money, and to increaſe the ſorrows of her heart, ſhe became the mother of a fine boy about the middle of June. Before her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, ſhe entruſted her hoſteſs with the real ſtate of her finances, and to retrench her expenſes, had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a room on the ſecond ſtory, where ſhe ſuffered in ſilence all the miſeries of diſappointed love, added to the poignant ſting of poverty. Once ſhe wrote to Mrs. Auberry; had ſhe addreſſed the letter to Dr. Lenient, ſhe had done right. But Mrs. Auberry had received a letter from Mrs. Webſter, which had prej<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udiced her againſt Rachel; ſhe therefore did not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her brother that ſhe had heard from her, and threw the letter into a draw, without deigning to give our diſtreſſed heroine the comfort of one line in anſwer.</p>
               <p>During her confinement, ſhe was told by the wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an who attended her, that a very find lady had taken the range of apartments on the firſt floor, which conſiſted of a dining-room, drawing-room, and bed-chamber; that ſhe had taken them only for a few weeks, whilſt her own houſe was finiſhed and properly furniſhed. "She is a charming lady," ſaid the talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative old woman, "and keeps her chariot, her own maid and footman."</p>
               <p>All this intelligence appeared of ſo little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to our heroine, that ſhe ſcarcely heard a ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the whole harangue; but the next day, as ſhe was paſſing from the bed to the ſofa at the other end of the room, ſhe caſt her eyes caſually out of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; an elegant chariot drew up to the door, and to her utter aſtoniſhment ſhe ſaw Mrs. Courtney deſcend from it.</p>
               <p>Loſt in amazement, ſhe ſat down; that her eyes had not deceived her, ſhe was certain. To what could
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:034490_0320_0FFF227953A5FFB0"/>
ſhe attribute this ſudden elevation of fortune? This was a riddle ſhe had not power to unravel; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was the cauſe, ſhe rejoiced at the effect, and, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the coldneſs ſhe had experienced from La Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone immediately after her marriage with Lieutenant Courtney, conſcious only of a pleaſurable ſenſation, to find a perſon with whom ſhe had formerly lived in habits of intimacy ſo near her, ſhe wrote with a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil on a ſlip of paper,</p>
               <p>"Dear Mrs. Courtney, your friend Rachel is again an inmate of the manſion you inhabit, and flatters her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf you will give her the pleaſure of your company for half an hour."</p>
               <p>This billet ſhe ſent by the nurſe, and in a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Mrs. Courtney entered the apartment. The attendant withdrawn, and a few common-place inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries paſt,</p>
               <p>"You cannot think, my dear Madam," ſaid our heroine, "what real pleaſure it gives me to find Mr. Courtney's proſpects ſo much amended, ſince your marriage."</p>
               <p>"Yes, he is made a Captain; beſides, a particular friend of mine, whom I had not ſeen for many years, has ſettled on me a very handſome income, which makes me quite independent."</p>
               <p>"How fortunate!" ſaid Rachel in the ſimplicity of her heart. "And where is Captain Courtney?"</p>
               <p>"Gone to India."</p>
               <p>"Is either of your ſiſters, or your mother-in-law in town with you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh dear no."</p>
               <p>"They are well, I hope?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, quite well; that is, I believe ſo, for I have heard nothing to the contrary, but I have not ſeen them lately."</p>
               <p>"No?"</p>
               <p>"No, not for theſe three months paſt. But come, tell me, my demure friend, what changes have taken place in your fate ſince we parted."</p>
               <p>With a look of mingled confuſion and candour, in the ſimple language of truth did Rachel explain to
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:034490_0321_0FFF227BAA4D8760"/>
Mrs. Courtney every circumſtance of her marriage and conſequent uneaſineſs, ſtill concealing the real name of her huſband.</p>
               <p>She ſpoke to a woman whoſe heart was impure, and who ſcrupled not to judge of others by herſelf. Beſides, Mrs. Courtney had been to viſit Mrs. Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and had learnt from her the manner of our hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine's departure from her houſe, and with whom it was ſuppoſed ſhe reſided. She laughed at the affliction Rachel appeared to experience from her huſband's neglect, called her agony of heart ideal miſery, told her the honey moon could not laſt forever, bid her keep up her ſpirits, and, promiſing to ſee her again in the evening, left her. Accordingly, in the evening ſhe again viſited her.</p>
               <p>"I have been thinking, Mrs. Dacres," ſaid ſhe with a half ſmile, and looking ſidelong from under her dark eyelaſhes, "that change of ſcene and air would be of ſervice to you. I am going into Northumberland, to viſit our old acquaintance, Mrs. Spriggins; what ſay you to a jaunt? You will travel at your eaſe with me in the chariot, Pelham will help take care of the child, and I dare ſay the journey will not be the leſs agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble becauſe it will take you near the borders of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land."</p>
               <p>A tinge of carnation paſſed over the languid cheek of Rachel, as ſhe ſaid ſhe ſhould like ſuch an excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but it was not in her power to take it.</p>
               <p>"What, for want of money, I ſuppoſe? Pſhaw! nonſenſe! you cannot be wholly deſtitute; a trifle will ſerve, and you ſurely wiſh to be nearer the Major than you are at preſent."</p>
               <p>Rachel's heart beat quick, as ſhe attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Mrs. Courtney put her hand before her mouth,</p>
               <p>"Come don't deny it; I have found out your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, but I won't betray you. Perhaps, when you are within a day's journey, he may be able to viſit you. London is at a vaſt diſtance from the banks of the Clyde."</p>
               <p>There is nothing more difficult to a perſon of nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural veracity than to be under the neceſſity of aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:034490_0322_0FFF227E26D7CD48"/>
a falſehood. Rachel felt the impoſſibility of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and remained ſilent. In ſhort, her innocence, her credulity, her ardent wiſh to be near her huſband prevailed, and ſhe conſented to accompany Mrs. Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into Northumberland. But, however liable to err from the frankneſs and candour of her temper. Rachel had ſtill that pride of ſoul which could not condeſcend to tell Mrs. Courtney that three guineas, and a few clothes, conſtituted the whole of her worldly poſſeſſions. Part of thoſe clothes, with ſome very fine laces, were diſpoſed of to pay the nurſe and other contingent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes; and with a mere trifle in her purſe, our hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine departed with her unworthy aſſociate from London.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Courtney was deceived when ſhe invited Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel to take this journey with her; but it was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of her own heart had deceived her, and before ſhe reached Northumberland, ſhe diſcovered that the mind of our heroine was ſtill uncontaminated, ſtill pure, and ſhrunk from vice with diſguſt, turned from immorality with abhorrence.</p>
               <p>On their arrival at Mr. Spriggins's, Mrs. Courtney was received with a profuſion of compliments, whilſt Rachel was ſcarcely noticed. She was ſhown to an upper apartment, and, weary as ſhe was with the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſuffered to undreſs the child herſelf, and put him to bed. She laid him on the pillow of repoſe, and, kneeling beſide the bed, poured forth her afflicted ſoul to her Maker. Her cheek reſted on the ſame pillow with that of her infant, and her tears flowed without reſtraint. She felt that the pretended friendſhip of Mrs. Courtney was only oſtentation; ſhe feared ſhe had more to ſuffer than ſhe ſhould be able to ſupport. She prayed for reſignation to the will of Heaven, and her tears continued to flow, not from impatience, they were the effuſions of an afflicted ſpirit.</p>
               <p>After a few weeks reſidence in the family of Mrs. Spriggins, Rachel perceived that not even a ſhadow of reſpect and attention towards herſelf remained in the manners of the whole family. At meals, ſhe was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to take the loweſt ſeat at the table, where ſhe was ſometimes ſo totally overlooked, as not to be helped
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:034490_0323_0FFF2281F2A15590"/>
till every one elſe had begun their dinner; and then ſhe was inſulted by an affectation of friendly familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, ſuch as, "Bleſs me, Mrs. Dacres, I had forgot you; but why don't you ſpeak? you are at home you know."</p>
               <p>At theſe moments, Rachel's heart would ſwell to her eyes, and in ſtruggling to ſuppreſs her tears, the food ſhe attempted to ſwallow ſeemed almoſt to choak her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Courtney diſagreed with and diſcharged her woman, and the next day requeſted our heroine to riſe from her ſeat, and fetch her work from the other end of the room. Had Rachel been independent, ſhe would without heſitation have complied with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; but Rachel was poor, and ſhe felt the requeſt an inſult.</p>
               <p>"I am not qualified to ſupply the place of your ſervant, Madam," ſaid ſhe haughtily.</p>
               <p>"Why I do not ſuppoſe you are," ſaid Mrs. Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, yawning indolently; "but indeed, child, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced as you are, I do not know what you could do better than endeavour to get a place; though to be ſure your child is an objection."</p>
               <p>The expreſſive eyes of our heroine flaſhed indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the inſolent manner and propoſal of her oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious friend; but ſhe diſdained to anſwer. 'I am not yet fallen quite ſo low as that," thought ſhe, and roſe to quit the apartment.</p>
               <p>"I really am ſorry for you, child," continued Mrs. Courtney, detaining her, "but painful as it is for a perſon who is ſo much intereſted for your welfare as I am to ſpeak diſagreeable truths, I really muſt tell you, that the haughty airs you give yourſelf are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming; you muſt learn humility."</p>
               <p>"I hope I ſhall in time," ſaid Rachel indignantly, "If I do not, I ſhall profit but little by your endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours."</p>
               <p>"Come, come, you miſunderſtand me; if you do not incline to do ſomething for a livelihood, I really think it would be adviſeable for you to go on to Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to your huſband. I expect a friend of mine here

in a few days, with whom I am going to make a tour through the northern counties; if you chooſe to go with me in quality of a companion, and take the care of my clothes, aſſiſt me to dreſs and undreſs, I will pay you twenty guineas a year; but then you muſt leave your child here at nurſe."</p>
               <p>"No, Mrs. Courtney," ſaid Rachel, "if I am obliged to eat the the bread of ſervitude, I will earn it of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, not of one who once thought herſelf honoured in being called the friend of Rachel Dudley. I will be the humble companion (or rather a ſlave on which ill humour may be laviſhed with impunity) to no one. I would gladly embrace your firſt propoſal of ſeeking my huſband, but you know I have not the means of proſecuting the journey, even by the cheapeſt convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance."</p>
               <p>"Heavens and earth!" replied Mrs. Courtney, with a look of well-affected ſurpriſe, "is it poſſible you can have come into this ſtrange place without any money? And what do you mean to do, child?"</p>
               <p>"To be no longer troubleſome to you, Madam," ſaid Rachel. "I thank you, Madam," continued ſhe, "for the ſhelter your roof has ſo long afforded me," turning to Mrs. Spriggins, who had ſat a ſilent and inſenſible ſpectatreſs of the ſcene, "but will no longer intrude; but this very night remove to a habitation better ſuited to my preſent humble condition."</p>
               <p>She then haſtily left the room. On the ſtairs ſhe met Belle Webſter.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Mrs. Dacres?" ſaid ſhe; for the tears, which a laudable pride had reſtrained whilſt ſhe was in the preſence of her inſolent hoſteſs and her companion, wounded ſenſibility forced in a torrent from her eyes the moment ſhe had ſhut the door. "What is the matter?" ſaid Belle.</p>
               <p>"Nothing," replied our heroine, "only I have ſtayed here too long."</p>
               <p>"Dear! I'm afraid ſiſter has been vexing you; well, don't mind her, you know ſhe never was very good natured."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="unknown:034490_0325_0FFF22860EF18FC0"/>
"I do not mind either her or her aſſociate," ſaid Rachel; "but I wiſh to releaſe them from an unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come intruder, and ſhall leave the houſe immediately. Do me the favour, Miſs Webſter, to requeſt one of the ſervants may take my trunk to the inn."</p>
               <p>"Dearee me! I hope you are not in earneſt?"</p>
               <p>"In very earneſt, I aſſure you."</p>
               <p>"Well, now I'm quite ſorry."</p>
               <p>"I thank you, Miſs Webſter. Will you aſk the favour I requeſt?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! to be ſure I will; but you won't go before tea?"</p>
               <p>"Before another hour," ſaid Rachel firmly.</p>
               <p>Belle was not overburthened with underſtanding: ſhe did not perfectly comprehend the delicacy of our heroine's feelings, nor did ſhe give herſelf the trouble to think much about it; ſo wiſhing her health, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended the ſtairs, and ſent up a boy to take her trunk. It was between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, when Rachel, taking her dear boy in her arms, and followed by the lad with her parcels, left the houſe of Mr. Spriggins, and went to ſeek a lodging in a town, to almoſt every inhabitant of which ſhe was a perfect ſtranger. She knew that the public inns afforded lodgings to travellers, and to one of the moſt reputable of theſe ſhe directed her ſteps. Her purſe was but ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly provided, but ſhe augmented her little ſtore by the ſale of a gold locket, the laſt thing of value which ſhe poſſeſſed, and from which ſhe took a lock of plaited hair; for it was the hair of Hamden Auberry, and to her a thouſand times more precious than the metal in which it had been enſhrined.</p>
               <p>On the following morning, ſhe inquired after a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate lodging, and was recommended by the woman who kept the inn, to a mean apartment in one of the moſt unfrequented ſtreets in the town. To this hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſylum ſhe retired, and felt a degree of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly pleaſure that ſhe could indulge her tears with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſtraint.</p>
               <p>It may occaſion ſome degree of ſurpriſe, that Sprig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, who had formerly been an admirer of our hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:034490_0326_0FFF2287CE53D8C0"/>
would ſuffer her to leave his houſe without either friends or money; but the heart by nature contracted, and whoſe chief object has been ſelf, is ſenſibly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an appearance of ſlight; it can never either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or forgive it; and ſuch a heart languidly moved in the boſom of Spriggins.</p>
               <p>But thoſe viſitors, who had ſeen Rachel in the fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, and now miſſed her, felt an awakened curioſity to know what was become of her. To theſe interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories had the Meſdames Spriggins and Courtney ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply anſwered, that ſhe was gone home; curioſity would have died, but they felt they had done wrong in driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, poor and unprotected as ſhe was, from their houſe; and in palliation of ſo inhuman an action, threw aſperſions on her character. Not content with depriving her of the protection of their own roof, they prevented her obtaining that protection from any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whoſe inmates were in the ſmalleſt degree reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>That the human heart is liable to error, and that on the eternal record our crimes and follies are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled, and will one day appear in dreadful judgment againſt us, is a ſolemn truth, which no perſon of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe will attempt to deny; yet we are led to hope, that the tear of unfeigned penitence will blot thoſe offences out. But the crime of ſlander is of ſo ſoul a die, its ſable hue ſtains the ſacred page, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mercy infinite can purify it. Oh thou Giver of life, guard, I beſeech thee, my heart from ingratitude, and my lips from ſlander; and for the reſt, thy will be done.</p>
               <p>During the period of theſe viciſſitudes, Rachel had never omitted writing every week to her huſband, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the time when the birth of her ſon prevented her. Theſe letters, written after ſhe left the houſe of Mrs. Varnice, all lay at the place where he had deſired them to be addreſſed; and when James was ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered to follow his maſter, he made them into a parcel, and took them with him.</p>
               <p>But words are inadequate to deſcribe the feelings of Hamden, when he by turns liſtened to the account
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:034490_0327_0FFF228B99B085D8"/>
which James gave him, and read the pathetic letters of his wife; ſometimes love, ſometimes reſentment predominated. But when he read that he was a fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that his once loved Rachel, in that ſeaſon of ſickneſs, was without the means to purchaſe the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary accommodations and comforts to render the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in ſome meaſure ſupportable, he determined to hazard every thing, own his marriage, and fly to her relief and comfort.</p>
               <p>Hamden was ever impetuous; he reſolved one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the next put the reſolve in execution. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Anne heard him with more calmneſs than he had expected; but that apparent calm was deceitful; when he had finiſhed, ſhe upbraided him with his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, imprecated miſery on both himſelf and his wife, and with a determined air renounced him forever. In vain was every endeavour to ſoften her reſentment, and Hamden embarked for England, without the ſmalleſt hope of being reinſtated in her affection, or of ever being the better for her fortune.</p>
               <p>Mortified pride, love and jealouſy corroded in his boſom during his ſhort voyage; and on his arrival in London, he repaired immediately to the houſe of Mrs. Varnice; for though Rachel had mentioned her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, yet ſhe had forgot to mention the name of the ſtreet to which ſhe had removed; and though ſhe was diſpleaſed with Mrs. Varnice, yet, as ſhe did not know the extent of that woman's vileneſs, ſhe ſpoke of her no farther than to ſay ſhe had reaſon to think both Hamden and herſelf had been miſtaken in her char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter. This was not ſufficient to deter Hamden from going to her houſe, eſpecially as he conceived it the only probable means of finding Rachel. But this viſit did not ſerve to conciliate his affection, or awaken returning tenderneſs. Mrs. Varnice told her own tale. Our poor heroine was repreſented as imprudent, if not guilty, in regard to Oliver; extravagant and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, in her expenſes.</p>
               <p>"Why indeed," ſaid Auberry, "I thought I left her ſufficient to defray every expenſe till my return;
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:034490_0328_0FFF228D243B8EF8"/>
and when I found my ſtay protracted beyond my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, I forwarded her a hundred pounds."</p>
               <p>"Well, who could have thought it?" ſaid Mrs. Varnice; "before ſhe left me, ſhe to my certain knowledge, raiſed money on her watch, rings, brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets."</p>
               <p>"Bracelets?" ſaid Hamden.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes! Lettuce pledged them for her."</p>
               <p>"Cruel, unkind Rachel!"</p>
               <p>"Dear! don't let it diſtreſs you ſo; I ſuppoſe her young friend Oliver helped her off with ſome of the money."</p>
               <p>"Damn him!" ſaid Hamden. "Oh! Rachel, Rachel, why have you uſed me thus? Oh! Mrs. Varnice, if you knew how I loved her, how I adored her! how at this moment her faſcinating image twines around every chord, every fibre of my heart! you would wonder how ſhe could be ſo ungrateful, ſo vile, ſo barbarous."</p>
               <p>Alas! weak, credulous Auberry, had you inſtead of liſtening to this woman's infamous aſperſions, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with ſcorn, and boldly aſſerted the innocence of your wife, and your full confidence in her truth and honour, her accuſer, conſcious of her own guilt and duplicity, would have retired intimidated within herſelf, and ſhrunk from a ſcrutiny, from whence ſhe muſt have been aſſured her own falſehood would ſtand detected. But who will eſpouſe the cauſe of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured wife, when he who has ſolemnly ſworn to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect her from all evil, liſtens with avidity to the voice that defames her, and joins with her worſt enemies to precipitate her into the abyſs of ignominy.</p>
               <p>From the houſe of Mrs. Varnice, Hamden went to the lodging ſhe had laſt occupied, and there, from a converſation with the woman of the houſe, learnt the route Rachel had taken, and with whom; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately, he alſo learnt that ſhe had been viſited almoſt daily by Oliver, during the period of his ſtay in London. Tortured almoſt to madneſs, he reſolved to follow her, upbraid her with her perfidy and cruelty,
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:034490_0329_0FFF228EB04FB4D0"/>
oblige her to relinquiſh the care of the child to him, and take an everlaſting leave of her.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, our heroine was drinking very deeply of the cup of affliction; poverty was her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant companion. The trifle ſhe poſſeſſed, at the time ſhe left the houſe of Spriggins, was ſoon expended, and by degrees the remains of her wardrobe dwindled away, till two cotton gowns, with a change of linen, were the whole of her earthly poſſeſſions. She had inquired for work, but could get none. The dearth of amuſement in a country-town makes every trifle, if wearing the appearance of novelty, become of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; and what ſpreads faſter than a tale of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal? The circumſtance of our heroine's coming from London to Mr. Spriggins, and quitting, the houſe ſo abruptly, had been talked over in almoſt every family in the place, told a hundred different ways, and each narrator adding or altering ſome circumſtance, poor Rachel was looked upon, even by the woman of whom ſhe rented her ſmall apartment, as a ſuſpicious char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter; and had ſhe been inclined to partake the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures of ſociety, ſhe would have found the doors of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every claſs of people ſhut againſt her. But ſhe had ſtill the conſolation of an innocent heart, and a firm faith and reliance on an omniſcient Deity, who would not ſuffer her eventually to periſh. She ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to her afflictions as to the wiſe diſpenſations of his providence, and prayed daily for a more humble, more unrepining ſpirit. She was entirely ignorant alſo, that any ſtigma had been thrown on her repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and conſcious of not deſerving, ſhe feared not the cenſures of a world, which, though ſhe would not wilfully offend, ſhe was but little ſolicitous to pleaſe.</p>
               <p>The neglect of Auberry ſunk the deepeſt into her heart, when her thoughts reverted to the few happy weeks paſt in his ſociety immediately after their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. The tear of bitter remembrance would guſh from her eyes, and as ſhe preſſed her infant to her heart, it bled at every vein, that he, as well as her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhould be ſo totally abandoned by his father.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="unknown:034490_0330_0FFF229047C7E1E0"/>
It was one evening in Auguſt, when Rachel, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lulled her darling to ſleep, the twilight ſtill giving ſufficient light, took her tablets from her pocket, and, as ſhe leaned over a window ſhe had juſt opened to gaze at the ſerenity of an evening, that ſeemed to give pleaſure to the whole creation but her forlorn, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſelf, wrote with her pencil the following lines:
<q>

                  <q>
                     <l>But come, with thy ſenſe-numbing power,</l>

                     <l>Nor leave me till that happy hour,</l>
                     <l>When I ſink to repoſe in the grave!</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>When ſhe had finiſhed, the full ſenſe of her own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſituation ruſhed upon her mind; ſhe reſted her head upon her hand, and, unable to weep, a kind of ſtupor pervaded all her ſenſes; and ſo entirely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:034490_0331_0FFF229465B40210"/>
was ſhe in her own agonizing reflections, that ſhe was as perfectly loſt to every ſurrounding object as if ſhe had been no longer in exiſtence. From this reverie ſhe was arouſed by the cry of her child, and in her haſte to let down the window, ſhe dropped her tablets. It was an awkward circumſtance; for the window looked into a garden belonging to a genteel houſe that was in another ſtreet. It was therefore impoſſible to regain them that night; but ſhe reſolved to go early the enſuing morning to inquire for them; for they had formerly belonged to her mother, and were on that account highly valued by Rachel.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, the next morning, as ſoon as ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined ſhe could gain admittance, ſhe took her child in her arms, and walked round to the front of the houſe. The door was opened by a decent young woman, and Rachel was beginning to ſpeak, when, turning her eyes toward a parlour, the door of which ſtood partly open, ſhe ſaw Archibald Oliver, dreſſed in deep mourning, ſitting at a breakfaſt table, and holding the identical tablets ſhe came to inquire for, in his hand. She was ſurpriſed—ſhe was ſilent.</p>
               <p>"Did you wiſh to ſee my miſtreſs, Ma'am?" ſaid the young woman.</p>
               <p>"Yes!" ſaid Rachel, hardly conſcious that ſhe had anſwered at all.</p>
               <p>There was ſomething in the air and manner of our heroine, that, had ſhe been clothed in the meaneſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, would ſtill have commanded reſpect. The young woman paſſed before her, and courteſying as ſhe puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed open the parlour door, deſired her to walk in, and ſhe would call her miſtreſs immediately. At the ſound of approaching ſteps, Oliver raiſed his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Good God! Mrs. Dacres!" exclaimed he.</p>
               <p>Rachel was fluttered; ſhe could not ſpeak. A lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid ſmile illumined her pallid countenance as ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her hand towards him. But the expreſſive tear that burſt from its gliſtering orbit, contradicted the appearance of tranquillity the ſmile was meant to convey.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="unknown:034490_0332_0FFF22976FA4F1F8"/>
"How is it, Mr. Oliver," ſaid ſhe, when ſhe could command her voice, "that I ſee you here?"</p>
               <p>"A very unhappy circumſtance brought me and ſtill detains me here," he replied. Rachel glanced her eye over his fable dreſs. Jeſſy darted into her mind.</p>
               <p>"Your ſiſter!" ſaid ſhe eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Is well," interrupted he, at once comprehending her fears, at leaſt I have no reaſon to think to the contrary; but Mrs. Oliver is no more."</p>
               <p>His voice faltered; Rachel was ſilent; ſhe knew the folly and impertinence of common-place conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Oliver recovered himſelf, and having learnt from our heroine every occurrence that had taken place ſince he ſaw her in London, he in return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her, that friendſhip for a very particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of her's had brought him to that place—</p>
               <p>"An acquaintance of mine?" ſaid Rachel.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Lieutenant Courtney."</p>
               <p>"Courtney! You aſtoniſh me; I thought he was gone to India."</p>
               <p>"He had an appointment of that kind, which was procured him by lord M—; but ſome diſcoveries which he made after he had even joined his ſhip, and had received ſailing orders, compelled him to quit his appointment, throw up his commiſſion, and follow his unprincipled wife to this place. Lord M. has a ſeat at Alnwick, which is only a ſhort ride from hence, and Courtney having obtained ſufficient teſtimony of her depravity and his own diſhonour, came to me, and aſked my advice in what manner he ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. See your wife, ſaid I, and remonſtrate with her. I will go with you. He ſeemed inclined to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my advice, and we rode together toward this place. When we had proceeded a few miles, we ſaw a chariot and four driving furiouſly along; the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries beſpoke it the equipage of lord M. Courtney no ſooner ſaw it, than, clapping ſpurs to his horſe, he gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopped from me, and before I could get up with him, had ſtopped the carriage in which was Mrs. Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:034490_0333_0FFF2298FB275F20"/>
and his Lordſhip. The irritated, impetuous huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had dragged the ignoble peer from the carriage, and, drawing a caſe of piſtols, preſented him one, whilſt with the other he prepared to defend himſelf, when one of the footmen ſtruck him acroſs the head with the end of a whip, and he fell lifeleſs to the ground. Lord M. ſprang into his carriage again and drove off, leaving me with my ſervant to take what care we could of poor Courtney. We were nearer this place than we were to Alnwick, and placing him on the horſe before John, with great difficulty we got him here. This houſe is kept by a woman who nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my wife; and as I thought he would be quieter and better attended here than in a public inn, I had him brought hither. The wound on his head is deep, but the ſurgeon does not think him in ſo much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the effect of that as from the violent pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of his mind.</p>
               <p>Rachel liſtened with aſtoniſhment to this detail, and was ſo entirely abſorbed in reflection on the ſtrange incidents Oliver related, that when the miſtreſs of the houſe entered, and requeſted to know what her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were, ſhe had totally forgotten the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that had brought her to the houſe. She heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated bluſhed; at length, caſting her eyes on the breakfaſt table, ſhe ſaw the object of her inquiry; but the conſciouſneſs of her embarraſſed, awkward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſo increaſed her confuſion, that the inquiries ſhe made for her tablets had more the appearance of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge than truth. However, the maid having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that Mr. Oliver had picked them up in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, they were delivered to our heroine, who, having expreſſed a deſire to ſee Courtney, and promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in the afternoon for that purpoſe, took her leave.</p>

to imagine ſhe came to viſit him, or Courtney, as ſhe ſeemed ſo perfectly acquainted with both.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon, Rachel determined to ſee Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. She had no idea that impropriety could be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to a viſit which ſhe conceived to be an act of duty; and when ſhe found him ſo extremely ill as to need the moſt conſtant and tender attention; when ſhe diſcovered that it was in her power to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> his afflicted heart, and ſmooth the bed of pain, by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of friendly aſſiduity; forgetting every thing but that ſhe had once been under obligations to him, ſhe reſolved herſelf to be his attendant till he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſtrength ſufficient to enable him to return to his mother and ſiſters. Thus every morning ſhe repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the chamber of the ſick man, nurſing him with the affection of a ſiſter, and adminiſtering to him the conſolation of a friend.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Spriggins and her unprincipled gueſt were mean enough to employ their ſervants to inquire in the neighbourhood after our heroine, and be conſtant ſpies upon her actions. That ſhe was often, nay, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt continually at the houſe where Oliver was, and where Courtney lay ſick, they were aſſured of; and though they knew that ſhe conſtantly returned to her ſolitary apartment to her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which were ſcanty enough, and that ſhe was always at home at an early hour in the evening, yet they failed not to attribute to motives the moſt degrading to the ſex, a condúct which was the reſult of pure benevolence, and did honour to her heart, however it proved, that her head was not too much ſtored with worldly prudence and knowledge.</p>
               <p>Things were exactly in this ſituation, when Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Auberry arrived in ſearch of a woman, whom, one moment, he was ready to kneel and worſhip, and the next, to call down everlaſting wrath upon her.</p>
               <p>It may eaſily be imagined, that the ſtory told by Mrs. Spriggins, Mrs. Courtney and family did not tend to ſoften his heart towards her; ſo far from it, he poured forth a torrent of execrations, and vowed never to ſee her more. But when he had returned to his inn, and muſed a few moments, he thought he
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:034490_0335_0FFF229DB9ED7BA8"/>
would ſee her once more, upbraid her, and bid her an everlaſting farewel; he had learnt in what quarter of the town ſhe lodged, and at the duſk of the evening went to the houſe and inquired for her. She was not at home. At eight o'clock he called again; ſtill ſhe was not returned. Having obtained a direction to the houſe where he was told ſhe ſpent every day, and having aſſured himſelf that was the reſidence of Oliver, he determined to keep watch before the door, and be himſelf an eye-witneſs of her leaving it, and at what hour. Long and weariſome was the night, and horrible were the feelings of Auberry. About twelve o'clock, he determined to leave her to her fate, and return with all ſpeed to London; but before he had reached the inn, deſire of revenge impelled him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. 'I will tear her from the arms of Oliver,' ſaid he, 'and wreak my vengeance on both her and her paramour;' but then the memory of his child croſſed his imagination, and with it the fond recollection of what the mother was when he firſt knew her; a flood of tenderneſs ruſhed over his ſoul, and he wept like an infant.</p>
               <p>In this diſtracted manner did Auberry paſs the night, and the dawn of day found him ſitting on the ſteps of a door oppoſite to the lodgings of Oliver. He roſe from the cold, damp ſeat, and with a heavy heart was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a laſt look at the houſe, when the door opened gently, and Rachel herſelf, with her child in her arms, came out.</p>
               <p>Though during the whole night Hamden had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his wife was there, yet ſomething like hope had ſometime led him to think he might have been deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhe might ſtill be innocent; but this ocular proof was beyond all doubt. He reeled againſt a poſt, ſtaggered and fell.</p>
               <p>Rachel ſaw him; but, wrapped in a coarſe great coat which he had borrowed at the inn, with his hat ſlapped, it was impoſſible, by the faint glimmer of the twilight, ſhe ſhould know him; ſhe imagined it to be an inebriated perſon, juſt endeavouring to return home; and fearful, ſhould ſhe be obſerved by him at that early hour, that he might in ſome reſpect or other
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:034490_0336_0FFF22A00ADD8E20"/>
be rude to her, ſhe quickened her ſteps, and before Auberry was ſufficiently recovered to ſpeak or riſe from the ground, ſhe was out of ſight, and in a few moments reached her own habitation. A little girl, who was up on ſome particular occaſion, let her in, and ſhe threw herſelf on the bed, in hopes to obtain ſome repoſe, while Auberry returned to the inn, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a haſty letter to her, which he left, with orders that it ſhould be ſent by eight o'clock in the morning. He then ordered a chaiſe and four, and proceeded with all the rapidity of ſuch a conveyance to London, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſtopping even for refreſhment, as though he thought, by the velocity of the movement, to leave his cares behind, or loſe the remembrance of them, by attending to the various objects that paſſed in quick ſucceſſion before him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Rachel had enjoyed about two hours ſleep, and felt herſelf greatly refreſhed; for the fatigue and anxiety of the night had exhauſted both her ſpirits and ſtrength. She had attended as uſual the day before at the bedſide of Courtney; towards, noon he had ariſen, and was removed for the benefit of the air into an adjoining apartment, and placed in an eaſy chair near the window. The noiſe of horſes drew his attention towards the ſtreet. He looked out, and ſaw his wife, accompanied by lord M. on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, attended by two ſervants in rich liveries. She raiſed her eyes, ſaw the emaciated figure of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, pointed him out to her diſſolute companion, and both burſt into a loud laugh. Courtney was unequal to the ſhock; he attempted to ſpeak, but his voice failed him; he gaſped, groaned, and fell to the floor. Alarming faintings ſucceeded each other, and he was reduced to ſuch a ſtate of weakneſs, that the medical gentleman who attended him imagined it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible that he ſhould live through the night. Was it poſſible for Rachel in ſuch a ſituation to leave him? No! She had not been treated with ſufficient reſpect by the miſtreſs of the houſe where ſhe lodged, to make her think it neceſſary to ſend any meſſage to her concerning her ſtaying out, or her reaſons for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="unknown:034490_0337_0FFF22A19920E068"/>
Towards morning, Courtney fell into a quiet ſleep, and Oliver entreated Rachel to retire, and endeavour to take ſome repoſe. Acting from motives the moſt pure and even commendable, without a thought or wiſh in the ſmalleſt title derogatory to virtue, Rachel had no apprehenſion of incurring cenſure from any. How ſurpriſed was ſhe then, on awaking in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to read the following note, which was brought to her by the little girl who had let her in.</p>
               <p>"Miſstreſs Dakirs, after the adventer of laſt nite, you cant ſuppos I will ſuffer you to ſtay any longer in my ouſe, wich is a oneſt ouſe; and furdermore, I does not expect you to go without paying me every fardin of what you oe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>me. You muſt go meditly, as I does not want women of your ſort in my ouſe no longer."</p>
               <p>Rachel was really ſo totally unconſcious of evil, that ſhe was at a loſs to think what the woman meant by "the adventure of laſt night;" but going to her to inquire, was ſo overwhelmed with abuſe, that, weeping, trembling, almoſt fainting, ſhe retreated from the houſe leaving every thing behind her to ſatiſfy the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of her inhuman landlady.</p>
               <p>As ſhe was going out of the door, ſhe met the porter with her huſband's letter. She took it, broke the ſeal, and read that he had been there, that he had ſeen her, that he believed her loſt to virtue, and that he abandoned her forever. Overcome by ſenſations the moſt agonizing, ſhe ſat down on the ſteps of the door. The letter remained open in her hand; her eyes were riveted to it, and only that ſhe breathed, ſhe might have been taken for a ſtatue of fixed and mute deſpair. How long ſhe would have remained in this ſituation is uncertain, or whether, ſinking into inſenſibility, ſhe would not have loſt all conſciouſneſs of her miſery, had not the woman with the diabolical malice of a fiend opened the door, and bade her begone from the ſtep. Arouſed from her lethargy of grief, ſhe aroſe, folded her child to her boſom, and bowing her head in meek reſignation, the ſorrows of her heart found vent at her eyes, and ſhe obeyed in ſilence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="unknown:034490_0338_0FFF22A41C2189C0"/>
And what was there, in this moment of anguiſh, to ſupport the ſinking ſpirits of our afflicted heroine? Conſcious innocence! And whilſt humbled to the very duſt, ſhe could look up with hope and confidence to Him who is a rock of defence to the injured, a ſure help to thoſe who truſt in him.</p>
               <p>Wounded pride would have first impelled her to hide herſelf from Oliver, as ſhe diſcovered, from the unconnected ſcrawl left by Auberry, that it was of him he was jealous, and had it been only for herſelf that ſhe was intereſted, ſhe would moſt likely have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered every degree of miſery before ſhe would have aſked relief of any one; but her child, the ſon of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry, the lawful heir to large poſſeſſions, for his ſake ſhe was reſolved to ſtifle her feelings, and endeavour to convince his cruel father that he had injured her in the moſt unwarrantable manner.</p>
               <p>She therefore went immediately to his lodgings, and calming her perturbed ſpirits as much as ſhe poſſibly could, thus addreſſed him:—"Mr. Oliver, I am neceſſitated to requeſt the loan of a few guineas, at the ſame time that I tell you it is more than prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able I may never be able to repay you. Something has taken place this morning, which obliges me in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to forbear ſeeing you, or giving any farther at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on our unfortunate friend."</p>
               <p>"Good heavens!" ſaid Oliver, ſtruck with her pale countenance, ſwollen eyes and evident agitation; "what can be the matter? Wherever you are going, do no refuſe me the ſatiſfaction of knowing, that I may be able to aſſiſt, protect, comfort, be a brother to you."</p>
               <p>"It is impoſſible," ſaid ſhe, "the world will not ſuffer it."</p>
               <p>He comprehended the meaning of her words, and without reply tendered her his purſe. She took five guineas from it, and then requeſting to ſee Courtney, of whom ſhe took a ſilent leave, ſhe departed, leaving Oliver aſtoniſhed and affected at her conduct. He muſed a few moments, and then thinking, however rigid propriety might forbid her to viſit the houſe he
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:034490_0339_0FFF22A81E3DCE58"/>
inhabited, or receive viſits from him, yet it did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him following and diſcovering her retreat, where he might ſupply her with all the neceſſaries and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of life. He ſnatched his hat, and ruſhed into the ſtreet; but he was too late; Rachel was no longer in ſight, nor could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> diſcover which way ſhe had gone.</p>
               <p>Our heroine walked to a poor cottage about a mile from the town, inhabited only by an old woman and her daughter. Here ſhe agreed to board at a very low rate for a few days, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ſat down to write to her huſband. She endeavoured to explain circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that appeared ſuſpicious; but to think that Auberry ſuſpected her honour, gave her ſuch inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible anguiſh, that ſhe was frequently obliged to lay down her pen and weep. At length ſhe finiſhed, earneſtly conjuring, if not for her own, yet for his child's ſake, he would ſend her ſome relief, nor ſuffer them to expire with want, or languiſh out their lives in poverty and obſcurity.</p>
               <p>This letter ſhe directed to a coffee-houſe in London, which ſhe knew he frequented, and requeſting an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to be directed to the poſt-office at Newark, ſhe left her infant in the charge of her old hoſteſs, went herſelf and put her own letter in, inquiring at the ſame time when ſhe might expect an anſwer.</p>
               <p>When ſhe returned to her humble home, fatigue, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of heart, and the violent emotions ſhe had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced during the day had ſo far overcome her, that ſhe went to bed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> indiſpoſed, and after a night of reſtleſs agitation, ſhe awoke from a ſhort ſlumber ſo ill, as to be unable to riſe.</p>
               <p>From that time, a period of three weeks was a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal blank to Rachel. A fever, accompanied by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium, brought her to the verge of the grave; but the tenderneſs of her good old hoſteſs and her daughter, co-operating with a naturally good conſtitution, and the attendance of ſkilful man of medicine, at length triumphed over the diſorder, and ſhe returned to life and a renewed ſenſe of her ſorrows.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing ſhe thought of was her expected letter. She diſpatched the young cottager to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:034490_0340_0FFF22AA6BAA2960"/>
to inquire for it; ſhe returned empty handed; there was no letter there. Thus day after day paſſed on. The five guineas Rachel had borrowed of Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were totally expended during her illneſs, and no letter arriving from her huſband, ſhe was once more pennyleſs, but not totally friendleſs. The poor inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants of the cottage were <hi>Christian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> Had ſhe been ſtained with a thouſand errors, they would not have thought it right to remember them when ſhe was bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the earth by affliction. Their whole poſſeſſions were, the cottage, ſmall garden, a cow and two ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wheels; but they dried the tear from her eyes by the voice of kindneſs, and told her ſhe ſhould be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to ſhare their humble fare till returning health enabled her to join their labours for ſubſiſtence, if nothing better offered. During her illneſs, the old cottager had found Auberry's letter, and wiſhing to gain ſome intelligence concerning her family, had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſed it.</p>
               <p>"She may be guilty," ſaid ſhe, "but I have no right to judge her. She is ſick and afflicted; it is therefore my duty to nurſe and comfort her." She then returned the letter to the pocket from whence ſhe took it, nor even after Rachel's recovery did ſhe ſuffer her to imagine, by any word, look or hint, that ſhe had ſeen it.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as Rachel had gathered ſtrength ſufficient to enable her to attempt it, with ſlow and uneven ſteps ſhe proceeded to Newark, determined to make inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry herſelf concerning a letter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or ſhe thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Auberry to abandon her and his child to abſolute want.</p>
               <p>She went to the office, and was told no ſuch letter was there. "Are you certain, Sir?" ſaid ſhe; "it muſt have been here ſome time, if it is here at all. Pray look amongſt the letters that lay in the office; it is of more conſequence to me than you can imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. It is directed to Mrs. Dacres, to be left here till called for."</p>
               <p>A young man hearing her repeat the name of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, turned over a parcel of letters, and preſented to
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:034490_0341_0FFF22ABF690D770"/>
the trembling hands of our heroine the long-expected epiſtle from her huſband.</p>
               <p>Rachel opened it; a hundred pound bank note dropped from it! She attempted to read it, but a miſt came over her eyes; ſhe reeled, and would have fallen, but the young man caught her. He called for water, and an interior door opening, a young woman, very plainly habited, ruſhed out, ſupported and preſſed to her boſom the lifeleſs, inanimate form, calling on her to revive by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>Leaning on the arm of this dear friend, and hardly daring to truſt her ſenſes leſt it ſhould prove an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Rachel retired into a ſmall, neat parlour, where ſhe ſoon regained ſufficient compoſure to peruſe her letter.

               <p>"But ſhould I ever return to the gay world, my young aſſociates will, I have no doubt, be ſurpriſed that I ſhould have eloped from my father's houſe changed my name, and ſecluded myſelf above a year and a half in a cottage, yet never have met with a ſingle adventure, or made one conqueſt; nay, if you will believe me, the impenetrable ruſtics have entirely overlooked my beauty and accompliſhments; and though I have appeared regularly every Sunday, when the weather permitted, at the pariſh church, the Squire has not once noticed me, and I have remained entirely unmoleſted.</p>
               <p>"But I am weary of this dull ſameneſs of ſcene, and you and I will now ſet out together in ſearch of adventures. This mad brained, harum-ſcarum huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of yours, though I think he little deſerves ſuch attention from us, yet we will e'en go after him. For if we ſhould not find him, we may perhaps find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body elſe that will be glad to ſee us."</p>
               <p>Rachel comprehending that Jeſſy meant Reuben, replied with additional penſiveneſs, "Alas! my dear girl, I have never heard from my brother ſince he left England."</p>
               <p>"So I underſtand," ſaid Jeſſy, ſtill forcing a ſmile, while her eyes were brimfull of tears; "but I cannot repreſs a fond hope, which almoſt amounts to a belief,
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:034490_0344_0FFF22B302C1BFE0"/>
that he is ſtill in exiſtence, and that we ſhall one day meet again. As to Archibald, it will not be proper to let him know of our deſign till it is too late for him to overtake and accompany us; for that would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw my whole plan of reconcilement between you and Auberry. And ſhould the worſt come to the worſt, there is ſtill my little annuity; we will live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, my dear Rachel, in humble, but contented in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence. What our income will not procure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry ſhall ſupply. We will ſtudy to fulfil the duties of our lowly ſtation, and, enjoying the ſweet conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an approving conſcience, hold the trifling mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that is in general termed the <hi>world,</hi> in ſo little eſtimation, as neither to court its ſmiles or fear its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures."</p>
               <p>This was a plan too agreeable to the feelings of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel not to be immediately cloſed with. This re-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of friendſhip, with a perſon ſo dear to her heart as Jeſſy Oliver, ſeemed to eaſe her boſom of half its load. A very ſhort time ſufficed for the ſettlement of every concern, either of Miſs Oliver or our hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and on the ſecond morning after their meeting they were on their road to London. Rachel left am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple teſtimony with her aged hoſteſs at the cottage, that whatever her other errors might have been, ſhe was not guilty of the ſin of ingratitude. Arrived in London, they made every inquiry after Auberry, and learnt that he had been departed above a fortnight, and it was univerſally believed to America.</p>
               <p>It was late in the ſeaſon for veſſels to cross the boiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Atlantic ocean; the two fair friends could hear of none likely to ſail to the port they wiſhed, under a month or ſix weeks. This appeared to the anxious and impatient Rachel an eternity; and being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a ſhip would go from Liverpool in the courſe of ten days, they purſued their journey for that place, and arrived juſt in time to ſecure a paſſage, as the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was to ſail the following morning.</p>
               <p>Reduced as our heroine was by illneſs, this long journey was almoſt too much for her ſtrength; but Jeſſy Oliver had fine ſpirits, and a conſtitution which,
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:034490_0345_0FFF22B48F91AC08"/>
though not robuſt, could ſupport great fatigue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinking under it. They alighted at the inn, and reſolved to indulge in a few hours reſt before their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation, where we will leave them and make ſome little inquiry after Auberry.</p>
               <p>When he had diſpatched his letter with the money to Rachel, he waited with the utmoſt impatience the arrival of the time in which he might expect her. He had in the firſt hurry of jealouſy, rage and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſold his commiſſion, and taken a paſſage on board a ſhip bound to Philadelphia, determined never more to viſit his native country, where every bright proſpect of his youth had been untimely blaſted. The reception of his wife's letter awakened all his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for her. Rachel in want, depreſſed, ſick, broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, was ever before his eyes. 'She may yet be innocent.' cried he; the very ſuppoſition ſeemed to give him comfort; 'yet the proofs of her depravity were ſo inconteſtable—' here his heart glowed with reſentment; 'I will at leaſt ſend her the means of coming immediately to me. If ſhe comes, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her with affection, if not, I will endeavour to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that I ever knew her.' In this frame of mind he wrote the letter which conveyed the money to our he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roine.</p>
               <p>But when day after day paſſed, and no tidings of her neither by letter or any other means, he conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe was totally abandoned, and in deſpair of ever knowing peace again, he embarked on his intended voyage. But tempeſtuous weather enſuing, and the brig in which he embarked being rather ancient, ſprung a leak, and they put into Liverpool to refit; where Auberry, giving way to the deſpair that prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his mind, ſunk into a ſtate of inanity. Both mind and body became debilitated; a hectic fever ſlowly undermined his conſtitution; and when the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was ready to depart, he was too ill to make the voyage, and ſuffered her to go without him. He had gone to his mother immediately on his arrival in Liverpool, where he explained to her all his cauſe for ſorrow, and felt every would bleed afreſh as he peruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:034490_0346_0FFF22B8B59C1B18"/>
ſome letters from Belle Webſter, which tended highly to criminate his wife. Doctor Lenient was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the time of his arrival; a ſmall eſtate had been left him in Ireland, and he had croſſed the channel in order to take poſſeſſion and ſettle ſome very material buſineſs.</p>
               <p>When Hamden had been with his mother about three weeks, the Doctor returned, ſurpriſed to ſee his nephew, and more ſurpriſed at his very rueful appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. He inquired what he had been doing to alter himſelf ſo. "I have ruining myſelf," ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry.</p>
               <p>"Odſo! I hope not," replied the good-hearted Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. "What, have you been gambling?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, in the lottery of life, and have drawn a blank. In ſhort, my dear uncle, I have married a woman with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either family or fortune, and am diſcarded by my aunt; but that I could have borne, had my wife been faithful."</p>
               <p>"Odds my life!" ſaid the Doctor, "matrimony ſeems no improver of happineſs; for this is the ſecond tale of miſery I have heard to-day. What think you, ſiſter? juſt as I landed from the packet, I ſaw two women ſtanding on the ſhore, ready to ſtep into a boat that was waiting. One countenance I knew inſtantly; for though pale and greatly emaciated, there was ſtill that character of ſenſibility and virtue impreſſed upon it for which I uſed to admire it. It was our unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate young friend Rachel Dudley."</p>
               <p>Hamden gaſped for breath, but he ſuffered the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to proceed without interruption. "She had a fine boy in her arms," continued the Doctor, "apparently about four months old and ſpite of all we have heard, I felt myſelf impelled to ſpeak to her. Her compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion was Miſs Oliver, whom we heard had eloped from her father's houſe, and who has not been heard of by her family for above a twelvemonth."</p>
               <p>"Well, Sir," cried Auberry impatiently, "but what of Rachel."</p>
               <p>"Why I'll tell you," ſaid the Doctor, taking off his wig and deliberately putting on his crimſon velvet
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:034490_0347_0FFF22BA478F5550"/>
cap, and without noticing the emotions of Hamden; "when I went up to her, and aſked her how ſhe did, ſhe ſaid her hand on her boſom, and with a look I ſhall never forget, anſwered, "Neither well nor happy, Doctor."</p>
               <p>"I am ſorry, my poor girl," ſaid I, "for ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that I underſtand have taken place, and knowing your extreme ſenſibility, cannot be ſurpriſed that they have injured both your health and peace of mind. But where are you going now?"</p>
               <p>"To America," ſaid ſhe, "in purſuit of my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band."</p>
               <p>"You are married, then," ſaid I.</p>
               <p>"Yes," ſhe replied, and fixing her eyes on my face, "did you not know it?"</p>
               <p>"No, how ſhould I? I have been in Ireland theſe two months paſt. Juſt then the ſailors called to her to get into the boat. She tendered me her hand."</p>
               <p>"God bleſs you, my good Doctor," ſaid ſhe. I ſhook her hand, helped her in, and—"</p>
               <p>"And ſhe is really gone, then," cried Hamden frantickly.</p>
               <p>The Doctor raiſed his eyes; the agitated counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his nephew alarmed him. "Yes, I believe ſo," ſaid he in a doubtful tone; "but why does it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect you thus.?"</p>
               <p>"Why does it affect me? Oh! Sir, I am the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of Rachel! It is me ſhe is gone in purſuit of. I have deſerted, abandoned, forſaken her; I thought her depraved; I was told—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and ſo have I been told," ſaid the Doctor with vehemence ſtriking his hand on the elbow of his chair; "but after beholding her meek, expreſſive countenance, where candour and purity are ſtamped on every feature; after ſeeing her emaciated frame, and hearing her tremulous, plaintive accents, I would not believe the ſmalleſt tittle to her diſadvantage, though millions joined to affirm it! Young man, you have been haſty, and blinded by paſſion; have thrown away a pearl of ineſtimable price."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="unknown:034490_0348_0FFF22BC95FDF1A0"/>
Hamden's feelings were now too great for utterance. His mother ſoothed him; but Dr. Lenient, who hated family pride, blamed the whole of his conduct; and though before he went to bed he preſcribed ſomething to compoſe the agitated ſpirits of Auberry, yet when retired, his thoughts were wholly occupied by Rachel, wandering without a proper protector, in ſearch of a man who had wantonly ſacrificed her happineſs and reputation on the altar of ambition and intereſt.</p>

               <p>WE left Reuben in captivity, employing every leiſure moment in expanding the mind and cultivating the talents of Eumea. In this manner ſix weary months paſſed on, and ſtill no hope of emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. At the end of this period, tidings arrived that the Indian chiefs had been guilty of a breach of the European laws, and in conſequence had ſuffered death. The ſachem called a council of his elders and chieftains, and it was determined that Reuben and his unhappy companions ſhould on the enſuing morning be bound to the ſtake, and ſuffer thoſe inhuman tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which none but ſavages could inflict, and none but ſavages ſubmit to, without an endeavour to be avenged of thoſe who inflict them.</p>
               <p>Eumea was in the wigwam at the time this horrid ſentence was paſſed; her heart ſunk; there were but a few hours to intervene before it was to be put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. In the dead of night, ſhe entered the wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wam of our hero.</p>
               <p>"Engliſhmen," ſaid ſhe, "awake, get up; danger and death are at hand; haſte, quit this place, flee into the woods that ſkirt the mountains, and the God of

the Chriſtians go with you." In a few words ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to them the neceſsity of their immediate flight, and directing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſkulking in caves, or deep woods, feeding on wild fruit, and even glad to make a meal of acorn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> terrified by the ruſtling of the leaves, or the ſteps of wild though inoffenſive animals, natives of the uncultivated tracts through which they were obliged to paſs.</p>
               <p>After three weeks weariſome journey, they at length arrived at a European ſettlement; but ſo reduced through famine and fatigue, that it ſeemed as though they were only arrived at a place of ſafety that they might reſt from all their cares in death. Even the ſtrength and ſpirits of O'Neil began to flag, and he bitterly regretted that he was no longer able to cheer, attend and comfort his dear maſter.</p>
               <p>But what was the ſurpriſe of Reuben, when, the day after his arrival at this place, he ſaw Eumea enter the apartment where he was. He raiſed himſelf from the bed on which he was reclining, and in a voice that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed at once ſurpriſe and pleaſure, exclaimed, "Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea here! what ſtrange incident!" She ſtopped him, took hold of his hand, and looking earneſtly in his face—</p>
               <p>"Is it ſtrange that I ſhould follow you; (ſaid ſhe) were not you my inſtructor, my more than father, my friend, and was it poſſible Eumea could ſtay behind you and live? Do not look angry; I know I have done wrong; for you taught me to love, reſpect, and never forſake my father and mother. I tried to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your precepts, I tried to obey your injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but, alas! the ſilent night was witneſs to my anguiſh, and the riſing ſun could not dry the dew from my eyelids. If I ſlept, I ſaw you, liſtened to you, and was happy. Fleeting joy! that but embittered
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:034490_0350_0FFF22BFADDB70E0"/>
the moment of awaking! The flowers you had gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered for me the day before you left me, I bound upon my breaſt next my heart; I have worn them there ever ſince; they withered and dried, but every day I refreſh them with my tears. One morning, juſt as the day appeared, I aroſe, took my bow and arrows, and reſolved to follow you. My mother was ſtill aſleep; I looked at her, I knelt beſide her; but I dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not kiſs her left ſhe ſhould awake. I would have prayed, but you had told me that an undutiful child could never be a favourite of our heavenly Father; ſo I preſſed my hands on my heart, which throbbed ſo loud, it ſeemed to ſay, Oh! God of the Chriſtians, bleſs my mother! God knows every thought of the heart, and though I dared not pronounce his ſacred name with my lips. perhaps its ſilent petition may be read and anſwered."</p>
               <p>Eumea pauſed; Reuben would have anſwered, but he was at a loſs what to ſay. O'Neil, weak and ill as he was, had moved towards her, and ſitting at her feet, leaning one hand on her knees, his head reſted on it, and his languid eyes were fixed on her face, as he liſtened to her with profound attention.</p>
               <p>"It is my belief," ſaid he, "that God Almighty never turns away from the prayers of an innocent heart; and then to be ſure he knows all we want, when we can't ſpeak to aſk for even a morſel of bread. Oh! if we were only to have what we deſerved, we ſhould find but poor accommodations, in our journey through this world; but you ſee he was ſo good as to ſend people before us, to make every thing comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and all he requires is, that we ſhall in return make things pleaſant and agreeable for them that come after us."</p>
               <p>Reuben could not help ſmiling at O'Neil's moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. Eumea ſeemed loſt in thought, and ſcarcely to have attended to what he ſaid; but when ſhe found he was ſilent, ſhe again addreſſed our hero.</p>
               <p>"So you ſee here I am; but what have I gained by following you? Nothing! for now all that I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered before for your abſence, I now ſeel on account
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:034490_0351_0FFF22C487EE0398"/>
of my mother. But I will not return. No; I could not ſupport my father's unkindneſs, and my mother's reproaches, which would be the more painful becauſe mingled with affection. I will follow you, my dear inſtructor, I will be your handmaid, and love and ſerve you to the laſt hour of my life."</p>
               <p>"And ſo will I," ſaid O'Neil, "and I'll well ſerve you too, my beautiful Indian lady, every day and all the day, and by might too, if ſo be there be neceſſity."</p>
               <p>"And how did you know that you ſhould find me here?" ſaid Reuben.</p>
               <p>"I knew," ſhe replied, "that this was the neareſt ſettlement, and had I not ſound you here, I ſhould have travelled onward to Philadelphia; and had you not been there, I ſhould have thought you had died by the way, and would have ſought you in a better world, the world of ſpirits."</p>
               <p>"You would not, I hope, Eumea, have dared to ruſh unbidden into eternity?" ſaid Reuben.</p>
               <p>"I fear I ſhould," ſhe replied; "for why ſhould we endure life, when the nights are paſt in anguiſh, and every day is a day of ſorrow? When the wintry blaſts howl, when the ſnow falls, and the froſt binds up the lakes; then, when confined to the wigwam, there is no comfort within, but the tempeſt of the paſſions rages more furious than the gale that bows the tall cedars, and ſhakes to the roots the ſtately oak; why ſhould we not ſleep with the inſect or the reptile tribes, that paſs the dreary ſeaſon in inſenſibility? And when the warm ſouthern breeze diſſolves the ice, and bids the trees he green, the bloſſom come; when the blackbird whiſtles mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and the robin begins to dreſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> plumes; if then nor fragrant bloſſom, nor cheerful bird, nor flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeckled field delight the ſenſe, or ſoothe the tortured ſoul, were it not better to ſeek repoſe in other climes, more ſuited to our feelings? Or when the deer ſeeks the deep woods, and pants though lying on the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's brink, when the ſcorching ſun dries the graſs and parches up the ground, where is the harm if, plunging in the wave, we quench the fever that conſumes us, or from our veins let out the blood, that ruſhes with
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:034490_0352_0FFF22C6D6142538"/>
ſuch fury through our frame, ſwelling the heart till it is near to burſting. Or even when the ſeaſon of corn arrives; when cluſters of wild grapes hang on the bending vines; when the berries, blackened by the ſun, peep through the half-faded leaves; when the cool, ſoft breeze of evening, and the ſweet air of the morning, affords refreſhing ſlumbers to the eyelids, or uncloſes them to pleaſing proſpects, that, being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, makes the heart dance with joy—Ah! then if the eyes are dimmed with tears and the heart op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with ſorrow; is it a ſin to ſeek that happy place where we can neither weep nor ſuffer more?"</p>
               <p>"You have profited but little by my inſtructions, Eumea," ſaid Reuben "if you can argue thus."</p>
               <p>"I will follow you, then," ſaid ſhe emphatically, "and endeavour to improve."</p>
               <p>In about a fortnight, our hero and his companions were enough recovered to continue their journey. It was in vain he entreated Eumea to return to her mother, ſhe perſiſted in following him. It was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect that he repreſented to her, that in accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him ſhe would be looked upon with diſreſpect by the European women; her reſolution was taken and was not to be ſhaken.</p>
               <p>The appearance of Reuben and his followers was miſerable in the extreme when they entered Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia; and what added to their miſery was, that amongſt them all they had not a ſingle copper, nor any friends to whom they could apply for aſſiſtance. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn group had croſſed the Schuylkill, and with weary ſteps were approaching the city, when a venerable man of the ſociety of Friends, riding out for exerciſe and air, ſurveyed them with an eye of compaſſion, and ſtopping his horſe—"Friend," ſaid he, addreſſing Reuben, "both thou and thy companions ſeem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued, and appear to have taken a long journey; from whence doſt thou come?"</p>
               <p>"From captivity," ſaid Reuben.</p>
               <p>"Yes," cried O'Neil, who, having recovered his uſual ſpirits, puſhed forward to ſpeak for himſelf; "yes, we have been obliged to pay a pretty long viſit
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:034490_0353_0FFF22C861480118"/>
to the copper-coloured gentlefolks, and if we had not come away as we did, they would have ſcalped us and roaſted us, and then a pretty figure we ſhould have cut! But this dear creature, who, though ſhe is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle darkiſh or ſo, has a heart as beautiful as an angel; ſo ſhe told us what they were about going to do. Said ſhe, Get up, my lads, and run away whilſt you can; for to-morrow you will have no legs to run with. So away we came, and a fine trampooſe we have had. And now we have got here, I don't know that we are much better off; for if they had roaſted us, we ſhould not a lived to be ſtarved to death; for a devil a penny have we got to buy bread."</p>
               <p>"Nevertheleſs," ſaid the benevolent friend, "thou ſhalt not ſtarve. I am not rich; but Heaven forbid that I ſhould ſuffer a fellow-creature to want while I have a morſel to give him, or a blanket to ſpare to ſhelter him from the inclemencies of the weather. I have a houſe on the banks of the Delaware, but a very ſhort diſtance from the city, and its doors were never ſhut againſt the unfortunate; come home with me, then, and bring the good Indian maiden with thee. It matters not to what nation, kindred or people they belong who are in affliction; I feel they are my breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and as ſuch, I will gladly ſhare my own comforts with them."</p>
               <p>They heard with delight the genuine effuſions of mercy and benevolence flow from the lips of the man of peace, and being directed by him, purſued their way to the habitation of hoſpitality.</p>
               <p>"A ſmall manſion, built by frugality and furniſhed by ſimplicity, ſituated on the banks of the Delaware, and ſurrounded by a large and well-cultivated garden, was the dwelling of Stedfaſt Trueman. Elizabeth his wife was not handſome, but there was ſomething in her look, voice and manner, more charming than beauty. Her houſe, her children, herſelf, were pure emblems of neatneſs, innocence and induſtry. She heard that ſome poor gueſts were arrived, directed to their friendly roof by her huſband, came into the kitchen to bid them welcome, and with her own hands
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:034490_0354_0FFF22CAAC506FC8"/>
aſſiſted to ſet forth refreſhment. The children came round them, ſome eagerly curious and inquiſitive, and others timidly ſtanding aloof, to obſerve the ſtrange dreſs and appearance of the travellers.</p>
               <p>In this aſylum, Reuben and his companions ſoon recruited both health and ſpirits. Their benevolent friend ſupplied them with ſome coarſe clothing, the joint product of his farm and his wife's induſtry. In the courſe of converſation our hero mentioned his fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's name.</p>
               <p>"Dudley," ſaid friend Trueman; "I knew him well; a more worthy, honeſt man never exiſted. If thou art his ſon, thou haſt, I fear, been greatly wronged by the man Jacob Holmes. I have reaſon to believe thy father was a man of ſtrict integrity, and that he would not premeditatedly aſſert a falſehood. He did declare to me in confidence every particular of his paſt life, and though he did not boaſt of his good deeds, yet I gathered enough to believe that Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob was the child of his bounty. But the man has ſince ſo boldly and ſolemnly contradicted that belief, that I dare not judge too raſhly; and Heaven forbid that I ſhould condemn him; for, juſt or unjuſt, he is gone to give an account of his ſtewardſhip before Him, who, requiring but humility, juſtice and mercy from his ſervants toward their fellow-creatures, will in no wiſe excuſe thoſe who ſlight his counſels, or break his commandments."</p>
               <p>Reuben was ſurpriſed. "Is Jacob Holmes then dead?" ſaid he.</p>
               <p>"Verily he ſleepeth with his fathers," ſaid True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. "He was greatly hurt about three months ſince, by a fall from his horſe; the bruiſe was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, brought on a ſpitting of blood, which baffled all medical aid, and he went off ſuddenly, when he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf mending. Indeed, I was told he never believed himſelf in danger. More is the pity; the rod of affliction, that warns us of approaching diſſolution, is a ſalutary and neceſſary judgment, that as we bow under the correcting hand, we may implore that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which is never withheld from the penitent ſinner."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="unknown:034490_0355_0FFF22CD081A18C0"/>
"And who inherits his eſtate?" ſaid Reuben.</p>
               <p>"His infant ſon, who with his mother, ſtill reſides in the houſe."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Holmes is a worthy woman," ſaid Reuben, "and poſſeſſes an honeſt ſimplicity of heart extremely intereſting. Oh bounteous Diſpoſer of events," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, and his foul expanded as he ſpoke, "viſit not, I humbly beſeech thee, the ſins of the father upon the child; but may he live to be a comfort to his mother, a friend to the worthy, and thy faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to good old age."</p>
               <p>"Thy pious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, good young man," ſaid True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, "return tenfold on thy own head."</p>
               <p>The unfortunate participators of Reuben's captivity being recruited, departed in ſearch of employment; but himſelf, O'Neil and Eumea were detained in the habitation of friend Trueman, who wiſhed to place our hero in ſome reputable employ, meant to detain O'Neil in his own ſervice, and thought the food and raiment ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to render the Indian maid comfortable, would never be miſſed by his own family. The inquiries he ſet on foot for employment for our hero made it uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally known that he was returned to Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>One morning, as he ſat converſing with Trueman, he was ſurpriſed by the entrance of Mrs. Holmes. She advanced to him with a firm but eager ſtep, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting her hand, "I am glad to ſee thee, friend Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben," ſaid ſhe; "I did not hear of thy return till yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter even, or I ſhould have come to viſit thee before."</p>
               <p>Our hero cordially ſhook her proffered hand, led her to a ſeat, and told her he was happy in an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to renew their acquaintance.</p>
               <p>"I expect thou doſt know already that Jacob Holmes is gone home," ſaid ſhe, her boſom heaving and her eyes ſwimming in tears. Reuben bowed aſſent.</p>
               <p>"Thou haſt no right to regret his departure," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, "but he was the choſen friend of my heart, the father of my child, the ſupport of his family; his loſs to me is irreparable." She pauſed a moment. "I have, ſince his departure," ſhe continued, recovering her voice, "diſcovered amongſt ſome old papers, which
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:034490_0356_0FFF22CF52228460"/>
I do dope and believe he had never inſpected, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted copy of a will, and other accounts of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to thee. Here they are; thou wilt find by them that thou art the real poſſeſſor of Mount Pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. I am ſure I could not be happy to detain it from the lawful owner, and I here relinquiſh all claim to it, and throw both myſelf and child upon your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence." She then untied a handkerchief, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the papers into the hands of Reuben, whoſe feelings on the occaſion cannot eaſily be deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Our hero, thus raiſed almoſt inſtantaneouſly from extreme poverty to a ſtate of eaſe, and indeed (what in thoſe days of moderation was termed) affluence, made it his firſt care to place Mrs. Holmes and her ſon in a comfortable habitation, and to fettle upon them one third of all his father died poſſeſſed of. He placed Eumea with her, who aſſiduouſly endeavoured to conform to the European dreſs, cuſtoms and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but ſhe pined at being ſeparated from Reuben, and if more than two days elapſed without her ſeeing him, ſhe would give way to the moſt violent affliction.</p>
               <p>Our hero had, previous to his campaign againſt the Indians, frequently written to his ſiſter; but theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being directed to the care of Mr. Andrew Atkins, were never forwarded to our heroine; indeed, after the firſt, he might have pleaded in excuſe that he did not know where to find her.</p>
               <p>Reuben made every inquiry at the poſt-office, and of the maſters of veſſels then arriving from England, for letters, but could hear of none addreſſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and he meditated a voyage to his native place, in order to bring his ſiſter over, and ſometimes indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fond hope, that Jeſſy Oliver might accompany her. But as he had much to ſettle previous to tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long a voyage, he deferred it till the enſuing ſpring.</p>
               <p>His friend, Stedfaſt Trueman, had made a purchaſe of ſome land ſituated in New-Jerſey, near the mouth of the Delaware; he thought it neceſſary to viſit it this autumn, and plan out the improvements he meant ſhould take place in the ſpring. He invited Reuben
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:034490_0357_0FFF22D105734380"/>
to accompany him on this excurſion, and he, wiſhing to ſee a little of that part of the country, aſſented. Their journey was extremely pleaſant; but on the day preceding that they had ſettled for their return to Philadelphia, a cold ſtorm, ſuch as often precedes or accompanies the ſun's autumnal paſſage acroſs the equinox, commenced, and they reſolved to tarry till its fury was abated. On the evening of the ſecond day, it was increaſed to a tremendous degree, not blowing ſteadily, but in guſts, that threw the ocean into horrible convulſions, heaping up vaſt mountainous waves that ſeemed to threaten heaven, and leaving hollow chaſms, in which the veſſels (which they could plainly deſcry from the windows of the houſe they were in) ſeemed often to be loſt, though in a moment after they appeared again on the ſummit of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wave.</p>
               <p>Friend Trueman and our hero were greatly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the evident diſtreſs in which ſeveral ſmall barks appeared; they ſtood anxiouſly watching them, till the curtain of night ſhut them from their view. The houſe they were in was ſituated at the entrance of Great Egg-Harbour; and as the ſtorm abated in ſome tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling degree towards morning, Reuben and his friend aroſe with the earlieſt dawn, to ſee if any ſigns of wrecks were apparent, or if they could be of any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the ſuffering mariners, who might, if luckily they eſcaped ſuch a cataſtrophe, be in want of friends and aſſiſtance. They wrapped themſelves in their great coats, and walked towards the ſea, where they preſently deſcribed a ſhip dreadfully ſhattered, endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring to make the harbour. Her foremaſt and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topmaſt were gone; ſome of her ſails, torn in atoms, were fluttering in the wind, and the few ſhe could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand were ſcarcely manageable.</p>
               <p>Long they laboured, for ſome hours oppoſed both by wind and tide; at length the latter turned in her favour, and ſhe fetched in, but not without making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſignals of diſtreſs; and it was very evident, as ſhe approached the ſhore, that ſhe laboured heavily in the water, and all the ſpectators concluded ſhe was in
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:034490_0358_0FFF22D290C61528"/>
danger of ſinking. The ſea ran ſo high, no boat could, without imminent riſk, go to the aſſiſtance of the wretched crew. At length a fiſhing boat ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off. The people on board had thrown out an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, but ſhe dragged it, and the wind ſetting acroſs the harbour, ſhe was making ſtern foremoſt to the ſhore. Juſt as the boat reached her, ſhe ſtruck, and the cries of the affrighted ſailors and paſſengers reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ears of thoſe who ſtood on the ſhore, waiting in ſuſpenſe and horror to behold the fate of ſo fine a ſhip and her unfortunate company. Several women were ſeen on the deck, and the ſpectators ſeemed as though they could have given their own lives to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the lives of the ſufferers.</p>
               <p>When the boat reached the ſhip, the people ruſhed over the ſides into her; the women were helped in, and in a few moments their ſituation was as perilous from having overloaded the boat, as it had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the veſſel. However, they put off, and made towards the ſhore; the wind favoured them, and the ſpectators exultingly cried, In five minutes they will be all ſafe; but in a much leſs time, a ſudden flaw took the ſails; from the number of perſons on board, the fiſhermen could not ſlack the ſheets in time, and ſhe overſet.</p>
               <p>All the aim of thoſe on ſhore was now to ſave, if poſſible, the lives of ſome, who, borne by the foaming ſurge, ſeemed almoſt to reach the land, when the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding wave would daſh them back into the dread abyſs of waters. Spars faſtened by ropes were thrown into the ſea, while a number of men on ſhore ſtood ready to drag them to land, ſhould any deſpairing wretch ſeize them as the means of deliverance. Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben was buſied in this humane endeavour, when he heard a ſhout of exultation from a group of men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſame manner at a little diſtance. They waved alſo for more help. He therefore quitted his own party, which was more numerous, and ran to their aſſiſtance, when he perceived that two women had been already ſnatched from a watery grave, and
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:034490_0359_0FFF22D66B61BE50"/>
ſeveral men were, by the help of the ſpars, near the ſhore.</p>
               <p>"Here," ſaid the maſter of the houſe at which they lodged, "here, take this poor infant, and carry it to the houſe, bid my dame make up a large fire in every room, and get all the beds ready. You muſt ſleep on the floor to-night, Sir."</p>
               <p>Reuben claſped the poor little dripping infant to his naked breaſt, wrapped his coat round it, and was delighted to find, by a faint moaning noiſe it made, that in all probability it would recover. He ran to the houſe, gave the child into the care of a kind-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Negro wench, and then returned to help the two women. One was entirely ſenſeleſs, for ſhe had drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on the very moment ſhe reached the ſhore; the other was unable to walk or ſpeak, but yet could make ſigns that her ſenſes were perfect. Reuben aſſiſted to carry them in, gave them in charge to the women of the houſe, and then returned to the ſea ſide; but ſoon perceiving nothing more was to be done, he came back to inquire after the little traveller.</p>
               <p>"The women are both recovered," ſaid a man, as he entered the houſe.</p>
               <p>"I am glad of it," ſaid Reuben; "might I be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſpeak to them; they are no doubt Engliſh women, and will rejoice to find a countryman ſo near them, who is willing and ready to render them any ſervice."</p>
               <p>This meſſage was carried to the ladies, and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was admitted. They were in ſeparate beds in the ſame room. Reuben drew near that which was next the door; the perſon who occupied it raiſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf partly, and exclaiming, "It is! it is my broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er!" threw herſelf into his arms, which, ſinking on the bed beſide her, he had extended to receive her; for the moment he beheld her face, he recognized his ſiſter, and the exclamation of 'Dear Reuben!' 'beloved Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel!' mutually eſcaped their lips as they burſt into a flood of tears.</p>
               <p>And what were the feelings of Jeſſy Oliver at this moment? they were indeſcribable. She folded her
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:034490_0360_0FFF22D7F578FAE8"/>
hands over her face, and the ſilent tears trickled through her fingers. Rachel recovered articulation firſt. "Reuben," ſaid ſhe, "there is a dear friend of both yours and mine; 'tis Jeſſy Oliver, who has been my friend, my ſupporter, my more than ſiſter."</p>
               <p>Reuben left his ſiſter, and dropping on his knees by the bedſide of Jeſſy, drew her hands from her face, and feeling more at that moment for her kindneſs to his ſiſter, than from any other motive, preſſed them to his heart, and cried, "May Heaven forever bleſs you." The enſuing ſcene may be conceived, but cannot be deſcribed. Reuben diſcovered, from the lamentations of his ſiſter, that it was her infant he had brought to the houſe (ſhe had dropped it at the moment of land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when her ſenſes failed her, and imagined it drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and he had the exquiſite pleaſure of reſtoring it to her arms.</p>
               <p>A few days reinſtated their health and ſpirits, and our hero, with his friend Stedfaſt Trueman, eſcorted the happy Rachel and Jeſſy to Philadelphia. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer explained every circumſtance of her marriage, and its ſubſequent conſequences; and the latter when ſolicited to become miſtreſs of Mount Pleaſant, did not frown or threaten to be obdurate. They arrived at friend Trueman's houſe about midday, and after taking a ſlight refreſhment, Reuben, with his ſiſter and her charming friend, proceeded to Mount Pleaſant. They were met at the gate by O'Neil.</p>
               <p>"Och! my dare maſter," ſaid he, "I'm mighty glad you are come back, for here has been a ſtrange ſort of a gentleman here, and for the matter of that he is here now, in our houſe, but he is ſick; ſo as he ſeemed to love your honour, and talk kindly of my good lady your ſiſter that I have heard your honour ſpeak of, I put him into the beſt chamber, and ſent for a doctor, and I hope your honour won't be angry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſee I did as if I had been in your honour's place."</p>
               <p>O'Neil would have gone on, had he not ſeen a chaiſe approach (for Reuben was on horſeback). "And be theſe viſitors?" ſaid he.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="unknown:034490_0361_0FFF0CED513B0E78"/>
"Yes," replied our hero, "and the very ſiſter you ſpoke of, and a charming lady, who I hope will ſoon become your miſtreſs, O'Neil."</p>
               <p>The honeſt, affectionate O'Neil ſtayed not to reply; he darted forward, and ſeemed as if he would have helped the horſe that drew the ſiſter of his beloved maſter. When the carriage ſtopped, he waited not for ceremony; but as Jeſſy ſtood on the ſide of the chaiſe ready to alight, he ſeized her in his arms, and bore her into the houſe; then running back, took the child from Rachel, (whom Reuben had helped out of the chaiſe) almoſt devoured it with kiſſes, and leaping, dancing and capering, cried, "Yes! yes! he will be happy after all, I knew he would, I was always ſure he would. O that my dear Miſtreſs Juliana was but alive now!"</p>
               <p>Perhaps the reader has before this ſurmiſed, that the ſtrange, inquiſitive, ſick gentleman was no other than Hamden Auberry, who had embarked for Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia immediately after his knowledge of our heroine's ſeeking him in that place; but the ſhip in which he embarked being a faſt ſailer, and ſteering a different courſe to that purſued by the one in which was his wife, arrived ſafe in the port of Philadelphia the very night before the commencement of the ſtorm in which poor Rachel ſuffered ſo much, and ſo nearly eſcaped with life. His firſt inquiries were for Reuben, and he was directed to Mount Pleaſant; on his arrival there, he learnt that Rachel was not arrived, and that Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben was abſent from home. Change of climate, the fatigues of a long voyage, and the anguiſh of mind he had endured for ſix months paſt, had ſo enervated his frame and ſhook his conſtitution, that when he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to remount the horſe that brought him, he turned ſo ſaint as to be obliged to return to the houſe, where he grew ſo much worſe, that O'Neil (as he had told his maſter) adviſed him to go to bed, and ſent for a doctor.</p>
               <p>The meeting between our heroine and her huſband was all that real affection and ſenſibility can imagine. Rachel wept, and regretted the pain ſhe had uninten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:034490_0362_0FFF22DC14A9A470"/>
given him, whilſt he implored her pardon for that falſe pride, which had firſt expoſed her to the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions and inſults of thoſe who, envying her ſuperior merit, rejoiced in an opportunity to level her with their own contaminated ideas.</p>
               <p>About ſix weeks after this happy meeting, Reuben received the hand of Jeſſy Oliver. It was a day of feſtivity. The gates of Mount Pleaſant were thrown open, and every viſitor made welcome. To add to their mirth, a dance in the evening was to finiſh the entertainment.</p>
               <p>A ſocial meal, diſpenſed with cheerfulneſs, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with a true ſpirit of hilarity, had been juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, when the parlour door haſtily opened, and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea entered. Her hair hung looſe about her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; her eyes were wild, and her voice broken. She ruſhed toward Reuben and Jeſſy, and taking a hand from each, joined them; then preſſing them to her boſom, raiſed her eyes to heaven—</p>
               <p>"God of the Chriſtians," ſaid ſhe fervently, "make them forever happy. Wife of Reuben, thou art a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py woman, for thy huſband is a man of honour. He ſaw the weakneſs of a poor, unprotected Indian maid, he pitied her folly, but took no advantage of it."</p>
               <p>Jeſſy was affected by the ſimple yet fervent addreſs. Reuben took the hand of Eumea, and would have made her ſit down, but ſhe refuſed.</p>
               <p>"No! no!" ſaid ſhe, "Eumea will reſt no more, know peace no more. I had raiſed a deity of my own, built an altar in my boſom, and daily offered the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of a fond, an affectionate heart; but the days are paſt, I can worſhip no longer without a crime. Farewel," ſaid ſhe, enthuſiaſtically claſping her hands, "do not quite forget the poor, poor Eumea!"</p>
               <p>She then left the houſe, and Reuben ſent a perſon to follow and ſee that ſhe came to no ill. She went home, but continued not long there; a young woman, who from her wild looks and incoherent language imagined her mind to be diſordered, endeavoured to detain her, but in vain. About the duſk of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe went out, and all inquiry for her was fruitleſs
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:034490_0363_0FFF22DF66F36B98"/>
till three days after, when as Reuben was giving ſome orders to O'Neil, in that part of his ground that lay on the verge of the Schuylkill, they diſcovered ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing floating on the water; the garments beſpoke it a woman. Reuben's heart ſhuddered, they dragged it to the ſhore; it was the corpſe of poor Eumea. Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben ſighed, raiſed his eyes to heaven, but was ſilent. Not ſo O'Neil. He fell on his knees beſide the pale corſe, and his honeſt heart burſt in a torrent from his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Och! my flower of the foreſt," ſaid he, "and art thou gone, and was it love that made thee leave us? Beautiful, good, ſweeteſt of ſavages—O! thy poor O'Neil can pity thee. And what ſhall he do now thou haſt cloſed thine eyes? Thou haſt murdered thy ſweet ſelf, and what is there now in the world that he cares for?"</p>
               <p>Reuben was ſtruck with the fervency and humility that was at once expreſſed by O'Neil; for it ſpoke as plain as words could ſpeak, 'I loved her, but I never dared to tell my love, leſt it ſhould offend her.'</p>
               <p>Our hero by degrees drew him from the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the melancholy object, and proper forms being gone through in regard to the body, it was buried in a field near the margin of the river. O'Neil banked up the grave, twiſted oſier twigs and fenced it round; at the head he planted a weeping willow, and at the foot a wild roſe tree. Of a night when his labour was finiſhed, he would viſit the ſpot, ſing old ditties, and weep whilſt he ſung; and though he lived to good old age, O'Neil never knew another love.</p>
               <p>After this period, our heroine for many years enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an uninterrupted ſeries of felicity. Auberry, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely occupied by the cares of a mercantile life, into which he had ſucceſsfully entered, and giving every leiſure moment to the aſſiſting of Rachel in the education of a beautiful riſing family, was entirely cured of jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſy and ambition, and wondered he could have ever doubted the faith of his wife, or have riſqued loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo vaſt a treaſure forever, rather than relinquiſh the hope of being rich and great.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="unknown:034490_0364_0FFF22E340A80B88"/>
Reuben and Jeſſy were patterns of conjugal felicity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that felicity was increaſed in the courſe of a few years, by the arrival of old Mr. Oliver, Archibald and Courtney. The former had ſaved a trifle from the wreck of his fortune, which had been almoſt diſſipated by a worthleſs woman. Archibald brought with him an amiable bride in the perſon of Courtney's ſiſter. The abandoned Mrs. Courtney had met the fate her vicious courſe of life merited, and died abroad, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected by all her pretended lovers, a victim to diſeaſe, poverty and remorſe.</p>
               <p>It was in the ſeventh year of our hero and heroine's happy ſettlement in Philadelphia, that the latter was told one morning that a gentleman from England de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee her. She went into the parlour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, to her infinite ſurpriſe, Mr. Allibi.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Auberry, I preſume." ſaid he, bowing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly. "I am happy, Madam, to be the firſt to wiſh you joy on a very great and unexpected acceſſion of fortune. Your huſband's relation, lady Anne, is dead; alſo her brother the Earl, and I may now ſalute you Counteſs of Montmorill. Moreover," continued he, not giving her leave to ſpeak, "I am to inform you, by order of Mr. Andrew Atkins, that yourſelf and broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Mr. Reuben Dudley, being the only deſcendants of the lady Arrabella Ruthven, who married about the year 1644-5, with Edward Dudley, ſon of Henry Dudley, deſcendant of the unfortunate lady Jane Grey, and who relinquiſhing her title, embarked with him for America; as I ſay, yourſelf and brother being the only legitimate deſcendants of that marriage, you are acknowledged joint heirs to the titles and immenſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of the houſe Ruthven. And I am commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by my very good friend, Mr. Andrew Atkins, to receive your orders in what manner he ſhall proceed in regard to ſaid eſtates, and to inform you, your Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſhire eſtate is now, through his care, entirely free from incumbrances."</p>
               <p>Rachel, overwhelmed by the rapidity with which Allibi related all this good news, and ſcarcely credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſhe heard, yet underſtanding ſufficient, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:034490_0365_0FFF22E4CC213D68"/>
to comprehend the mean fineſſe of Allibi and his dirty employer, in thus informing her of her acceſſion of fortune, and making a merit of relinquiſhing the Lancaſhire eſtate, in hopes of being made agent and ſteward to thoſe of much greater value, could ſcarcely command her temper, whilſt ſhe interrogated him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the extraordinary intelligence he conveyed. However, being aſcertained of the truth of his aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and received from him ſome papers of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, with a long, fulſome, congratulatory letter from Mr. Andrew Atkins, ſhe appointed him to call the enſuing morning, when her brother and huſband would be ſure to meet him.</p>
               <p>On the following morning, therefore, at a little paſt eight o'clock, Mr. Allibi entered the breakfaſt parlour, where he found Reuben, Rachel, Mr. Auberry and Mrs. Dudley aſſembled to breakfaſt. After partaking a ſocial meal, and delivering and atteſting to every neceſſary paper, both in regard to their new acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and the Lancaſhire eſtate, he was ſomewhat aſtoniſhed to hear Reuben addreſs him in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words:—</p>
               <p>"You may think, Mr. Allibi, that by bringing us this intelligence you have greatly heightened our felic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; and in one reſpect you have, as it extends our power of ſerving our fellow-creatures. As to titles, both my brother Auberry and his wife Rachel, join with me to renounce them; they are diſtinctions noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worth, and ſhould by no means be introduced into a young country, where the only diſtinction between man and man ſhould be made by virtue, genius and education. Our ſons are true-born Americans, and while they ſtrive to make that little reſpectable, we wiſh them to poſſeſs no other. Let the titles then go, and ſuch of the eſtates as are annexed to them, to more diſtant branches of our ſeveral families, or in caſe of default of heirs, let them ſink into oblivion. Of the immenſe property of which we are become poſſeſſors, we ſhall retain no more than will ſet our ſons forward in buſineſs, and give our daughters moderate portions;
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:034490_0366_0FFF22E737DAB4C0"/>
the reſidue ſhall be equally divided amongſt the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent relatives of both families."</p>
               <p>Allibi brightened at theſe words, thinking he ſhould be conſtituted agent in this buſineſs; but Reuben con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued:—</p>
               <p>"I am obliged to you for the trouble you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on my account, and hold myſelf your debtor for the expenſes of your voyage and other contingencies, which, whenever you pleaſe, I ſhall be ready to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge; and when you return, I will trouble you with a letter to Mr. Andrew Atkins, informing him he will be no farther troubled with my affairs, but will pleaſe to ſettle all accounts with Mr. Courtney, a gentleman who has kindly undertaken to go to England for that purpoſe."</p>
               <p>The poor, diſappointed Allibi could ſcarcely breathe at the concluſion of this ſpeech; he ſhuffled on his ſeat, attempted to recommend himſelf by reprobating the conduct of Atkins, but a look of marked contempt from Reuben ſilenced him; and, mortified beyond en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance, he roſe haſtily and took his leave.</p>
               <p>In a ſhort time, Courtney embarked for England, ſettled every thing according to the directions of Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben and Auberry, made many an orphan glad, and many a diſconſolate heart leap for joy. He liberated the poor debtor, afforded relief to depreſſed merit, and wiped away the tear from the eye of ſuffering virtue. The incenſe of gratitude aſcended towards heaven, and was returned in bleſſings on the heads of Reuben, Rachel, and their poſterity.</p>
